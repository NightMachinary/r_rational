I AM SO EXCITED I LOVE TED CHIANG

damnit I have beeminder goals for other books but DAMNIT I AM GOING TO READ THESE

shit yeah I have no plans tonight. I'll hopefully post with reviews of at least one story tomorrow depending on length

EDIT: wait it's only available for pre-order on AU kindle store - is it released in the US already?! :( not out until Monday for me. There goes my excitement.

For anyone like me wanting to know what the stories are about, here's something I stole from one of the amazon reviews:

--------------

The Merchant And The Alcehmist's Gate (5/5) Great story about time travel. Unique idea, exploring time travel that cannot change the past but could still have an effect. Really well done, story within a story. Loved this one, had me hooked from the beginning.

Exhalation (5/5) This one will stay with me for awhile. It's an alternative universe that is populated with only robots, but they have no idea where they came from. Without giving away too much, one of the robots starts to explore the underlying anatomy and discovers new things about their world and himself.

What's Expected Of Us (4/5) Good, but short. Interesting exploration on free will and whether its possible through the guise of a very simple machine invented in the future.

The Lifecycle of Software Objects (5/5) Both my favorite in the book and the longest. The author assumes that A.I. will take at least as long to train as a human (20ish years) and writes a story that supposes the same thing. Great story that explains some of the dilemmas of separating personhood from being human and what the consequences could be. The 'software objects' start off as a souped up version of a Tamigotchi, but by introducing a small amount of autonomy and capacity, Chiang shows how difficult decisions could be when considering how to interact with artificial intelligence.

Dacey's Patient Automatic Nanny (5/5) Another short one, interesting exploration about the limits of technological helps for relationships.

The Truth of Fact, The Truth of Feeling (5/5) Great story that explores the similarities between a culture that learns the technology of writing for the first time with a culture grappling with externalized memory. Loved this one, second favorite in the book.

The Great Silence (4/5) Good story, about the similarities another species, like parrots, have to extraterrestrial life. Probably my least favorite, but still worth reading.

Omphalos (5/5) Really interesting exploration of an alternative universe where the majority of scientific evidence lines up with a very young earth creationism. As a Christian, I appreciate Chiang's incorporation of religion into many of his tales and his exploration of the tension that exists between spirituality and science.

Anxiety Is The Dizziness Of Freedom (5/5) Loved this one too. Great idea, exploring what it would look like if parallel universes really existed and we found a way to interact with them. Very complicated idea that is handled really well, great read and one that you will learn from.

I know for sure I've read Exhalation (I didn't love it as much as everyone else seems to have: I thought it was only interesting/good not excellent - maybe I missed something), but I really loved The Lifecycle of Software Objects when I first read it and I'm really excited to read it again when I get the book. The others I haven't heard of but although I love Ted Chiang I have to admit I don't furiously go searching for his stories in the far corners of the web.
