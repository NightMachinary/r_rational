I believe six out of nine have been published before, but I can't be certain.

Here's the titles if you want to check for yourself:

- The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate
- Exhalation
- What's Expected of Us
- The Lifecycle of Software Objects
- The Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling
- The Great Silence
- Dacey's Patent Automatic Nanny
- Omphalos
- Anxiety Is the Dizziness of Freedom

The last three are new to me and I have never read them anywhere else.
