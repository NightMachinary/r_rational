It's a type of story I really like and haven't been able to find. I think /The Time Machine/ was similar, and although I didn't care for it, so was /Rendzevous with Rama/, but Ted's got better ideas than either of them (admittedly HG Wells's big idea was time travel at all, really, so I'm not giving him enough credit, but modern sci fi audiences demand more sophistication).
