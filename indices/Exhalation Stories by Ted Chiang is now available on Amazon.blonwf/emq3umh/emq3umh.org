This is a second collection of short stories written by Ted Chiang who is very popular with this subreddit for his intro to rationalist fiction story named Exhalation (the title isn't a coincidence, it's one of the stories in this collection).

The first collection was [[https://www.amazon.com/Stories-Your-Life-Others-Chiang-ebook/dp/B0048EKOP0][Stories of Your Life and Others]].

It's hard to explain why his writing is so good even though I usually dislike short stories. I suppose it comes down to the world building and how well he can show the logical outcomes of a world which wouldn't be expected from the first impression.

Both of the books are within the top ten of Amazon's rankings for Short Stories Anthologies, #1 and #7, if that helps.
