You just managed to describe exactly what quality I liked so much in his writing that I couldn't articulate at all.

The only other author I think that ever comes close is Robert Heinlein, but that's more the philosophical and thoughtfulness aspect and his writing isn't as "quiet".

Other people have recommended Liu Cixin and Liu Ken as similar authors, but I haven't read anything by them, so I don't know if that's true or not.
