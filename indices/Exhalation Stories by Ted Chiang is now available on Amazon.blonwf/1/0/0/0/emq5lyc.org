Yeah, there used to be a site somewhere that hosted most of his short stories for free, but I think it has been taken down. Also, Subterranean Press and Strange Horizon magazines would have his stories online free for reading, but they (most likely) took the texts down when he planned to publish them.

EDIT: I just found the [[https://web.archive.org/web/20110927090558/http://www.freesfonline.de/authors/Ted_Chiang.html][site]] that used to exist by using the Wayback Archive. If you go to different times for when the page was saved, you'll see different stories that used to be up there. It's a lot of work to recover all of the texts and not all of the stories in both collections are in there, but it's an option for anyone who doesn't want to pay the $14 to Amazon.
