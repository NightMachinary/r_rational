  Gotham is subject to his thoughts on the matter whether they like it or not. I guess Gotham should just be grateful that he's agreeable for the most part but yeesh, what a terrible precedent to set. Could you imagine if billionaires were vigilantes in our world?

I still don't see anything negative about bill gates opening up a lawbook to a random page and getting a few people a day to prison for breaking that law. If there is a shitty law on the books, he would shine a huge +bat-signal+ spotlight on it; even if it might not be the optimal way of getting rid of it, it's certainly far from worst.

If he opens a law book and randomly hits upon and starts enforcing a good law, I don't see any issues (so long as he gets the same people as Batman, i.e. those that are obviously breaking the law at a given moment).
