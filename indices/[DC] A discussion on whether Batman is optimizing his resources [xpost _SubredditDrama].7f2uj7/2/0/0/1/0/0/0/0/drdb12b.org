  I'll have to disagree with you on your first point: a masked billionaire vigilante enforcing bad laws DOES sound like the worst way to handle the existence of bad laws to me. I mean, Christ, write an op ed or something (ugh it's so weird not being able to use my dash key). Use your vast wealth to lobby. Use the professional contacts you may have to learn more about that issue that concerns you.

Using bad laws to blackmail people sounds like the worst way to me.

  As for the good law thing, one of my biggest qualms with vigilantism is a lack of oversight. As much as there is to criticize about the present day police force, at least there's a semblance of oversight and procedure. Imagine the poor detective who goes to an absolute mess of a crime scene, and a masked Bill Gates is there to say "they were bad, I pinky promise."

So how do cops deal with crimes in progress? How would bill gates be worse if he also wore a bodycam?
