I'll have to disagree with you on your first point: a masked billionaire vigilante enforcing bad laws DOES sound like the worst way to handle the existence of bad laws to me. I mean, Christ, write an op ed or something (ugh it's so weird not being able to use my dash key). Use your vast wealth to lobby. Use the professional contacts you may have to learn more about that issue that concerns you.

As for the good law thing, one of my biggest qualms with vigilantism is a lack of oversight. As much as there is to criticize about the present day police force, at least there's a semblance of oversight and procedure. Imagine the poor detective who goes to an absolute mess of a crime scene, and a masked Bill Gates is there to say "they were bad, I pinky promise."

Batman gets away with this for the most part because, as the reader, we know Batman is correct in his assessments, and he is constantly praised for his intellect. We wouldn't have any of those assurances with real world billionaires running around as vigilantes.

And I suppose I should acknowledge that my politics are at least a bit of an influence here. If Elon Musk responded to some of Trump's recent attempted actions towards illegal immigration with him suiting up and chasing down schoolchildren from illegal immigrant families, I'd have quite a few things to say, and none of them would be nice.
