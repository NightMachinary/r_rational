You're right. The thing is that I originally watched these videos at a time when I was emotionally vulnerable and didn't understand what I was meant to take away from them, so some made me feel very insecure about liking certain stories and characters.

It's a fate I want other people to avoid because it did me no good. To this day, I obsessively analyze almost everything I watch because I still feel self loathing about what I do and don't like. Expressing and coping with those feelings is hard, especially in person.
