I really liked After Hours for a long time and recommend a lot of their videos, but I think this one exposes a big weakness of the series. When discussing protagonists, they tend to go in with the intention of deconstructing them and don't seriously consider what makes those characters resonate with people.

I don't think it's fair to criticize Batman for failing to break out of the cycle his stories are stuck in when that story is what people are there to read, and the fact that he keeps on fighting no matter how many setbacks he faces is a crucial element of his character that people like. They're criticizing a story for doing exactly what it's trying to do.

Sorin's defense is this video relies on the narrative conceit that Batman is good at his job even when it wouldn't make sense in reality, while everyone else keeps hammering away with examples that don't exist in-universe. Additionally, Sorin as a comedy character is a narcissist who idolizes power fantasies so I don't know how seriously we're supposed to take him.

A similar thing happens in the Spider Man video where Dan's reason for loving the character is that they're both sad, hapless nerds that won't grow up. The episodes about comedy characters are just as bad, since the fact that theyâ€˜re idiots and assholes in dysfunctional relationships is what makes them funny to watch.

I can see how this would be appealing to some, why else would Rick & Morty exist if people weren't hungry for cynical deconstructions, but it's something that I've had more than my fill of and at this point in my life I would rather escape from the crushing despair of reality than be reminded of it.
