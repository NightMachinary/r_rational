This reply gave me lots of thoughts, so apologies if my response seems scattered. I'll try to be organized.

1) They certainly do go into fiction with the deliberate intention of deconstructing it, but I'm not sure why that's necessarily a problem. You say they don't take into account what makes those characters or storylines compelling, but I'm not sure why that's relevant for what that show is trying to accomplish. When they discuss the absurdity of the setup for 101 Dalmatians, I'm not sure if they need to temper their discussion with "but here's why it's a good movie that people found enjoyable." No matter how true it is, it doesn't seem relevant to their thesis.

2) "They're criticizing a story for doing what it set out to do." I don't see how this is a rebuttal to the content of their video. Basically they're flirting with the concept of efficient altruism, a concept that I think is a fair one to apply to analysis of Batman. He's a billionaire who moonlights as a vigilante: even if that's an intentional narrative choice, and even if that makes for a compelling story, that doesn't make the approach above criticism, nor does it make the fictional character of Batman automatically correct in his choices.

3) I think I may be taking away something different from these videos than you. I felt like the strongest point against Batman made within it was what Kate started saying toward the end: the concept of a billionaire taking to the streets and beating up people according to his moral philosophy is a horrifying prospect. And as for the Spiderman vid, I don't think the point was "Spiderman is worthwhile because he is like this dopey talking head we have on our show." I think the point was "Spiderman is worthwhile because he is a relatable person with real world struggles." I don't relate to Spiderman because I'm some hapless nerd, it's because I know how it feels to work hard at something that I find rewarding but still have a crummy apartment I can just barely afford at the end of the day. I can't relate to the ultra rich, ultra strong, ultra smart Batman, but I can relate to Spiderman.

4) I do think cynicism and deconstruction are a bit overplayed these days, and need to be tempered with understanding the point of the construction that's being deconstructed in the first place. This is especially true if you think that deconstruction reminds you of "the crushing despair of reality." You're right: with those stakes, videos like the one I posted just aren't worth it. That said, I think this is a weird subreddit to make that point: stuff is deconstructed here quite ruthlessly all the time. Still, I get what you're saying, and this is why I subscribe to youtubers like Lindsay Ellis, who has fantastic videos analyzing certain movies, and while she can be critical, some of her videos are in defense of a movie that is underappreciated. MovieBob has a series called "Really That Good" that even has the stated purpose of fighting the tide of excessive cynicism. If you want positive and grounded criticism, I'd check them both out.

5) Just a side note: My dash key on my laptop doesn't work, so that's why I keep using colons so often. Sorry for the awkward grammar!

ETA: Fuck it, here, have some links.

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD3h_bT0Mfg][MovieBob: REALLY THAT GOOD: Raimi's Spiderman 1 and 2]]. Not only is this relevant to something you brought up, it honestly did make me see these movies in a new, more appreciative light.
