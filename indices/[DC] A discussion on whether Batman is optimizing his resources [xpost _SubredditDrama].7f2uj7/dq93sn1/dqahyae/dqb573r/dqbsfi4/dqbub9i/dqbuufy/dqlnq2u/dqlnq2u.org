Offhand the only crimes that I can remember Batman pursuing people for are things like violent crimes, theft, and arson, which I think are ones that no sane person would contend are bad to enforce. I don't recall a case where he busts people for weed and I am very confident that he's never gone after anyone for jaywalking, littering, or etc.
