Could you enhance a specific part of someone's body so as to throw them off in battle? As in, they take a step and suddenly their left leg is significantly stronger/heavier than their right. It's not directly harmful for the person, except that it'll screw up their rhythm and make them easier to hit.

On a related note, can you enhance their pain nerves, so any hits you land will hurt even more than usual? Combo that with the previously described usage, and maybe a little power enhancement on your part, and you can increase a character's combat potential quite heavily.

Is entropy an attribute you can enhance?
