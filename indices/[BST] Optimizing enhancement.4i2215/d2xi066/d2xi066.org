This sounds a little bit like a cross between David Brin's /The Practice Effect/ or Sanderson's [[http://coppermind.net/wiki/Feruchemy][Feruchemy]]... except both of those have more interesting limitations.

For example, the Practice Effect only works on inanimate objects and the enhancement needs continuous maintenance (resulting in an economy of servants wearing their employers' clothes to keep them nice). And Feruchemy only works on yourself, and only with certain properties, which must generally be stored in advance for later use. (For example, going around moving slowly for a week to store up speed, being sick to store up health, etc.) So it's inherently a balanced power rather than a world-breaker.
