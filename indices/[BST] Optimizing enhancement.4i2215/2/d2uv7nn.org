You can gain /some/ effective intelligence by improving your metabolic processes and just leaving that on permanently. Never have low bloodsugar, never be tired - at the end of the day, you will not be any smarter than your best self was before, but you will spend a far greater amount of time at peak ability. If you start that young, you will get far more learning done.

I expect this will be the most common use, simply because it will also be the most pleasant. Noone likes feeling tired, and while you could do things like enhancing your strength or whatever instead.. why would you? Super-strength isn't useful if you are not currently moving furniture. So the default will just be to leave it at "Optimize metabolism" at all times and switch things up briefly when you need the power for something else
