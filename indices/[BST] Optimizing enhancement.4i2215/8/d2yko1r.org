So, insofar as combat goes, a sniper an enhance the range of his gun; or the accuracy of his sights; or the clarity of his own eyes.

Someone who doesn't want the sniper to succeed might (for example) enhance the muzzle velocity of the weapon, thus causing the bullet to fly a lot faster, drop a lot less, and miss the target.

You can enhance the speed of a computer, the efficiency of a cooling system (allowing more overclocking).

You could enhance a racing car - being intimately familiar with the car would help, as would being close (the driver could do it? But that takes some of his focus away from driving the thing...)

What about intangibles? If someone's feeling happy, can you enhance that emotion directly, make him happier? Being able to use this on any emotion (especially in a crowd) could make for an /extremely/ persuasive snake-oil salesman. (If not, he could always enhance the desirability of what he's selling in order to push up the price)

Or profitability. Could you enhance the profitability of a company, directly?

An Enhancer could make a great doctor, Enhancing his patients' immune system. (If it's possible to be an Enhancer and not realise it, then one or more Enhancers might be homeopaths). Of course, this goes two ways; an evil Enhancer could rather Enhance the /disease/, threatening the patient.
