I assume you can enhance industrial processes, and in-system and FTL drives.

Gangs of indentured enhancer "galley slaves" in factories and transport vessels that just spend all their time enhancing the same components of the same process or subsystem until they're really good at it.If the technology is there, they may be kept in suspended animation chambers to save space, just awake enough to maintain their enhancement.
