You should see some of the things they do with Feruchemy in the later books if you think it's an inherently balanced power. :P

[[#s][Some of the stuff you can do with]]

Feruchemy's drawback is also not as great a hurdle as it could be, since you can store when the utility cost of storing is low and tap when the utility benefit is great. You can also stack a long period of time's small drip of storage into a few seconds of physics-defying "holyshitwhat".
