I could easily see a government body or cabal taking over by using either mind control devices (and enhancing them) or brainwashing (enhanced) and then using those people to make themselves more powerful. Imagine if North Korea was all enhancing Kim Jung Um and refusal to do so => camps. However, if a pyramid structure was used (to reduce the diminishing returns) betrayal would be easy. I could imagine small empires being possible, but due to the distances in space, large ones would be easy to form, but hard to control.
