I'm no nuclear engineer, but you could probably build an A-bomb with this by mucking about with neutron production and such. Of course, you can build an A-bomb anyway. This would just make it easier in terms of materials.

As is often the case in these sort of "superpower" things, it likely goes mind control > perception powers > DPS > everything else.

This effect seems to have a very good knowledge of biology, and at least a decent knowledge of physics and engineering, so you could probably learn some things by observing how it enhances.

It's not clear how it determines what different enhancements "cost".

Depending on how heavily it's penalized in terms of diminishing returns, it might be worth keeping up a constant "boost your boosting" effect while doing other boosting.
