I think the keys here are that it's a 'small minority' of people, and the familiarity aspect. Demand will be very high since it seems like their power can be used for pretty much anything.

Some ideas: given the fact that enhancing is more effective with familiarity, I think there would be strong tendency towards life-long pairings of powerful people with one or more enhancers: think executive and their trusted secretary, or a knight and their page. The ability to pay for the (rare) services of an enhancer would tend to consolidate power in a few, likely resulting in a strongly delineated elites vs proles situation - potentially feudal. An interesting implication is that the population level of elites would then be influenced somewhat by the birth rate of enhancers.

A point of conflict in your story could be the novelty of big businesses and large governments being able to pay more for enhancers than the nobles can. Low-volume high-value manufacturing (e.g. $50k watches or top end champagne/wine) could use an enhancer on the production line, public figures could have their smile, their voice, their grace enhanced to be more persuasive. Research and development (e.g. pharma) may benefit from pairing enhancers with their top experts. Investment banks would have their networking equipment enhanced (much like they currently pay big bucks for land closest to the exchange to minimise transaction latency).

Depending on how you count 'familiarity', you might get freelance enhancers, whose speciality is enhancing the abilities of other enhancers. Thus the powerful could hire a short-term power boost by getting an enhancer for their enhancer.
