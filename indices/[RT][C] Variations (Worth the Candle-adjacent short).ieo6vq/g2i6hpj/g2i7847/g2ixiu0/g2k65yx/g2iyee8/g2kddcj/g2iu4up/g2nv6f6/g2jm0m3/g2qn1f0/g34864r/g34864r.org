I agree with that it's draining to read about such characters but for me it depends on my mood. If I'm in a similar dip in life then it's unbearable but otherwise its overall nice to read about them.

Especially when it's only a single chapter instead of a book, adding the fact that there were no hugely embarrassing or cringe moments in this and that it's neatly written makes this a highly enjoyable experience for me.
