This is a great little slice-of-life short. I found Callie and Jestin's respective revelations to be especially interesting, and they went a long way towards making the characters feel like real people. Callie's experience reminded me of [[https://youtu.be/hmKix-75dsg][this Vi Hart video]], in which Vi Hart explains that throughout her teenage years, she thought everyone had the same beliefs and opinions as she did, and if they claimed otherwise, they were doing it for attention, political correctness, or some other ulterior motive.
