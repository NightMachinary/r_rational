One of the things I enjoy most about the fantasy genre is its ability to show us the human condition without the restricting context of a 'real' human world.

You don't need big explosions or rampaging dragons to write good fantasy. You just need to desire a different viewpoint on a universal problem-- a viewpoint that isn't quite possible in our world, but which can be written to life in this one.

Callie just feels like a person. And the fact that she's an orc, or that her culture was stripped from her by the archetypal Chosen King, or that she doesn't fit into human beauty standards don't make her feel less like someone who could exist in our world. They're just more examples of the value of a fantasy viewpoint's applicability to real issues.
