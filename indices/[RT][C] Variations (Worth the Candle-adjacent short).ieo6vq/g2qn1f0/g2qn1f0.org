I find it, not difficult but just draining, annoying?, to read these types of characters. A lack of confidence justified or not seems to grate on me. I guess I feel empathetic for how horrible it must be to be incapable of crossing a room without thinking about what other people think about it. And feeling her feelings is not exactly a fun thing though I think that doesn't mean it's something people shouldn't feel.

When she's alone it was worse because as she said when she's alone she literally just whines about how bad everything is which isn't fun to read I assume for anyone?

Also that guys comments about intellect seem like author stand in to me but perhaps I'm projecting though I don't identify too much. Maybe the author is actually the main character, certainly she reflects some parts but I don't think overall.
