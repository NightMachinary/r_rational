How Harry manages to bring up such amusement and frustration at the same time is beyond me. His attempts to rationalise have gone off the deep end, and "Science" isn't exactly helping with his denial either, the damn plot device.

It's been a while since we saw a Daphne and Neville scene. Incredibly fluffy (I keep on hearing the Smash Mouth version even though that canonically comes after fifth year), but I guess that's just what was needed to contrast Harry's mind melting either side of it.

I wanted to ask about the use of "Gemelo" last chapter; shouldn't that be the Gemini charm? Also in the first section Harry thinks

and unless there's been some renovations at Hogwarts, I'm pretty sure this should be the Great Hall instead?
