I liked the idea, but when reading it, this and other parts just felt, well, super jarring. It's like if your past!isekai started his modernizations with a revolutionary way to harness phlogistigons; yes, the author can make their work have the laws of physics that would allow this to be possible, but that doesn't change the effect. For instance:

There's a technological limit to how complex a machine Shenron can bring back, as we see with 16, so I would have expected that Maijin Boo destroying the planet would have left the machine lobotomized at best.

Similarly and more importantly, the entire time-travel section makes no sense to me. Even leaving aside how time passes the same at both ends due to the mechanics unless you make an entirely new timeline when traveling back (in which case there would be 2 present!timelines, one in which the destruction of earth did and one in which it did not), it really seems odd that Vegeta didn't even blast the earth apart hard enough to destroy the capsule corp laboratory. Like, gero's computer surviving, sure, advanced tech ala 16's armor or something, but bulma's lab's defenses would be a known quantity. The fact that gero's computer was somehow able to reconstruct time travel from the incinerated parts of cell's time machine (yes, conservation of information, but reworking the events of a closed system so completely should require a computational apparatus comparable in power to the system studied, not the shreds it had left) without any of its main computation or sensors, and able to create a time machine from that in the time, but somehow not able to do so from first principles, is similarly jarring.

Overall, it fells, well, forced. Ai is dangerous, absolutely, especiall unshackled and self modifying Ai, but when the AI requires that the fundamental laws of the setting be rewritten in its favor and that none of its enemies have agency and things that feel strongly of diabolus ex machina, well, it sorta cheapens the effect quite a bit.
