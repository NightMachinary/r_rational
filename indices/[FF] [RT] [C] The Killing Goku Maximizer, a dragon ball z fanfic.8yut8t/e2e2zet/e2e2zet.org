This story went really far with it's Goku killiness. Very, very, very far.\\
I kept thinking in the beginning- /killing/ Goku could be interpreted as ending his life, not as making him not exist. But that could lead to wireheading and possibly settling down into harmlessness, however, and this definition leads to more /Fun/.

Overall, it was well-written, with all characters behaving with competence and common sense.
