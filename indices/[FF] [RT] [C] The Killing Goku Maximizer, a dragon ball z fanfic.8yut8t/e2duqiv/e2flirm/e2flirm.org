  Sorry for the extended break on "The Optimised Wish Project"! This is a completely unrelated rational DBZ short story I came up with,

I was confused on this point myself. You didn't actually call it OWP-related in the title, but the title format is very distinctive at this point. Thus, a suggestion: When posting similar short and unrelated works, or posting this same work in other places, perhaps it should be subtitled "A Dragonball Z oneshot".
