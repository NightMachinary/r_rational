Sorry for the extended break on "The Optimised Wish Project"! This is a completely unrelated rational DBZ short story I came up with, but the idea was just too good for me to discard, so I followed my inspiration and wrote it down. Hopefully it will make up a bit for the wait. As I explain in the notes, this was inspired by me reading "Friendship is Optimal" just a few days ago (it was a blast) and reflecting on how Dr. Gero had built a computer that possessed both the intelligence to carry out independent scientific research and a drive to pursue a single, rather unhealthy purpose: killing Goku. And that sounds like a recipe for disaster waiting to unfold, in terms of A.I. safety.

This story was the result of the unhinged train of thought that followed.
