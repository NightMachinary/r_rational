This is gorgeous, I love it.

Did it not have extraterrestrial servers when earth was destroyed though?

The characters seemed to hypothesize that by now it surely must have, and it must have known that destroying the planet would be likely once there is no longer anyone they care about on it and thus extraterrestrial colonies would be necessary to survive the incoming planet-busting, never giving them the chance to destroy it on one planet alone.

But when earth was destroyed it seemed to be rapidly dying, which seems to imply it was all located on earth?
