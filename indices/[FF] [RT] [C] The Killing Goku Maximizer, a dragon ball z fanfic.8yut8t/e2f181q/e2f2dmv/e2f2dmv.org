Well, it was Bulma's theory to begin with, and she was only considering the ways it could resist a planet-wide EMP attack (which was already a pretty outrageous and inapplicable idea). My mind about that was that the computer had underground backups at that stage, but not space ones. Anyway, I might consider rewriting it a bit and making a second version to accommodate these possible inconsistencies (perhaps, as someone else pointed out, I should also remove the time travel computing loops, which while an idea I love, might not be possible in the DBZ-verse as time travel seems to work only by shifting back and forth by fixed intervals). This was written really quickly and basically planned as I wrote - almost a stream of consciousness on my part. I just had a lot of fun with the idea, but a bit of polish might be necessary.
