Ah. I appreciate the response, and would first like to reiterate that this is /really/ good and scratches an itch in me that I've had since I first learned of paperclip maximizes. It was an extremely satisfying read.

I was mostly figuring that if it's clever enough to trick earth into nanobot bombing themselves by predicting their responses that well, it would also figure out not only that the Capsule corps and Z-fighters would try to escape in the rocket and place some self-replicating nanobots on it (and every other space and time-travel capable craft it knows of), but also that once everyone on earth was doomed, there would be nothing holding them back from blowing up the planet, an ability it knows that they have.

It's also a /lot/ easier to make a rocket capable of reaching escape velocity when your payload can be less than a gram, but it might be detected.

I got the impression that Dragonball time-travel was more like "travel to an alternate reality that has advanced further in the time line" with no consequences to the universe you left, and I'm not sure they know of a way to return to specific alternate realities after leaving, but I've watched less of the time travel stories than many.

If you are looking for a way for the story to continue after the Earth blows up, the AI might have extraterrestrial and even extrasolar (cloning Z-fighters cells would let you travel between star systems as easily as they do, right?) colonies already. This could make the fight escalate one more step at the galactic stage before total victory.

If looking for a similar effect to the time travel computing boost, Orion's Arm has the concept of a [[https://orionsarm.com/eg-article/48507a11adbd7][Tippler Oracle,]] which is a "basement universe" around 10-ish light years across that a high AI creates by expanding and pinching off some space (save a small wormhole for access) with computronium-assembling nanobots to solve problems that might require millions or billions or the age of the universe to otherwise solve. Probably a bit too much for when the AI has just left the planet, but on the galactic stage it might become feasible to make bubbles of expanded space and then pinch them off, as supposedly time accelerates the closer a universe gets to compressing into a hot big bang.

Probably not viable for rapidfire research since the universe has to last long enough in non-apocalyptic conditions for the nanobots to actually have time to construct the computronium, but those big long problems could potentially be solved this way.

Another potential problem worth exploring is the possibility that the god-child grows bored with smashing people one day. Maybe it can put him near a black hole or something so that time slows down immensely around the god-child? Doesn't matter if he gets bored in five minutes if those five minutes take longer than the remaining lifespan of nearly all other black holes and white dwarfs.
