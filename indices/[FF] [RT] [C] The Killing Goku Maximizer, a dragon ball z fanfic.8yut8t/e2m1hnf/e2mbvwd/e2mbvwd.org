If Dende creates new Dragonballs, would they be ready for use ASAP? We've never seen that - only him restoring the existing ones. Even if they were created scattered, the machine would get to them first.

As per Beerus, my idea was more that the machine could get info about God ki from Saiyan DNA, and once it has that, that's pretty much it, it can reproduce it through its own means. Beerus' hakai is powerful, but is it destroy-a-whole-galaxy-in-three-minutes powerful, especially if the galaxy fights back? He already did plenty damage, but he's not all-powerful like Zen-oh-sama.
