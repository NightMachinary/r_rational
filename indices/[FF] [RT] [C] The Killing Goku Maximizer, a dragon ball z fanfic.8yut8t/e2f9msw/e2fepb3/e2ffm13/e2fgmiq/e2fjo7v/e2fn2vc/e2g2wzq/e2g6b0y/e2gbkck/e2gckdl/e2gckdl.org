You're in the "our limits" camp, I'm in the "us" one. Simple as that, I guess XD. I would be delighted to be wrong though, especially if I get to see evidence for it in my lifetime.

And thanks for the offer of beta-ing! I'd like to hear an opinion on immediate future OWP developments. Part of what made this FF come to mind is that I actually was thinking about having an AI feature - for a much minor role - in the next arc, and play on a smaller scale with some transhumanist themes. All while actually having a rather light tone. If you're ok discussing it and being spoiled a little, PM me!
