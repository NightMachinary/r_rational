Well, let's leave out the socio-political considerations, that however have me rather worried on their own...

Nuclear fusion is indeed potentially possible, though the people I know who work in the field seem all but optimistic with regards to that. Let's just say we already know that ITER, the next fusion research machine, has some potential design flaws, but we can't fix them because designing and building these things takes so long we just can't go back to the drawing table every time we discover something new. We just have to hope to squeeze new info from the thing anyway by compensating for flaws during operation. The complexity of this stuff is already off the roof.

Dyson Swarms IMHO are out of our immediate reach, though potentially achievable. But consider how much the strain on our planetary resources and environment increases for every order of magnitude we try to scale up our industry... I'm not sure we could do that without having some well-established off-planet bases, and right now those don't seem very convenient or practical due to the sheer low quality of the real estate in our corner of space. Mars is the best prospect and let's face it, it's still pretty crap.

Even so, let's imagine we can acquire a good mastery of our Solar System, The Expanse-style, and we somehow still manage to do it while having a socio-economic structure conducive to further scientific and technological development. That's /still/ possibly too small to build a particle accelerator that can test the Planck scale. Unless you think it would be economical for such a civilisation to do something like disseminate an entire solar orbit (let's say between Earth and Mars) with superconducting magnets to accelerate particles around the entire Solar System to insane speeds, using up a significant fraction of the total energy output of the whole thing. To me, that seems the kind of stuff you can do if you have at least two or three star systems at your disposal. It might be a bit too much if you factor that people will still want to spend money on stuff that impacts their lives more directly than high energy physics - /especially/ if high energy physics is a sterile field that hasn't produced anything meaningful in decades or centuries.

And even then, suppose we build it, and we find out that quantum gravity is a theory that just doesn't allow to break the FTL limit anyway. What then? The light speed limit would remain a hard barrier between us and interstellar colonisation. We could overcome it by extending our own lives, of course, potentially by cyber implants, DNA rewriting, uploading or some other such trick because our bodies too are at their limit (we can improve the likelihood of reaching old age, but we can't really push the upper limit of 100-ish years of life for now).

Or we could just create a race of sentient machines that would carry our torch while being much more long lived, I guess. They would also have the benefit of not being as squishy and choosy when it comes to habitability conditions as we are. And that's one field where we can be sure significant advance must still be possible - if the human brain can do it with a few kg of matter and the energy produced by our metabolism, there's no way that sentient AI would require necessarily gigantic clusters to work (unless religions are right and we all just work because we have souls XD).

...I suppose the summary of it all is: I'm a naturally pessimistic person, and I'm pretty frustrated by both the state and trends of physics in recent time, so my extrapolations of the future are pretty bad scenarios, which usually tend to be also more realistic scenarios. My biggest pet peeve is understanding the quantum measurement problem, but anyway, I just get the impression we ran out of a whole lot of low hanging fruit in this field and we built our expectations on the freak occurrence of incredibly fast development for a couple hundred years rather than the norm.
