That's a weird way of looking at it. (The development trend) I can see your point that a lot of low hanging fruit in physics is already plucked. But it is by no means finished. I personally think we will never get to the end of science, that even if we discover the principles behind quantum gravity, we will simultaneously find even more stuff to figure out.

But even if physics development is forced to take a back seat for a while, engineering has a lot of catching up to do. At this point, our species is completely hooked on technology. I don't think we could stop inventing new things, even if we wanted to. Someone, somewhere would continue anyways. And what we managed to do in the last 100 years boggles the mind. And that was with a fraction of the people we have now. With a fraction of the tools we have access to now.

Sure, Moore's law seems to have petered out some years ago, there are still many other alternative routes we can take to higher computing power, and the scale we can work on is both increasing and minimising at the same time.

Other breakthroughs we seem to be on the edge of is; genetic engineering, space travel, material science, energy production (I know you seem doubtful of fusion, but really I'm talking about a 100 year time span here), automation, 3d printers, and that's just at the top of my head. Any of those will be game changing.

For the last 4 billion years, life has been confined to the earth. It took 3,5 billion of those years for it to evolve to anything more complex than a single cell. Homo Sapience has been around for 200 000 years. Civilisation 12 000. Industrial society 150‚Åì In 1969, we walked on the moon.

That was the first time that life touched upon another heavenly body. That was us. That was humans. The trend is most definitely exponential. It is hard to see it from so up close, but take a step back and it becomes clear as day. If we don't kill ourselves in the next 100 years, we will be gods. That is kind of the conclusion I have come to. I don't know if I will be alive to see it, but I hope so.

Once we get a couple of problems sorted down here. (Sickness, war, resource scarcity), there seems to be nothing stopping us from conquering the stars.
