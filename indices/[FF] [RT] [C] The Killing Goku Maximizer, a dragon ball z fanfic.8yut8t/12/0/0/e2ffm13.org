There are very few constants in the universe we are sure about. Even the conservation of energy is not absolute, not on relativistic scales anyway. And even time and causality seem to break down in the quantum world. No telling if this will (or can) have any impact on our scale, but until we have a universal theory (and even then), it will be hard to rule out the possibility of anything.

But the thing I was thinking about was simply the AI getting smarter than any human at some point, and then figuring out the fundamental concepts behind time travel, magic, and ki all at once, and how to use them to their extreme. Basically becoming a god immediately upon figuring out how all those things really worked.
