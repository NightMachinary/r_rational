You are right, of course. But we have a lot more data than you seem to think. The price of bitcoin, tulips and any other specific event is relatively short lived. And is therefore by definition a fad.

And hype is part of the human condition. We can no more get rid of it than we can get rid of porn.

But as I see the history of the planet, life and humanity. Something has to break soon. Either it is us, or our limits. And when I say "soon", I am talking the next century or so.

By the way, still love the fanfic. I have stayed up far to late to read your other stuff too. I am eagerly awaiting the continuation of 'The OWP'. By the way, if you want a beta or someone to just bounce ideas off of, I would be happy to contribute. Although we may not have the exact same interpretations of how history will go, that shouldn't pose a problem.

I have written some stuff myself, if you're worried about that. Link to my profile: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6111553/Caliburn0]]
