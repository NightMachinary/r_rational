  Oh, I thought the optimished wish project was just a forum where people try assembling a flawless wish to use on a malicious genie/unfriendly AI

That was called the Open Source Wish Project, which I was indeed referencing with my title since it's basically what Bulma does before summoning Shenron, but it's dead now :/.

The AI certainly can come up with suitable entertainment, I think XD. In Super, Zen-chan seems to be kept busy just by playing marbles with planets... he doesn't even know about fighting until Goku & co. give him a demonstration tournament, and he's been around for the entirety of DBZ and before. He just never looked.

  Are we certain that the time travel splits timelines rather than just traveling to one of infinite simultaneous timelines (full Rick & Morty style) that happens to match the time he wants to go to?

Yes. Because timelines are finite and splitting them is a big deal. There are two methods of time travel in DB Super: one is the time machine built for Trunks or similar technologies. These are considered taboo by the Gods and produce new timelines. Time travelling is a cosmic crime in DB! Other actions of supreme Gods can produce offshoot timelines. There's only four-five of these, one of them created by Trunks. Who created the others is unknown. I think Beerus created another one by destroying Zamasu (if you haven't seen Super, long story). The other method is the Time Rings. These are in possession of the Gods and allow them to time travel without affecting the past and splitting off timelines (so I assume these are closed time loops). When a new timeline is created, new rings appear as well. Each ring moves you to the past of a specific timeline.

It got really, really complicated after the Goku Black arc XD. The end of that arc was also pretty much as mindfuck-ey as the one of this fanfiction ([[#s][it ended with]]

)

EDIT: oh, and there's a third mechanism. Whis can rewind time, for just a few seconds. That's not really time travel though - time /literally runs backwards/ and history can then be rewritten at leisure without splitting any new timelines.
