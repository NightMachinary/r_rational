Well, the AI /does/ get smarter. It acquires emotions and sentience when it conquers the internet, for example. It just happens more in jumps than a smooth exponential because of the way it grows and is set back by occasional attacks.

However I'd say the fact that this is set in the DBZ universe is key to the way the situation goes to hell very quickly. I think in real life, for good or worse, real hard physical limits mean not everything can be done with technology - either ours, or a superintelligent AI's. The second principle of thermodynamics, Heisenberg's indetermination principle, the lightspeed limit... all of these are hard-coded and incredibly restrictive constraints that, even while allowing some wiggle room (and certainly more potential development than we have already), probably prevent altogether the kind of crazy feats we imagine for singularity-level AIs. Can't diverge to infinity if infinities are banned by law.
