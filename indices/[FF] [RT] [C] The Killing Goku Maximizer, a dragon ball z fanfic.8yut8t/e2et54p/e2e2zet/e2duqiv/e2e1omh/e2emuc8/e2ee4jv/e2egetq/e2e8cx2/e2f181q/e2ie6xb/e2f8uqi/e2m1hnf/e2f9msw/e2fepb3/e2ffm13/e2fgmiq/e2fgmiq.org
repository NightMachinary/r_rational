Well, that would have felt like a very sudden deus ex machina (literally...). Since anyway there's no reason to prefer one way to the other I kept it harder for the machine. After all right until the nanomachine attack the thing isn't even /that/ big yet. There are limits to how much you can achieve by sheer brute computational force anyway, even with parallelism, it isn't as simple as "twice the CPUs = everything is twice as fast".

As for the physical laws... I get the increasing feeling that it's really not that good. I mean, it sounds bad if you think of a malicious AI putting its hands on those easy gains before us, but if those potential gains at least /were/ there, that'd be something to look forward to.

I just seriously doubt they are.

We know for sure there must be a full theory of quantum gravity we're missing, but the only thing we can be reasonably sure of is that it will kick in at the Planck energy scale, which is an insane number of orders of magnitude above what we can achieve right now. Everything else, like supersymmetry and strings, is speculation - I might even say wishful thinking. For all we know it's a desert of new physics up until the Planck scale, and the Planck scale is out of reach until we go full Kardashev 1.5 or so... but we can't go beyond Kardashev 1 without new physics. It's a Catch 22, and I'm frankly afraid we might just have been unlucky enough to exist in a universe that works like that.

See it this way. We were born in the Solar System. We had the luck of having a big enough satellite orbiting our planet, which set an achievable goal for our early space program. However, now we're having many more problems because the next leap, to Mars, is comparatively much harder.

In a better version of this universe, Venus would have been habitable instead of being a greenhouse hell (it's in the Goldilocks zone after all...) and we would have much more incentive and economic convenience in colonising it. Our space technology would be flourishing and our energy limits would not be a problem. In a worse version, we wouldn't even have had the moon, and leaping from LEO to enough know-how to land on Mars would have been a pipe dream.

I'm afraid that, speaking of physical laws, we might be in one of those universes. We just landed on the Moon, and the next viable target is Pluto. If that's the case, then either us or an AI would be equally locked down. Energy conservation is definitely absolute on macroscopic time scales (are you thinking of temporary quantum fluctuations?). Time and causality still hold, they just follow different, weirder rules. The more you study these things the more you realise every single loophole you can think of is carefully patched up. Lightspeed looks like a truly absolute limit, so does causality. I don't hold much hope even from quantum gravity or dark matter. Dark energy is mildly interesting in that in the unlikely possibility it can be controlled and manipulated it /could/ perhaps hold the key to building an Alcubierre drive. But that's a pretty far-off possibility.

Let's look at it this way. This planet had to deal with self-repairing, self-replicating, learning, adapting carbon-based nanomachines programmed to maximise their own numbers for billions of years now. They're called bacteria and they never managed to eat it down to its core. Unless you include the single-celled organisms who started organising into increasingly complex systems eventually spawning a race of crust-drilling, space-dwelling, carbon-dioxide-spewing, fanfiction-writing two legged apes whose population has indeed been exploding exponentially as of late...
