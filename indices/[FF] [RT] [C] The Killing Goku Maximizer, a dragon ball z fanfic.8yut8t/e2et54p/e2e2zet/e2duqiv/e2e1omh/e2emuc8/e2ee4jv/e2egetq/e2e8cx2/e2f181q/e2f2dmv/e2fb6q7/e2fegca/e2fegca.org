Ah, my idea there (same canon I'm applying to Optimised Wish Project really) is that the Dragon world has no special or general relativity, and surely no cosmic speed limit. So no black holes either. There's various reasons in-canon to think this, IMHO, the main ones being the complete elasticity of space travel times without any dramatic FTL travel methods (hyperjumps, warp drives etc.) and the very existence of the instant transmission technique. You'll notice I didn't add any lag to Bulma talking with the Z fighters from Jupiter - that wasn't a mistake!

And if you haven't seen DB Super, well... suffice to say Zen-chan (the King of All) is a rather simple creature. Really, that bit was somewhat of an affectionate jab on my part at DBZ recent fanservice heavy videogames like Xenoverse and FighterZ - since Zen-chan is in many ways an audience stand-in in Super as well. The universe getting meta at the highest levels is basically canon XD.

Plus, Zen-chan getting bored is a general problem for the Dragon world anyway. He somehow managed to last until now without erasing all of existence on a whim, though, so let's assume he's as easily amused as he's bored.

Agreed on your ideas - about time travel, Trunks travels back to the past and that creates a split timeline, but the key point is that after he spends a certain time in the past, he can only go back to his future /after the same amount of time has passed/. This seems confirmed in DB Super during the Goku Black saga. Trunks comes back to the main timeline after a number of years that have passed in parallel in his timeline as well. Basically his time machine seems locked onto travelling back and forth by the same amount of years as it did the first time. It's possible that by re-calibrating it he'd simply lose forever the lock onto the specific timeline he wants to visit, and just start spawning new ones. BTW, Super also confirms that this sort of many-worlds multiverse is of a higher level of the multiverse ruled over by Zen-chan. Trunks' timeline had /its own/ Zen-chan, distinct from the one occupying the main one.
