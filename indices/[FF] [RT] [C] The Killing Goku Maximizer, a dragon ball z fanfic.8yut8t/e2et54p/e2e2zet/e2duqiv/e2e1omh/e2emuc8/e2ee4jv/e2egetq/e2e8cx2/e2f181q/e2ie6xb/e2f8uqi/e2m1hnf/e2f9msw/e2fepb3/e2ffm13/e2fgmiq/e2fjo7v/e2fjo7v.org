  but we can't go beyond Kardashev 1 without new physics

What makes you say that? (Starting) a Dyson Swarm seems to be completely within our near-future reach, and while we don't know when nuclear fusion reactors will be feasible, afaik they seem like we'll /eventually/ get there, new physics or not. Though given that most of my futurist information comes solely from Isaac Arthur, I'm hardly a reliable source. Do you have particular reasons for saying that future advancements are going to be hard?
