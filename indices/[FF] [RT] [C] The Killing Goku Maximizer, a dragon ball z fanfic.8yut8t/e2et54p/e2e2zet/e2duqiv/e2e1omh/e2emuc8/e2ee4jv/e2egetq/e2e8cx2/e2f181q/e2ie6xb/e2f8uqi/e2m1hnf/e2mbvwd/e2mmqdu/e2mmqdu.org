It's hard to argue they can't be used immediately. Kami reset the Dragonballs for immediate use after the destruction of the Dragon in DB, and it's noted he could have chosen not to. Furthermore, Kami/Piccolo's death and revival during the Frieza arc cause the Dragonballs to reset and be ready for use immediately. When Goku compains about waiting 100 days, Dende doesn't note that there's an additional charge time before changing tacts. Nothing at all implies that in the instance of creating new balls, you also wait any amount of charge time, but even adding a year of charge time still puts this at a 30.6 hour process with the Time Chamber, which is a superior alternative to Goku's suicide.

We have no clue on the upper limits of Beerus's Hakai, because there have been none shown by an actual GoD. The fact of the matter is we did see him fight a Majin, and that Majin can't touch him. We know of no other methods to create God Ki than the ritual, and it requires far afield from canon methods to imbue what is essentially a soulless Majin with god ki; even if we assumed it could spit out god ki batteries that somehow charge it, this just gives it a method of harming Beerus; it still can't get around unknowable time restarts and Whis' Ultra Instinct. (Time Rings were something I considered counting in their favor, but in actuality aren't something they'd consider using.) They can, however, use any set of Super Dragon Balls.
