About the virus idea, this Bulma did never get the plans for #17 and #18 - those were recovered from Gero's lab by Trunks and Krillin. So she's not as familiar as the one we know with their architecture. Plus this is the computer we're talking about, and whatever weird modifications it's doing to itself.

About Beerus, the time frame IMHO is not very relevant (he's notoriously a lazy bum) and Hakai isn't necessary that powerful (if we consider the Super manga as canon, it's a progressive technique that requires energy as you destroy mass, so obviously it would be very hard to use with the computer here). But with Whis you're right, though I'm not sure how useful his rewinding could have been. Perhaps he can rewind only once and it didn't do anything good? But nah, you got me here.

Piccolo can't make Dragon Balls any more. Dende could, though they'd just be destroyed again, being on Earth. Neo Namek could be a bit of a stretch I guess, depends on how much information we reckon the computer has. But yeah, Goku did have trouble finding it in the Cell saga, so it at least needs a /more/ sensitive ki sensor than Goku's sixth sense.
