The problem with extrapolating from exponential trends is you never know when and why they're going to stop. You could extrapolate that the price of Bitcoin in late 2017, or tulips in 17th century Netherlands, would keep rising exponentially from the existing data, and be sorely disappointed when they crashed and burned without any apparent forewarning. Complex systems are assholes like that.

I don't deny that there's room for improvement. If I have to say where the best chances lie, I'd hazard Artificial Intelligence (not the singularity kind, but I'd say human level might be attained at some point in the next decades, which will in itself be a history-defining moment and one that will usher in both a lot of changes and a lot of trouble), and genetic engineering. Materials science is good but I don't feel like some massive breakthrough is lurking behind the corner. Space travel... eh. We might do something new, if the funding is there. Private spaceflight will certainly have a technological and social fallout, but again, it's not the stuff paradigm shifts are made of IMHO. A lot of this stuff is incremental innovation, not radical innovation, to me. A bad sign I see is that our society, our science communication and our businesses seem all to run a lot on hype, to make up for results that don't always live up to snuff, but that is bound to also create disappointment and backlash.

This isn't about "the end of science" as in "there's nothing else to discover". Rather, it's about "the next groundbreaking discovery (I'm talking stuff like quantum mechanics or relativity) will be much harder and without our quick fix we might fall prey to problems that will make it almost impossible to ever reach it". Humanity's progress wasn't always linear and steady. When the Roman Empire fell, technology, productivity and knowledge in Europe were kicked back quite a lot. Exactly because we're so dependent on technology, like the Romans were so dependent on new lands to conquer, lack of significant developments that come fast enough to satisfy our hunger might end up strangling us.

And of course, there /is/ the possibility that anything else beyond a certain energy scale is just desperately out of reach and will forever be. And we don't know how likely it is because it's not like we have many Universes to make statistics about so we know what sets of laws are more likely to occur. It's not a pleasant thought, but we shouldn't shun away from it because of that.
