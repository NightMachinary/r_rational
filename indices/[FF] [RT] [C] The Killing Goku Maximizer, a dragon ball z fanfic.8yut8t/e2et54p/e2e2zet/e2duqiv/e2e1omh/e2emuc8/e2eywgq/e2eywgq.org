When was any limit about #16 established? The only reason why #16 isn't restored that I thought was at play is that he doesn't classify as "living being". They specifically ask the Dragon to resurrect all victims of Cell. #17 and #18 qualify since they're still part biological and obviously possess a "soul" of sort (#18 is seen in the afterlife in the Majin Boo saga too), while #16 doesn't because he's purely mechanical. He can't be "resurrected"; only "restored", or "rebuilt".

I didn't really mean the story as a 'serious' parabola on AI danger of course, it's more a way to play around with the DBZ setting as well. I mentioned it being inspired by "Friendship is Optimal", if you've ever read that it's pretty tongue-in-cheek too, what with the singularity starting from a My Little Pony MMORPG. Concerning the time travel, you're right, I didn't think about the fact that when Trunks uses it time does indeed seem to pass equally on both sides, though that's a pretty silly mechanism for time travel to begin with. As for the time machine wreckage, the system surely knew it was in CC and that it was an absolutely critical resource. It can create androids with Super Saiyan level energy no problem, so for example projecting a shield that can resist planetary destruction around it is no big deal. Super Saiyans and upwards can't be killed by planetary explosions, they would just die afterwards because of the lack of air. It can't protect the whole /planet/ of course, but specific dedicated critical parts of its mechanism, sure.
