This was great :) The one thing that bothered me a bit was why the machine hadn't just destroyed the planet immediately. Originally I always figured that Gero's machines had a limiter on their actions, since he wanted to presumably live in some fashion after Goku was dead; that could probably be written in somewhere to help address that potential question for readers. But it was willing to create a second cell-like-planet-buster, so really it seems like it shouldn't be opposed to just creating an android that has no ki signature but is strong enough to blow the planet up (which isn't that hard at all in the DBZverse).

Overall great story though! Looking forward to the continuation of Optimized Wish :)
