Oh, I thought the optimished wish project was just a forum where people try assembling a flawless wish to use on a malicious genie/unfriendly AI, if it's a story on this level I have to check it out! (Edit: Doh, just realized it's the awesome Rational!DBZ story I've recently started following. Thank you for that one too! :D)

And those are some fair assumptions to me, it solves a lot of problems that would otherwise be too omnipresent.

Zen-chan might be an issue in that before there was an entire universe generating fighters, movies, videogames and such at a way, way higher rate than Zen-chan could parttake of them without accelerating time. If the AI only offers him only one excellent form of entertainment it'll probably keep him happy for a long while, but eventually there's a risk that it's too same-y. Even the most fantastically realistic Diablo III or Doom game will get boring after a long enough slaughter of demons. The AI might need to match the cultural diversity of an entire universe, or at least as much as Zen-chan can parttake of - which it may well be able to do once it realizes that killing opponents like Frieza becomes too dull after the first million years.

I didn't think DBZ actually paid that much attention to keeping their time travel consistent, what do you know!

Are we certain that the time travel splits timelines rather than just traveling to one of infinite simultaneous timelines (full Rick & Morty style) that happens to match the time he wants to go to?
