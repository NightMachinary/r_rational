Very much so. The Daizenshuu suggest there should be 4 timelines, but then it suggests that the fourth timeline would have a Perfect Cell, when that does not make sense given the other details. We'd have two Killer Robot Futures, and two Trunks Warned Everyone and They Won timelines. But when do the two futures split? I thought I had a solution to this a few months ago, but it's not coming back to me easily.

Perhaps a truth-table would help? We know there must be a timeline that received no time travelers, one that received Trunks, and one that received both Cell and Trunks. Is there then, therefore, one that received Cell but not Trunks?

Maybe like this:

1. First bad timeline. Trunks leaves from here, as the original time-traveler.
2. The second timeline is created by Trunks's trip, from which he gets a remote to destroy 17 and 18 in his timeline. The fate of this timeline's Cell is unknown, but he wouldn't show up for 20 years or so.
3. Cell from the original timeline goes back in time, creating the third timeline. Trunks is not here, but for some reason, this Cell never becomes important enough for Trunks to know about. Maybe he and 16 take each other out when no one's paying attention, or something. This is the second bad future.
4. Trunks from the second bad future goes back, creating the timeline we see most in canon.

This is still confusing. And Super makes it even more so.
