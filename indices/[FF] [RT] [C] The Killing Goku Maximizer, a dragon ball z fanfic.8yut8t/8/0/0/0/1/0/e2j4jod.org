No, wait a second, when does that happen? If you're thinking of Trunks going back in the Android saga, the reason for the divergence was that Cell had also gone back to even before. He simply didn't know. There are three timelines there. In one, no one goes back, Goku dies and Cell kills everyone. In one, Trunks alone goes back, divergence starts at that point, they defeat the androids somehow, then he returns to his future but is killed by Cell who steals his time machine. And in one, Cell lands, then Trunks, and the divergence starts with Cell, so when Trunks arrives the butterfly effect is in full force already and #19 and #20 are born.

There's the question or how is it that Trunks lands in the same timeline as Cell, but that could be because Cell uses Trunks' time machine but goes back /even further/ into the past, so he creates a split timeline of the timeline into which Trunks arrives from another timeline... thus effectively creating /two/ future timelines...

It's confusing.
