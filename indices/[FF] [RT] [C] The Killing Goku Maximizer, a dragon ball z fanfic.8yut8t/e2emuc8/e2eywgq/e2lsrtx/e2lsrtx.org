Shenron couldn't bring him back; he's not a literal genie, if he could have restored 16 he would have done so by another means. This wasn't the same wish as reviving everyone else, either; this is the one that, after it failed, krillin used to remove 17 and 18's bombs.

That's always something that made sense to me. How I saw it, timetravel created other realities, and had them running concurrently; its like booting up another autosave in a new window. You're only using one at a time, but both are experiencing ticks at the same rate, and if you want to travel to back to exactly when you left, you have to open up a third timeline.

If it had enough control to hav eitd agents around the CC vault, why couldn't it have just gotten timetravel from that /before/ the earth blew up? If vegeta leaving allowed it to make a move, and it spent those few minutes before thr death working out timetravel, that would have solved quite a few issues I think.
