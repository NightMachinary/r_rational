  This wasn't the same wish as reviving everyone else, either; this is the one that, after it failed, krillin used to remove 17 and 18's bombs.

Nope. That wish was for Shenron to make #17 and #18 human again. He said he couldn't because they were too powerful, and he couldn't act on their bodies (makes sense, or they could just go ask Shenron to give strokes to all their enemies). Then Krillin just asked to remove the bombs, and he said that was okay because it didn't have to do with their strength.
