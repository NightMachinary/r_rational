One of the few divergences from canon rules that bugged me.

Why can't Dende just pay the 100 days to create new Dragonballs, since the lookout is out of its reach per magic, and then proceed to wipe it out? There's a 30 model gap between the Instant Transmission effect and the planet wipe. There's a 24 hour gap between the death of Goku and the planet wipe. The machine cannot beat a 6.6 hour stay in a magically safe, time accelerated room needed for Dende to create the Dragonballs anew with a fresh Dragon.

(Also there's no real way within canon it can beat Beerus. SSG requires pure blood Saiyan and drains the energy of the Saiyan batteries to complete no-fly zero. Even if the ritual didn't drain the AI blob, it would need to split off a pure saiyan body to fight Beerus. Even if it could do all that, it has no method to detect and deal with Whis and Beerus cheating it to death by attrition. This is assuming it could eat a full power GoD Hakai at all, which is suspect really.)
