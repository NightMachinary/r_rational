I read the whole thing. It was... okay? It's very, very irrational - I enjoy plenty of irrational stories, but this story consistently and egregiously had characters acting in ways that no real person would, and only sometimes for The Plot, which is pretty goddamn threadbare. Honestly, I get the feeling the author is making the whole thing up as he goes and isn't thinking things through.

The story also consistently makes references to various other niche works I haven't read - not enough to affect my understanding of the plot (because I'm not convinced there are any important plot moments to miss) but enough to break immersion and leave me confused.
