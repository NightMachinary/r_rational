hmm... I guess I understand the meaning and that is probably what is most important. The way he uses the language annoys me though, just enough that it makes me not want to read to much more. (specifically, if everyone is speaking japanese, why are we seeing everything in english except key words? manyh of which have perfectly good english translations.)

"the town looked so urban, with modern buildings, a shoutengai (商店街 or commercial district)" Hell, from what ive seen he means "market"

What is the point of that?

Why does he keep using "amenoshita" which could just be used as "the world"? Or using youkai, kami, and spirits? Why did he call the truck "Truck-kun"? Do I need to know what "chuunibyou" means?Besides trying to teach vocab, it makes me try to figure out what if there is more meaning...
