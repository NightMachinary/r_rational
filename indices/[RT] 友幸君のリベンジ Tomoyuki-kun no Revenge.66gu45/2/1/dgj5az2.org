as a second note... the title confuses me. 友幸君のリベンジ Tomoyuki-kun no Ribenji? 友幸君の復讐 Tomoyuki's Revenge? The name in kanji, followed by の followed by revenge in katakana confuses me. Granted, my Japanese is like, the definition of amatuerish so maybe I just don't know enough. Also, I believe the poster didnt write this, but that is just a guess.
