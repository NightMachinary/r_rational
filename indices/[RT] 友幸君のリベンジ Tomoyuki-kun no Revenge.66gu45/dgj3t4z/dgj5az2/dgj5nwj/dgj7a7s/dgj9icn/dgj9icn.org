Well, Truck-kun is a fairly old meme in the isekai-community. It's a common plot device to whisk the protagonist away from his mundane world by having a truck hit him, subsequently ending his life, allowing him to live out his new life in another world. The thing is: the goddamn truck is so ubiquitous, and has claimed so many lives from so many different anime that they just figured they'd name him Truck-kun.

Chuunibyou is also a fairly common word in the anime community, which basically translates to eight grade syndrome, or the feeling of self-importance that one gets typically at the age of thirteen. Symptoms include heavy delusions of grandeur, escapism, improvised role play and taking up pretentious hobbies.

I mean, Amenoshita is a place separate from our world, so using 'the world' would be very confusing. In fact, the word Amenoshita provides an easier way to distinguish the new world from the old one.

Yeah, the mixing of some really unnecessary japanese words here and there, like the Shoutengai, kinda does set me a little off. It's stupid because, as you said, shopping district or market works just fine.
