I think that there's a significant possibility that body jacking is what we're dealing with here, but it's not the only option.

His "prize" here might not be Link's body, but rather a courage fragment, which we've already seen vanishing and going to him. It's possible that he requires more courage fragments for something, such as more fully manifesting in the world, escaping his curse, etc.

If so, he may have simply been waiting for centuries for someone to travel to his location with a courage fragment.
