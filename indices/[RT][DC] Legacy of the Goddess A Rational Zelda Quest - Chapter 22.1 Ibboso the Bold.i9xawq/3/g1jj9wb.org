  Salaris: @Vecht, can I spend 20 personal points to get your ideas on how you would address the situation as a player?

  Cariyaga: I'll chip in 20 more, too.

  Lugnut: plus my 10

*Disclaimer:*

The following is, to the best of my ability, my honest take of "what I would do if I were a player, sans any particular QM knowledge," provided mostly as a stream-of-consciousness with me giving this serious thought over the course of ~1 hour. It is in no way to be construed as WoQM, and further may be incomplete or just flat wrong. Additionally, I make no guarantees that it won't end in Bad Things (TM) should you choose to follow through with it. I assure you, I am quite adept at this type of information segregation, compartmentalization, quarantine, etc., and I have taken great pains to employ such here.

So, first question: What do we know about Ibboso? The first mention was Link's vision from Hylia at the Obsidian Spire:

#+begin_quote
  “Although your trials have only begun, you show great promise. It is the solemn duty of all who walk this path to protect the realm, and to seek out and vanquish evil wherever it is found. The powers you are to wield must only ever serve this purpose. Prove yourself worthy of them, and you will have earned my favor.”

  Link's breath caught in his throat. Something about this wasn't right. If Hylia was still here, then...

  He knelt before her. “Holy Mother---please, you must listen! The world needs you. The realm is beset by a great evil already---there isn't time! A man named Ganondorf... he serves... the dark god Demise...”

  “You doubtless have many questions for me,” Hylia said, speaking over him as if he weren't there. “Would that I could answer them. Rest assured that I am with you still, guiding your steps from beyond time. Have faith, and you will be rewarded. For now, you must continue your quest. I charge you with this task: release the shade of Ibboso from his eternal prison, and retrieve the fragment of Courage his tribe defends.”
#+end_quote

In particular, this line stands out to me:

- "Rest assured that I am with you still, guiding your steps from beyond time. Have faith, and you will be rewarded."

Now I have no idea what Hylia means by "from beyond time," but to take that at face value, she has at bare minimum foreseen this eventuality and it is a part of her over-arching plans. She has, after all, been playing against Demise for an unknown amount of time prior to the story start. Her efforts culminated in her sacrificing herself to save Hyrule and empowering a champion. Given that Link was one of the three (even if he wasn't initially chosen to be empowered), it stands to reason that Hylia had plans for Link in any timelines where he survived (so roughly 66% of them). In the timelines where Link stumbles upon the silvery egg (again, assuming that was part of her plan, given how unlikely it was said to be in the story), he gets the visions of the temples. Seeing as he's now talking to her (or her memory/imprint/recording/cognitive shadow/essence/whatever) and thus /survived/ the first challenge, it seems to me it would be immensely wasteful of her to immediately send him off to die at the hands of Ibboso.

Meaning, this isn't a hopeless situation, and Hylia may have already, one way or the other, given Link the tools he needs to come out of it ahead. Maybe if he fights Ibboso head on, he'll win? Though that seems risky, and also not the kind of answer you'd like to find out the hard way. If nothing else, just this point alone seems like it would be a source of inspiration for him to draw on. That's kind of exactly what "having faith" means, isn't it? Link seems particularly religious and motivated by that type of reasoning--wanting to believe he is a chosen hero of destiny. I'm not sure to what degree /more motivation/ will help him against Ibboso, but it's something to keep in mind at least.

I /suppose/ it's possible Hylia could intentionally be sending Link to his doom as a means of letting Ibboso escape (other players on Discord have posited Ibboso wants to yoink Link's body and I think that is a fairly straightforward interpretation), but that kind of misdirection and manipulation doesn't strike me as something Hylia, as portrayed thus far, would be willing to do. I will proceed assuming this is not the case.

I further suppose it could be possible this wasn't intended as a message for Link /specifically/, but rather as a general-purpose message for any hero-types who managed to get this far. After all, it has been an indeterminate amount of time since the Lightsworn order fell apart. The first line ("Although your trials have only begun, you show great promise.") does seem to be at odds with the interpretation that this was a message meant specifically for Link. It's still possible that the message was recorded long, long ago, and had to serve multiple purposes. I'm not sure.

Next mention:

#+begin_quote
  “There is not much to this one, sadly,” Naibi said. “Ibboso was said to be an arrogant king, who renounced the Gerudo way and violated the old laws. He offered refuge to the lost sons of other tribes---ꡦꡟꡛꡀꡲꡀꡟꡟꡖꡨ---those who were exiled for the crime of weakness. This angered the gods, and his tribe was cursed to roam the dry sands for eternity, never knowing the peace of death.”

  “The crime of weakness?” Zelda said in disbelief. It was painfully obvious to her that “the gods” in this tale referred to Morudo Geira in some capacity, but she wasn't about to mention that in front of Naibi.

  “We no longer follow the old laws,” Naibi said simply. “Please, let us not speak any more of this.”

  Zelda nodded solemnly. “My mistake. Naibi, in Link's vision, there was a mausoleum in the middle of a graveyard filled with shambling corpses. He said he had a vague feeling it was somewhere to the east, but he doesn't know exactly where it is. You wouldn't happen to know where to find that, would you?”

  “Ehh,” she waved a hand from side to side. “There is a certain pass in the eastern mountains where no one goes. It is said that it was once a place of ritual and worship, but is now haunted. I never put stock in such tales, but if what you say is true, perhaps the dead really do roam there. I cannot say if it is the same place as his vision, but I also do not know where else it might be. There are not many such tales.”
#+end_quote

Things to take from this that might be relevant:

- Ibboso fought against the Gerudo practice of sacrificing their male children. Also, he's attuned to Courage. He's probably not evil.

- THIS DESCRIPTION OF THE LOCATION IS NOT WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE LATEST CHAPTER

- The place they're at, presumably, was once a "place of ritual and worship." Maybe that's important? I dunno.

In particular, #2 above really strikes me as off. This whole chapter seems to be one big fever dream, and I have to wonder how much of it's real. Presumably they are actually here at this location in some capacity, but from Fi's appearance at the start, to Ryn's constant reminders and Link's own internal monologue saying "none of this is real," it's obvious there's some really fucky stuff going on.

Is the Ibboso encounter real? Or is this whole thing just running on some kind of dream logic? Presumably there are real consequences at stake here, and Ibboso really is going to kill Link and yoink his body unless Link finds a way to stop him. But is it /actually happening/, or is it some pseudo-physical manifestation of cognitive plane shenanigans? The situation might not be what it seems, is all I'm saying. It's a stretch, but Link might be able to go all Neo and use DreamLogic (TM) against Ibboso, if that is in fact what's happening. Could be risky, though. Ibboso is almost certainly more practiced at it, having "awaited this opportunity for ages." And if it doesn't work, again, not the kind of thing you'd like to find out the hard way when there's an ancient Gerudo king trying to lop your head off.

Question: Why hasn't this happened before? Is Link & co. really the first people to arrive here? That strikes me as unlikely. We're not sure when Ibboso and his tribe was cursed, but it seems like it would be around the time the Gerudo split off from the Hylians, and the story says (via Raolin in prologue 1) that it's been "over a thousand years" since the last war with the Gerudo. So it's been >1000 years, and probably longer than that. That's a hell of a lot of time for no one else to have ventured in here for Ibboso to yoink.

...Is something special about Link? His Lightsworn status? Or maybe his connection with Courage?

AAHHH.

Idea.

You know what? It doesn't matter. Ibboso wants Link's body. But he doesn't have Link's body. Link does.

And what can Link do with his body?

Oh yes. That's right, class. It's time for some good ol' fashioned

*[X] GAME THEORETIC COERCION!!!*

- It's obvious Ibboso wants to use Link's body for some purpose, probably to yoink it and gtfo. Pick up your sword and threaten to kill yourself unless he stops and agrees to talk this out. (And, uh... we probably need to fill in the rest of the plan with what we want to talk to him about.)

^ Yeah, that's probably the plan I'd vote for if I were a player.

I'd probably poke others to refine it first and ultimately be shouted down by more risk-averse folks, but I'd totally vote for it.
