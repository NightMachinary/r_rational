[Plan: lets talk through the sword] Seems like diplomacy isn't working and ibosso seems the kind of guy that prefers crossing swords to talking(I mean he is even complaining about our words being.empty) .

Link:Grab the sword and shield fight ibosso. Keep trying diplomacy while you do it.

Link:Start whith saying that you don't think someone who would steal a body is a hero either. Mention that you have faced the trial of the Spire and a vision sent you to release him. Also that the enemy is about to wipe out hyrule and the last thing we need right now is a fight between people who should be in the same side.

Link:Try to get the fight away from Ryn.

Link:Try to be as nonlethal as possible, we are in an illusion and we can't know if we are actually fighting an ally, and not sure what killing ibosso in this illusion/cognitive/dream whatever would do, ideally we want him as an ally. But if you get too wounded, it looks like ibosso won't stop and you are about to loose attempt to shot him whith the transfubulator (if you don't have it realize this is not real and you should have it and see if you can get it to materialize).

Explicitly think that the fragment will come back to you (this place/illusion seems to react to beliefs and it would make sense for it to come back, since it should be bonded to Link)

Fi:If Link is actually fighting ibosso in a way you can detect support him by giving him mana to keep him in his normal level if necesary. Use rejuvenate on him if the fight is going bad. Otherwise inform Zelda/link's companions if they aren't compromised of the situation Link is in and and ask for her orders about it.
