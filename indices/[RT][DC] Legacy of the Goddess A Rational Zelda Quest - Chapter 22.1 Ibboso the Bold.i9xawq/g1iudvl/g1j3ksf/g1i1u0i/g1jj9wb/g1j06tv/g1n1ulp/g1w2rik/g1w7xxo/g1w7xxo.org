[Plan: Constructive Paranoia]

Please see my long winded post in this thread for reasons to doubt everything about this chapter. Since the true state of reality cannot be known, the best plan is the one that produces the best results in the maximal number of possible realities, weighted by probabilities.

This plan is based on optimizing for the following realities with roughly equal weights:

- Reality A:

  - Everything is an illusion. It is hostile and trying to cause us harm.

- Reality B:

  - Everything is an illusion. It is trying to measure our worth.

- Reality C:

  - Everything is a dream realm. Non-party member entities are real real entities. This dream realm is the prison Ibboso needs to be released from and wants to escape.

- Reality D:

  - Things are approximately as presented in the chapter.

Based on this, this is the best plan I could think of, most contingencies for reality D snatched from Salaris, Mathemicae and crivtox:

1. Scry as soon as possible

   1. Request Ibbosso to give you a moment to prepare. Appeal to his honour and mercy.
   2. If above does not work, explain that he could be an illusion and you don't want to hit your friends, so you must scry to make sure before can fight.
   3. If not, try to fit scrying in at some point if at all possible.

2. Explain observed reality to Ryn

   1. Main point being that you will have to respond to an attacker that could be real, so please stand clear.

3. Request/Authorize Fi to induce sleep paralysis in self, if trapped in illusion
4. The above may take time. Dodge and shield as necessary to buy the time.
5. Diplomacy

   1. So you would sacrifice me to save yourself?
   2. I may be no hero, but I will protect the realm and seek out and vanquish evil wherever it is found.

      1. Reference to the speech heard in vision in tower, to signal lightswornness
      2. Humility

   3. Hylia told me to release you from your prison
   4. Mention that the old evil god is dead. Ask about feelings regarding that. Ask about awareness of demise, Ganondorf.

6. Ibboso could be the sort of guy you need to beat to befriend

   1. Try to use moves and tactics least likely to hurt friends if blinded.
   2. Can Fi read our mind to what extent? Subvocalization? Inform friends about moves.
   3. Definitely don't kill Ibboso. Use tricks, like the transfubulator.
