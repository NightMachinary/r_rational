[Plan: Ibboso the Hypocrite]

- Continue trying diplomacy
- Talking seems more likely to achieve his goddess given mission of 'release the shade of Ibboso from his eternal prison'
- Say, 'I'm a /boy/, and you're trying to sacrifice me. Are you going to become what you fought so hard against?'

The idea here is that Ibboso is known for being anti-child sacrifice. And yet here he is trying to bodyjack a kid. Throw his hypocrisy into his face in hopes of scoring an armor-piercing question. Since we know that he at least /was/ a not-evil guy. I'll note here that Lucia was also calling Link boy which might be a hint from her as well.
