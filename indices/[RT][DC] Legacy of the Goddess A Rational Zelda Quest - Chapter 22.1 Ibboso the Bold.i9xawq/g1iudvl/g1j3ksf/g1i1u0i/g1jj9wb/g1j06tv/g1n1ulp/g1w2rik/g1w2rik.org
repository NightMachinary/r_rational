Okay, this chapter is purposefully very confusing, and works had to make you forget your previous confusions by introducing new ones, so I listed my suspicions as I reread the chapter, to make sure I didn't drop them. Could help to form some idea about what is going on. The full list is below, a bit long and windy.

TL; DR:

1. The illusion started at first the line of the chapter.

   1. cf. Fi

2. There is some leakage from reality, especially in what Ryn says

   1. But not all she says is real

3. It seems somewhat unlikely for everything to be one coherent illusion created by a single agent

   1. But there is definite intent in purposefully distracting Link all the time. Could still just be a feature of an advanced effect.
   2. Most likely: illusion containing genuinely independent agents. A dream realm? But with some control by some actor?

Here is the full chronological suspicion listing:

- Link is surprised by how soon they got "here".

  - Their hereness is only an assertion by Ryn. This assertion presumes they knew precisely where they were going and are now there. So this is probably false. They were not yet at their goal, when Link entered the illusion/mindbending.

- Koja says "that's ominuous", then takes it back. Very inorganic. I suspect "that's ominuous" leaked from reality and was explained away.

  - So some specific ominuous thing happened and Link was not meant to pay attention to it.

- Grenja's "Did you forget why we came here?" dialogue. Clearly an attempt by illusionist to fish out why they were there.
- Illusionist was not aware of what Fi was. Simulated another hylian.
- “Link! Are you listening to me?” Ryn's voice leaked from reality.

  - Simulated Fi was immediately used to distract Link.

- Fi: "I had hoped you of all people would understand that the situation is exceedingly dire, Master. Regardless of you believe you are seeing, you must---”

  - I suspect this leaked from reality, requiring another immediate distraction, in the form of Urik appearing.

- Grenja was uncharacteristically aggressive in apprehending Urik.

  - I'm not sure why. A test whether Link approves this approach? A mistake? Urik appeared also in reality, but in a more clearly suspicious way?

- "Link glanced back to his teammates. Ryn was arguing with Grenja, while Koja stood off to the side, shaking her head."

  - Was each one dealing with their private illusion? Or did this leak from reality?

- Urik posessed.

  - If illusion, why? To justify change?

- “Link!” Ryn said quietly. “Will you /please/ just listen---”

  - Ryn has definitely been saying a lot of things to Link, that we have not seen in the text.

- “That's none of your...” Link shook his head. “That's... uh... one of the gemstones from the Obsidian Spire."

  - Explicit mindbending here. Strong enough to reverse already formed decision and redirect thought. Not used this strongly constantly. Costly? Risky?

    - If the risk is detection, why not just turn mind away from idea? So likely not that risk at least. So cost more likely. => Finite resources? Could use attrition?

- Gem changes things, allegedly. Obelisk changes. Real?

  - If real, meaning?

    - Allows transition to ghost town? What is relation between ghost town and illusion if so?
    - Occam suggest ghost effect and the effect since first line of chapter is same.
    - Both ghost or both illusionist? Ghosts as separate from illusionist real?

- Ghost town an inconvenience for Urik. If both illusions, why?

  - Establish danger to force trust in Urik?
  - Test reactions?
  - This is to a degree evidence against ghosts, illusion and Urik being all illusions serving same purpose

- "He shook his head. No. This wasn't right. This wasn't /real/. “Boy, come! Get inside, now!” Urik yelled, holding a door open and gesturing inside."

  - Was this a rescue, or a distraction from realizing nothing is real?

- “Uh, Link?” Koja said. “Not to sound rude or anything, but---”

  - Leak from reality. In general, there are clearly several alternative realities inside the house. If only link is illusioned, this suggests house is in some way real.

- Ryn let out a breath. “Okay. So, I don't know what's going on exactly, but ... not real ... this place? ... none of it ... but it's safe here, just like Urik said ... can't believe anything you see ... some kind of shared dream, or /something/ ... those people out there? They're not people! ... don't look, it makes them angry ... Koja? Are you listening? I said...”

  - Whatever Ryn is trying to say is being heavily edited by the illusion.
  - Likely main point of editing is to make us trust Urik. No reason why Ryn would be so confident in Urik's assertion. No reason to believe Urik exists for real Ryn.

- " Link hesitated. Something nagged at the back of his mind. There was something he was trying very hard /not/ to think about. Somehow he needed to think about it, without actually thinking /about/ it. He needed to think /around/ it. He needed to get Grenja to as well."

  - Genuine struggle against memetic threat? Is there anything around that should not be thought about for some reason?
  - Or is this just the mindbeding making him avoid thinking about flaws.

- Either the illusion contains a Grenja who has a separate illusion, or there actually is such a Grenja? Unclear.
- “It's, uh, not so bad,”

  - Trying to make it safe by thinking it so?
  - Was the miscalculation by Urik genuine, if so, in which direction?

- Ryn grinned. “Yes, Link,” she said. “Urik's trying to help us. It's safe now.” She looked around the room. “I think.”

  - Was this a pure illusion Ryn? Usually when Link adresses Ryn, as he did here, at least the first few words back are from real Ryn. Is that different here? Is only "Yes, Link" real? Or is there a real Urik really trying to help us with the illusion?

- The discussion about the draw and the Scry seems real. Which is evidence that something similar to what is claimed may actually be going on.

  - “Not /now/, you idiot,”

    - A sudden shift from previous line, countermanding it. Likely switched to illusion here. Should have scried immediately.

- Urik & Iboso disagree

  - Evidence against all being illusion puppets of same master, to an extent

- “Urik?” Ryn said, looking confused. “What are you talking about? Who's Urik?”

  - Seems like a leakage from reality. Patched by claiming it was a joke. Suggests Urik exists only for Link.
  - There is some evidence for Urik being real to others, but "YOU ARE NOT LISTENING"-Ryn would not joke here and now, even if this joke is like her in the abstract.
