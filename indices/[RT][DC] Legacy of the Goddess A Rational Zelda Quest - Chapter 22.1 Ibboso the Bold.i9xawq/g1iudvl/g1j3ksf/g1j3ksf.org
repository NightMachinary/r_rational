[Plan: Job Interview]

- Continue trying diplomacy
- Talking seems more likely to achieve his goddess given mission of 'release the shade of Ibboso from his eternal prison '
- If you replace me, are you going to protect the realm, and to seek out and vanquish evil wherever it is found?

  - [Joke] Alternate phrasing. Where do you see yourself 5 years from now? [/Joke]

Edit: My reasoning here is that Ibboso is claiming, like a certain red-haired jerk, that Link isn't a /real/ lightsworn. 'Protect the realm...' is an exact quote of what Hylia said to Link in his vision. My theory is that the first paragraph she says to every Lightsworn candidate. And then the 2nd paragraph where she talks about freeing Ibboso is one unique to the candidate. So by quoting what she says in the first paragraph, that's proof to Ibboso that Link's the real deal.

The reason I think establishing this is key, is based on what Lucia (She helped Hyrule defeat Morudo Geira worshipers awhile back so she's not one of the super evil fae) has said. When Lucia noticed that Link was a lightsworn, she took over for Urik. And then when Link revealed that he had gotten the purple gemstone from the Spire she said this.

  “This changes matters considerably,” he said. “I know why you are here. I may be able to help you.”

Being Lightsworn wasn't sufficient, it was the reveal of going to the Spire that made her think we had a chance.

#+begin_quote
  “He's Lightsworn, and chosen of the Goddesses! Hylia sent him. Please---”
#+end_quote

Once again she's emphasizing Link's Lightsworn status. Which is awfully nice of her given how so many people in the know are so dismissive of it.
