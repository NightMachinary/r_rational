OP's idea of throwing in TMNT ripoffs like Street Sharks sounds like it could be awesome, since they already have pretty much everything in common, and I'd love the meta aspects of a crossover; in contrast, the Mobians in Sonic actually have quite a bit of lore (much of it conflicting, of course) and personally I'd prefer to see that setting Rationalised independently rather than as a crossover with this one. Could be just me, though.
