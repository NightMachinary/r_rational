I mean, the various cartoons all end up getting pretty space opera, going hard on alternate dimensions, aliens, and other mutants. Surely the whole mutagen thing could fairly reasonably come about with a little handwaving as some sort of weird interaction between some of these things.

I think you'd need to lean pretty hard into mysticism and "ancient magic" type stuff to make the ninjas relevant, but it's not wholly impossible as I see it. That said, Shredder, to my knowledge, invariably gets caught up with dimensional junk and Krang, etc. Which gives a decent capacity for combining sci-fi benefits with ancient ninja skills. Maybe even a Matrix-esque thought download solution to your training problem. (In all honesty a good rationalist fiction /probably/ leans a little less on the whole henchmen thing).

Once you allow for that though, you can just combine a little bit of the mutagen aspect / being an actual giant mobile turtle, with all the benefits that entails, along with Splinter's mastery of the aforementioned ancient ways and you get a decent basis for the TMNT's superiority.

With all this, depending on the strength of this mutagen, those other mutant animal characters all sorta slot in fairly well into such a world, if I'm being honest...

I don't /really/ know how you'd approach a rationalist fiction, and I can't say I'm intimately familiar with any of the overarching Ninja Turtles plot lines, but I don't think the world is necessarily hostile to it.
