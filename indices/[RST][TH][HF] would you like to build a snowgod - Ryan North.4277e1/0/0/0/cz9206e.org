I did have explanations, but didn't include them because it's magic and I ain't gotta explain shit (also because it wasn't a mystery that was central to the plot, didn't reveal any characterization, wouldn't have been known to the protagonist, and would have to come at the wrong moment).

Elsa has a required secondary power of being able to unfreeze things. She does this at the end of the movie when she unfreezes the lake and the whole town, which would have taken ages to happen just from the heat of the sun. So frostbite isn't really a problem if it can be permanently maintained from a distance, since unfreezing is part of the powerset.

Edit: Alternate explanation was that it was one of the phases of ice available at higher pressures and room temperature, but I wasn't sure about the physics of that and it's a little less canonically sound.
