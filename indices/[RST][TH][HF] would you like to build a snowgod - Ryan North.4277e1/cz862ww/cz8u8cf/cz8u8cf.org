That story bothered me because it ignored the effects of extremely cold temperatures on human flesh. "ice [..] fused directly with the old man's arm joined with a collar of snow" and "a sliver of ice in his brain" should cause frostbite of the arm and frostbite of the brain, respectively.

Now you can say, "it's magic, I ain't got to explain shit," but A) the other effects of Elsa's ice magic have been handled realistically (e.g. ships made out of sawdust and ice because regular ice wouldn't be strong enough), and B) at no point was that lampshade hung. ("How did you avoid frostbite?" "It's magic." "Fair enough.")
