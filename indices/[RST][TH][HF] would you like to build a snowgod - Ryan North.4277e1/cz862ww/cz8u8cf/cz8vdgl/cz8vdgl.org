I had the idea that "living ice" worked differently than "dead ice". The pykrete ships were formed /using/ ice magic, but the ships themselves were mundane. So: they acted like normal ice.

The automatons, arms, control things, and so on, weren't made out of mundane ice but were made out of magic ice, which has different properties. For example, thinking creatures made out of the magic ice don't melt.
