Tv tropes says it's just an insult because younger d&d players are more likely to engage in cheaty tactics, that's kind of boring.

Edit: I stand by my first leap of logic as a fairly rational one given that:

1. The word munchkin did not previously exist prior to roald dahl making it up in willy wonka.

2. Willy Wonka is basically a max level d&d player breaking the world to suit his own needs.

3. Munchkin isn't really used as an insult for short people anymore, I last remember hearing it in the 90's. I feel old now.

Anyway, sorry for clogging up the thread, have a nice day!
