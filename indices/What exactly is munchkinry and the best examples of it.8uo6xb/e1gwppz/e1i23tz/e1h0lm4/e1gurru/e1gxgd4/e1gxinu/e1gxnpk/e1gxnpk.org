Personal first hand knowledge. The gaming community I was involved with in the 70's used it.

Citation referencing "Munchkin" as a term of art in 1983:

#+begin_quote
  The whole thing started around 1983 or so at a party at Pacificon at the Dunfey Hotel in San Mateo in which the idea came up of classifying the different styles of roleplaying. They came up with four different types, which are explained below. Special credit goes to Perry Caro, Chris Guthrie, Rick Heli, Robert Allen, and Ken Kaufman, to name a few.

  The Real Man

  The tough macho type who walks up to the attacking dragon and orders it to leave before he gets hurt.

  The Real Roleplayer

  The intelligent cunning guy who tricks the constable into letting you all out of prison.

  The Loonie

  The guy who will do anything for a cheap laugh, including casting a fireball at ground zero.

  The Munchkin

  Need we say more?

This term was well known at Sydney University in 1977-78 (personal experience - that's was when I was playing D&D there).

An even earlier reference:

  I can point to its use in Alarums and Excursions back in 1976 if I look around long enough. There were young players even back then, and they often tended toward the malign forms of power gaming, and thus the connection. I'm sorry, just because you didn't see it until it got into more general usage doesn't mean it was new when you saw it. Memes take a while to spread.

  Re: Munchkins. It has been mentioned by a few [members] that there are far too many youngsters who, while they are the fantasy gamete of the ham, seem to delight in nothing more than making huge amounts of noise, getting in the way of collation [of the magazine] and generally making nuisances of themselves.
