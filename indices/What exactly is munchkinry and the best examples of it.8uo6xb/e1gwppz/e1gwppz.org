On this subreddit at least, it usually refers to exposing and/or abusing loopholes in a given set of rules, in creative and interesting ways

My personal favourite example is from Harry Potter and the Natural 20, wherein a character points out that if one follows the exact rules of D&D 3.5 to their logical conclusion, then any character wielding a tower shield is completely invisible (as they and their equipment cannot be seen through full cover, and the tower shield is part of their equipment).
