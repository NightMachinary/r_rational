Pity, but yea, the world is definitely dark and bleak as fuck. There are people who'll get pretty riled up when you call Worm Grimdark - that should be reserved for entirely crapsack universes with totally crapsack people like Warhammer 40k where there /are/ no good guys - but I understand that it's still not easy to stomach.\\
