Examples of munchkinry? There are plenty in [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Worm]].

Imagine you have a superpower that allows you to control bugs and insects. Pretty damn creepy, and boring, right? However! If you have /really/ good control, like the protagonist of that story, you can use that to great effect. For starters, and that's not spoiling a lot, she uses her creepy crawlies to fabricate a damn great costume that can stand up to knives and small arms fire, because spider silk is fucking badass.

Or if you're a guy whose touch can stop things and people in time. Great for crime fighting, just put a dude in time-out then slap handcuffs on his immobile form. Easy, right? But there's more! How about you start carrying a stack of paper, so you can build staircases wherever you go? Or bring an inflatable tent, giving you instant access to an inviolable shield! There are some neat tricks with ultra-thin wires later on, but that would be spoilers.

Seriously, I could rave for hours and hours on how cleverly superpowers are used in that book, and that's not even its best feature; an honor belonging to its many well-developed characters.

Just... don't be like me and put the book down after the second chapter because of the bullying, okay? It really doesn't last long at all, and while it's an important part of the main character and forms many of her traits, it isn't focussed on a lot.
