So he literally defines it as "Gritty, adult, dark science fiction and fantasy."? That's pretty broad, and yea, under that definition Worm is grimdark - and so is practically any superhero movie besides Spiderman. At that point the word just... kinda loses its meaning.\\
Like, yea, Worm is a shithole of a world, and every superpowered human has a tragic backstory by default. But there are still decent people, in fact even most villains have /some/ decency or less shitty traits, even some of the literal Nazis.

Contrast that with WH40k, a universe where reality itself is close to coming apart at the seams due to Chaos gods, where a galaxy-devouring tide of bio-horror-monsters is about to overwhelm every major power, and where even the "good" guys are literal fascists that make North Korea look like a democratical first-world country.

No, these two aren't even in the same ballpark as far as shittyness is concerned. We shouldn't use the same word to describe both.
