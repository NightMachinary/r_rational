How so? Almost the entire MCU is basically action-adventure romps with the occasional emotional moment whose consequences aren't mused about too much before going back to the heroes mindlessly quipping their way to victory.

Now if we're talking about the DC universe, or most of the pre-MCU superhero movies, like Singer's X-Men or the original Daredevil, then it's a different story.
