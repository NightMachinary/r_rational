You might find it interesting, and it is a story about incremental improvement approaching human singularity, but the human half of the partnership really isn't the one driving the improvements until late in the story. In fact the human main character frequently gets irritated by the changes made by the symbiote main character.

Warning. It was my first original fiction. The grammar is decent, but story elements and structure hiccup from time to time.
