There's a Chinese novel where the guy living in a futristic world based on genetic scores. Average MC gets attacked by mad scientist, gets a genetic upgrade join a sort of space army, and upgrades his powers as he gets his hands on materials during his travels. Makes influencal friends along the way etc it's a nice read but I forgot the title, check on [[/r/noveltranslations]]
