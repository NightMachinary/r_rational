So, you are looking for a story about a person who incrementally approaches human singularity, at a rate based on the resources they can collect.

Off the top of my head I cannot think of any. Most protagonists either enter a story already enhanced, or become enhanced all at once through the actions of others.

The closest thing I can think of off the top of my head is Weber's Honor Harrington. She starts the series as a genetically enhanced human, and loses several body parts during the course of events, replacing them with mechanical body parts with features beyond human capabilities. She also develops a sort of empathic mental skillset as well, due to her own genetic predisposition, and her link with a telepathic/empathic companion treecat.

David Weber's writing style, while more rational than many, is not highly rational. He also tends to spent more time on space combat and technical minutae than most other successful authors.
