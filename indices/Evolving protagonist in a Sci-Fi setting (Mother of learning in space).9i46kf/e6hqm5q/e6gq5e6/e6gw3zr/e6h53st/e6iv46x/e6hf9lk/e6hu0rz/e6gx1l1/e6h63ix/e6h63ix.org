I actually quite liked the story and think it's a good recommendation, but funny story... I read it in anthology of hard science fiction, I think, and it had this author's introduction with it that was just the most offputting thing thing I'd ever read. It was about how he'd made up a bunch of quasi-meaningless numerical comparisons and convinced his editor that this was plausible science. And of course the story is transparently not plausible to anyone who's taken a biology class or two.
