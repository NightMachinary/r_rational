I kinda went by the title. Reading the full description, there hasn't been much permanent mind/body enhancement going on in that story, has there? The mechanics work at odds to it. Instead it's mostly experience, new techniques and equipment. Of actual artificial brain/body enhancements, there's been Zorian's memory upgrade and some dabbling with potions in literally the most recent chapter. Maybe the soul-sight ritual counts?
