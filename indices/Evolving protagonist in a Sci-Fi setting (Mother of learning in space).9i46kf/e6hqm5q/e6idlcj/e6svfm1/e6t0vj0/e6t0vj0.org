I wish you'd been less abrasive. There are people here who enjoy his stories, and that feels an awful lot like a personal attack.

For those who need content warnings: /Perilous Waif/ has no sex scenes. Its protagonist is 14 and treated as such, at most engaging in flirting with peers. The setting contains normalized android sex slaves, and mind & body hacks sometimes used in sexualised ways (though mostly as a background detail).
