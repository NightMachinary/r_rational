  In HP canon Harry saw a fully accurate scale model of the milky way galaxy being sold in diagon ally.

I wonder how reliably canon Harry rates the accuracy of milky way galaxy models.

  I don't know about a magical spaceship but wizards probably have spells or divinations to explore outer space without actually leaving Earth.

I would probably still go in person, even if I had an identical experience available in some sort of virtual reality device. I suspect, I would not be alone.

Besides, I feel that this type of spell would be a bit inconsistent with the canon universe. The society described in the books does not look like a terribly outward-looking civ hungry for exploration. Sure, the spells were probably invented at one point or another, but they are not widely known or available. At least that's my reading.
