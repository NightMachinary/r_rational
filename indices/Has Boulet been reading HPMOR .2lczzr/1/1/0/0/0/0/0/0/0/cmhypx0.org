  Spells seem to travel at about 80-100 mph based on most calculations I've seen.

Huh. Can I ask for how those calculations were done or for a source? Because that would mean that one could outrun jinxes on a Firebolt without any evasive maneuvers. Indeed, barring spells being affected by initial momentum, in flight skirmishes would look pretty weird.
