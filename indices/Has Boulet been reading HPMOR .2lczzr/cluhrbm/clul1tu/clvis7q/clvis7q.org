That's probably the best reason I've ever seen, but still it suffers from an issue that it is a pretty niche interest, especially in a society that doesn't have stuff like Star Trek. And even for wizards it's probably not trivial, as you'd likely have to invent spells for stuff like radiation shields.

Still, I'd really really like to read a "wizards-colonise-space" story. To The Stars does the magical space colonisation from a different angle (and is therefore my favourite space story), but it might be more fun with wizards because the big magics in To The Stars can be used just once per lifetime.
