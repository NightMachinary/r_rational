I feel like we don't really get to see the wizarding world accuralty because we see through the eyes of Harry. He barely interacts with other people his own age besides Hermione and Ron.

The wizarding world is probably advancing spellcraft and magical theory all the time, its just that Harry doesn't care about that sort of stuff. I do think though there probably isn't an organization dedicated to systematically progressing magic. In our world we have universities, research groups, and companies all advancing science and technology. The wizarding world has some advancement, but its probably done indipendently by curious wizards

There probably isn't a government sponsored wizard!NASA but I wouldn't be surprised that there is a loosely sffliated group of wizards somewhere who study and explore space or something.
