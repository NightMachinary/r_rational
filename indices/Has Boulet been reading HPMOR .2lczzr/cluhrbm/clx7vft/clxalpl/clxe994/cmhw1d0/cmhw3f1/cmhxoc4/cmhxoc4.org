Okay, so maybe it is useless to go to the moon. It was more of a contention on why Voldy needed to fly at all.

Although if you find a way to summon a hologram (a la dark mark) or even just a very large firework spark at the edge of your vision or at the maximum safe range for apparition then you could apparate to the exact spot indicated by your signal spell. And spells leaving your wand as a beam travel pretty fast if I remember right.

Add something to negate your weight and you can travel at speed of beam + 1/time needed to cast beam + 1/time needed to apparate mph.
