Spells seem to travel at about 80-100 mph based on most calculations I've seen. The moon is 240000 miles away. It would take 3000 hours minimum to get to the moon like that.

I'm not saying it's not doable, there probably is some way to do it, but the sheer distance of the moon makes any of these methods long and tricky.

I'd probably do it with programmed magical items. Send one to fly every mile up, or every ten miles. Then someone could use them as a chain to get to the moon.
