Not Harry then but the broom itself. If it was just an ongoing control interference spell it would be fire and forget but evidently it needs continued casting. So if there was an invisible beam of roughly 100mph speed delivering the spell effect one would always have to point to where the target (the broom) would be once a 100mph particle would have traversed the distance between wand and target. Judging from how beamless spells seem to function in general this is not the case. Though I am curious at what range one can channel effectively instantaneous pain with the Cruciatus curse.
