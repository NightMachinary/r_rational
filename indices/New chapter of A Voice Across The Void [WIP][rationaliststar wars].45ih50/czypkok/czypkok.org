To offer a counterpoint, I think that the focus on a single court's politics is the reason that I check this story for updates so frequently. One of the biggest flaws in the Star Wars EU is that politics happens only on the galactic scale. Exploring what it means for a planet to have a change of regime is really interesting to me.

(The specter of Kreia in the background is laughing at the idea that the planetary politics are somehow separate from galactic politics. But from my point of view, the scope of the plot doesn't have to escalate to cosmic-level-threats in order to be interesting. That is doubly true for stories where there's only 9 published chapters.)
