  Author, please. Please make a story world that I care about, with characters for whom I wish either success or failure.

I understand where you are coming from, but, strange as this may sound, your request is unreasonable. I am writing about a world /I/ care about. This may be a world you care about, but maybe not. It really depends on whether we care about the same things.

I care about court politics and crushes old and new. I care about the experience of being torn apart, having your reason and emotion at odds. I do not care about "taking a level in Badass."

Let me turn your request around. Perhaps /you/ should be the one to write something about a world that you care about. You are the only one who can do it right.
