  ...but please at least acknowledge to yourself that you can lose an audience because of the cultural context of your work, especially this audience.

Acknowledged! Losing a subset of my audience is something I actively desire.

A story is a very personal thing.

I have an ideal reader in mind when I write. Among other things, not only is my ideal reader predisposed to read a bildungsroman -- with its attendant smorgsabord of crushes old and new -- but he/she finds the inter-personal dynamics of a small community interesting. Based on what you wrote above, that reader is very much the opposite of you.

  I was giving out tropes as examples of what your story told me was going to happen, based on the first two chapters.

My ideal reader would be sufficiently well-read to understand how ridiculous it is to say that a story *told* them something was going to happen in the opening chapters. This reader understands that fiction is complicated -- that stories can set up expectations to subvert them -- that stories can touch on a theme only to seemingly abandon it for a while, before coming back again to cast it in a new light.

Hopefully, the reader who is far from my ideal reader will quickly figure out my story isn't for them.

Occasionally, some such person will read on for a while before realizing they won't find much that interests them .

I make no effort to predict or avoid this. Every word is written with my ideal reader in mind.

It isn't that I want you to have a bad time, TimeLoopedPowerGamer -- I do not, honestly. But the quality of your experience is not in my utility function.
