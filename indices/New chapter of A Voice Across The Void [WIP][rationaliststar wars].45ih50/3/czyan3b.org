  This is a very short chapter, mostly because of pacing; the plot needs to inch along slightly before the start of chapter 9.

I've been following the story since chapter one. Since the first couple of chapters, the plot has done little but inch.

That sounds terrible so I'll quickly point out that I do like the story, but not how it's happening. That's why I'm commenting. Hope I have your attention now, because chapters one and two hooked me, and chapters three through eight have almost lost me.

Maybe my thoughts are off and I'm totally off base. But this is my honest reaction so far to the story.

I'm not one to talk about a story having pacing issues. I'm really not. But I am here. Because you mentioned this latest chapter was /for that purpose/, and because I like the idea of what I thought this story was about when I first started reading it. And I'm still not sure I'm wrong about what the story /was/ about.

Author, please. Please make a story world that I care about, with characters for whom I wish either success or failure. This latest drama...does nothing for me. It is a moral issue and a test of character, sure, but I don't /care/ about the MC that much (yet) that it hold my interest whether he fucks up or not.

I care about the setting, because that's always what's interesting in Star Wars. I care about the effects of someone getting Sith training in the Old Republic. I care about the order at large dealing with the loser MC suddenly taking a level in Badass.

I don't care about his new master, the other students (how many of those are there again?), the problems of this planet, or even the MC's old or new crushes. (Take that, Valentine's Day.)

Hell, I cared about the holocron more than I have the MC and his problems so far. This tiny world's tiny problems are tiny. I crave big plots. This guy is going against the entire Jedi Order's teachings. I need that to mean something, soon.

What is the intended promise of this story meant to be? Is it being fulfilled? I don't know. But I do know that I want awesome, and tiny world's tiny court politics is Lucas'ing the awesome out of the story for me.

Hope that reader reaction helps you. Hope you keep writing, even if it isn't something I'll dig.
