I won't argue the validity of my opinions. That's pointless. They're just opinions. But I will point out that, based on your response, I think you misunderstood what I was actually saying.

I'm saying that your story has problems with thematic consistency and audience promises, especially at the start.

--------------

/Theme/ to me is what the setting and characters focus on, ideas that progress and change. This is one way a reader will choose a story, by seeing if it is about ideas or messages that interest them, or if they like they way the narrative style works overall on a totally new idea.

/Audience/ or /reader promises/ are things that are suggested will happen later by the narrative form and focus, or even outright stated by a character; in a skillful story, tropes and themes are played with at the start of a story to entice the reader to continue by promising them resolutions they'll like and a journey they'll enjoy.

--------------

By confirming what you meant to do with the story, you verified my opinion that the start of the story was misleading.

I'm not /just/ asking for my perfect story, with all the things I like--which I don't think is an unreasonable request. Why wouldn't I want that? And if someone doesn't point out what they felt was missing, maybe you don't realize what you were writing wasn't having the effect you thought it was. But let's put that aside.

I'm saying I /thought/ this was a different story. I expected Sith and Jedi Code to collide early and often. I expected a witch hunt for a heretic, a ideological struggle between students and Masters, or a growing Sith crisis and a test of faith between a system of order that hated change, and chaos, freedom, and truth offered by people driven mad by the same.

That was my expectation based on what I initially read. I felt big things were promised by someone being seduced by an ancient Sith device in the first chapter, breaking with the Jedi Code, and striking off with reason and a deeper understanding (maybe) of a part of the Force than anyone else but very skilled Masters of the Order--and that the story was being posted in [[/r/rational]].

I wasn't expecting six chapters of small-+town+ planet court intrigue, or other things you (and others, obviously) seem to like.

--------------

In short, I don't see this story so far as representing a good understanding of the audience you drew with the first two chapters, [[/r/rational]] linking, and this summary:

#+begin_quote
  A padawan comes across an ancient Sith holocron during an archaeological field trip and keeps the discovery secret from his masters.
#+end_quote

The secret hasn't come up /as a secret/ in six chapters. The Masters don't seem to be interacting with him at all anymore, what he did or learned doesn't seem to have mattered, and the holocron hasn't shown up again either. I feel I was promised something and am being given something else. I think, as an author myself, that it is important to give feedback on this sort of thing when public comment is sought.

It also isn't giving me the rational-fic buzz I want. I'm not getting why their plans are smart applications of their skill set. I'm not getting why they are in this situation, what they'll get out of it, and where they think they're ultimately going. I don't see a challenge to be defeated or an objective to be ultimately won. I don't see either the building tension around, or clues to, a larger plot. I feel I was just told /there isn't one/.

And that makes me sad. I thought you should know.

--------------

Write what you want, but please be aware of your audience and what effect your writing has on them.

This has been my story about what I've experienced reading your story. It is what I'd want someone to write about my writing. That's why I was careful to make sure I wasn't misunderstanding something, because I wanted my feedback to be based on the reality of what was actually being written, not my own ideas about a reality not well checked and verified.

Again, I hope you take this as evidence for what it is: an honest reader reaction. If I feel this way about the story, it is unlikely I'm alone. Do with this knowledge what you will.
