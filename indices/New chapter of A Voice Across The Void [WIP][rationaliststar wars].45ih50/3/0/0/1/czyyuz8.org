I hope you'll understand if I don't reply to all of the above.

An opening about a padawan who discovers forbidden teachings may be leading in to a story about using these teachings to grow in strength and overpower all who stand in his way; /or/ it may be leading in to a story about being conflicted about said teachings and having to make genuinely difficult choices to reconcile them; /or/ something else entirely.

It sounds like you became convinced one of these possibilities would take place and grew disappointed when the story turned out to be different than you expected. I'm sorry for it, but the fault is entirely yours for leaping to a conclusion that was not warranted.

  I'm saying I thought this was a different story. I expected Sith and Jedi Code to collide early and often. I expected a witch hunt for a heretic, a ideological struggle between students and Masters, or a growing Sith crisis and a test of faith between a system of order that hated change, and chaos, freedom, and truth offered by people driven mad by the same. That was my expectation based on what I initially read.

I think that is a lot of (oddly specific) things to expect based on a beginning which can really go in multiple directions.
