    /I'm saying I thought this was a different story. I expected Sith and Jedi Code to collide early and often. I expected a witch hunt for a heretic, a ideological struggle between students and Masters, or a growing Sith crisis and a test of faith between a system of order that hated change, and chaos, freedom, and truth offered by people driven mad by the same. That was my expectation based on what I initially read./

  I think that is a lot of (oddly specific) things to expect based on a beginning which can really go in multiple directions.

No, what I was saying wasn't specific items in an inclusive list, any of which I would miss if not included. I used the word "or," which indicates possibly exclusive or partial lists of items. I was attempting to strongly imply these were some of /many/ possible directions within a specific thematic area.

I was giving out tropes as examples of what your story told me was going to happen, based on the first two chapters. I wasn't saying those tropes were the ones I was personally expecting.

You are wrong about what I'm trying to say. You aren't reading what I'm writing. You're dismissing arguments I'm not making, and not echoing back my own arguments but making up your own and then dismissing them in confusing ways. And then there's this.

  It sounds like you became convinced one of these possibilities would take place and grew disappointed when the story turned out to be different than you expected. I'm sorry for it, but the fault is entirely yours for leaping to a conclusion that was not warranted.

This is an incredibly rude way to react to detailed constructive criticism. Also, you appear to be making irrational assumptions as to my goals and motives.

Perhaps you are still reading into later dialog what I first wrote. I'll take one more shot at this, then I think I'm done. If this is a simple misunderstanding, fine. If this is yet another reading comprehension issue with someone on reddit, screw it. Talk to the void for all I care.

I was initially commenting on a work in progress and adding in my own hopes and fears as well as my reaction to what I'd read so far.

Once told it wasn't the sort of story that I was expecting, I explained my reasoning and reactions only, no longer asking for certain results. I explained why I subjectively felt what I did. I explained how, objectively, my experience was one that could and should be avoided by a writer.

You are failing to respond to that in a way that shows you've even read and understood what I've written, while acting like you have.

I'm not sure I can care any further how you deal with it, but please at least acknowledge to yourself that you can lose an audience because of the cultural context of your work, especially /this/ audience. Being aware of who your audience is and how they'll react is important, and should shape the way you write. I don't see any glimmer of understanding of that from how you're responding here.
