  If I feel this way about the story, it is unlikely I'm alone.

You are not alone. I too feel like the story has yet to deliver on its implicit promises. That said, I still maintain enough of an interest to continue reading, and there is potential for the current plot to resolve in an interesting way.

Take for example the end of the previous chapter: I think that it can be classified as what [[/u/ZoltanBerrigomo]] calls "having your reason and emotion at odds", which fits with what I expect from a [[/r/rational]] fic about a Jedi having a crisis of faith (among other things). Of course that particular instance can more accurately be described as crushing victory of emotion over reason, but you can't deny that they're technically at odds in the scene.

Perhaps this whole current plot is building up to re-examination of Jedi stance on detachment and how the situation would have developed if the protagonist didn't have an attack of hormone-induced motivated cognition. Perhaps we will see a more thorough exploration of utilitarian ethics and consequentialism, and how actions that make one feel like a monstrous villain can still be the best course of action from a wider perspective, not to mention how the dark side of the Force factors into this. It looks to me like [[/u/ZoltanBerrigomo]] /is/ interested in all of that, so I'm mildly optimistic.
