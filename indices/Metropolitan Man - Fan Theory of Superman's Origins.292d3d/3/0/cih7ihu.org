He's incredibly close to human baseline in all respects save the superpowers. Leveled-up human seems the most reasonable hypothesis. Going on the assumption that it's impossible to have this level of technology available in the world for over 20 years without some organization having used it for massive political advantage, it must be a tech that was not developed by any current humans. The story casts a dim view on Superman's claimed "alien" origin story (and I personally agree it's rather outlandish, altho sufficiently-advanced-tech etc). If non-human is discarded as a hypothesis, non-current is the next best thing.
