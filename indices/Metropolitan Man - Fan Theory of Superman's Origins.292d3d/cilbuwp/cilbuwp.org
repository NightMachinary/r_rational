/Spoilers for the most recent chapter./

I know I'm late to the party, but I wanted to get more information about Superman's ship before I made my suggestion.

So the choice and construction of Superman's powers, especially the X-ray vision that isn't based on radiation but still can't see through lead, seems too arbitrary yet specific to be some naturally occurring accident (leading us to discard the default comic book origin story). The fact that the ship seems clearly designed for its ultimate cargo suggests his actual travel wasn't an accident either (so probably no time travel mishap, sorry).

My pet theory so far is that Superman is a test. He seems to have been purposefully designed to have every reasonable physical enhancement possible, along with all of the subconscious neural machinery required to finely control all of these enhancements, but no cognitive enhancements of any kind. I would expect any race with the ability to "supe up" the human form like that to know and understand not only the inherent cognitive flaws and limitations of the current human brain, but also how to fix them.

Whoever crafted Superman clearly had deep understanding of the human mind in order to give him the ability to control these powers (unless we are assuming this control is already possible with the existing machinery, which I find more unbelievable than this, but nonetheless still plausible), yet they took care to keep his mind working in exactly the same way a normal human's does otherwise. Why? I think he was sent by an alien race as some kind of test. As to what kind of test, I have two ideas.

First, if this race doesn't particularly find high value in the mere existence of human-level intelligence in the universe, this could be a cultural experiment. Can this particular human culture raise and train one of its own /not/ to be an iron-fisted despot that takes over the planet when given such a massive physical advantage over the strength (physical, technological, and tactical) of the entire rest of the race?

If the race /does/ value humanity's existence, Superman could be a test of another kind. He may be a representation of the potential power each human will have available with technological advancements occurring as rapidly as they are (due in no small part to people like Luthor himself). I'm thinking in a vein similar to the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter][Great Filter]]. Or, more directly related, perhaps in the process of passing through the Great Filter, this race permanently destroyed something it found vital (its home planet, or maybe even its entire home star system). In providing this challenge early in the form of Superman, it may be hoping to stop humanity from making the same mistake by bringing the Filter early.
