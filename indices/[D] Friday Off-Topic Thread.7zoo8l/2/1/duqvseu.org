Our odds improved somewhat with the end of the Cold War. Nonetheless, there are some practical ways in which the odds of humanity's continued existence can be improved.

- Remember that history is made by people. Pick your favourite historical character, someone who had a dramatic effect on the world - whether Albert Einstein, Mahatma Ghandi, Nelson Mandela or J.R.R. Tolkein. Each of them was /just one person/. Now, remember that when anyone tells you that /just one person/ can't make a difference. Exactly /how/ you can do that in your current circumstances depends a lot on what your current circumstances are.

- You're looking at the long term. In general, to best improve the odds of people surviving over the long term, the aim is to ensure that future generations of people are educated, intelligent, and generally content with their lot - that is, they have their basic physical needs covered. If you have some way of helping to ensure this, then go for it.

- Small remarks can have a surprisingly large effect. One possible way to encourage humanity to move to the stars is to start and push a suitable meme - this might encourage more people to move into space-related fields, or study relevant technologies. It's a small thing, but it tilts the odds a little more in the desired direction...
