I just had a potentially-interesting (depending on execution, of course) idea.

A lot of mythology has ageless, extraordinarily long-lived, and even straight-up immortal characters. Imagine being one of these characters at the dawn of civilization. The humans are creating all sorts of neat things, and spreading over world, and waging wars, and telling stories, all all sorts of cool stuff. So you start interacting with them; giving out divine boons and choosing favored avatars and maybe sleeping around

But after a few thousand years of civilization, it starts seeming old-hat. Sure, the humans are still creating new stuff, migrating everywhere, and waging wars. But there's a cyclical pattern to it, and you're beginning to get bored. Maybe you make deep emotional connections with specific humans, but they die after only a few decades, and eventually you're just humaned-out, and retreat to the spirit realm, or heaven, or hell, or the space-between-worlds, or wherever you're from.

Not every mythological being does that at the same time, and perhaps some never truly leave. But after hundreds of years, the vast majority disappear, and humans are left in a world of (mostly) pure logic and cold reason.

And then, the singularity.

Suddenly, things are getting really, really weird, really really fast. And that piques your interest. Plus, this "biological immortality" thing means individual humans will actually be around for an appreciable timescale...

So we have a post-singularity world, and also there's magic. There are infinitely many possible cool stories to write in such a world, but we have finite time (barring immortality and the removal of entropy) so what kinds of stories would you want to hear?
