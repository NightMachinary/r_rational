I will +1 everyone saying get a couple trusted people who read your work, and listen to their feedback. But completely ignore the one-way noise from comments, reviews, etc. If it disturbs you, maybe write a plugin that will hide the comment section?

I think it's essential in any feedback like that to have a two-directional discussion. If you can't talk, or at least exchange emails, there's no point.
