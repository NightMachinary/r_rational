Not an author, but as a reader: Whenever I see somebody bluntly criticizing/shitting on an author's work in their own subreddit/thread or one they've just taken the time to comment in ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/7y5u38/shade_46_parahumans_2/due10hh/][this recent one of Wildbow's comes to mind]], or [[https://www.reddit.com/r/bakker/comments/7st55f/entertain_us_not_yourself/][this thread posted to R Scott Bakker's sub]]), I get really angry. I have to imagine most reasonably empathetic people have a negative reaction to people who do that. So I would suggest something which may not on the face of it appear healthy, but which I think maybe actually is: Get annoyed; or get irritated; tell yourself "this person is socially inept, or a troll, or the kind of person that leaves YouTube comments, or at the least an uncomfortable embarrassment to many people reading this." You'll almost always be correct, except in the rarest instances of delicately phrased, positive feedback.

Think maybe despite the poster's social miscarriages there's useful feedback somewhere in there for you? - maybe. But it won't be useful to you if it gets you down, and unsolicited and read when you are not mining comments for it, there is no reason to derail what you were getting from comments to switch tracks to those laid by this idiot commenter. It is a kind of crossing of boundaries, to come into an author's space and say unwelcomed things which would be rude to say in person. In person you may be hesitant to say "Yeah thanks, shut up." But in your own head, it just may help you improve in disregarding these people's words.
