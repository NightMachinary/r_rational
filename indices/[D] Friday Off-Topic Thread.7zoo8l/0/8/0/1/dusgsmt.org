Perspective. It's not realistic to expect any given story to please every reader, and given enough readers, some of them are going to go as far as to react as if they have been personally wronged.

However, given some of the clarification that OP later provided, "unreasonably negative feedback" seems less directly relevant. Though, I do still feel the issue is one of perception, stemming from a desire to keep everyone pleased to an unreasonably comprehensive extent. (At least, that's my armchair speculation on the matter.)
