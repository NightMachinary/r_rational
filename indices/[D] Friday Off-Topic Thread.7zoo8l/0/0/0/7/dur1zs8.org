For what it's worth, I read one late chapter of Worth The Candle at some point to see if I should binge it (that's how I got into /A Practical Guide/), and I immediately realized it wouldn't be the kind of fiction I liked and moved on. (so I was a little surprised when it turned out you were the one writing it)

And... I dunno, I'm glad I didn't stick by it? I know if I had, I would be perpetually annoyed by it and have the urge to criticize and nitpick everything, and not in a fun way. I'm not sure if there's any morale to be found here, except that apparently the different things you write appeal to different audiences.
