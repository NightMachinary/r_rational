Darn, I completely missed this.

  And then I look at 22 hours, and I think that's actually still a lot of time, and it feels even worse when someone says that it was a waste of their time. I don't understand the mentality that allows people to sink that much time into something that they're not happy with, and it makes me feel weird and uncomfortable to know that I had a small role in that terrible decision on their part. Wasting a day of your life on something that only kind of interested you, that you kept churning through because you felt like you had to get to the end, when you were under no actual compulsion to do so, when there are millions of other things out there you could have been trying instead ... I don't know. It gets to me sometimes. Like I'm a rock that ships are dashing themselves on for no clear reason.

I prefer [[/u/wassname]]'s mental imagery above. I think when you're already in a mopey mood, it's easy to fall into negative perspectives. But if you tilt your view a bit, the net enjoyment created by your story outweighs /by far/ the net disappointment of a few naysayers who stuck with it. Say we used the unreliable stat of Kudos on AO3: even if we account for the unreliability, that's likely more than a thousand people * 22 hours of enjoyment = a lot of time people have spent on something you created. And you've already reached more people than the hours you've spent writing.

Neither is it your responsibility to satisfy everyone who /chose/ to invest their time into reading your story. It's kind of like saying that "not everyone in the world likes me, but if I were just slightly different in this way, then maybe they would like to spend time with me." I'd say it's unhealthily egotistical to feel that guilt. After the latest WtC chapters, I can even see vague parallels between this and Uther's dilemma. It's a treacherous road when you have to worry about every negative consequence (however minor) to something you've produced with positive intentions.
