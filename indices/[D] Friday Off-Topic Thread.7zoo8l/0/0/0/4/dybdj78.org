On the other hand, imagine thousands of people staring at your mural for 22 hours straight because they enjoy it. Sure we don't say anything - we're just lurking in the forest. But, at a minimum, we enjoyed it enough to spend 22 hours on it. Hours we could have spent chatting, watching, or reading millions of other things.
