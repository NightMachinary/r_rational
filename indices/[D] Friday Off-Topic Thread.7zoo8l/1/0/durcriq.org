I think you could tell an interesting story about humanity confronting something cosmically larger than itself, and also having to reconcile how that has influenced its own development. It'd be a story where the Singularity ceases to be the ultimate goal and becomes just the new status quo that faces disruption by unexpected revelations.

Honestly, I think it could make a really interesting satire of modern philosophical conflicts. We've built a civilization and culture that seemed reasonably good and continuously optimizing, only to confront new problems that we hadn't considered and realize how little we still know about ourselves. Many are no longer confident that civilization has been on the right track.

The reappearance of magic after the Singularity could be a good metaphor for how many of us feel that the world has turned upside down over the past few years and so much of what we believed about the world, including our place in it, turned out to not be as clear as we thought. Now we have to figure out what to do with what we have before everything we built falls apart.
