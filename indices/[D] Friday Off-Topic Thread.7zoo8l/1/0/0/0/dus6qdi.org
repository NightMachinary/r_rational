Well I don't really do "philosophy" but it would be a good way to expand my writing horizons... Tell you what, I'll schedule ~1-2 hours tomorrow night to try to write a vert short story (1k to 2k words, probably) about the topic, and probably post it as a oneshot to spacebattles and AO3. Hopefully I won't dissapoint!
