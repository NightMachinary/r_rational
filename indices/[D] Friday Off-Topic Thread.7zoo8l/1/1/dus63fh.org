  Not every mythological being does that at the same time, and perhaps some never truly leave. But after hundreds of years, the vast majority disappear, and humans are left in a world of (mostly) pure logic and cold reason.

  And then, the singularity.

  Suddenly, things are getting really, really weird, really really fast. And that piques your interest. Plus, this "biological immortality" thing means individual humans will actually be around for an appreciable timescale...

  So we have a post-singularity world, and also there's magic. There are infinitely many possible cool stories to write in such a world, but we have finite time (barring immortality and the removal of entropy) so what kinds of stories would you want to hear?

Sounds like being a Perpetual during the early Age of Strife/late Golden Age of Technology.
