Nah. From my pre-digitized perspective, my digitized self is still me (assuming it's a high-fidelity digitalization.) Of course, my digitized self and my post-digitized meatspace body aren't the same people, but there's only a 50% chance I'm stuck being the meat body, and I can bring that percentage arbitrarily low by digitizing myself a whole bunch of times.
