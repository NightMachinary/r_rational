Something I'm struggling with recently is kinda feeling like humanity doesn't have much of a chance at an extreme long future. Anything past the end of our solar system. There are various reasons for this, but the basics is a combination of worry around the great filter and a general feeling that extremely destructive tech is getting cheaper and easier to use.

Basically how do we get through the next couple thousand years without either killing all of us or destroying civilization. I'm confident that if we can manage that humanity's probably destined for at least another million, but I'm not happy with our odds. Do we need to actually move to avoid certain technology. Is there bad information? I'm generally pretty optimistic but I'm feeling like I'm loosing that optimism. Any advice from anyone? Should I just not worry about such distant dangers? I feel 50 to a hundred years is probably going to continue with an upward trajectory so maybe it doesn't mater that humanity will probably never make it to the stars.
