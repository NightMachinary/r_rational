[[/r/changemyview][r/changemyview]] might be a good place to go. I'd like to help, but I'm struggling with self loathing over being a product and enabler of a culture of wealthy straight white men abusing, exploiting, discriminating, and otherwise dehumanizing people so I'm not sure how useful I'd be or how healthy it'd be for me to confront this source of debilitating anxiety in this way.
