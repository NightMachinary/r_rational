Completely fair, I wouldn't want you to review it if that is your headspace, either!

I didn't really think much about content warnings in my story but I really should have a content warning for "discussion of slavery" or something. The book doesn't have racism, at least I don't think it does and have tried hard to make sure it doesn't, so I suppose I should explicitly say like "no racist content" or something?

Thanks for the subreddit suggestion. I'm not sure what view I want changed though, so I'm struggling to think of a way to post it on the forum without it being "change my view: slavery is awesome". I mean I suppose I could do... "change my view: i should write about slavery in my novel".... still doesn't seem to be what the forum is for though.
