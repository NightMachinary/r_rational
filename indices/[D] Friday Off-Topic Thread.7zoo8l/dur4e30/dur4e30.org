I'm struggling with something I'm writing (OK, something I wrote about a year ago) and I want someone to hash it out with me. It's not a "how can I make magic that is self-consistent" sort of question, it's a "how do I deal with this moral problem in a sensitive way?" sort of question.

Anyone want to help me out? It does not require much reading (like, you don't have to read a whole novel; just like the three quarters of a page that deals with the Tricky Issue).

It's about slavery, so I would especially appreciate any African-American perspectives that might be on this forum / lurking this forum or failing that, someone who is au fait with a lot of those issues (SJW style I guess?). Or... is there a subreddit that I could use to find someone like this?
