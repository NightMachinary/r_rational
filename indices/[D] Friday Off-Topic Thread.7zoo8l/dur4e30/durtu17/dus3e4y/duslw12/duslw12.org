Human slavery exists in all nations, even now.

The difference is between nations whose governments officially sanction it versus those who are against it... but crime still exists everywhere.

If the moral dilemma involves the act itself and speaking to survivors of it, you're 150 years too late. If it involves cultural issues about the descendants of such, good luck to you, though I don't see how that would matter to your magic system unless it involves necromancy, mind control, or some weird bloodline magic.
