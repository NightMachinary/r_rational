What you're saying and what I'm hearing don't match up.

I am hearing: "I don't want to offend American blacks." What this says to me is that you're approaching the issues from an overtly racial viewpoint. So much for colorblindness.

I am also hearing: "I plan to pay indulgences if necessary." As though writing about things that have the potential to offend certain people is a sin that must be paid for. So much for art.
