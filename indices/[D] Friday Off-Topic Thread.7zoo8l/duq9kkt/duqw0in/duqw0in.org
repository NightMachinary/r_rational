âˆž isn't a single value. In many applications, it can be considered merely 'bigger than the biggest number you can think of', but there are circumstances in which some forms of infinity are /distinctly/ larger than others; and when you're mixing infinities and zeroes, then things can happen that might seem unexpected.
