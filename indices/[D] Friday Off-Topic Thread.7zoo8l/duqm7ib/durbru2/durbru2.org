I'm super late to this and haven't read the other responses, but the best advice I've heard from a creative is that there are people who won't like you make and /you don't want them to like it/. The source was Caleb Stokes on his podcast The Mixed Six, while discussing playtesting a game he had designed. He realized that he was making his art for a certain audience and decided to stop worrying about people who didn't want the experience he was offering.
