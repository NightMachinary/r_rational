Do you do the thing where negative feedback registers as meteorites impacting the soil of your soul, but compliments are merely a pleasant breeze blowing by? I struggle with that--with being much more willing to doubt complements than criticisms, or (similarly) with spending much more time attending to negative feedback. Positive feedback is less actionable, after all.

If that is what you are struggling with, it might be a good idea to spend more time contemplating the positive feedback you've received. People love your stories. You could approach it like complements are mysteries to be solved--their true reasons for loving your works are in many ways as mysterious and poorly reported as criticisms. I also want to add that if someone likes your work for a reason different than the reason you wrote it, that is still something worth celebrating (I think). Having a positive effect on another person is remarkable, especially if it is apparently by accident.

As for responding to criticism... Hmm. I think you are right, but still... discussing your intent with at least a few people is probably beneficial. You can go to a trusted third party and ask them if they understand a criticism of your work, or if the criticism has merit in the first place. That would allow you to detect spurious criticisms and also reduce the emotional strain of figuring out legitimate criticisms.

That's all I've got, I hope it helps. Ah, well, you should also know that your excellent writing made me (and probably others) hesitate to offer advice. It feels like a rowboat advising a cruise ship, and it's not like I really know how to handle negative feedback either.
