It sometimes feels like I'm making this giant mural on the side of the road, ten feet tall and eighty feet wide, with these big, complex, dominating shapes, a woman draped across the forest floor, a fox slinking by her, a boxy generator covered in moss, all in huge proportions.

And then someone wanders by, spends a few seconds taking it in, and says, "The proportions on that woman are kind of wonky". And it's just /so/ deflating, because I spent all this time, and out of everything that I was trying to express, that was what they saw. And if I think they're wrong, then there's nothing that I can actually do except try to figure out what made them say that, and sometimes there's no good answer -- and I'll just feel like I'm trying to fix a problem that's not actually there. And if they're /right/ then I either have to redo the whole fucking thing, or just scrap it and then go paint a different mural somewhere else, because it's going to take nearly as much time to fix the proportions as it did to just paint the woman in the first place. Or finish it, and live with the fact that it's imperfect, and hope that every time someone new sees it they don't circle back to the woman and her slightly off proportions.

Or someone will come along and say, "Eh, I don't really like foxes" as though I've wasted their time by painting a thing with foxes in it, and out of everything that I've made, their focus immediately went to the fox, and that was the thing that they chose to comment on. I want to shake them and tell them that I'm not making this mural for /them,/ I'm making it for people who will see this thing that I'm imperfectly trying to express, or failing that, at least for the people who can enjoy a fox.

Or someone will say, "I'm normally really into this sort of thing, but it just didn't do it for me, I don't know", and that always feels like failure. I only managed to transmit a fraction of what I wanted to that person, and that person is likely to be the exact sort of person that the mural was /for/ in the first place. It was put up where everyone could see it, but it wasn't for everyone, and of the small group of people that were actually meant to enjoy it, I lost this one person because I screwed up somewhere at doing the thing that I feel like I was most driven to do.

Except it's not just one or two people giving their complaints, it's a bunch of them, and some of them are coming to the cafe and sitting down at my table when I'm not even working on my murals, because they want to tell me directly how much they didn't like my mural.

Some of it is helpful -- maybe even most. Sometimes someone tells you that the proportions on the woman are off when she's just an outline in pencil, and you can fix it. Or someone will point out that the fox has a reflection in one eye but not the other, and you can fix that in a matter of minutes. And other times it's stuff that can't be fixed, or can't be fixed easily, or is just a matter of taste.

And sometimes people aren't even talking to me, they're talking to other people they're viewing the mural with, and it only feels personal because they're talking about something personal in such an impersonal way.

I think last time I calculated my writing speed for prose, it was about 500 words per hour, though it kind of varies depending on what I'm writing and how intensely I'm in the zen of it. That means that something like /Worth the Candle/ is quickly approaching a thousand hours of my life (so far), which breaking down the math, seems more or less accurate.

If the average person reads 300 words per minute (probably low-balling it), that means that they can get through 400,000 words in about 22 hours of reading.

I think about those numbers a fair amount -- how comparatively easy it is to consume, versus how hard it is to produce.

And then I look at 22 hours, and I think that's actually still a lot of time, and it feels even worse when someone says that it was a waste of their time. I don't understand the mentality that allows people to sink that much time into something that they're not happy with, and it makes me feel weird and uncomfortable to know that I had a small role in that terrible decision on their part. Wasting a day of your life on something that only kind of interested you, that you kept churning through because you felt like you had to get to the end, when you were under no actual compulsion to do so, when there are millions of other things out there you could have been trying instead ... I don't know. It gets to me sometimes. Like I'm a rock that ships are dashing themselves on for no clear reason.

I've just been bummed out today. Sorry for the rant.
