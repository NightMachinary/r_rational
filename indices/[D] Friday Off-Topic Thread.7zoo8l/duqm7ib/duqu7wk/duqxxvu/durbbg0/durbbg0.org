Is this generally criticism that you feel is important to read, where your issue is not being able to be dispassionate, or is this a case where filtering it out before you heard of it would be an acceptable (if not ideal) solution? If it is a mix, how would you partition it?

I think it's obvious that, at least on [[/r/rational]], your work is overwhelmingly viewed favourably. It is not obvious to me that your aversion to responding to criticism allows you to have significant direct impact on the critic in most cases, though I did appreciate [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7vxian/rtwip_worth_the_candle_ch_7274/dtwnxut/][that time you replied to mine]]. It does not seem to me that this sums up to the advantages of exposing yourself to the minority critical view being worth your discomfort. You are certainly an exceptionally talented writer; you don't /need/ a correcting hand.
