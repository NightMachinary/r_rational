Thank you for the thorough reply. The metaphor was illuminating in particular, but I'm going to address the math first. Incidentally, the math really proves the "rowboat vs cruise ship" thing I was talking about.

It looks like you need at least 36 readers to break even on 'time spent writing' vs 'time spent reading'. I think most of the time you can trust readers to quit reading if they aren't enjoying themselves, but in those cases where you can't, for every reader above number 36 who enjoys your story you can justify one reader who doesn't. That's a bar you easily pass. Hundreds of people upvote posts of your stories on the [[/r/rational][r/rational]]. Your stories are a net positive.

Beyond that, I don't think it makes sense to judge your writing this way. You probably gain some things from writing it independent of readership, so it's not like time spent writing is a pure cost. Furthermore, the readers who claim to hate it probably enjoy hating it. They are getting exactly what they signed up for, so I wouldn't worry about them too much. They aren't ships dashing themselves on the rocks, they are surfers who don't fear the violence of the waves. You can't feel responsible for them being in the water, or for them not being carried along by your work--the former is their fault, the latter is an inevitable accident of the circumstances they willingly accept.

You've made something apparent to me. I only write short stories thus far, and I only let five or so people read them before they are complete. I trust those five people, a lot, and I take their criticisms to heart. Your ongoing fiction allows people to provide feedback much earlier in the process than I would allow, and I can see that it has a cost. Thank you for making your incomplete work available for us. You know, most people making murals set up ropes to prevent passerby from interrupting. Perhaps you really should stop looking at criticisms?

I really like the mural metaphor. These people who chase you down to insult your mural aren't standing in front of the mural. They ran away from it. It looks like they aren't interested in the work, they're interested in the artist's reaction to their opinion. They have to run quite a ways to be heard, or so it seems. The artist, in that case, is likely the only person listening to them.

Another thing: long after you've gone onto bigger and better murals, and indeed even if you ever quit making murals, this mural will still be there. It will catching the eyes of passerby and inspiring discussion long past the time you are paying close attention to what people are saying.

Finally, it's valid to feel bummed out when people don't like your work. But, in the interest of evenness, why not be joyful when people like your work? I'll note I read each chapter of /Worth the Candle/ two or three times and not once have I felt the need to criticize it. It's really good.

I didn't say anything about the mural I went out of my way to walk by so many times. It was really good.
