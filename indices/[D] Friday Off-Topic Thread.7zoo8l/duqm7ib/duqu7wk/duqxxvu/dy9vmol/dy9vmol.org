  And it's just so deflating, because I spent all this time, and out of everything that I was trying to express, that was what they saw.

Hmm; I don't know about that.

If someone has bothered to read your story up to this point, rather than giving up after a single chapter, well, they've almost certainly had /tons/ of thoughts about it. 99% of people won't ever "hate-read" a text; they continuously measure the effort required to continue reading vs. the reward they're getting out of it, and if the reward isn't /still/ worth it, they stop reading, /and/ stop participating in the related community. They just drift away.

So, when one of these people finishes reading everything you've written so far, and all they have to say is some superficial critique about something they noticed in the latest chapter---that's not because that's /all/ they have to say. That they're still here, by itself, says a lot.

No; what's happening is that you've emotionally affected them, and they're now too /shy/ to share their real feelings about your work, because those feelings feel too fresh and deep to be something they're comfortable talking about with anyone, let alone the creator.

Look at the average fandom of a work on Tumblr. Those people talking to each-other gushing about how much they love a work, squeeing and dying and whatever else? Those are the small percentage of people who are somehow immune to the entirely-normal human reaction of "reverence anxiety." They're exceptional in that way; we think such behaviour strange enough to point it out.

But for every one person who consumes art and then shares their feelings about it, there are many more people who consume art and then hide their feelings. For every one Beatles "fan", there are hundreds of people who have Beatles songs on their phone.

What would one of those people who has The Beatles on their phone say, if they were asked about a particular song? They wouldn't tell you their /feelings/ about it, surely. They'd maybe share trivia about it, or some little thing they noticed.

And if, instead of The Beatles (who society says "is good" whether you think so or not), it was a local indie band? And you were /at/ their show, and they had just performed a new song? Well, you don't know any trivia---they just performed the song for the first time---so you've only got things you've noticed. And, since they're not universally venerated as above cultural reproach, some little /negative/ thing you've noticed is on the table. It might help them! You'd sure love to help them! Because of all those feelings you'd never tell them in a million years!

Or, to put all that another way: a priest will never be told he's doing a good job by the members of his congregation. But he will almost certainly have it pointed out if he has his collar untucked. Because you, as such a member, would want him to look his best for the other members. Just as if you were his mother.
