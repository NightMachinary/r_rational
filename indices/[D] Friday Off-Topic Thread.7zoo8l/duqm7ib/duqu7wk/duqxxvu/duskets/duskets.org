Well, let me just say that Worth the Candle is the best online fiction I've ever seen --- head and shoulders above the rest. Just incredibly good. When I read it I waved between appreciation of how good it is, jealousy of your talent, and gratitude that you're producing something so personal. Can't thank you enough.
