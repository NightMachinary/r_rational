Unless I'm misunderstanding, it sounds like you are reading negative feedback and trying to translate it into critique. Have you considered picking up a few beta readers, or even after the fact readers, just some people you trust to give you honest and helpful feedback? There's probably something virtuous about always listening to negative feedback about your work, whatever spirit it's offered in, and trying to take something useful from it, but it's not clear that the tiny marginal value of the actually useful feedback is worth the cost in being upset or bummed out. Where hand-picked readers/crit groups let you find people who have a high usefulness/harmfulness ratio.

Some people who give negative feedback are genuinely trying to help and are bad at it. Some people are just trying to express that they Didn't Like Thing--I don't think people see much difference between going on [[/r/MarvelMovies][r/MarvelMovies]] and saying "ugh Black Panther sucked I hated the CGI!" and saying something similar about a web serial where the author is literally right there in the reddit thread. Listening to the latter group seems like a recipe for frustration and failure.
