I think my problem is more about my emotional response to the negative feedback than it is about being able to take feedback in, separate the wheat from the chaff, and get something constructive out of it. This is especially the case when it's something personal, rather than professional -- I don't think I ever got a code review back and got bummed that there were bad comments and things that I had to fix, because I don't think I've ever written code that I actually cared about (or at least, not submitted said code for code review).
