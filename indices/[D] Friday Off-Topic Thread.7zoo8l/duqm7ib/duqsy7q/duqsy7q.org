  Any advise for dealing with negative feedback
#+end_quote

Personally, I'm an inexperienced writer, so I respond to all feedback /period/ with the intention of getting people to feel "heard" so they give more feedback in the future, negative or positive. The idea being that even people somehow less experienced than me provide valuable data that I can use to improve myself.

On the flipside, you're not [inexperienced]. Also, you have a fairly large readerbase. So there's going to inevitably be "noise," where you have feedback that purports to be helpful (and indeed, may even be polite, well thought out, and given with good intentions), but isn't. So instead, excluding the genuinely high-value pieces of feedback from other experienced writers, treat feedback as more of a statistic. One random complaining about how plot point x didn't make sense is just one random. Several randoms doing that likely indicate that there's some structural deficiency in how you presented x, even if x itself actually made perfect sense because of reasons y and z.

And while there's no accounting for taste, people who "just didn't like" something still have valid opinions. Not in the sense that you should have changed that something to be what they wanted (because then you'd just have another contingent of your readership complaining), but in the sense that these people aren't feeling catered to for whatever reason, and if you think you can identify what that group of people want to see, and can afford to cater to those people without pissing off everyone else, maybe you can slip in some discrete fanservice (so to speak.)

You have the genuine "haters" who aren't constructive and generally just want to make a mess. There's always the danger, as an artist, of getting your head stuck so far up your ass that any and everyone who disagrees is a "hater," but I doubt you personally are at risk for that, so if you assess someone to be a "hater," chances are you're probably right.
