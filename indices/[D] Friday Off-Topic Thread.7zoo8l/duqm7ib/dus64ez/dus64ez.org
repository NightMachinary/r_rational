How about making a metaphorical processing factory for the reviews, and only paying more personal attention to the end-result of the said factory, instead of the reviews themselves?

The reviews you're interested in get dropped into the first sector of the factory, where they get decomposed \ disassembled into component units; and these units themselves get sorted into specific categories. Biggest categories being “positive” and “negative” review sections, with smaller categories \ sections like “boring writing style”, “insightful”, “motivating”, “plot holes”, etc.

From here on out, an individual handling approach can be devised for each of the smallest categories, depending on its specific properties.

For instance:

- toxic criticism → just discard them

- unfixable plot holes → 1) keep them in mind for future works and 2) discard the new incoming review blocks like this about this particular plot hole after stage 1 has been completed

- fixable plot holes → look for ways to fix them and fix them

- vague criticism → 1) collect them together to try and synthesize them into something more meaningful, using them all as context for each other. 2) show them to other writers for fresh qualified opinions

  - vague criticism of the "I'm normally really into this sort of thing, but it just didn't do it for me, I don't know" variety → collect them together and show to the active interested audience for some possible insight, every once in a while

- positive review parts → 1) use them as “eye bleach” after working with negative review parts 2) look for unintended positive outcomes and try to replicate them

- negative review parts the accuracy of which is hard to determine due to their subjective matter → view them as statistical data \ audience response polling data

And so on.

There are only so many things that a review can be talking about, and once enough reviews get disassembled like this, it should become rather easy and quick to deal with new incoming reviews. /And/ it will not require as much energy emotionally, since there are specific protocols in place for “handling the potentially hazardous” materials.
