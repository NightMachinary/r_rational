Any advice for dealing with negative feedback? I keep finding myself really bummed out by it, to the point where my wife was asking me why I was in such a bad mood.

I've been trying to disassemble what's /really/ bothering me, and trying to split it out into different categories, but they're fuzzy categories, because things like "this is bad execution" and "this is not to my tastes" can have a significant amount of overlap, and there's also a good chance that the person responding hasn't actually identified their real objection, which results in this confused negativity.

(I think it's usually a mistake for creators to respond to criticism, especially in terms of prose fiction, where there's a large amount of interpretation. 99% of the time it comes off as defensive (which it is, because a work is being defended) and when it doesn't, it brings in too much that's outside the work itself -- you can't patch a plot hole that exists within a work through WoG, in my opinion, and you especially can't/shouldn't reveal the message that you intended to convey but were unable to.)
