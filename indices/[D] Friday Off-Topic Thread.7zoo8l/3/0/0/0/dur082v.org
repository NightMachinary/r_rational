If you're not willing to describe the actual problem, I don't think we can help you. Maybe a math, or rather, statistics, sub (MathOverflow, actually) can help you better. Even then, I think they'll ask you to describe the real problem.

As for the problem itself, I think you should be asking why you have singularities in the first place, and why they're going to infinity instead of one. That suggests to me that you screwed up your model and are pretty far off track.
