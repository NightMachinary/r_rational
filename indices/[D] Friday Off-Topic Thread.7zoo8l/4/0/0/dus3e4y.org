  perspectives of people with first hand experience with slavery
#+end_quote

Unfortunately, I'm not sure how many of those people are likely going to have access to the internet to answer my question and I'm not going to be able to book a flight to Mauritania any time soon.

My logic behind the specific request was due to the American-centric nature of what I'm writing (the human love interest is American and has a family history as like "civil war heroes" and whatnot), I'd appreciate the perspective of people who have a more first-hand knowledge of the social issues that remain in American society/etc.

Also, it's unlikely that actual victims of slavery would read my novel unless it got to Harry Potter levels of fame, but pretty likely that an African-American would. If the novel got to Harry Potter levels of fame I'd make sure to donate some large sum of money to a relevant charity (and I'm planning on donating a small sum of money to a relevant charity by way of thanks for the review).
