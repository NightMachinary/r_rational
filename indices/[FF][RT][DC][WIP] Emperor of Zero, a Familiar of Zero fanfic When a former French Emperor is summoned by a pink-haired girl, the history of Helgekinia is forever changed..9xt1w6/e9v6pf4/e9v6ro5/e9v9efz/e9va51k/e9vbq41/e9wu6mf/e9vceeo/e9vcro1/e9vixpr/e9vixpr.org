Perhaps something like Discontinued then. The poster can always say it advance after posting. A lot of really great rational fics haven't been completed, it's sad to think that I might not have gotten to know them in the first place if I saw the Dead tag and decided it isn't worth my time to invest on. And who knows, seeing an influx of interest the creator might even get set out on continuing the story again. I feel it is detrimental overall to discourage people from possibly reading something they might love.
