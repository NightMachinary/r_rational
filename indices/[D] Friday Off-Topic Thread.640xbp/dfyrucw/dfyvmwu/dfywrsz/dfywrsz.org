  how much are you getting as a stipend?
#+end_quote

Nada, unless I'm very mistaken about something and have missed an email somewhere. Student loans and work-study all the way.

  As for more generic advice, you can check out threads like these on [[/r/gradschool][r/gradschool]].

  If you really want your own place w/ no flatmates, you could also look into seeing how much you can afford to skimp out on going into campus,

Huh. Do you know how I could find that out without asking? "I'm wondering how often I'm going to actually need to come to campus" would probably give the wrong impression.
