Congrats!

Housing suggestions in the Bay are pretty budget-dependent -- how much are you getting as a stipend? The usual approach for grad students is, in my experience, to send an email out to your department listserv (or have your advisor or the department head or w/e send one out) asking if anyone needs a roommate (and introducing yourself etc.). Another alternative would be to post on your university's grad student/dept facebook group (or look for similar posts there). You have a bit more assurance that you won't be living with any super awful people, insofar as grad school admissions serve to filter them out.

If you really want your own place w/ no flatmates, you could also look into seeing how much you can afford to skimp out on going into campus, e.g. one of my labmates (in a computational evolutionary anthropology/biology lab) lives 1.5h away and only comes in ~2 days a week. Though it sounds like you don't mind somewhat cramped conditions!

As for more generic advice, you can check out [[https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/search?q=what+do+you+wish&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all][threads like these]] on [[/r/gradschool][r/gradschool]]. For myself, I wish I had started learning C++ sooner, as well as read a few books and watched a few MOOCs earlier than I actually had. Dunno how applicable that would be to your program/projects!
