  I care that over this the world is deciding to tear apart any semblance of peace or order.

You're looking at it from the wrong, globalist, universalist perspective.

Consider the following:

- The nation-state is the fundamental unit of sovereignty

- Submission to lawful authority is the hallmark of civilisation

Without a global state maintaining order, perpetual peace is unachievable. Without universal consensus on social order and the allocation of resources, perpetual peace is also undesirable.
