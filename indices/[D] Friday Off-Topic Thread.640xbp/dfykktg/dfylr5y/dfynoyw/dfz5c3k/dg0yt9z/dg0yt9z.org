I put it to you that it is not peace that is desirable insomuch as it is and end to war and particularly to the associated death. If, instead of war, all disagreements were resolved by means of (let us take a random example) chess matches instead, you could have a war without universal consensus on social order and resource allocation that was /also/ free of war-related killings.
