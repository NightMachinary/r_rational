It can work out. Wars are /expensive/.

Let us say that you and I disagree on some matter of policy. You insist on Policy A, I insist on Policy B. These policies are mutually exclusive; Policy A benefits you, while Policy B benefits me. Negotiations fail.

Now, we have two options.

Option one: War. War is, as I have noted above, expensive. Both of us think we can win (which means that, realistically, we're fairly closely matched). This means that even the winner will take significant losses. Yes, I expect I can defeat you - but the damage to me and mine in making the attempt will take /years/ to fix.

Option two: Regular chess matches. (Or some other conflict resolution method). If you win, we follow Policy A for two years; if I win, we follow Policy B for two years. In two years, we re-do the conflict resolution, for the same stakes. Even if I /lose/ the chess match, the only costs I have to bear are the costs of your running Policy A and (possibly) the cost of your gloating.

So, depending on the costs (to me) of running Policy A, it is quite possible that the costs of losing the chess match will be /less/ (possibly significantly less) than the costs of winning the war.
