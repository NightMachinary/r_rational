We can't stop it.

That situation was different. Dumbledore could absolutely have stormed Azkaban at any moment and had Harry obliterate all the Dementors. He had the power.

We do not have the power to stop the conflict in Syria, not without making Syria a vassal state and redirecting the ire of all the parties involved upon ourselves. Sure we could invade, take out the government, shoot everyone who resisted us...

But then Syria would just become another Iraq. Another Vietnam.

We can't win this. We just can't.
