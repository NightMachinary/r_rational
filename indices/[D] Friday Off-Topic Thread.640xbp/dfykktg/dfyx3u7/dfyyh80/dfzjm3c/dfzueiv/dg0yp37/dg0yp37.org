Hmmmm. Mass strikes, marches on Parliament, carefully calculated anarchy to make a point?

Let's consider for a moment the case of South Africa. (I consider it partially because I live here, and partially because I think it's an instructive case to consider in this context). Before 1994, we had some really pretty horrible politics. And there were strikes. There were people toyi-toying (a kind of a dance involving much lifting of the knees) in front of workplaces, organising marches to parliament, that sort of thing. Loads of nonviolent resistance. (Nonviolent resistance didn't seem to work, so at one point it went right over into violent resistance. If you really want to know about that, try looking up 'uMkhonto we Sizwe').

Anyhow. In the end, the revolution /won/. They didn't kill off the old guard or anything like that; they managed to persuade the government to let everyone vote, and the majority of the population (who had until then been denied their vote) promptly and predictably voted the old government /out/.

And there were loads of ways in which they then - with a /lot/ of care and /incredible/ planning - managed to create a new government without the country descending into chaos.

Seriously. Look up the history of the ANC in 1994. That's, I'd submit it to you, pretty close to the best-case scenario for the course of action you're proposing. The revolutionists /won/, and they did so with - well, /minimal/ casualties.

...it's twenty-three years later. The men who safely guided the revolution through a narrow gap have grown old, many have died (usually peacefully, surrounded by grieving relatives). Their successor is a greedy little man who, while not actually setting out on a deliberate policy of discrimination against an entire category of people, nonetheless appears interested in little more than how much money he can personally wrench out of the government before his term limit is up. (Oh, and women. He's up to something like six wives now, I think.) There are now - as in, of this last weekend - marches on Parliament calling for /his/ removal. (Next election is 2019, last I heard he was pretty confident in his ability to hang on until then - but he might just gut the economy completely in that time).

So, /absolute best case/, might be workable in at least the short term, done /really well/ and paying /plenty/ of attention to the lessons of history.

Long term? Jury's still out, but be careful to make sure that you set up a system that can't be wrecked when the greedy guy who's surprisingly good at political manoeuvring gets into power.

/Worst/ case, well, try looking up Zimbabwe. Or the French Revolution. Trust me, you /don't/ want the worst case.
