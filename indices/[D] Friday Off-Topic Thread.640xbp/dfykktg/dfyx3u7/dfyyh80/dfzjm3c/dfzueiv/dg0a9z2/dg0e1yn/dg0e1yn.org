  You'd trust a bunch of volunteers with no chain of command with that kind of authority?
#+end_quote

No, of course not! The whole point is that they /have/ a chain of command, and are accountable to popular assemblies where any citizen can object to what they do.

#+begin_quote
  But still, what you're describing isn't easy, and isn't really something the wisdom the the crowds can organize, I don't think.
#+end_quote

What I'm describing requires nothing more than a change in corporations law and corporate administration. People /know/ how their own workplaces run, simply because doing /your own job/ everyday requires intimate knowledge of your own job and the institution around you. All that worker self-management entails is letting that information flow /bottom-up/ from the people who actually have it, to the people who need it (administrators). It just entails turning leaders into representatives, exactly as we've chosen to do in almost every other context of democratic societies.

#+begin_quote
  How?
#+end_quote

With the exact soldiers who carry out all the orders already.

#+begin_quote
  Well local farmers already can't meet demand for their region. So we're back to logistics companies to accomplish that. We need to be able to ship food around to accomplish this goal. A few minor changes can do better then what we are doing (in canada) now, but none of them are complication free.
#+end_quote

So you work /with/ the workers in agriculture and logistics, who now have fuller control over their own work lives, and care about the actual goal of supplying food to people. They didn't start hating you because you gave them more freedom! Quite the contrary, working people given freedom and self-control at work tend to devote themselves /more/ to the terminal goal of their job.

#+begin_quote
  Admittedly a lot easier without a lot of things like occupancy laws.
#+end_quote

And with land-value taxes, a robust social-housing system, cooperatively owned apartment buildings, etc. All non-innovative institutions that have already been tried and succeeded -- to the point that they often had to be /forcibly/ dismantled by their ideological opponents, to the active objections of their users.

#+begin_quote
  Making sure that every component-factory gets the right amount of components with the minimal amount of wasted effort is a hard problem. It's a giant directed graph, with each node doing computation about what it needs.
#+end_quote

Well yes, and I'm proposing to make it /easier/ by giving far more control to the people who actually carry out the work every day, and thus know what needs doing.

#+begin_quote
  Any company we take over isn't going to be functional unless we take over all the component-factories it depends on, we provide an alternative component factory, or we provide some way of interfacing with heretical component-factories.
#+end_quote

All three of these are good options. We should use all of them as-needed.

  A workable centralized/cooperative planning apparatus that can interface with external market systems.
#+end_quote

So there's a few things to say here:

- Centralized planning is subject to information-transmission problems. At best, each level in a hierarchy can accurately capture the correlations between the components below it. This actually means that the top of the hierarchy is missing /most/ of the information about the joint distribution, even though it also has /much/ of the information necessary to reproduce any one component.

- "Market systems" /require/ an equitable distribution of income and a high velocity of money in order to function as efficient information-transmission mechanisms instead of rent-extraction devices.

- And really, markets are not useful because they actually achieve efficient price equilibria. We all know they can only do that under idealized circumstances. [[https://www.jacobinmag.com/2012/12/the-red-and-the-black/][They're useful because they allow experimentation]], and it's /experimentation/ that actually creates growth. This should make sense from philosophy-of-science, and from the success of the scientific method more broadly.

- Really we're talking about [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.01987][collective]] [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.04187][active inference]], and we should really just cast things in the correct cognitive terms to find out /how good/ any given "economic" method (two levels of abstraction up) is at solving the underlying basic problem of coherent, well-coordinated, goal-directed collective action. Seen from this perspective, the successes of markets and the failures of planning make sense: a frozen algorithm that doesn't take new inputs at runtime can't do inference, but there are many online Monte Carlo algorithms can approximate inference fairly well. An interesting question would be: what's an online variational algorithm for economic needs?

- Cooperative planning is already something that firms engage in on an everyday basis. The real question is theory of firms: where does it work better to plan out the actions of many people as part of a single organization, and where does it work better to partition people into different organizations?
