  Actually, you do need laws allowing you to charter your cooperative in a location with reasonable tax laws. And, hopefully this surprises you, getting those laws passes has actually been hard in a lot of places.

Also, I'm not seeing any reason why you couldn't run a cooperative on top of the charter of any generic international business company. Admittedly international business companies cost a bit more, like a grand a year, but you can run them pretty much however you want.

What leads you to believe that you can't run a cooperative as an international business company out of somewhere like Belize? Belize has a /pretty/ good tax rate of zero, and it's not hard to register an IBC in Belize. Technically you wouldn't qualify as a co-op for tax purposes, but since you're not paying taxes that's not a problem.
