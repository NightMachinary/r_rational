  You don't need to smash heads to start a cooperative, to manage companies however you want.
#+end_quote

Actually, you /do/ need laws allowing you to charter your cooperative in a location with reasonable tax laws. And, hopefully this surprises you, getting those laws passes has /actually been hard/ in a lot of places.

Yes, there have actually been legislatures who have said, "We won't pass a law letting you organize worker-owned cooperatives. We don't see the point. Just start a /normal/ company!"

  And frankly, people preaching about how we're not doing enough to fight the power, while participating in the university system, one of the oldest institutions for enforcing socioeconomic status, while also not visibly doing anything to actually solve any of these problems? That pisses me off.

Uh, you got any people around here you're directing that at? I'm currently just some guy.

  I think that the socialist ideology would get a lot further along if it actually solved problems. And don't tell me that the only problems that can be solved with socialism are big scale and require everyone to cooperate. Visibly and consistently solve smaller scale problems with socialism and I'll buy into it.
#+end_quote

It /does/ solve problems, and I see no need to use that excuse. My argument for socialism is less along the lines of "I promise this will work if everyone cooperates" and more along the lines of, "This will work if they get their damned boots off our throats and stop trying to /force/ us into irrational systems that waste our efforts and make us unhappy."

I'm not an "end of history" Hegelian communist. I expect that a socialist society can, will, and should have its own internal conflicts and differences. There will be no single glorious utopia. There will be a somewhat more /efficient/ expression of the needs and desires of the mere mortals who already make up the world.

It'll be like shoveling snow with your neighbors: you might have some arguments as to who shovels what, and you're still ultimately doing a bunch of hard work in awful weather, but by cooperating about it you get everyone inside to their hot tea a lot faster.

  So fucking build things that solve problems instead of telling us how we need to do more. How we need to kill our neighbors because they're not doing enough.
#+end_quote

I don't advocate for killing your neighbors. I advocate for militant nonviolence until the point where the existing state initiates violence, at which point we defend ourselves and our neighbors.

Like, let's go back to the Syrian war, since that's what started all this. /Wars/ are not some /natural/ state of affairs in Syria. The Syrian Civil War /started/ in 2011. US airstrikes /started/ some time after that. Current Western strikes /started/ just a couple of nights ago. There's no need to kill my neighbors for "not doing enough" about the Syrian war, because my neighbors didn't drop any bombs, the Air Force did.

  Right now you're engaging in tribalism and being useless instead of fixing things, as near as I can tell.
#+end_quote

Dude, I've been to... I think three IRL demonstrations in the past week. I would have gone to another one about the war last night, but I honestly thought I was gonna heave a brick and ruin things for my stupid hippie comrades who don't want to get arrested, so I went to my in-laws' house instead.

I've spent whole bunches of time writing letters, knocking on doors, dialing people's phones. I'm a delegate to a platform convention scheduled for a couple months from now. I send a monthly donation to the organization I belong to, and attend regular meetings, where local leaders coordinate our activism together.

I get that some people play Internet Activist and don't do IRL stuff. I am not that person.

I also object to the charge of tribalism since I actually feel a lot more sympathy for the [[https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/12/we-need-the-ironic-leftaka-the-dirtbag-leftnow-mor.html]["dirtbag left"]] than I do for the suited-up professional-class liberals who characterize Scott's "Blue Tribe".

  But I don't think it's about solving the problems for you, I think it's about fighting the enemy, and getting them to accept that you're right.
#+end_quote

It's very much about solving the problems. Look, if I had a minimum viable product around which to start a company, I would be founding a cooperative. It's one of those things I've always wanted to do. I also just don't have a minimum viable product, and I'm not sure how much effort is currently required to produce one for the kind of thing I want to make. It's seemingly a bit more than would actually constitute anything /minimum/, but hopefully I've /almost/ got a new job nailed-down, so I might have time to think about that sort of thing and more experience with the relevant techniques soon.

(I've also been spending a lot of effort job-hunting and working on /another/ problem, which culminated in a nice little presentation I gave. Unfortunately, the presentation was dumping too much information on people at once, and left them more confused-but-interested than anything else. I might have to try a grant proposal.)
