Not exactly a concrete plan, more a wish-list, but I'll try to provide some explanation on why /I'm/ not going to support that.

  municipal People's Protection Units

You'd trust a bunch of volunteers with no chain of command with that kind of authority? What you're describing is a gang. And yes, the police are a gang too, but they're a relatively predictable one. A new organization like that, made up of volunteers, has a lot of potential to be a lot worse. Of course if I'm being uncharitable maybe you think it will only be a lot worse for the right people....

When I see people advocating that /their/ ingroup should replace the police, with very little oversight, I +reach for my+ get a bit antsy.

  take over the workplaces
#+end_quote

Workplaces are useless without a supply chain, and most of the "workplaces" that would be taken over would be near the end of the supply chain. Of course take over the right logistics companies...

But still, what you're describing isn't easy, and isn't really something the wisdom the the crowds can organize, I don't think.

How?

#+begin_quote
  Begin supplying food
#+end_quote

Well local farmers already can't meet demand for their region. So we're back to logistics companies to accomplish that. We need to be able to ship food around to accomplish this goal. A few minor changes can do better then what we are doing (in canada) now, but none of them are complication free.

#+begin_quote
  housing
#+end_quote

Admittedly a lot easier without a lot of things like occupancy laws.

#+begin_quote
  health-care
#+end_quote

That is actually a lot easier. And we already do it in canada.

The thing I think you might not be getting about this problem is that supply chains are /hard/. You want to supply housing for people, but think about all the stuff we need to build new houses. Gypsum, electrical cables, electrical outlets, light bulbs, pipe, circuit breakers, insulation, paint, hinges, windows, flooring, etc.

Then realize that each of those components needs yet more components, and a certain amount of labour.

Making sure that every component-factory gets the right amount of components with the minimal amount of wasted effort is a /hard/ problem. It's a giant directed graph, with each node doing computation about what it needs.

Any company we take over isn't going to be functional unless we take over all the component-factories it depends on, we provide an alternative component factory, or we provide some way of interfacing with heretical component-factories.

So if you want to take over the means of production, which I think it the main goal, start working on economics 2.0. Some way to manage that giant directed graph. A workable centralized/cooperative planning apparatus that can interface with external market systems.
