You can run a corporation however you want, pretty much. You don't need to smash heads to start a cooperative, to manage companies however you want.

There are a bunch of places that use local currencies. You don't need to smash heads to start a local currency, you just need a system that offers tangible benefits to its users.

And frankly, people preaching about how we're not doing enough to fight the power, while participating in the university system, one of the oldest institutions for enforcing socioeconomic status, while also not visibly doing anything to actually solve any of these problems? That pisses me off. And as far as I can tell is describes of the people who advocate for violent revolution.

I think that the socialist ideology would get a lot further along if it actually /solved problems/. And don't tell me that the only problems that can be solved with socialism are big scale and require everyone to cooperate. Visibly and consistently solve smaller scale problems with socialism and I'll buy into it.

You're a software dev for fucks sake. You have one of the best toolsets for letting people solve small scale problems with socialism, for providing that kind of social proof.

Hell, 90% of the software I interact with is more or less socialist. That's more or less how community developed FOSS works.

So fucking build things that solve problems instead of telling us how we need to do more. How we need to kill our neighbors because they're not doing enough.

Right now you're engaging in tribalism and being useless instead of fixing things, as near as I can tell. Whining about how other people don't support socialist policies while not seeming to do anything that makes those policies more viable. But I don't think it's about solving the problems for you, I think it's about fighting the enemy, and getting them to accept that you're right.

Well screw the enemy. These kinds of policies work, and they will eventually out-compete the enemy, as long as we actually support them. Visibly and consistently solve smaller scale problems using socialism and we'll have a lot more support for it. But this kind of violent revolution talk actively hurts that cause.
