These kind of excuses are used to justify great atrocities and strip sacred civil liberties. I know you mean to post this in a pro-peace anti-war way. But someone who was pro-war and wanted intervention in Syria could have posted this exact same post, word for word, after the chemical weapons attack. Write in all caps all you want, but the world still turns and our actions still have consequences. We must press on. We must do so to the best of our abilities within the bounds of our political system. This is as true today as it was a few days ago, or a few months ago. I can only hope our efforts are enough to secure peace and civil rights.
