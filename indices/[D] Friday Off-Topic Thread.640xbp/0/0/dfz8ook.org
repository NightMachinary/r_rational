  How probable is it for something like that to happen?

Almost zero chance that it directly causes the end of the world.

Russia has been getting hammered by US sanctions, and combined with free-falling oil prices that's put their economy in the shitter. Putin is acting tough to get the US to the negotiating table. While they won't start WW3 over a middle east backwater the US doesn't particularly want to invade regardless, they might make it tough for the US to act in the area (for example, by funding extremists, or using their diplomatic weight to convince other nations to stop giving the US basing rights.) As such, Russia's intention is to get some deal along the lines of "we look the other way, you drop your sanctions."
