So...I got accepted to San Francisco State University earlier this week, which means that I'm going to be working on a Master's in Philosophy come August.

Any suggestions for finding good housing in the Bay Area? I'm looking on Craigslist, Zillow, etc., and keeping an eye on anything that looks good (my main problem here is that I'm not in SF yet, so I can't do check out the sites in person or anything), but if anyone has advice then it would be appreciated.

Also, if anyone happens to know somebody who's going to be needing to fill a room around August, then that's cool, too. It doesn't matter how small the space is, so long as I'm physically capable of sleeping in it, and I'd rather live in a walk-in closet for cheap than go too far into debt for a room that I could swing a cat in.

Also, if there's anything that you wish you had known before going to grad school, I'd appreciate hearing it. I've been doing my research, but I'd prefer to not miss out on a good bit of advice just because I didn't ask.
