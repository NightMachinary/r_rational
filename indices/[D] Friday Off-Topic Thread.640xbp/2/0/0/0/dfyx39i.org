  Huh. Do you know how I could find that out without asking? "I'm wondering how often I'm going to actually need to come to campus" would probably give the wrong impression.

Hmm, part of it depends on the specifics of your project (e.g. if it has a significant lab component), how much coursework you're taking, the nature of your work-study, if you're explicitly assigned an office/desk in your advisors office, etc. But one way to figure it out beyond that would be to ask your advisor how often you should anticipate meeting with them, and if they'd prefer you work at your desk in eye's view over the library or something. If they're ok with you working at the library, you can just stay home lol. ;] You could also (correctly) frame it as a financial thing and not a laziness thing by asking what they recommend for housing, and if they think it would be better for you to live somewhere closer or save on costs by living farther away and commuting not as often, if you want to be more explicit.
