I was attacked tonight by a few assholes on the way home. Only a few punches, and they didn't steal anything, and I don't think I'll have bruises... but fuck, it could have been worse. I feel like shit, and I don't feel safe. Fuck fuck fuck shit putain de merde d'encul√© de de fils de pute de connards de merdeux de cons de sous-merdes de putain de merde!

EDIT: Thanks for the kind words, guys. I got a night of rest and I feel okay now. No, I don't think having a weapon would have helped me. There were quite a few of them (six or more? Idk), so what I did was get away from them before they escalated further. Starting any kind of violence would have ended with me in the hospital. I mean, it was kind of dumb of to approach 6+ guys drinking beer at night alone, but I was tipsy too at that point. Lesson learned, I guess.
