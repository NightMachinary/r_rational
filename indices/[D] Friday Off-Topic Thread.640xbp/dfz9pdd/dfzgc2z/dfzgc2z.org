First off, really sorry to hear this happened to you.

Second off, I recommend taking up some sort of martial art. It does wonders to help you feel safe, even after a short time. Not just being able to handle yourself in a fight -- it helps you learn to be on the lookout and avoid fights like this, accept when situations like this are unavoidable, and regain your sense of safety.

Personally, I've been involved with Tae Kwon Do and could not recommend it enough. That said, I've heard any similar practice gives similar benefits -- find somewhere convenient, try it out, see if you like it.
