You see, that's a lot more reasonable a set of points than the whole "row row fight the powah marx did nothing wrong" shtick. I think that the aesthetics of revolution are getting in the way of your ability to effectively communicate, coordinate, and get things done.

It's also seems like a lot more approachable of a set of problems. Instead of trying to coordinate a bunch of people into open rebellion. You create a "local currency" running on whatever algorithm makes sense for "coherent, well-coordinated, goal-directed collective action". Get some firms/people/whatever to adopt said local-currency, and watch as they out-compete other firms by their nature of being better co-ordinated.

I am a decently competent web-dev, and I will donate at least 20 hours of my time towards implementing a web-interface for such a system. My time will go a lot further if you implement the code in python, since I can wrap it directly in my web framework of choice (django for static stuff, aiohttp if we need push alerts and websockets). I know at least one other developer who would be interested in working on such a project if it's at all sane beyond that 20 hour mark.

  What I'm describing requires nothing more than a change in corporations law and corporate administration.

Well then produce educational tools on how corporate administration /should/ work. And corporate law is pretty flexible. If you expect firms running like this to out-compete other firms, then you should just be able to draw up a cooperative company charter, start some companies (a bit more complicated), use the profit from those companies to create a cooperative venture-capital firm, and so on.
