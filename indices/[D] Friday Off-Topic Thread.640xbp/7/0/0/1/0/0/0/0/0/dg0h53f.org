  You see, that's a lot more reasonable a set of points than the whole "row row fight the powah marx did nothing wrong" shtick.

Ok, I feel like /now/ we've got an actual point of departure, and an interesting difference in felt ideological hegemony.

I've lived in two countries. I could bring this list of proposed changes to society to the Powers That Be, and depending on the place, I'd get the following responses:

- "Everything good about that we already do, and the rest is a bad idea. We know, because we had socialism once. It sucked. We're so glad capitalism gave us growth. We also really miss our kibbutzim. Collective life was great. Whatever happened to that?"

- "That's commie talk and the cops should put you rioting anarchists away. Now get the corrupt big government's hands off my Medicare!" (Less serious)

- "That all sounds very nice, but it's just not possible. The politics, the cost, you can't do major reforms in a complex society! However, I do believe that we /could/ help people by creating jobs, through cuts to the minimum wage, subsidized job-training loans, and a carefully calibrated subsidized health-care program." (Very Serious Person)

The pattern is, of course, that people rationalize away their support for actually-existing socialist and social-democratic policies /that benefit them/, while rationalizing /in/ their otherwise broad support for forms of capitalism that actually /harm/ them. As a result, everyone sounds incoherent: nobody believes they're on a happy medium, everyone claims to want to move Right for some reason, but they can't find many specific changes they want to make /which actually work in practice/.

The exception is breaking up monopolies, a free-market position that does actually work, because it involves increasing experimentation and decreasing rent-extraction. Hurray for good principles actually working! Mind, unfortunately, most "free-market" parties just don't do much antitrust enforcement these days, and even support business consolidation.

You seem to say this is a "reasonable set of points", indicating that it would be worth taking up in public and thinking about. Great. Unfortunately, I couch things in terms of revolution because, AFAIK, in the society I live in, you /really do/ need to fight an actual, militant revolution to get this kind of reform through.

Yes, even though the New Democratic Party could maybe move left a little bit, put this stuff in its platform, and still get a decent vote-share up in Canada.
