Yeah, I'm not saying that the mechanics of how to do the replacement are easy, or obvious, or known, or even necessarily /possible/.

My point is more that, as a philosophical position, an end to war-related death does not /strictly/ require universal consensus on social order and resource allocation.

Convincing everyone to replace war with something else (maybe not chess, I'm sure you can think of something better) may not be simpler, but I'm not sure that it's any harder that obtaining said universal consensus.
