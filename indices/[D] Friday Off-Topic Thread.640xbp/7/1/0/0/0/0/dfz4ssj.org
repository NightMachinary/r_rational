And what, murder half the population of our world's largest cities to say nothing of the actual men and women in uniform you'd have to kill to get there? Want to achieve world peace via violence? Better be willing to slaughter billions to do it.

Shitty institutions got us into this mess of a world political situation, and better ones, not random violence on a literally unimaginable scale, will get us out of it. There is no silver bullet, no single generation solution, only the inconsistent march towards a future a little less dark than today.
