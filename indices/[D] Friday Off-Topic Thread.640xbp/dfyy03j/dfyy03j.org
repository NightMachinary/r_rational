What do you guys think about the recent [[http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/u-s-launches-missiles-syrian-base-after-chemical-weapons-attack-n743636?cid=eml_nbn_20170406][airstrike in Syria]] and subsequent [[http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/04/07/522982477/russia-says-u-s-broke-international-law-in-striking-syria-citing-pretext][condemnation by Russia]]? I know next to nothing about politics, but I do remember Russia making statements that they wouldn't accept the US interfering in Syria. This kind of has me on edge, because from my (very uneducated when it comes to politics) point of view, it seems like this situation could very easily snowball into WW3. How probable is it for something like that to happen?
