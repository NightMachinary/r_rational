Nah, the actress for X-23 did an amazing job. Especially in the one scene where she ends up crying, her nose starts running and if what little I remember from acting classes several years ago is true, that's something that only happens when you're really managing to act really well.

Agreed on the plot holes, they existed but weren't Armageddon levels of stupid and distracting. Seriously, fuck that movie, it's way easier to teach astronauts how to drill than it is to teach oil drillers how to astronaut.
