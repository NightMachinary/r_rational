Really? I thought it was an okay action movie, but the plot seemed pretty weak and I am thoroughly tired of Hollywood "soft-rebooting" franchises.

Logan's biggest plot hole was the whole money issue. Logan's a super-predator past his prime, so why isn't he using what he has and taking money from people. Ideally criminals, but still, chauffeuring vegas tourists to make money? Really?

I was also annoyed that the driver-less semis were portrayed as being dangerous and the software didn't watch out for pedestrians.
