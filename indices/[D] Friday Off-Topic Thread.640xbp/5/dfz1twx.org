Fun idea for a private [[http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/62lpoc/d_friday_offtopic_thread/dfnkwc5][conversation venue]]:\\
- Set up a private Git repository\\
- Add a single HTML file to it\\
- Allow chosen conversation partner(s) to access the repository\\
- Enforce proper format (=<blockquote id="1234">=) and quoting (=<a href="1234">=) by refusing pull requests that don't conform

It essentially would be a 4chan thread with no images and no comment limit. Obviously, much the same effect could be accomplished by exchanging an HTML file through email--but that would allow an unscrupulous participant to edit long-past exchanges silently, without anyone else's noticing.
