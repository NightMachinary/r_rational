Perhaps a good thing to look up would be genuine alchemical texts, from when people thought this WAS a real thing? I think the reason for the gold was that they believed matter existed in a sort of ladder of nobility. So gold was the ultimate form of it. But the point was that the philosopher's stone would "raise" the nobility of the matter, so it would turn lead into gold or make you immortal, as in, it would turn anything into a more perfect form.
