I don't know how rational it might be, but 'Wake of The Ravager' on RoyalRoad (by Macronomicon) is a LitRPG with a reasonable backstory and likeable characters. A bit cheesy, and not without its flaws re: sexism, but with a teenage boy protag, it's not unreasonable. Anime tropes lampshaded often.

One of the powers the MC has is 'dupdomancy' which (after some leveling and many chapters) lets him copy various abstract properties from materials, such as the 'hardness' of titanium. He can then apply that to other materials. Without too many spoilers, he figures out how to basically make any material he wants given enough power and time. With some genre savvy help, he begins to upend the order of his medieval world.
