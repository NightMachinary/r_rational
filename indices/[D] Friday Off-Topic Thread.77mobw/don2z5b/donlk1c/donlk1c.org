  He doesn't even refer to it as if it's a mental illness or institutionalized ideology that people are victims of, but simply calls people out for thinking that way at all.

Hmm... I've always considered this way of approaching a disagreement to be a sign of respect. If I attributed what I believe to be your false belief to mental illness or institutionalized ideology, I'm not really taking your beliefs seriously. I'd be being dismissive of you - effectively telling you that I don't think you can handle a real conversation about this. You're just a victim. You can't handle the truth. On the other hand, if I straight out tell you that I think you're wrong for reasons x, y, and z, that suggests I think you're capable of engaging in a discussion.

Having said that, I think the opposite of your statement here might be a fair summary of why you didn't like the video. Grey didn't say, "I think you're wrong and here's why." Instead, he said that he thinks that you're wrong but you probably have Stockholm Syndrome so you can't handle a real conversation about it anyways. He essentially /did/ refer to your belief as a mental illness, and that's annoyingly dismissive.
