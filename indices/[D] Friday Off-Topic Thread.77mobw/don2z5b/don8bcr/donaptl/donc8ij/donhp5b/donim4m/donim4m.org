My comment was intended to point out that you are conflating two different definitions with the phrase "accepting death". There is the first, which means "acknowledging death as a thing that exists", and the second which is "treating death as acceptable". You are pretending for some reason that we here use the phrase "refusing to accept death" as if we are somehow forgetting that it exists or failing to take it into account, when this sub is probably one of the few places where that is emphatically not true.

Thus, the folks here /acknowledge that death exists/ just as one attempting to fly must take gravity into consideration, but they /do not approve of the existence of death as acceptable/, and choose instead to fight gravity and not live in its shadow forever. We hope to find our anti-death Bernoulli Principle and use it to combat it and defeat it, not sit on our thumbs and decide that since no such principle has been utilized since the beginning of time, that we are trapped in this gravity well forever.
