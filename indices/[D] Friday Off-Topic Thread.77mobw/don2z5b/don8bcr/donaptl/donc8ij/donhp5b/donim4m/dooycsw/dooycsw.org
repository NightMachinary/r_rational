  you are conflating two different definitions

/You/ are putting words into my mouth.

I mean that there are many who refuse to understand that death is an acceptable outcome. Of course I don't mean that people somehow forget that things die. Anyone who has had a pet knows this. And I'm sure we also all know that death of a beloved pet, friend, family member, idol, etc, brings pain to others. And I also mean that the existence of grief is acceptable.

What I mean, and what many here "forget", is that the existence of a thing (death) can be both acceptable and undesirable. The two are not mutually contradictory.

  We hope to find our anti-death Bernoulli Principle and use it to combat it and defeat it, not sit on our thumbs and decide that since no such principle has been utilized since the beginning of time, that we are trapped in this gravity well forever.

I'm not saying one should not "rage against the dying of the light". By all means, work on life-extending medical technology. Maybe you'll reach "escape velocity" and discover a cure for entropy. And I've seen some models that can allow for both immortality and entropy. But none that seem to work within this universe with physical laws compatible with those we currently understand. I wouldn't want to bet against the possibility of immortality, but betting for it sounds suspiciously like pascal's wager, complete with it's religious undertones.
