I was going to place a personal moratorium on this topic, since the echo chamber around here doesn't seem interested in alternative perspectives. But if you want to discuss, I have no problem with that. To task, then.

Not a turn of phrase seen very often. Most people only have two hands. I suppose an upload could have as many as he needs, though.

That's basically human+machine. We already do this, all the time. Once upon a time, "very hard job" used to mean something like "multiplying two 20 digit numbers". Today I just pull out numpy and have it done.

  despite the desire itself being impossible, we get something useful out of the attempt

I'm not arguing against pursuing dreams or trying things. I'm not even arguing that immortality is impossible. It looks like the problem this community is having with the topic is the interpretation that "accepting death" means "not doing anything to stop it". We can accept the inevitability of death while still trying to prolong life. No one's going to reject a cure just because they've accepted death. But we can be comfortable with being mortal while still trying to make that mortal span longer and more pleasant than our ancestors'.

It looks like people on the anti-death side are saying: "We don't reject the reality of death; we reject the universal inevitability of it." The more I look into it, the more it looks like they're hypocrites: they reject both the requirement of death, and the imminence of their own. It looks to me like they are trying to find solace in the religion of trans-humanism; that they are hoping against hope that perhaps they won't have to face the existential horror. This is no different than finding peace in traditional religious views of an afterlife; which bizarrely the rationalist community seems to reject.
