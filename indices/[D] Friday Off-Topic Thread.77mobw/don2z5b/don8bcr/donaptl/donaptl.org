Acceptance of death is acceptance of reality. It is rational thinking at its core. Refusal to accept death is madness: it is to reject reality, and replace it with wishes and dreams. This is not conducive to sanity.

Much has been written on this topic, and it would be wise to read it.

I don't know if you've ever spent much time with people on their deathbeds, but it would be instructive to do so. Broadly speaking, people separate into two groups when the moment of their death is upon them: those who accept the imminence of their death, and those who reject it. It may seem an arbitrary distinction, but it is in fact profound. This distinction characterizes everything else about the two groups.

This is something you can try for yourself. Find out what the difference is, if there even is one, and report back what you discover.
