My own personal thought on this is that if you are immortal, well, you literally have forever for things to be better again. I know that is overly simple, but it fits for me.

The other way to think about is: If I have a problem with being alive, but I am immortal; I literally have forever to figure out the solution.

Although if I was being tortured I might abandon this ideal pretty quickly because I don't think I could heroically resist unending pain.
