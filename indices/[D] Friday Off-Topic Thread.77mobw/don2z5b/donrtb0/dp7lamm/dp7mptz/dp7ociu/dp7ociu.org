Well, let's take the two examples that were mentioned beforehand: 1. Being tortured. Eventually the people torturing me die of old age. 2. Heat death of universe. Seems unlikely that we know what will happen next. Might as well see.

Obviously, this is kind of tongue in cheek and whatnot. But I hope you see my point; which is that no one really knows whether or not with unlimited time you couldn't find a solution. In fact, for your 1+1=3; if our universe, through string theory shenanigans, ever did collide with the "sheet" of another universe causing another Big Bang, might our physics change significantly enough that 1+1=3? I dont know. I might be dumb. But I am not sure if you can put me into a situation where I don't think, literal, unlimited time doesn't give me a way out.
