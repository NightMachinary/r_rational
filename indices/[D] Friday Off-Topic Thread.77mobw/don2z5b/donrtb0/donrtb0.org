I find it odd when people consider whether to accept "death" based on lifespan rather than circumstance. If you're enjoying life, "death" is bad. On the other hand, if you're undergoing excruciating torture, "death" could be sweet release.

For example, lots of people claim to wish to be immortal, no qualifiers attached. This is a rather dangerous wish, seeing as you'll eventually end up floating in a black empty void for all eternity if the universe goes into heat death before anyone finds a way to reverse entropy.
