CGP Grey and Kurzgesagt collaboratively posted videos about old age and death today, and I don't know if I've ever seen sister videos where I completely agreed with one while the other...offended me. Kurzgesagt frames the issue as about improving the length and quality of life, which we're already doing and I'm totally on board with, while CGP opened by calling the acceptance of death a form of madness similar to Stockholm Syndrome and I instinctively felt attacked.

It's not that I'm opposed in any way to what CGP wants to do, I want humans to live longer and don't have any arbitrary limit on how long I think life should last, I just hate the way he derogatorily describes my mindset (not belief system). He doesn't even refer to it as if it's a mental illness or institutionalized ideology that people are victims of, but simply calls people out for thinking that way at all. This is an effective a technique for persuasion as when atheists tell theists they're idiots.

I was introduced to the idea of immortality as a /good thing/ by HPMOR, and the reason I was accepting of the idea at a time when I devoutly believed in New Age pseudoscience was because Yudkowsky took care to portray Harry as the smart weirdo who wasn't always right in a world of sympathetic people who who at least thought they had good reasons to believe what they did. It placed rationality in a similar social situation as it is in reality.

I loved how Yudkowksy seemed self aware of how most people do or would think he's weird, how his moral convictions conflict with so many other people's, and the potential negative outcomes of that situation. It was a humility that I see too rarely in a time when empathy for people who believe differently from you is in short supply, including in myself. I can't help but see CGP's statements as hubristic in an eerily similar way to religious fundamentalism.
