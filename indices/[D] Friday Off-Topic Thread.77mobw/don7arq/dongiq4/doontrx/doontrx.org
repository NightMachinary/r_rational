Regarding your first paragraph, I /do/ want to include something where higher INT pokemon are more likely to treat otherwise innocuous-looking pokeballs as a threat, but as Vulpix pointed out we've got the OoS contact-means-capture mechanic. I don't particularly like the whole "captured pokemon can disengage freely" thing, it always seemed a bit too...anime.

Regarding Silph having a monopoly, I'm thinking it's a Microsoft situation where 75%+ of the market is dominated by them, but maybe there are some rich or otherwise stubborn companies that are in on it as well. However, as you point out, due to the danger involved, I bet that most other companies are more concerned with ease of use and capture features, not actually improving the tech itself due to the sheer costs involved on that end.
