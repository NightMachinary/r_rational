  why can't I make backups of my pokemon if they're being digitized / why can't I duplicate my OP pokemon / why isn't everyone just carrying around a copy of Lance's Dragonite
#+end_quote

Technically you can make a copy of the digital information of a pokemon, but to actually recreate that pokemon out of the non-original pokemon's matter, you'd need the exact right proportion of matter, and the tech that would allow that to be understood and gathered and stored hasn't been created yet.

  how we can digitize, simulate, and train brains but not add more muscle mass or bone density at will.
#+end_quote

I mean, they kind of can, but it's hellishly complex, which is why working, safe TMs are so rare and difficult to create. Increase muscle mass without also increasing the body's natural ability to oxygenate that muscle mass, or the right marrow amount to support the bone density, and the pokemon might look fine at first, but collapse after a few hours or die to some underlying weakness or chain reaction.

I'm not a biologist obviously so I don't know to what degree I'm overstating this, but it seems justified to say "This would take a LOT of trial and error to get right, with each individual specie, and so it hasn't been done yet."

Hell, it would make a lot more sense in canon if CARBOS and IRON and the other supplements were actually the brand names of TM-like programs that can slightly buff your pokemon's physical and mental attributes in predictable ways.

  what happens in a few years once Moore lets us catch up?
#+end_quote

Actually I think Moore's law has a semi-ceiling that we've surpassed in Pokemon anyway: there is a hard limit on how much heat can be dissipated from a given surface area, and so keeping chips cool will be a big challenge sometime within the next decade if we continue to cram more and more of it into less space. I'm not versed enough on technical knowledge to know what potential solutions will work best for solving that, but I just assume the pokemon world has in the same way I assume it's solved the rudimentary mind upload issue: because it's demonstrated to have done so.

Many of these problems may in fact be solved in the future of the pokemon worlds we imagine. But they're in the /future/ of their world just like space elevators or solar satellites or quantum computers may be in the future of ours. We have to leave them /some/ closed doors, some places to continue research on and open new technologies and reach new eras.

There may in fact be an era in the future of Origin of Species' world where people can fill pokeballs with matter and copy a dragonite template onto it, or just create their own unique pokemon that are stronger than any found in the wild, or as Bill wants to do, figure out how to reverse or solve the problem of intelligence limiting in creatures that get captured, including humans.

If you plan on allowing people to fund research over the course of years in Renegade's world anyway, why /not/ keep it a digitization problem that still needs to be solved, and then let them pour money into some lab to solve it?
