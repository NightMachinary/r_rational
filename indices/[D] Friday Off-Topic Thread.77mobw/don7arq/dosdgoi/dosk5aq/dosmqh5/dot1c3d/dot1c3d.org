  If you plan on allowing people to fund research over the course of years in Renegade's world anyway, why not keep it a digitization problem that still needs to be solved, and then let them solve it?

Mostly because I have no confidence that I could simulate a post-scarcity society that organically grows from a normal one. If that was the /point/ of the game, then maybe, but as it's essentially a backdrop for the game I /actually/ want to make (train pokemon, fight Legendaries, explore the world), I feel like I should come up with just enough lore and rules to justify the systems I want, and then permit growth and progress within those systems and in combinations of those systems and leave it at that. I can't predict or generate how a society would react to such a game-changer, not without going full-on Dwarf Fortress.

  Technically you can make a copy of the digital information of a pokemon, but to actually recreate that pokemon out of the non-original pokemon's matter, you'd need the exact right proportion of matter, and the tech that would allow that to be understood and gathered and stored hasn't been created yet.

I can appreciate the difference of complexity between a program that knows how to output one specific product vs procedurally generating a product, but to have a program that can, fully generically, scan an object, break down that object, store that object in a compressed form, and then recreate that object seemingly perfectly, you've already /got/ what you need for replication. Just do them in a different order; capture a barrel of corpses to get your material, point a previously-scanned template to replicate at the barrel data/mass/whatever, and you're mostly golden.

  I mean, they kind of can, but it's hellishly complex

I agree that it's not just like moving a slider over to the right, but if this society can simulate animal brains /and write the changes to the meat/, then adding muscle mass is downright child's play. It would be one thing if the only digital interaction was with something like porygon, but the fact that it's a poor man's "I know Kung Fu" /that works on 700 disparate species and counting/ is an enormous indicator that A: the template can be modified before release in presumably a purely digital form, and B: the digital changes can be perfectly replicated in meatspace. It's...shit, it's a Star Trek tech in a world only barely removed from Cowboys and Indians.

The only way that I feel like it's justified at all is by removing a lot of the scientific background of the tech industries. In our world, observations lead to fundamental theoretical groundwork, which is then applied practically. The equivalent process (in Renegade) is mostly reversed: why would you need to theorize generalized theories of electromagnetism when you have a floating friggin magnet in front of you that's done 80% of the work for you biologically, and you just need to tap it? It reminds me of how the ancient Greeks had the steam engine, but there was no use for it since slavery was so prevalent and so much cheaper; why have a fundamental understanding of natural phenomena when a significantly cheaper, tamable, breedable proxy to the powers of the universe is right under your nose with every possible variance you might want?

Add in the inherent violent chaos of a world wracked by Stormbirds and other colossal threats, and you have a scientific community that is really more like mad scientists or hackers, tossing together Frankensteinian tech together by the seat of their pants, desperately trying to survive the next Snorlax stampede or Diglett migration or Stormbird attack. They don't know /how/ it works and only vaguely /why/ it works, but in the moment that's a tertiary concern at best. I see the pokeball, not as a parallel to the electric car or some other modern refinement of an old process, but like the invention of gunpowder, or even fire: crucially important, and its descendants will shape the world, but ultimately defined by its ability to force chaos on itself to give humanity some breathing room.

Whew, sorry for the inforant. All this said, I totally understand why such a stance isn't really compatible with your vision for OoS; it's certainly not clean, not modern, only passingly (and superficially) comparable to our world, and you have meta-goals that are intrinsically associated with science in general. Your story is partially defined by the process of humanity peering a little deeper; Renegade is more like take what you can carry and run.
