Oh wow, lot of useful feedback here. It's very harsh and a bit mean, but I get the gist. Thank you very much :)

I'm going to try to answer everything later, but to address your main points:

I did write the GDD a bit like a diary. When I was writing it with a team, it was with the idea that everyone already knew what the project was about, which is why I didn't open with the "meatiest" parts.

On the other hand, the GDD also serves as a kind of proto-to-do-list, in the sense that it's supposed to have be exhaustive-ish overview of what the final project will be like. So while I agree that some parts feel a bit shallow and read like "this feature will be good instead of bad", I still want to include them in some form. Idem for the "I don't know how to do this" parts, which are intended to remind me of which subjects I need to research.

But yeah, I should probably rewrite these parts to make this more clear. On the other hand, this isn't exactly a promotional document; it's better to be readable and interesting to get useful feedback, but it doesn't really /need/ to sell the game.

Regarding whether I should make a Minecraft mod... I don't know. I've kind of taken it for granted that I need to build the thing from the ground up to have enough flexibility, and on the long term I do want the engine to be 100% my own... but it's true that it might be faster to make a prototype to test features by modding Minecraft than from the ground up. On the other hand, I feel more comfortable with C++ and Ogre than Java and Minecraft code, but yeah. Another possibility would be to make a fork of Minetest's code, which is C++ and Irrlicht.

I'll think about it.
