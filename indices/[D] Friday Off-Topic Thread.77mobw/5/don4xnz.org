In the asking of questions, some ambiguity regrettably is unavoidable. Let's consider an extremely boring question:

#+begin_quote
  Between the colors pink and green, which would you estimate to be your favorite?
#+end_quote

- What do I mean by =pink=? What, /exactly/, is the range of colors to which I'm referring? Does =pink= include lavender or maroon? Am I talking about RGB or CMYK? (Similar complaints can be made about =green=.)\\
- Explicitly, I've directed the target to consider only the pure and undiluted colors. However, it's eminently likely that he instead will contemplate various items that in his experience have /represented/ the color. (This is the difference between "I prefer green because, being the color of nature, it seems calm and soothing." and "I prefer green because leaves are green and I like leaves.", which says nothing about whether the speaker likes green /itself/.)\\
- What does =favorite= mean? Again, explicitly, I inquired solely about the isolated color---but maybe the respondent will think, not of amorphous blobs of color in a featureless black void, but of buying a pink car or of painting the interior of his house green. Certainly, "What would you prefer the color of your primarily-driven car to be, if you could choose any single solid color of glossy paint?" would be an interesting question, but it isn't the question that was asked /in this instance/.

That's the problem. What's the solution?\\
- Describe the intended context with excruciating detail, leaving no room for error\\
- Allow the respondent to request clarification of the question's intended context---even incrementally, if he finds it necessary\\
- Ensure that the respondent explains the context of his response alongside that response, regardless of the context in which you yourself plan to answer\\
- Allow the respondent to deliver multiple responses, each with its own context provided alongside
