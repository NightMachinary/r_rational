Your questions actually make me wonder, do some colors have larger scopes than others? For example, what is the color range of "blue" in the English language? Something like #CCCCFF to #000066? Could it actually be bigger than the color range of "red", and hence more likely to be someone's favorite color?

This actually seems likely, since most people know that "pink" is different from "red". Meanwhile, how many people disqualify "cyan" as a "blue"? And "black" and "white" probably have extremely limited ranges compared to the other colours.
