The 2017 NYC Rationalist Solstice has been [[http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/pi1/nyc_solstice_and_east_coast_megameetup_interested/][officially announced]] for Saturday, December 9th. For tickets and fundraising info, check [[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1939801081/nyc-secular-solstice-2017-generations/description][here]]. Usually about 150 people show up, so it's a really nice celebration.

Simultaneously with the solstice, there will be a [[https://rationalistmegameetup.com/][Rationalist East Coast Megameetup]]. A bunch of rationalists (current estimate: 40) will be hanging out together in a large AirBnB in NYC for the Friday-Sunday containing the Solstice event.

(Note: I am not one of the organizers of this event and I've never gone to it before, I'm just crossposting it here)
