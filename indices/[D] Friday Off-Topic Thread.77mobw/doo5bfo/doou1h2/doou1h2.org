It took me reading the whole document to really understand that you basically want a game map editor that is edited by playing a game. I have to ask, why not just make a mod for Minecraft's creative mode? So much of that document is saying "do this just like minecraft" that you may as well start with the game that is most like minecraft (that being minecraft itself) and then going from there. If nothing else, it would let you prototype the feasibility of what it is you want to do, without wasting time cloning minecraft just to discover that the part you /actually/ want to do isn't what you thought it would be.

You really should put all that at the beginning, tho. I left other comments on the document; sorry if it came across a bit mean.
