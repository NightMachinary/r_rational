  Re: eliminating ambiguity in communication
#+end_quote

A quote from some article on numerical methods:

#+begin_quote
  Don't compute to high precision unless you are certain you are going to need it.
#+end_quote

This appears to hold for everyday conversation too. Providing excruciatingly detailed context for every question/statement is too inefficient, since it is rarely needed/relevant. It is much more reasonable to just say the thing, and allow incremental refinement of contextual understanding via requested clarifications. Which people generally already do.
