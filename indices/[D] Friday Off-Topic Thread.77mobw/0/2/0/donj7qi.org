For me, I think it's less a belief that predicts observations and more a mindset that helps to deal with existential dread. I expect my place in the universe to be small and finite so I feel less dissatisfaction with the life I am able to live. I will continue to work to live the best life I can, but I need to remind myself that there is a limit to it.

If I believe that people can become truly immortal and that preserving life the /penultimate goal of existence/, then that will give any other life I choose to live less value according to my worldview. Given that I have depressive episodes due to not being as intuitively talented at achieving my goals as I'd like to be, I need existential serenity in my life.
