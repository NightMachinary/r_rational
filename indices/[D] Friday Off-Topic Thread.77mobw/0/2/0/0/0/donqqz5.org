First of all, we don't actually know that much about Stockholm Syndrome because it's very difficult to study. Second, I don't think coping with fear of an unknown future outside of my control should be directly compared to a mental illness that afflicts victims of abuse out of respect for them.

Third, while I agree that it is a coping mechanism I do not see any reason to stop utilizing it if it is working and doesn't prevent me from pursuing the same goals as anyone else. The only negative consequence of it so far is that I feel offended when people refer to my mindset as “madness”, implying that I am lesser than they.

I need a way to cope with anxiety and despair because I cannot relieve myself of it and believing that I can will distract me from directly confronting it. I will not stop fearing death as long as it is a possibility, so I need to accept that fear is something that I can live with so I can focus on mitigating it instead of vainly trying to remove it.
