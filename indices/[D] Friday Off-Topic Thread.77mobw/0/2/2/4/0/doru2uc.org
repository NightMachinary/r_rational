  Or at least, sure, you're basically 100% definitely going to die at some point. It's one of those events that happens with probability 1. On the other hand, so was everything else bad in life, until it wasn't.

I wonder that people still take this sort of reasoning seriously. I suppose the world has always been full of dupes.

The search for the philosopher's stone, holy grail, fountain of youth, etc. has been going on for thousands of years... for as long as humans have been around, I imagine. The arguments I'm hearing today are exactly the same as those we've always heard. Only now they're framed in terms of machinery, AI, uploading, and in general /science/. And throughout, the arguments are still riddled with magical thinking. "A superintelligent FAI will work out the details for us," is not a solution. Or like those idiots paying to have themselves cryogenically frozen when they die. "Eventually scientific advances will allow me to be resuscitated," is the epitome of magical thinking.
