  Broadly speaking, people separate into two groups when the moment of their death is upon them: those who accept the imminence of their death, and those who reject it.

I believe you misunderstand. By "accepting death" we don't mean accepting the inevitable expiration of a particular terminally ill person given current medical knowledge, for that would indeed be delusional, but believing that the general phenomenon of death can't (and sometimes shouldn't) be prevented in the face of continuously advancing medical science and tech.
