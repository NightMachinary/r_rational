Would you say that acceptance of death is "acceptance of reality" if we had the technology to make death entirely optional? If not, then the disagreement is about whether or not technology will ever get to that point. If so, then it seems to me that you're making an argument about doing things the "natural" way being better. If you're going to make that argument, then you're a hypocrite if you're benefitting from modern medical care.
