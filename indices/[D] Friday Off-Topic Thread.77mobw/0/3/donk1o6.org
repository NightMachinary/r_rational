I'm glad you mentioned that you felt attacked.

  It's not that I'm opposed in any way to what CGP wants to do, I want humans to live longer and don't have any arbitrary limit on how long I think life should last, I just hate the way he derogatorily describes my mindset (not belief system).

It didn't seem derogatory to me. In what way do you disagree with CGP? I don't think his calling death 'madness' is hyperbole meant to injure those opposed to him or to signal his belonging to a group (like atheists insulting theists often is). It is his honest appraisal of the situation.

In fact, since death acceptance isn't a politicized issue (yet! :[) calling it madness is probably a great way to make people think about it.

If you aren't opposed to what he's saying---that is, if you think involuntary death is worth resisting and eliminating if possible---your mindset isn't even what he is calling madness. What insult do you perceive?

Anyways, I plan on showing this video to several people. I'm glad to know someone on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] considered it offensive. I will be less surprised if those I show it to are offended, and I'll try to sympathize with them if they are.
