I can come up with more, hm, polite ways of talking about popular attitudes toward death without saying "stockholm syndrome," but I don't know if I can come up with a more succinct way.

You don't find people arguing that we ought to die at forty, or that we ought to still die from smallpox. If we lived for a thousand years, I don't think we'd have people saying that we ought to live for only five hundred years, or a hundred, or seventy.

Somehow, magically, people seem to believe that the current human lifespan is good enough, or, if it isn't good enough, then it's just a little bit short of good enough. This, among other things, suggests that our "death is ultimately good" attitude is a coping mechanism, and "Stockholm Syndrome" seems like a pretty good shorthand for "coping mechanism which works by causing us to like the thing that is causing harm to us."
