  For example, lots of people claim to wish to be immortal, no qualifiers attached. This is a rather dangerous wish, seeing as you'll eventually end up floating in a black empty void for all eternity if the universe goes into heat death before anyone finds a way to reverse entropy.

In order to properly enjoy living for an infinity of time I would require the ability to consciously control what makes me happy and what interests me, and for more extreme circumstances, exactly how much pleasure and/or pain I experience at any given time.

Once you have that the whole "If you were truly immortal you wouldn't like to spend billions of years immersed in the heart of a star or an infinity of time in a void, now would you?" argument becomes moot because I can enjoy absolutely anything that happens to me just as much as I wish to.

True immortality requires some form of wireheading for happiness. And that sounds great to me.
