So it seems we can both agree that we cannot give an accurate reading on how likely a problem is to be solved in exceptional circumstances. (I'd say normal circumstances, most things can be solved by working on it for 1,000 years or 100,000,000,000 years).

So. My philosophy on this comes down to: If I die then its final. I cease to exist, and, in my opinion that sucks. If I don't die, then there is a chance, maybe incredibly, ultra tiny, that I get to better circumstances.

Better circumstances > death.

If you were to use math the greater than sign would always line up with living.

I understand its, uh, semi-ridiculous. But it makes sense to me.
