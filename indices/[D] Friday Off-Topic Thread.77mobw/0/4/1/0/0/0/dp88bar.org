  But I am not sure if you can put me into a situation where I don't think, literal, unlimited time doesn't give me a way out.

This seems incredibly optimistic. Sure, it is impossible to tell if a real-world problem has no solution. Everything could be an illusion that you can just wake up from after all. But that doesn't mean it is impossible for a real-world problem to have no solution. If anything that just makes things worse, you could be trapped without knowing you are trapped, wasting your time trying to find a solution that just doesn't exist.
