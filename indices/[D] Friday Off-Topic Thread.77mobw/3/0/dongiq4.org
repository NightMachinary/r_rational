What if being smart somehow helps you get out of a pokeball and avoid full capture? This would mean that, just as healthier pokemon are more likely to escape a pokeball when you are trying to catch them, high-INT/SAP pokemon are also more likely to escape a pokeball.

Altenately, aren't all pokeballs created by Silph Co? Maybe they rig their pokeballs to reject humans. Since pokeballs are pretty complicated stuff, I don't think it'd be unreasonable that they still have a monopoly (especially if anyone trying to reverse engineer pokeballs has to deal with Pokemon Hell World and a slew of other dimensions as they perfect their off-brand ball), but if there are multiple companies then you just have to say that it's an industry standard.
