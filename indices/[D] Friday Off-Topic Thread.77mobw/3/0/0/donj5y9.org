For the second idea, on a Pokeball monopoly, all legal Pokeballs are programmed to reject humans. Like, it's /super/-illegal for them to be otherwise. Silph doesn't have a monopoly on Pokeballs, though, and you can find jailbroken Pokeballs on the black market. Super-illegal, still, but there.

As for the first, we took inspiration from Pokemon Origin of Species in the sense that if a Pokeball connects it automatically captures with no chance for resistance (the trick is being able to hit the Pokemon in the first place, and size/mass limits. Higher level Pokeballs can take more of a beating and can hold larger Pokemon). Though, OoS approached Pokeballs from a 'convert to mass-energy and recreate' angle and we adopted the auto-catch rules before coming up with the ghost organ idea, so it's not impossible that we may return to canon's interpretation there.
