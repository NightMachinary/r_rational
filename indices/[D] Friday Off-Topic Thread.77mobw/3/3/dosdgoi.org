My problem with the pokeball-as-portal-tech idea has always been that it isn't supported enough by canon, where we clearly see pokemon in their balls able to be interacted with digitally, such as through virtual training regimen and bonding exercises. I guess there's no reason one couldn't mesh the two and say that pokeballs both put the pokemon in a pocket dimension and also have an interface that allows them to experience simulations, but at that point it feels like adding complexity without benefit, if there's going to be a handwave at the end of it anyway :)
