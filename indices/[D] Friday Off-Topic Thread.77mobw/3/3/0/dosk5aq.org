It's just stupid hard to make a pokeball system that does not by dint of existing create the means of full digitization and uploading, which then dominos to a completely different world. I'm okay if the player asks questions such as "how does X even work", but it's more difficult when they can ask "why can't I just X" when interacting with systems of explicit rules. For that reason, I find the digitization model brings up some of those questions, such as "why can't I make backups of my pokemon if they're being digitized" which then leads to "why can't I duplicate my OP pokemon" or "why isn't everyone just carrying around a copy of Lance's Dragonite", and that doesn't even get into the questions of how we can digitize, simulate, and train brains but not add more muscle mass or bone density at will. If the reason that humans can't be uploaded purely comes down to a lack of processing power, what happens in a few years once Moore lets us catch up?

These could actually be interesting ideas to explore in some context or another, but in the context of a game sim where one is expected to explore and manipulate any of the world's rules they come across, I don't want to veto any player's ideas soley because I decided I don't want the world to work that way. So while "it only fits in the pokeball because portal tech, and only so much mass can be actively accessed at once because The Devil and humans can't even use it at all because Power of Hell" is a bit, I dunno, intellectually dissatisfying on a certain level, it's a lot more ironclad from a systems-to-work-around level. If the player is able to research and fund a pokeball that could actually within the rules of the universe simulate a human, then I don't want to stop them just because I said so.

Instead I'll summon Giratina and make it a boss fight.
