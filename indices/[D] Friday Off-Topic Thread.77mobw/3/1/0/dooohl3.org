This reply actually got me thinking about the problem in other terms than just scaling off of intelligence, so thanks for that.

As for it just being flavor text, my purpose is to hopefully figure out a systematic mechanic, something that by dint of existing could have other effects than just "no humans in pokeballs". Bonus points if it means that, say, we can have an in-universe group of psychics who raise their Alakazam without using pokeballs, and on average those Alakazam actually /are/ slightly more powerful and intelligent because of it.
