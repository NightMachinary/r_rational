  Bonus points if it means that, say, we can have an in-universe group of psychics who raise their Alakazam without using pokeballs, and on average those Alakazam actually are slightly more powerful and intelligent because of it.

This is how I basically see pokeball tech working in OoS, so I'd expected that to be how it works in Renegade as well :)

The problems of not using a pokeball to train a pokemon in OoS are massive, however: all automated training programs in the pokeball and pokedex tech can't be used, the things that train them not to attack humans and differentiate between enemy and friendly pokemon for team battles and so on are the least of it, you'd have to train them even in the most basic things like responding to movement and retreat commands, or aiming their attacks. Not to mention all the biological upkeep and environmental hazards many pokemon would entail.

The time and money investment would almost certainly not pay off compared to investing all that energy into training other pokemon in the meantime, but maybe that calculus would be different in Renegade.
