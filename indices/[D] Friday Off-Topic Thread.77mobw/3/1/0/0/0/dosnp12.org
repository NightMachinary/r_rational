Oh certainly, I doubt it would be viable for a full team+ or even in most cases individually--I doubt your Graveller is even benefiting much, being well below the threshold past which this becomes an issue.

(Although it just occurred to me that if the limiting factor that attracts Giratina's attention is the portal activity and thus the number of 'context switches' within a pokeball, then one would be relatively restricted when interfacing with a highly complex /or/ a very large brain. Although a quick google shows that even a sperm whale has a brain that weighs about 20 pounds, so it's not a huge variance. And those that aren't physically impaired like humans would still be possible to train 'virtually', just at a lower safe rate.)

But yeah. I aim to have that sort of low-level training available to teach in the situations that it's needed (so that one can hack it and train, I dunno, knight's-move commands), you just wouldn't want to waste your time on it in the vast majority of cases. One other exception is when deciding what to teach in situations where the pokemon's ability to understand is limited--if you can teach a Pidgeot thirty movement commands then you just go nuts, but if you can only teach a Beedrill 6 in any reasonable amount of time, then which ones do you go for? Do you trade off specific moves and settle for a generic 'attack' just so you can communicate more specific aerobatics?
