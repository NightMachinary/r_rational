If we're OK with capturing-but-not-enslaving humans, and are basically writing flavor text...

Perhaps Pokeballs work by modeling the nervous system at a very low level, and subverts a critter's natural psychology by application of a carefully tuned stimulus, Snowcrash style.

You could choose to limit this by computation: using an algorithm that has a run time that scales very fast - perhaps even exponentially - with brain complexity. This would makes human-capable equipment way more powerful as run-of-the-mill stuff (assuming that Pokemon top off at about "gorrilla")... and so the stuff designed for capturing beasts, even with a modest computational safety margin, just doesn't cut it - but specially built research hardware might have a chance. (And if capture-tech that high-powered is illegal, it'll be hard to get: these are ASICs supercomputers in the high Request-For-Quote range, not guns.)

Alternatively, the limit could be sensor/emitter technology... which isn't nearly as subject to More's law, and so doesn't trip the "but the world will fall apart in 5 years" intuition that the computational complexity problem does.
