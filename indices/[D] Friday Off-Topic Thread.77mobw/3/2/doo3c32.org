You could do a hand wave involving human and Pokemon evolution. If they have no relation and the world has supernatural stuff then why can't Pokemon have some resistance to something that effects humans in the dimension the pokeball uses.

It seems like you're looking for some force or effect that applies to humans and not Pokemon. What if humans developed cancer from the dimension due to radiation. While the Pokemon are fine.
