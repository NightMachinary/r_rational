This is actually very similar to where the current discussion track eventually landed on in Discord. I basically got thinking on what distortion negatively effects, and since that basically means "what is Ghost and Dark effective against", the natural conclusion is something to do with Psychic typing.

Thus, the current idea is that all humans have a small Psychic typing %, and unlike a normal Psychic pokemon which has a more-or-less isolated and separate organ that the brain merely commands, in humans the psychic-ness is interconnected within the brain, like white matter in our brains.

Repeated and chronic exposure of a standard Psychic pokemon to distortion via pokeball might introduce microfractures of the psychic organ, but unless it's above and beyond normal use it's probably not going to have much of an effect. You can't say the same for micro-alterations of the brain itself, however, and so humans that are captured are essentially lobotomized: at best your personality completely changes, at worst (if you were Psychic on top of the latent brain structure) completely comatose or braindead. Most individuals come out completely infantilized.

This also would mean that Dark humans would have an additional but probably undiscovered boon: due to their latent absorption of distortion energy via the Dark organ they've got somewhere in their head, /they/ can probably hang out in pokeballs no problem. Due to their overall rarity and the absolute social outrage over the problem (lobotomy is actually a very good parallel in this sense) experimental evidence for this would be hard to come by.

Unless, maybe, you're an individual as powerful as Giovanni with a host of loyal Renegades at your disposal, with a higher than average distribution of Darks in the ranks...

EDIT: oh, and then we could say that the higher a unit's SAP stat, the more any Psychic typing is inseparably connected with the brain. Thus, brain damage per capture/release can be calculated on an individual basis, meaning that while in-universe people think that the rule is "humans and pokeballs don't mix", the /actual/ rule is "medium-high SAP + any Psychic typing and pokeballs don't mix".
