Okay, you're pushing a bit much on the Bleach connection. :D

I think a lot of that just comes from tropes in general, or from eastern warrior magic tropes. The push-down power, the discrete power steps, revealing true power, etc.. Lots of these elements overlap between Bleach and Cradle, and other fics.

This is kinda pushing it. In Bleach, there's nothing divine about Shinigami, they're just powerful spirits. Suriel is a whole other ball game. Also, with Ichigo, his powers were inside him the whole time, and probably would have started sooner or later without Rukia, where Lindon truly had nothing.

Don't get me wrong, they're both great (though I actually like Cradle a lot more), but thinking they're incredibly similar just means you haven't read/watched many other eastern style fics. For example, even Naruto has a broad similarity to Cradle in how the magic system works, though Xianxias take it to extreme power levels. It's that whole eastern magic style, vs western DnD/Harry Potter wizard type magic.

  The /ambiance/ of Bleach was stellar, and these books manage to capture that same spark, which I think is fantastic.

Again, Cradle exceeds Bleach. Bleach was one fight to the next, always trying to save /somebody/ (or stopping 2 different people from destroying the world). That was more or less the entire point of training in Bleach. Cradle, on the other hand, has completely different motivations. Lindon's not living and dying at the point of a sword in swordfights; he has to be more clever than that. Bleach had a very standard, simple plot, whereas Cradle has a more sophisticated, but not insane, plot.

The ambiance and feeling is similar in that there's eastern magic style fighting with crazy levels of escalating power, but Cradle is just /so/ much better. Despite Cradle's power levels going much farther than Bleach, Cradle's world building makes sense to me. It feels like it could be a consistent world/multiverse than can exist, but Bleach? Things don't add up enough in Bleach. At a minimum, what about all the other cultures, let alone talking about number of people in the Seretei, or how the magic feels artificial? (Bleach feels like a being said, this is how magic works, with different Shinigami magic types coming to people naturally in battle, whereas Cradle feels like the early humans in Cradle had to explore how the world actually worked, with trial and error.)

I like Bleach, I like fanfiction of Bleach. But Cradle is just so good, that it feels wrong to directly compare them, because they /are/ actually quite different.

Sorry if I ranted too much. I just wanted to put out counterpoints, because although they are similar in how you say, it's the same in that TVTropes pages of both should share a bunch of listed tropes, while still being quite starkly different. I just feel really passionately about Cradle, I guess. <3
