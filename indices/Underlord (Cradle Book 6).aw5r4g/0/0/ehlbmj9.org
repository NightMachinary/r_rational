Do you know of any other good Xianxia? Ever since I got into Cradle, I've tried others, but they kept being too shit for the reasons you mentioned.

My holy grail of a Xianxia is one with a clever and smart person, where the advancing comes from being clever instead of brute force elixirs/luck, who cares deeply about others and has empathy for most/all people. It would need to be a real story, with struggle and complicated characters, not falling into the trash heap you mentioned. Preferably female, because I like reading female protagonists, for whatever reason, but it doesn't really matter.

This is broadly covered by Cradle, though Cradle didn't go into how Madra worked as much as I liked, nor did it go into compassion very much. I get why -- it's hard to fit so much amazing stuff into one space, and Cradle /fits/ a lot of stuff.

That said, I can totally imagine an AU fanfic focused on Akura Mercy, or an AU based on Lindon who was more clever and driven in his childhood.
