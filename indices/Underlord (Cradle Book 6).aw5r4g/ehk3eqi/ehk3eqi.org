So this book series has been recommended here before and now that the sixth book is out, I'm making a new recommendation for the Cradle Series.

It's very much a Western style of the Xianxia genre which seems to be surprisingly popular around here, even if very few books ever meet our [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4ab3xk/recommendations_xianxia_is_a_good_genre_and_you/d0zm9va][standards]] for rationality. There is a lot of well-deserved criticism of how many main characters are very villainous, the enemies and female characters are usually under-developed, the economies of cultivation aren't logical, the conflict scales very poorly as you go from one city in the beginning to interstellar in scope at the end of a series, and awkward prose due to translating from a different culture to ours. But I bring up all of these flaws to say that the Cradle series completely avoids all of the typical flaws in Xianxia and has a very smart character who sets out to cultivate smartly instead of being bullheadedly stubborn.

The women are well-developed individuals with goals of their own (instead of being cheerleaders or trophies), the economics are logical, the conflicts actually use military doctrine modified for the power-levels involved, enemies aren't raving loons who must kill the main character no matter what, and the story is original in the English language so no awkward prose from translating!
