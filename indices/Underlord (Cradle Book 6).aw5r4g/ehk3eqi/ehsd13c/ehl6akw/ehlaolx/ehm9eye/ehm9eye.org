  Besides that, the quality of the world building and story in general is a lot better than Bleach.

Oh I definitely agree with this point, but there are a /lot/ of overlapping elements: a teenage boy getting rescued by a divine warrior who sets him on a journey to becoming powerful, a complete overhaul of the power structure once the protagonist leaves the starting area, a near-all-knowing mentor who keeps their students in the dark about his true power, powerful people pushing weaker fighters to their knees with the power of their spirit pressure, the significance of discrete power steps being emphasised only a few episodes before the protagonists beat those higher level foes in 1-on-1 combat, /"finally there are no witnesses, so I can unleash my true power"/, ... It's all there. And yet, as you mentioned, these books are a great read. The /ambiance/ of Bleach was stellar, and these books manage to capture that same spark, which I think is fantastic.
