  I think a lot of that just comes from tropes in general, or from eastern warrior magic tropes. The push-down power, the discrete power steps, revealing true power, etc.. Lots of these elements overlap between Bleach and Cradle, and other fics.

I suppose that's true. I compare it to Bleach because it's the most similar story I know and that shit was amazing as a 13-year-old, but that was literally half a life ago and I read/watched hardly anything truly similar since. What stuck with me were the narrative devices and the ambiance, both of which pop up in Cradle as well.
