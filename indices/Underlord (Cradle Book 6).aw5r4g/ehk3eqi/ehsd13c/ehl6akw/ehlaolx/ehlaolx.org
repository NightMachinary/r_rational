I think Will said that they planned Cradle to be 12 books, but it might end up being a bit longer. Also, just because Cradle will finish, doesn't mean that the story of Will's multiverse will.

Also, Cradle is like Bleach in that the main character of Cradle was designed to be half a typical shounen protagonist, half actual human being. Besides that, the quality of the world building and story in general is a /lot/ better than Bleach.

Sure, there's advancing your level of magical combat ability, but it's still really different. Unlike Bleach, where the plot was created to have as much cool sword fights as possible, Cradle's plot fits together /really/ well. There's a balance of training, fighting, interpersonal stuff, comedy, etc.. Basically, Cradle has a really good plot, while Bleach was mediocre.

Don't get me wrong, I do like Bleach, but comparing them is like comparing apples to oranges. I just hold them completely separate in my head.

Sorry, I'm just not a fan of your Bleach analogy. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
