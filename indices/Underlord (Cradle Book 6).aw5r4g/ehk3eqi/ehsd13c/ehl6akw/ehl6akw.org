For those not familiar with the series: it's basically [[https://i.imgur.com/yo0xght.jpg][Bleach]], with a pinch of sci-fi. Also, the author actually poured some effort in having the world make sense. The world building doesn't all hold up to the closest scrutiny, but there's a really satisfying story to be found if you can look past some of that.

Mild spoiler to give you an idea where we are in the story: in this book Ichigo unlocks his bankai, and in the next book he'll compete in the ChÅ«nin exams. So, about halfway towards the point where these kinds of stories /should/ stop, even though they almost never do. I'm fairly confident about this one staying on the rails and not necessarily overstaying its welcome, though.
