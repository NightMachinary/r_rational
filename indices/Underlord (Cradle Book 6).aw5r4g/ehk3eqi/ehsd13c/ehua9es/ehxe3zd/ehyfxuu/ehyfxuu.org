Mild spoilers ahead!

I got a similar impression as you did of Corin, but I feel like that's somewhat intentional on the author's part as set up for future character growth. He spent his formative years living with an abusive father, constantly being compared to an older brother who was better than him in every way, isolated from anyone close to his age, and is extremely introverted. Being passive is somewhat expected from his upbringing.

In the first book, he is manipulated by many people around him and he is constantly playing catch up to learn what everyone else knows. The second book, he is showing more initiative to find out more information, is more independent/less reliant on others, and is (a little) more social.

Considering that there is expected to be roughly 7 books in the series, I feel like Corin is meant to be passive in the beginning of the series and will become more proactive in future books as time goes on.
