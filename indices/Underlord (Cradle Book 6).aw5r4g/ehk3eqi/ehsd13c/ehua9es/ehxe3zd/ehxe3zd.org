I've been reading (and likely will continue to read) the SAM series, but it isn't nearly as good as Cradle. The protagonist is basically a passive particle to events going on around him. He doesn't do nearly as much investigation/work on using/improving his magic and as far as I can tell the plot would be nearly identical if he did nothing (basically the MC is just a glorified camera for the reader to view what's going on). It's worth a read because the world building is pretty well done and interesting and the writing isn't bad, but man does the activeness/relevance of the main character need a SERIOUS overhaul.

But, like I said, even given all that, I'm still reading it.
