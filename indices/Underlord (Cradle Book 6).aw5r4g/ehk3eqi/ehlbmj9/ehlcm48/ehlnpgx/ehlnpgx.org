[[http://gravitytales.com/novel/way-of-choices][Way of Choices]] is without a doubt one of my favorite stories and I can never recommend it enough. It is a male main character though. I will admit that it takes a little bit to get used to the writing style but once you do, it is definitely the best xianxia I have read. The writing is just stylized, not bad. It doesn't have the middle school level of writing that so many web fictions have and is actually really well put together and written. The world building is insanely good and the power progression is SO satisfying.

The top of the line godly powered characters are brought up right away and the constant power limit they represent stays constant and keeps the story grounded instead of getting ridiculous in terms of power scale. Powerful characters exist the entire time and don't just conveniently start showing up once the MC and crew are strong enough to deal with them. There is just a lot of political maneuvering and careful balances of alliances and grudges that keep everything in balance to prevent people from killing each other.

The main character starts of weak and stays weak for a LONG time but it makes it so that once he does start getting strength, it feels extremely earned. A lot of these stories have the weal MC who then gets blessed with a godly item and then turn overpowered in 2 seconds and stay overpowered for the rest of the story. Not this one, in my opinion. Plus the main character is just a really good person and satisfying to read about.

Hopefully I convinced you to try to read it and I hope you end up enjoying it.
