Forge of Destiny is a good one that I would second.

I only have a few others to recommend:

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/white-collar-cultivator.44460/][White Collar Cultivator]] was pretty good with an everyman character isekaied into a generic wukia world and with him digging into the mental differences between mortals and cultivators. He's basically using common-sense and his mastery over bureaucracy to stay alive. Unfortunately, WCC is dead so you might not like the abrupt ending.

[[https://www.wuxiaworld.co/Forty-Millenniums-of-Cultivation/][Forty Millenniums of Cultivation]] is also pretty good where they take the idea of usual Xianxia where mortals are worthless and should be discarded in pursuit of power and flips it on its head with the enlightenment ideal that everyone is worthy including the mortals. It's to the wuxia genre what HPMOR with its transhumanist ideals to Harry Potter. Here's a better written [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4zncxn/forty_millenniums_of_cultivation_%E4%BF%AE%E7%9C%9F%E5%9B%9B%E4%B8%87%E5%B9%B4_rt/][shill]] on it. Just warning you, it starts out as a very generic Xianxia story to set up tropes to subvert and hints of rationality only begins to appear around chapter #100 at the end of the first volume.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/11397/the-dao-of-magic][The Dao of Magic]] is a fantastic story about a man from Earth who seeks out to scientifically investigate Qi and wants to completely rebuild cultivation society into one where everyone isn't back-stabbing each other all the time.
