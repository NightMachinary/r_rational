A series has recently started on RR called [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21188/forge-of-destiny][Forge of Destiny]], it's an adaptation of a quest story from another site, it is /very/ good so far. Especially considering that it has a female protagonist, something that is almost unheard of in Xianxia, and if it is the case usually means that the genre is heavily diluted by very bad romance, which does not appear to be the case here.
