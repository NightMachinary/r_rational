/Deadpool/ is surprisingly good.

It's sitting at about the same score as /Ant-Man/ on rottentomatoes, and yeah, like /Ant-Man/, it isn't trying very hard.

But it's not-trying-very-hard at doing something original, while /Ant-Man/ is not-trying-very-hard at telling a bog-standard light-hearted superhero origin story. And the humor was less crap than I expected.
