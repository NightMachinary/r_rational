I was a technical support specialist for NCR for eight years, then they moved my job to Serbia. After looking for work within a sane commuting distance from my house for nearly a year, I decided that I would drive a truck for a living. It doesn't matter where I live, because I mostly live in the truck, and you can't move truck driving jobs overseas. The money is comparable.
