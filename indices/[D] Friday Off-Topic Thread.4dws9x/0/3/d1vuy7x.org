I played Factorio, but quickly became frustrated at my lack of large scale design ability. Do you have any advice for someone who keeps hitting a wall where my small scale solutions work great, but become a horrible mess when I try to integrate them all together?

I feel like I have this same problem when writing software, and I'm not quite sure what I'm missing here or how I should be thinking about the process differently.
