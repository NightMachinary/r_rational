The biggest thing you should learn to do is to create a main bus where you put the ingredients you need to make things work. [[http://i.imgur.com/yvjgVSx.jpg][Here's an example]]. So you have a river of basic ingredients running through the factory, and you pull from it with splitters and underground belt when you need them. Each assembly area can then be fairly self-contained, and the problems get a lot smaller because if you're setting up (for example) a place where you're making belts, you don't really need to think about where the inputs are coming from, because you already handled getting all the materials earlier on.

Another tip is to give yourself plenty of space. It's fun to find compact, efficient designs, but most of the time the only penalty for not using them is that you have a slightly larger space to defend. Trying to cram things in makes the logistics a lot more difficult.
