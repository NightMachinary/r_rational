Factorio reminds me a lot of three Zacktronics games: Spacechem, Infinifactory, and TIS-1000. If you enjoy Factorio's factory-making you might well enjoy one or more of those as well.

Infinifactory is a 3d first-person factory making game where you have inputs and have to create outputs by manipulating blocks with e.g. conveyor belts, lasers, rotators, welders, etc.

Spacechem is a chemisty-themed puzzle game where you have to make outputs out of inputs and do things like make water by bonding hydrogens to oxygen, or fuse hydrogens into carbon and then make carbon steel, or whatever.

TIS-1000 is a programming themed game where you have a very simple assembly language and a grid of low quality computers, and have to solve problems like finding the maximum of a string of numbers and outputting it.

If you like even one of these games I would not be surprised if you like all three.
