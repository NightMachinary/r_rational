  On this site, are you more likely to downvote a submission or to hide it?
#+end_quote

Same policy as you, basically - and the same for upvotes. I seriously have to think a submission is good/bad for a sub to bother with the extra click. I'm also more likely to vote in small subs than big ones, since I have a bigger impact and usually care more about that community.

As curious as deleted posts instinctively make me, I would have respected you less if you had shared a copy of it, and disapprove of the attempt. I support people's right to delete their own posts, because the alternative is a lot of interesting posts not getting written at all.
