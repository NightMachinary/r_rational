On [[/r/rational][r/rational]]:

I upvote all rational fiction I see, even if I'm not a reader of it, because I want to encourage authors and people who share. I also upvote the weekly discussion threads and challenges.

I tend to downvote discussion threads like "Rational X???" since I want to signal boost content over discussion. However, I will upvote or ignore these threads sometimes if they are good or if the author's post is very good. I tend to ignore (neither upvote nor downvote) very few threads. I almost always vote.

Of the current 25 highest posts (sorted by hot) on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] I have upvoted all of them, except Orange Mind, Indie Fund, Interesting Study, and Rationalist Diablo???-- this is a usual rate of upvoting, 85%, for me.
