...that's both hilarious and kinda sad.

Searching for "peridexis", I appear to hold results 1, 2, 4, and 6. The rest are from source material, plus someone on Tumblr (why??). Related searches include "Tarn Adams" and "Dwarf Fortress donations", OK. Google autocompletes "peridex" to "peridexiserrant"... I guess it's a rare stem.

I suppose at least it's a recognisable name?
