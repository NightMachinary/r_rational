My last name has too many vowels and nobody can ever spell it. Also, I have church affiliations. So "Call me Brother G" works a lot better than "Call me Brother [apparently unpronounceable gibbering from beyond the stars]."

I also use it for my email.

Honestly, I'm thinking of changing it (in particular I'm a little less fond of the religious affiliations and broadcasting them now), but I'm not sure if it would be worth the trouble to change my username all over the web. Of course, every time I start a new account, the problem just becomes that much worse, so... >.>

(Also I'm not sure what I'd change it /too/, either. Maybe "NoIDon'tWriteTheReckoningImJustPostingLinksToItWhenItUpdates." >:P )
