/Toa/ is the title of the heroes of LEGO's old [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Bionicle][Bionicle]] series of merchandise. I greatly enjoyed the complex toys, beautiful comics, and well-written books that made up the franchise.

/Kraka/ is a reference to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krakatoa][Krakatoa]], whose location is related to the last name of the first person whose pursuit I attempted after my entrance into society. (It's also a tangential reference to the Bionicle character [[http://biosector01.com/wiki/index.php/Krahka][Krahka]].)
