Several years ago I was making my first character on World of Warcraft and couldn't think of a good name. So I decided to just hit the name randomizer and got Luminnaran. For about two years my only real use of the internet was playing WoW so I began to think of "Luminnaran" less as a character in WoW and more as simply my internet identity.

After that I started using Luminnaran as my name everywhere online and and so when I joined reddit (I was a pretty late adopter of reddit as my main source of information) it was an obvious choice to simply continue using the same internet name I had been using for years.
