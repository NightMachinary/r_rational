I tend to like user names that could be a real name as well. In addition, I first found this subreddit through alexanderwale's story 'The Last Christmas' so I went with a firstlast name format as a subtle way to honor him.

Xamuel is because I also like slightly unusual names, so I tend to take a common name and switch out one of the letters with a less common letter like X, Y, Z, Q, or V. So Mark will become Marq, Richard is Rivard, and Samuel becomes Xamuel.
