Curse of most shonen titles. One Piece handles that particular thing pretty well.

I think Soma will lose, and have to join Central. Current first seat is a third year, meaning he has a few months left before graduation (Japanese high school is 3 yrs long), which could be like a second Stagiaire arc, give some more characterisation to Central mooks and E10, and radically shift the status quo.

Realistic estimate would be that Souma doesn't get a seat in E10 until his second year. Jewel generation or not, he's still got a lot to learn. Azami could be the first major villain, but I don't know how the next one, if there's going to be one, would top him as a threat. I just hope he doesn't get Aizen'd
