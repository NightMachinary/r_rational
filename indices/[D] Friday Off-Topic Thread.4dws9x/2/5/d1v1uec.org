when I was a teenager and way too edgy I was also a fan of latin and gaelic and linguistics.

So I made a horrible pidgen mash of mostly latin words that somewhat means "lord/lordess of the night/twilight land something something bugs"

It has since then served me VERY WELL for maintaining a consistent username everywhere.

Prior to that I liked unpronounceable cosmic horror type names for my usernames but what pre-pubescent kid doesn't?
