I've used full-blown suites (e.g. ViaVoice, Dragon) and the speech recognition built into Windows Vista/7/etc.

Full blown suite:

- Pro: Generally better accuracy, definitely works well if you'll do this all the time (e.g. medical dictation)
- Con: Learning curve, cost (can be pretty expensive), common assumption is that you're using a fancy noise-cancelling microphone

Windows Speech Recognition:

- Pro: Free, pretty good results
- Con: Dictionary isn't as big (you'll find yourself adding words a lot in the beginning)

In all cases, assuming that you'll be using speech to text for >2 days and using it as a full replacement during that time, I strongly recommend getting a noise cancelling headset microphone. You don't need to get a super expensive one. The 2 priorities are:

1. Get audio from as close to your mouth as possible
2. Get rid of background noise

If you normally listen to music, then make sure you get one with headphones. :)

Something like [[http://www.amazon.com/Plantronics-PLNAUDIO478-Stereo-USB-Headset/dp/B005VAORH6/]] ($25) will be fine.
