Does anyone have any experience with +text-to-speech+ speech-to-text for large quantities of text? I burned my hand pretty badly today which has slowed down my typing considerably, and I have a limited supply of powerful painkillers that I don't think will last me through the entire healing process so probably won't want to do even slow typing towards the end of it. (This would be for prose fiction, if that makes a difference.)
