I think there's a better example but I can't recall it.

If you have a .edu e-mail address, or know someone who does, their requests will be taken much more seriously. The best approach, though, is to call a professor during office hours and ask for an in-person appointment to go over your idea. Make it clear you think it has merit, are pursuing a patent, and are genuinely looking for a technical evaluation of whether you should continue pursuing its promotion or give it up as a waste of time, as you have other things you could be doing. I don't know if your job would allow you the time to do that, however.
