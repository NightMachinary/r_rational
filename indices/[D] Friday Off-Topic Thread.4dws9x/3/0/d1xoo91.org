I assume you don't have the time, skills, or funds to create an appealing video that explains the idea well. Do a small Kickstarter for those funds, then hire someone to make that video. Then do a huge Kickstarter promising increasing levels of involvement with getting the idea into some phase of production, mainly by making contact with you a scarce commodity. The goal of the huge Kickstarter will be to generate media attention, and the attention of Elon Musk or his competitor-colleagues in private and governmental space travel. Say you need the money in order to be able to spend your time getting the idea into some phase of production, and that all leftover will go straight to making the project not so large of a money sink for whatever entity decides to invest in the idea.

Again, the idea is to get PR and funding so you can spend more time getting access to people with the power to get it done.

An easier route might be pm'ing Eliezer this comment, asking if he's still in contact with Peter Thiel, who can then be the power broker between you and Elon Musk. Before that, e-mail one or a few respected Professor(s) of the pertinent field your patent and the idea, asking if they would invest in it had they the funds, or just what they think of the idea. Use that to get enough credibility to make clear to the power broker that the risk of embarrassment and time wasting is low.

Another way would be e-mailing engineers at SpaceX, NASA, etc. your patent and the idea, requesting they bring it up to their superiors if they find the idea something worth pursuing. Before that, though, you need to decide what deal you are comfortable accepting.
