A method patent is much the same as a device patent. The smaller the actors are who implement the patented idea/item, the harder it is to enforce.

For example, if you try to patent something like tying little balloons into dog-shaped knots, you probably aren't going to be able to enforce it, even if it is valid. Every clown in the universe would ignore your patent. The balloon makers can't be held responsible either, they just make balloons.

Now, if you were to patent a new eating utensil, you wouldn't try to enforce the patent on people using them, you would enforce it on people making and selling the utensils.

In my case, there are very few actors involved in the space propulsion industry.
