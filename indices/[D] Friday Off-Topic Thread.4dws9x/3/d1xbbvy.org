Well, I don't have a new load until tomorrow at 1100 EST, so I have a little time to think.

I am closing in on acquiring a patent for what might literally be a game-changing space propulsion method, that can utilize pre-existing space-proven fuel-based propulsion technologies to perform interplanetary-range missions both rapidly enough for commercial exploitation and more efficiently than any current rocketry method. My last examiner interaction was an Ex Parte Quayle action, meaning it was patentable, but I had some cleanup on non-claim issues to take care of. That claim had too many limitations, due to my only recently determining how to use wording in a claim to more precisely define my claim. I have resubmitted, with a couple earlier limitations removed.

I believe I will have the patent in a few months. Supposing nobody comes forward with a publication that predates my patent application process, but was overlooked by the entire space propulsion community, what in the heck am I going to do with it?

I have no meaningful ties to anyone in the space science community. I have no experience with dealing with a patent. I'm afraid to sell the thing, because I don't want it locked in a box by some corporation. I don't particularly want to administer the thing (no experience, again.)

I'm also refusing to allow myself to look too forward and collect eggs for only one basket. As I mentioned in a recent thread, I'm currently a professional truck driver, and that's not changing until I get other money in hand, if this ever generates income. The return from this could be anywhere from zero to licensing fees that might mean I never have to work again.

I have considered a Kickstarter to put it into public domain, but I have my doubts about how well that would actually work, and what I'd offer for rewards and stretch goals.

I'm also considering holding onto it, pinching my nose, and dealing with lawyers and licensing agents to administer the thing, because I know I can trust myself to not lock it in a box somewhere.

Anyone here know of an example of an outsider in a field generating a game-breaking patent, and not making a horrible mash of introducing/administering it?

I'll say again, that I do not have the patent yet, but every office action gets me closer. The concept is patentable, it's a matter of what limits I'll be forced to accept.
