I've used Dragon Naturally Speaking when I was in high school, but there is a learning curve to figure how to add punctuation like periods, commas, question marks, apostrophe, and so on, and I don't remember what I did besides manually editing them in afterwards. Probably, programmed it to automatically translate certain spoken phrases into a punctuation mark like "add period" -> . and "add comma" -> , or something like that.

You also have to speak clearly and at a steady pace which takes a little practice. I suspect that it's good training if one wanted to make audiobooks.
