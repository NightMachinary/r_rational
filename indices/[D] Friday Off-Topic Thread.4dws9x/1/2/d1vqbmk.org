I really liked it. Sure, he's a bit short-sighted, but you could say the same of pretty much any movie protagonist. Not every story can be rational, just like not every story can be a romance, or a space opera; some stories in possibility space are both good and rationality-incompatible. The protagonist's antics are funny, and there's a lot you only get to learn about the world and the characters by seeing how they act in different timelines.

Also, your feminist critique rubs me the wrong way. A big part of the story is the father-son relationship, which would be lost somewhat if it were a father-son-daughter-mother relationship. Not to say that the alternate universe gender-inclusive It's About Time wouldn't be good too, but they're /different movies/, and I hate it when people act like the writer and director are committing some kind of cosmic wrong by making the movie they want to make instead of a similar movie with the same characters but an entirely different plot.
