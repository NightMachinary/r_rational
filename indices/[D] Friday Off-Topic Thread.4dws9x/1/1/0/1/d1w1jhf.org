The problem is that it doesn't make any sense for the world to secretly be ruled by time travelers because such a world would be so vastly (and obviously) different from our own.

Effectively by piggybacking information arbitrarily far back into the past it seems inevitable that as soon as you get some time travelers who know what the hell they're doing, you will almost inevitably get a singularity, spreading back as far as anyone has had these powers.

But that's kind of how things go, with nearly any setting with any time travel that can do much.

As for the trigger thing, well i'm not sure just being depressing is really a "trigger" so i'm not sure such a thing would exist. Still i've heard a lot of people complain about movies that totally blindside you by suddenly getting seriously sad part way through. The classic example is marley and me, which I never saw for that reason. I mean can you imagine if a massive number of comedies turned into horror films part way through.
