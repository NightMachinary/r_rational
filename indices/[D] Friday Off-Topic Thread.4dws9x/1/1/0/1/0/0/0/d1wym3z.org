  I've never really quite understood why movies deliberately try to be sad, I don't really see sadness having any redeeming value

I don't know why /most/ people watch stuff like that, but I have bipolar and shows like Bojack Horseman are very cathartic for me inasmuch as they reflect my subjective state onto the screen. Being able to see Bojack or Rick Sanchez spiral into self-destructive behaviors and suicidal ideation is a (probably very odd) form of validation: by their very existence, these shows remind me that I'm not alone in this, and some people really /do/ understand, whether because they experience it themselves or because they're just really empathetic.

(It helps that Bojack Horseman and R&M are both hilarious as well, but that isn't essential for the catharsis and feeling of being understood)

Like I said, though, I don't know why /most/ people would like sad stuff.
