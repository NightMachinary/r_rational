I thought basically the same thing while watching the movie. The character doesn't have to be a rationalist to actually use their abilities in a remotely clever way.

The thing about this kind of movie is that the makers clearly wanted to tell a particular kind of story, that had nothing to do with the time travel aspect, and as a result the time travel was never fully explored.

To people with strong munchkin instincts something in a movie with immense implications not being well utilized can be very frustrating but alas we must put up with most movie protagonists being about as smart as a average middle schooler.

As a unrelated point I really wish it was standard to include a tag for movies that are depressing af.
