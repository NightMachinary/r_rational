I'm actually more physically active, and eat less on the truck. I've lost a few pounds. Not a lot, but it's been fairly steady weight loss. Trucks these days have much better suspension and seats than older trucks which would cause serious lower back issues due to vibration. There is the repetitive exposure to diesel fuel, but the tanks of the truck are large enough that I refuel less often than I did when I did local service work.
