Since becoming a professional truck driver, I have become painfully aware of how irrational the motoring public is. Every single day, usually at least two or three times a day, people in normal-sized vehicles do things around me that, if I were paying less attention, could have resulted in a metal omelette with human-filling.

Less than two hours ago someone in a little 2-door grey import crossover of some sort cut in front of me at 60+ miles per hour, so close that their passenger rear bumper was obscured by my hood.

One tire on my truck supports, on average, up to 4400+ pounds. The front two wheels routinely carry 6000+ pounds per wheel. People do NOT respect big trucks enough.
