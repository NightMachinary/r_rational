I'm actually in the process of re-booting it as a slightly more standard webcomic-ish thing to help polish the pacing, give the characters room to breath and over all overcome some of the production issues I was getting.

It's still planned to be interactive, but the stages of interactivity are initially going to be a bit low while I get the 'establishing fiction' up and then will be a more episodic 'slice of weird-life' that can get a lot more input after everyone has had some time for things to sink in how the world/characters work.

Otherwise ya, it's dead as far as a forum adventure project. If you'd like to be involved/read the rough draft I'm in process of writing scripts and then later will be doing story boards/illustrations etc for several months to come.
