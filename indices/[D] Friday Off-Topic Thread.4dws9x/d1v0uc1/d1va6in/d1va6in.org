The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roxolani][Roxolani]] were a bunch of Eastern European nomads. Not particularly notable; they bothered the Romans a bit until the Huns ate them. You might cross swords with them in /Total War: Rome 2/.

My father mentioned them when I was a kid looking for a pseudonym, I liked the name, kept it ever since.
