During the Final Exam, it was noted that we hadn't seen Cedric Diggory in a while and also that he likely had a time turner to be able to do all the things be was doing. It was therefore inferred through logic which was /totally reasonable/ that there were some number of time-turned Cedrices Diggory transfigured into Harry's glasses (which had conveniently been left on his face due to a sticking charm), which would appear and leap into action as soon as his glasses were finite'd.
