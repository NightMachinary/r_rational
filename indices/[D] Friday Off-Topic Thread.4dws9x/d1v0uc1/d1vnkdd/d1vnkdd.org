My name is derived from the fictional son of a fictional character I created when I was around 6-7, Hishoto. I once used it as a name but forgot the password, so I had to use the name Kishoto. I liked how it sounded better so Kishoto persisted as the name I use everywhere. Google Kishoto and most of those results will be me.
