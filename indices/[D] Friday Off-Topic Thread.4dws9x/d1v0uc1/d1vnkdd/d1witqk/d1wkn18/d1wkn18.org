Well this IS the off topic thread, lol.

I thought it was interesting. Kinda frustrated we didn't get a clear answer to whether Soma will or will not join Central. And, with the setup to a shokugeki between the two, I'm now almost 100% certain one of two things will happen: (1) Soma loses and works for Central (2) Something will happen to invalidate/postpone the shokugeki. There's simply no way, thematically, Soma can win this match, which is annoying to me as I really hate matches with foregone conclusions, which is what this one is. Although, to be fair, most of the important shokugekis are that way. Like, anytime we see Soma betting his expulsion, we know he's either going to win or get out of it somehow, which removes a lot of the tension from what should be an epic moment.
