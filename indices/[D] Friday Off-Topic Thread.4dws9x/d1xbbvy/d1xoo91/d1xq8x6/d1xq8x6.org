I have considered approaches similar to what you've outlined, but I won't/can't act on them until I have the patent.

Would a kickstarter like that even generate interest? I could probably get a video made by the time I have the patent, but most of what I see done in kickstarters is media. Games/books/etc.

The direct contact with professors or industry professionals can be dauntingly hard to manage. Think about how many crackpots try to sell them new ideas. They are going to paint me with crackpot brush unless I have some sort of credentials, or a really good hook. I've already cautiously approached several, and not even one response. I've even written a book about the idea and published it for free, and only gotten a response from one science writer, who said she wanted to write an article on it, but was told no by her editor because the editor refused to believe it was valid that nobody had thought of it before. /shrug/
