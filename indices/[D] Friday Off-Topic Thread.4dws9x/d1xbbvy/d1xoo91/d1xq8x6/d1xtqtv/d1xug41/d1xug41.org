I've bookmarked the link and will examine it more closely, to see what they did and how.

I don't have access to a .edu email address. The idea of just calling a professor out of the blue during their office hours when I'm not a student? Hmm. I hadn't considered that. I don't know why I hadn't considered that. Perhaps some sort of subconscious thought that professors are for students, not for the public. However, I know they do frequently work outside academia on other projects and research, so I've missed an option. Thank you Next time I get a week of home time, I might try that.
