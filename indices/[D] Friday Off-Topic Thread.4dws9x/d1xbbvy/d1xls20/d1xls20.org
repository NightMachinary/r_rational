I did some Googling and found an article about a movie star who got a [[https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2010/07/25/hedy-lamarr-the-inventor/][patent]] which helped significantly in WWII. It was probably easier for her due to having the fame to make connections with the relevant people, but she was still an outsider.

I have a question about patents. If you are the 'owner' of an idea, does that mean people can't use the concept in their own projects without your permission, or they just can't use it to make money, or what? It's just very confusing on how one can 'control' an idea and I can't find anything which explains it clearly enough for me.

Thanks!
