/On this site, are you more likely to downvote a submission or to hide it?/

When I browse [[/r/all][r/all]], I typically upvote between five and fifteen percent of the submissions and hide all the others, starting from the top and working my way downward through a fifty-item page before refreshing and starting again (until I get bored, which typically takes only one or two pages). Downvotes are relatively rare, and are reserved for items that I /thoroughly/ dislike--most often, something from [[/r/UpliftingNews][r/UpliftingNews]] concerning money that's being spent on animals. I sometimes think that I should be more strategic and downvote /everything/ that I consider to have risen above its proper station, though, rather than merely hiding it from my sight.

Mr. Yudkowsky made a fairly-funny post on Facebook making light of [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/04/04/the-ideology-is-not-the-movement][Mr. Alexander's facetiously calling him the rightful Caliph of Rationality]]--but then [[http://slatestarscratchpad.tumblr.com/post/142425293256][he deleted it]]. When I originally saw it, I considered making a screenshot of it, but decided against it, considering it not funny enough to be worth much [[http://www.ckiiwiki.com/Prestige][prestige]] here (let alone funny enough for me to save for my personal satisfaction)--and now it's lost forever. Sigh... Well, I guess I'll be less complacent in the future.

Anyway--now that I've written so much about this post, I might as well take a stab at seeing what I can remember of it:

  Apparently, I have been anointed the Caliph of Rationality. This means that I obviously deserve a harem. If you sleep with me, you will get a free T-shirt with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yodh][a large "Yud" character]] on it. /(Editor's note: For context, he previously made [[http://i.imgur.com/YoJACyY.png][another post]] decrying how, even though he himself would be excoriated for selling such shirts, other people currently are making them without his input.)/ Use one of the following Facebook reactions according to your opinion of this development...

  #+begin_quote
    *Like:* "Nah. You're my caliph, but not /that/ kind of caliph."

    *Love:* "In a heartbeat!"

    *Haha:* /(Something that this editor doesn't remember.)/

    *Wow:* /(A "squee" fangirl-type exclamation that this editor doesn't remember well enough to do justice to.)/

    *Sad:* "Maybe later, after I transition."

    *Angry:* "I've already slept with you! Where's my T-shirt?!"

It can't be denied that [[http://www.fimfiction.net/index.php?view=category&user=1291][Chatoyance]], of so much infamy in the /Friendship Is Magic/ fandom, has been a very prolific creator--and it always bears remembering that, even if you dislike the /majority/ of a person's work, there may still be /something/ of interest to you buried deep within his accumulated corpus. Several years ago (well before the start of /Friendship Is Magic/, I think), I somehow happened to stumble on [[http://unicornjelly.com][this ancient comic]], which was started by her way all the way back in 2000. I vaguely remember reading several dozen pages of it before getting confused/bored/something and leaving the site--but the art definitely is /quite/ exquisite. Likewise, I personally didn't have too much liking for the art style of [[http://pasteldefender.com][this other comic of hers]], and dropped it after not too many pages, but I did find the worldbuilding ([[http://pasteldefender.com/images/007.jpg][this panel]], at the very least) to be fairly interesting.

(Unlike FanFiction.net, FIMFiction.net lacks ID-based links to authors' profiles--so, if I link directly to a person's FIMFiction.net profile, that link will break if the person changes his profile's name. Sigh...)
