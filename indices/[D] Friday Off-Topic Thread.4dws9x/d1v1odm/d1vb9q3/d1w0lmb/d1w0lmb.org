  I would have respected you less if you had shared a copy of it, and disapprove of the attempt. I support people's right to delete their own posts, because the alternative is a lot of interesting posts not getting written at all.

Hmm, bear with me. Isn't it a bit entitled to inform that you'd be basing your respect of a person on something like this? I mean, support it as a right if that's your stance, sure, but that doesn't mean that others can't similarly support the right to archiving things that have been openly posted on the internet. And informing people that you'd be respecting them less if they did so seems like a counter-productive way of defending your position on the issue.

That is, saying “I would have respected you less if you had shared a copy of [openly accessible piece of opinion]” is akin to saying the same about someone uploading pictures\videos of someone soapboxing on a public property.
