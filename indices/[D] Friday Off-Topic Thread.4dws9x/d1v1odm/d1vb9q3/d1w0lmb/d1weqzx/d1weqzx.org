It seemed like the right choice of words to communicate with [[/u/ToaKraka]], given what I know of him and how he relates to people. He has my apologies if I misjudged. I would not necessarily have used those exact words with someone else.

As for the object-level issue,

  the right to archiving things that have been openly posted on the internet.

Although this has its appeal, I think that on the whole it does more damage than respecting other people's deletions.

People sometimes have brain farts or emotional outbursts and say things they immediately regret. Or they change their minds and would rather prevent confusion regarding their current stance. Or (like Yudkowsky) they're famous enough that their every word might get scrutinized by people who don't have their best interests in mind.

When someone doesn't respect self-deletions, they make people more vulnerable to those things. So people are more likely to just not post potentially controversial things in the first place, and the conversation is poorer for it.

If the deleted post was super interesting (as happened on another recent occasion in the LW diaspora), then I can at least see the case for sharing the copy. But this is just a bit of humor and opportunity for gossip.
