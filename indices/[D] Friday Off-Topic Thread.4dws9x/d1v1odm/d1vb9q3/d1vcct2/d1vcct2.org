  News to me, I can read it through feedly just fine.

About a year ago, the author [[http://tailsteak.com/reviews/woohooligan.html][mentioned]] that he should do things that respectable webcomic authors did, including setting up a working RSS feed. At that time, the RSS feed had stopped working. Now that I check on Feedly again, I see both a dead feed (last updated almost two years ago) and a live one, which I assume was set up more recently than when I last checked.
