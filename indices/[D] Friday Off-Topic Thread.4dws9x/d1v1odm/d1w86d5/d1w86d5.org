  Mr. Yudkowsky made a fairly-funny post on Facebook making light of Mr. Alexander's facetiously calling him the rightful Caliph of Rationality--but then he deleted it. When I originally saw it, I considered making a screenshot of it, but decided against it, considering it not funny enough to be worth much prestige here (let alone funny enough for me to save for my personal satisfaction)--and now it's lost forever. Sigh... Well, I guess I'll be less complacent in the future.

Also, not saving other people's stuff against their will when they decide to delete it is polite. Also, there wasn't a reaction face for, "I'm pretty sure 'rationality' shouldn't have a caliph"? Or for, "HERESY!"? Come on, man, where's my HERESYBLAM icon when I need it?
