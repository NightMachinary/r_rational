Thanks! From what I gather, Butlers are specialized servants/bodyguards that can be members of the Thieves Guild (Price's tag is Savvy, I believe, and Shook's teacher had a Butler as well) but aren't necessarily associated with them (I think Branwen had a Butler who was killed in the Black Wreath attack).
