I believe it's mentioned later on that Butlers are created in a process similar to the Hands of the Emperor. Future books do reveal how the Hands are made, but telling you now would spoil the reveal. We don't have much info on the Butler's though, so my best, vague guess is that it involves Nature magic and Old God technology. The result seems to be that Butlers retain more individuality than Hands, but likely lack the level of power Hands wiele. Still strong, but not one-man army strong. What I'd really like to know is why the Empire allows Butlers to remain independent agents if this is the case, though. Seems like a resource that Sharidan's mother would have snatched up.
