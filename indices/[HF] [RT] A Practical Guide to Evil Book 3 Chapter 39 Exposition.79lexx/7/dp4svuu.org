I wonder if the shape of things to come will involve Kat turning the Empire into its own redemption story, thereby defying Bard's plans by subverting the Good vs. Evil and Heroes vs. Villains narrative dictated by the Gods (who I suspect Bard is or works for) into something new and more complex. The Empire has already become a better place than the Good kingdoms in a variety of ways, and Kat has recruited two heroes to her party to create a story where heroes and villains are working side by side.

Ultimately I think this comes down to Kat finding a way to end the Gods' imposition of their story onto all the mortals. That stupid endless Good vs. Evil conflict is the root of all the problems.
