It feels like Cat is kind of "catching up" with what her plan was from the start. Like, from day one, her plan was "unify Callow and Praes", and her method has always been "find a common enemy to point them at".

I guess it's great that it's progressively hitting her that this strategy is super unstable and potentially disastrous.
