By the way, I love this line:

#+begin_quote
  “The custom exists,” she said. “But only Praesi think it's common. If a couple needs to fight to choose who'll raise the child, they shouldn't be having children. It's a sign of immaturity.”
#+end_quote

I'm not sure how to put it, but it's great. It summarizes everything I think about culture, how we perceive it, and how we relate to it as individuals.

"Yeah, there are people who get into a ritual duel to settle who will raise their child. Specifically, morons who think 'having (the orc version of) pubic hair' is equivalent to 'being an adult'. Actual adults talk about it like fucking sentient beings."
