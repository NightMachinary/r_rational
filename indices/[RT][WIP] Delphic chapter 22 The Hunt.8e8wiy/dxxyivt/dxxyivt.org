Book One is nearly complete. Likely two more regular chapters and an epilogue.

For those who are enjoying the story, I'd greatly appreciate further feedback as I'm plotting out the arcs going forward. What elements worked best for you, and what elements strained your credibility? Where would you like me to focus the narrative next - superhero support, crime investigation, Paris, Eutopia?

I'll be continuing this narrative, in some form, into the foreseeable future. Let me know what you think.
