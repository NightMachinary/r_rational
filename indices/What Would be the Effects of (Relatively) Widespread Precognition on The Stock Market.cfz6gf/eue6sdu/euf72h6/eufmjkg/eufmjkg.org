Yes exactly, that's the conclusion I got to as well. Selling it as an insurance product would work as far as marketing goes, and the company could do the integration for the client. But I think the smart companies could go farther and do their own integrations with some sort of cryptographic structure. I'm thinking of those companies that submit anonymized data for anyone to find insights into. But in this case it could just be a totally anonymized thing. Just a string like "984562 -> BANANA ELEPHANT BASEBALL", that only the client would even know what it meant.

Like with most time fuckery, institutionalized pre-commitement is very powerful.

Also the pricing model would be pretty opaque. I would almost worry it would have the problems IT does with the "what am I even paying you for if everything works right all the time". But in the end like with IT those companies will fail.
