What value would you place on the solution to cold fusion?

A Precog bootstrap feedback loop, where a Precog cannot reliably determine if and what actions they must undertake to see their precognition come to fruition, does not prohibit or even inhibit a Precog's ability to gather factual data.

If I'm a Precog, and I see an announcement one hour into the future that cold fusion has been solved via the liberal application of spray cheese in hexagonal fractals, then that information is just as valid now as it is in the future despite anything I could possibly do. It is a fact of reality, and will be true as surely as 2 + 2 = 4.

Is cold fusion not solved within the hour? Do I not have another Precog event within the hour to chain into a longer lookahead period?

Just recruit a bunch of Precogs, equip them with Google Glass and a shared text box, then have them share the most recent Precog event (filtering out useless information). Boom, infinite look ahead period. Cold fusion solved.

The only way to prevent bootstrapping via chaining precognitive events is to disallow Precog event overlap across all subjects. At least that's the most concise thought I've had in the past hour on this subject.
