Some quick thoughts:

1. You're probably going to get some kind of legislation / regulations relating to precogs. People with power would prefer to keep that power rather lose it to precogs, so I wouldn't be surprised by some kind of licensing system which prevents precogs from striking out on their own rather than working for other people.

2. I am not an economist, so take this with a huge grain of salt and ignore it if someone with better credentials comes along, but there will probably be an initial period of extreme chaos, followed by a period of stability which follows the same general patterns currently seen in Wall Street's ebbs and flows, but centered on the interactions between precog traders rather non-precog traders.

3. This probably means that, while things will shake out into some kind of equilibrium, it will be more volatile than the original state of affairs (only precogs are actors in the "future futures market" = fewer actors than the original futures market = individual variance counts for a lot more).

4. [[https://www.kurzweilai.net/when-the-speed-of-light-is-too-slow][Check this out]] and follow links and so forth as appropriate. There are some interesting parallels, if you substitute "delays in communication" for "variability in precog strength."
