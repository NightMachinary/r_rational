I can almost agree with you. Most people just don't have the temperment to become an oligarch. However, you only need a few. The large majority of power is excercised through lobbying, donation, and aquaintance with those in power. Any super who has a power exploitable for money (and I think there'll be quite a few). There are ~70000 people in the world that are in the 99th percentile of power in the world, and ~32000 in america. That's a lot of potential oligarchs, and they're going to have a huge societal impact merely from celebrity.
