I think the key question is whether a precog can bootstrap: can they write themselves letters from the deep future by copying a letter copied by a future self looking deeper into the future?

If so, all societal decision making suddenly become very weird, and you'll end up with a lot of these guys investing in small-time start-ups that become huge.

​

If not, as the linkage between the financial markets and the real markets happens mostly at a +1 day timescale (outside of the commodity, currency and power markets, I believe - HF traders don't have very much effect on the real world outside of second or third order effects), I suspect it won't really matter.

​

Finally, even if it did matter, you've defined a total ordering on precogs over any time horizon: of all the one-second time horizon precogs, they are the best. Citadel or some other large fund will hire them, use them to monetise trading on AAPL and other large tickers, and they'll likely have the same effect as high frequency traders did - more efficient markets over that time horizon.

​

And finally, failing all of these: precogs just give you certainty over having information which is more likely: I strongly suspect this is mostly unexciting in the context of financial markets. See how insider trading is illegal because it reduces liquidity (people don't want to trade against people who might know more than them), but as far as I understand, most models say that it would just make things a little more volatile, rather than cause any blow-ups.
