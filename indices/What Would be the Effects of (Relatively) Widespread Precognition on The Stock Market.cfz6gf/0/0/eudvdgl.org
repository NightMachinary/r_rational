It is kind of hard to imagine a world where they can't bootstrap, yet they are also useful on the stock market. But you are right, bootstrapping makes things really weird.

For example:

Precogs see that company A is going to have a bad financial report and the stock is going to tank tomorrow. They act on that information today, and the stock tanks a day early.

But that should mean that the precogs saw the stock tank the day before. So they should act on the information two days in advance. This bootstrapping should keep extending. Until you get companies never getting first-round funding because they have a bad financial report six years out.

I guess one way to disentangle precog predictions with the effect of their predictions, is that there is a single global defined time when the predictions are relevant. At 9 am east coast time they all receive their precog vision of what the world will look like tomorrow at 8:59 am, based solely on how the world looked at 8:59 am east coast time today. That way it is impossible to have a predict => alter actions => re-predict feedback loop.
