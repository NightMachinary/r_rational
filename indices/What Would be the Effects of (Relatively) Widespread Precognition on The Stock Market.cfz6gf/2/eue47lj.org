I'm going to ignore bootstrapping, because it's hax and vastly complicates things.

  What major effects would the employment of precognition by financial actors have on markets? Would markets be exploitable to precogs?

You're making a bold presumption that markets would be exploitable by Precogs when you haven't deliberated as to whether this would be the best use of their time and abilities.

Why wouldn't a precog just hang out at a casino and place winning bets? Gamble? Play the lottery? Or, perform equivalent tasks that actually benefit society. A precog could have prevented the Challenger from exploding, if positioned and used correctly.

That said, precogs would not significantly change financial markets from their current state, in my opinion.

Look into [[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/high-frequency-trading.asp][High-Frequency Trading]], specifically [[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/042414/youd-better-know-your-highfrequency-trading-terminology.asp#latency][Latency Arbitrage]]. Throwing precogs into the mix would just be high/er/ frequency trading, it would create a more efficient allocation of resources in the stock market but the world would carry on as normal.
