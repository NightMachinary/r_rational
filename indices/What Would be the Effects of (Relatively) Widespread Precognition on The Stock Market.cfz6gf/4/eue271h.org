You make the incorrect assumption it would look different. In the real world, people in the financial markets act with foreknowledge all the time. Let me say it again, all the time. Often with perfect accuracy and much more than a day into the future.

Best uses for precognition in a Merrill Lynch company. A. Validating rumors. Filtering out a small percent of fake rumors from true is money saved/made. Telepathy and the like aren't much help with verifying unsourced rumors

B. Preventing disaster. Many a company has been badly damaged from a single bad trade. Have someone whose one job is to catch the accidental billion dollar loss an hour before it happens. Imagine the precog is just watch the stock price of her own company. It suddenly drops. The precog hits a button. All trading halts, the future of company stock price stabilizes with a minor decline. Now the auditors come in. What was about to happen? Bad trade, fraud, a typo in a press release.
