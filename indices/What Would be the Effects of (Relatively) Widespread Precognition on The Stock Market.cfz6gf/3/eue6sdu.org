I agree with [[/u/baskaransri]], no major effects on markets outside of what HFT do. They could probably make a tidy profit, maybe increase volatility a bit.

I suspect they would be more useful on the corporate side of the equation. Massive system failures, and so on could all be predicted against. Most engineers can write a post morteum slack message within five minutes of the error, upon seeing it the precog could call the engineering department and stop them from making the mistake, or prevent them from screwing up the recovery. The precog could even be hidden behind a "site reliability tiger team" group that just happens to stop people from typing commands that break the system. For reference a minute of downtime is in the mid 6 figures, if the precog fixes 1 minute of downtime they already have a comfortable salary.

I suspect emergency response, military concerns, and so on would also have better uses for them they would be willing to payout the ear for. Hell even at 1 minute range a precog could probably stop blackouts, train collisions, and so on given enough access to information and button to push to stop it. In the modern world I would make a startup focused on hiring four one hour precogs (give them each a 20% share) and building a software system of anonymized clients where they are automatically given information from alerts from clients along the lines of "Client Y: X happened because Z", and then they would type back into their terminal "16252, Z causes X" and it messages the client back. I think that would be a billion dollar business.
