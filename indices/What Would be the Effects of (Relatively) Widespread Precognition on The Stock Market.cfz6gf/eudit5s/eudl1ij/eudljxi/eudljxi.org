Only supers have intrinsic power, but people with lots of money still have a power which (1) they would like to keep and (2) supers should not underestimate. Your average precog with a range of one minute is probably not going to beat Jeff Bezos, if Jeff Bezos wants to lobby Congress to rig the system so that precogs can't freelance.

(Precogs with very long ranges would have a better chance here, but some of those might decide to screw over their less powerful peers for some personal advantage, so it's really up to the individuals in question here).

Given the short ranges involved for most precogs, I think it's more likely that they'll find themselves working for oligarchs rather than becoming oligarchs.
