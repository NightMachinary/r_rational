For your first note, something ypu should understand is that you have it backwards. /Only/ supers have intrinsic power. A super, no matter if they're in the gutter or a palace, is just fundamentally superior to a normal human.

Judging by the dynamics of our current society, where a small oligarchy of ultra wealthy corporations and individuals are capable controlling our government, supers would have no issue slotting themselves into that powerstructure, whether through mere celebrity or the kind of leverage afforded by precognition.
