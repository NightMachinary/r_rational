I'd be willing to bet the government would just put a heavy tax on capital gains for terms of less than a year, and test every confirmed precog, and pay a lot of attention to the lifestyle of the few capable of seeing past 1 year, and either tax or fine them for using or sharing information of that sort.

They'd probably be mandated to serve in the military, safety or other governmental positions.

Mostly if I'm right, volatility goes down because daytraders can't make much money even if they wanted to, or to do it they'd need to hold positions for over a year. It'd probably be regulated in an overly enthusiastic manner, causing unforeseen consequences that are harmful long term to stop exploitation right now.
