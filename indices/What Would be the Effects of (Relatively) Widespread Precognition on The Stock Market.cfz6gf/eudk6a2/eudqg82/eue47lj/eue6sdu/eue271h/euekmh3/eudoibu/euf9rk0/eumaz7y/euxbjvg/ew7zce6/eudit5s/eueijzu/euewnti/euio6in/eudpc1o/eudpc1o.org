Bullet 4 would eliminate most of the precogs from the stock market. It operates on a time scale of years, not minutes, and the short term manipulation a precog might be capable of would be captured under the existing anti-cheating laws. These people might do well as day traders, always able to buy or sell after a downtick or uptick, but they'd be thwarting each other any time 2 go after the same stock (and day traders tend to go after a few dozen at a time, so it's pretty likely to happen a lot).

For the big players, bullet 3 is going to cause trouble. Every major company is going to want as many of them as they can pay, the first to help with strategy and corporate direction, the rest to keep them out of the hands of their competitors (and improved chances of being correct in the case of a clash). So any long term strategies are going to be thwarted by relative armies of long term precogs.

Any small market that has only 1 player or that has players who largely stay off each others' toes. Companies who make industrial equipment for example.
