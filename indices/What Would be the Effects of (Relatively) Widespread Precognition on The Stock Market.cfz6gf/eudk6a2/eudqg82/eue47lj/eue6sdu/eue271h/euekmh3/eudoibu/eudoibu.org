  Precogs *cannot anticipate their own decision* (they can anticipate truly random processes e.g a quantum die) and can anticipate the world when they take a given course of action.

I don't quite get what the bit in bold means. How can they see the future from their perspective while also not seeing what actions they will decide to take?

Also how quickly can a precog glance into the future on average? Since being able to look a day into the future every second would be very different then being able look a day into the future once a day.
