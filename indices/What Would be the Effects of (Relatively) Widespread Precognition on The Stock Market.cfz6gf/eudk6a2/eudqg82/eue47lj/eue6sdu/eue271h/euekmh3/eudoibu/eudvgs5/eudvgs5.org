If precogs could anticipate the decisions they made, it would enable paradoxical scenarios.

Suppose a precog decides to predict a decision of theirs, but resolves to make a decision different from whatever prediction they made. No matter what prediction they see (as long as the precog can decide as normal) the prediction would be wrong.

  How can they see the future from their perspective while also not seeing what actions they will decide to take?

They can visualise the evolution of the world if they take a given course of action. Any prediction they make is contingent upon a certain course of action they've decided to follow.

  Also how quickly can a precog glance into the future on average? Since being able to look a day into the future every second would be very different then being able look a day into the future once a day.

The average precog can make a few hundred predictions a day. However, as a rule of thumb, the shorter out they're looking, the more predictions they can make.
