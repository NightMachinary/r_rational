Financial market is not needed if there are precogs. Looks like the end result would be dissolution of the financial market and replacement of it by feudal fiefdoms ruled by hierarchies of precogs. And the same about the state and economy. You can not realistically rebel against precogs - even if you overthrough one you can not prevent other taking power.
