On one hand, we'd finally be able to get rid of the Itô calculus and use normal derivatives for er.. talking about derivatives, because now you can be closer to symmetric around "now" for information flow, allowing use of better integrators and what not. If this is all it was, this would make it even easier for physicists to switch over and become financial folk.

On the other hand, you'd probably lose something like the "no memory property" of the elementary random processes involved, which means everything goes to hell in new and different ways. I've no real idea how this could actually be modeled. Basically, we shed the Itô calculus, but get no good foundation to replace it with.

You'd probably still usually model markets with elementary random processes, semi-martingales and all that, but it means you'd be "black swanned" way more often, because the model would become an even worse model of reality than it is today.

With only several thousand such agents, maybe this would be tolerable without (much) additional modeling.

Your best investment strategy would probably be to gather the highest powered precog(s) you could, to account for the somewhat step-like decay you'd get from boostrapping. Given that you seem to allow bootstrapping, and assuming each bootstrap step is exponential in that if you had something like 70% accuracy you get 70%^{2} for two hops, etc. you'd basically want to look for the best psychic(s) you could get on a compound interest basis, given the strict dominance relationship you offer for anticipation. This seems to offer a way to compare psychics of different mixes of longest precognition period and accuracy, by just comparing them on a "compound" basis like this at some fixed distance(s) in time.

The real question is would use of precognition in the markets be sufficiently controlled by something like existing "insider trading" statutes, which effectively try to prevent something that locally to the market looks like precognition. If not, I expect you'd get many of the same effects you see in unregulated markets, lots of pumping and dumping, huge financial market boom and bust swings, etc.

You'd get a bunch of other knock-on effects that would get in the way of regulation. It'd be hard for governments to retain top talent in an economy like that and situations like company precogs stopping preemptively stopping whistleblower efforts, union organization, etc. seem like a scenario that'd emerge in the dystopian corporate future that would likely ensue. It would also seem to follow that in time almost every major large scale corporate decision would need to be made by a precog, using normal humans as support and information gathering tools.

Basically, the presence of an unevenly distributed resource like precognition should by some analogue of Coase's theorem wind up in the hands of largish organizations that are equipped to use it, largely independent of the original distribution of the talent.
