If I could precog, I would go into insurance. The total non-health insurance market is about $300 billion ($1.2 trillion - $0.9 trillion for health).

Prevention is a better product than normal insurance from the customer's perspective, so you can probably charge higher rates. And from the company's perspective, you almost never have to pay out. You'd just be piling in hundreds of billions in profit each year (although precog salaries would scale to gobble some of that up).

Insurance would probably expand to things we don't even think about, like the "site reliability tiger team" you mention except distributed to every company that paid your retainer. They would probably grumble about paying you $100,000k a year just to get random phonecalls about every year saying "DON'T MERGE TO PRODUCTION ON A FRIDAY. You're welcome. That'll be $20,000 please," but the companies that don't do that wouldn't be able to compete.

Hell, even shit like "Hey, that Sonic Trailer you release tomorrow is terrible and everyone hates it" would earn you 6+ figures and that's less than 10 minutes work.
