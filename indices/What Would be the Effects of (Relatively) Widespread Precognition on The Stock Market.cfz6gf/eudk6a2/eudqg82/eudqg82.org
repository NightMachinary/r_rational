Well, right now (in theory) you have a bunch of people with access to roughly the same data making decisions in their own self interests using various amounts cognitive power to interpret data they think is relevant. (some are smart, some are not)

If precogs are common then my instinct is to say the market would do a couple wild swings at thr beginning and then stabilize into what you see now in the real world.

People without powers would hire people with powers and all the powers would even out the situation again.

It's mostly when powers are rare that it would destroy the market. In that situation every precog is a whale in the pond of stocks.
