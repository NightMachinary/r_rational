Allow for significant degradation, so that precognition only shows one's focus. So some bootstrapping is possible, but the available/visibility of information significantly deteriorates the more reliant it is on deep future events.

A consequence is that the more powerful one's immediate precognition is, the better their bootstrapping.

So a few of the best precogs would be in great demand for their ability to look into the deep future for the same warning signs you describe, but just like fund managers, their ability to help their investors is not concrete as the deterioration affects the deep future predictions, especially with other competing precogs in the market.
