I'm not sure that works - it blocks infinite recursion, but it /does/ mean that precog 1 can foresee precog 2 foreseeing precog 3 foreseeing pcog 4, and so on.

If we assume 1% of 1% of 7 billion people are full-day precogs, then you have up to 700 000 days (1917 years) of foresight, at the cost equivalent to hiring one of them full-time (just a different one every day).

In other words, precogs will make your precious financial system their bitch.
