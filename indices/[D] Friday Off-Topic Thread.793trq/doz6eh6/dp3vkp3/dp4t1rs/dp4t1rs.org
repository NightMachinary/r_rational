Yup! There are two main areas where type conversion is a thing, and both revolve around the concept of Normal typing being a vector of mutation. First is breeding, where a high Normal % translates to a higher chance that other elemental typing will be converted to some other type randomly on unit creation. Over generations it is possible to breed a type into a species (if you have a lucky patient zero), and this will be easier on a Rattata than a Gyarados.

Second pertains to evolutions and the use of HMs. When evolving, a certain portion of Normal % will regularly be converted when upgrading the Pokémon; for instance, an (average) Charmander might go from 20/10/70 Fire/Dragon/Normal to a Charmeleon at 30/15/55 to a Charizard at 40/20/20/20 Fire/Dragon/Flying/Normal. Normal typing is usually the pool from which additional typing is taken (there might be some cases with more specialized transformations, such as Onix turning 50% of its Rock into Steel while evolving). Coincidentally, HMs that add new organs (such as a cooling organ to enable Ice Beam) do so at the expense of Normal typing, so one might need to sacrifice 10% Normal to add 10% Ice, for instance. This means that using HMs on unevolved Pokémon is a risk, for if insufficient Normal typing exists, the Pokémon might be prevented from evolving at all. It also naturally limits the number of diverse HMs that can be used; pure Normal types will be naturally much more flexible where this is concerned.

It occurs to me that the second might be used as a catalyst for the first, altho I'd have to think through how much of that should affect the inherited typing.
