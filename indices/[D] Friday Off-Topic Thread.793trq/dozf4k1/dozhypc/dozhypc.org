  Anyone got some good ways to keep out of an anxiety spiral so I can take some MOOCs and finish getting my PhD applications in?
#+end_quote

there's a wealth of literature on the beneficial effects of exercise w.r.t. reducing anxiety (most of it focused on aerobic exercise, but some also on e.g. strength training), and some on exposure to nature-y/outdoors-y stuff, so I suggest going on a medium-length (~10mi? idk, w/e is appropriate for your current level of fitness and time availability) run in some nearby park/trail system

  a personal statement is supposed to express my personal drive to study the subject.
#+end_quote

express /and/ evince! Be sure to not just wax poetic on your love of neural nets *or* whatever, but provide concrete examples of your consistent interest and competence in them (ideally in ways that aren't immediately obvious from the rest of your app/cv). Overall though I don't think a personal statement is too make-or-break-y, but maybe it's different in neuro/cs departments. Also, by citations, do you mean more ~5 or, like, 50? In my experience personal statements aren't supposed to be research statements so be sure yours isn't as much of one!

You could also consider marketing yourself more as an interdisciplinarian and then not have to change too much!

(and regardless should imo seek to integrate yourself into multiple groups to allow for greater flexibility on future job markets -- put on your neuro hat when applying to neuro jobs, your cs hat when applying to cs jobs, etc.)

Good luck!
