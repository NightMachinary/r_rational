  there's a wealth of literature on the beneficial effects of exercise w.r.t. reducing anxiety (most of it focused on aerobic exercise, but some also on e.g. strength training), and some on exposure to nature-y/outdoors-y stuff, so I suggest going on a medium-length (~10mi? idk, w/e is appropriate for your current level of fitness and time availability) run in some nearby park/trail system

We've got a nearby trail system through a bit of a riverside park, but, like, dude, the longest run you can make through it is about... 3.25km. My current standard runs are about 2.5km. 10 miles as a /medium-length/ run? Wow, you're /good/ at this.

That said, one of the things I really like about athletics is that, well, you push yourself to do something you've never done before, you feel like shit, and then a few days later, it gets easier to do it /every single time you do it/. In addition to PhD applications, the point of the MOOCs is really to set myself up to be able to do academic things that way: just put in the work, and get the results. I was never able to treat school like that before, and I've been having to re-learn how to study to do it.

  You could also consider marketing yourself more as an interdisciplinarian and then not have to change too much!

Since my topic was going to be [[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1754073916670021?journalCode=emra][affective/evaluative cognition along these lines]], I'm struggling to come up with non-ridiculous ways to write a Comp Sci essay that says, "I will make the robots like you."
