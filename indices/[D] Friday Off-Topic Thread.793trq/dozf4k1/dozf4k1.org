Well, as promised last week, my job laid me off today. With honors, in a way: they say they'd be happy to work with me again when/if the revenues pick up.

Anyone got some good ways to keep out of an anxiety spiral so I can take some MOOCs and finish getting my PhD applications in?

Speaking of which, got the personal statements separated out by school. I need to rewrite a couple to target computer science departments (with cognition labs) instead of neuroscience departments. That's harder than it sounds, since a personal statement is supposed to express my personal drive to study the subject.

Gonna have to leave my current narrative about the brain and stuff into a bunch of stuff about Moravec's Paradox, Neats vs Scruffies, "build it to understand it" and such... for an essay about studying the core affect/evaluative system.

Oh shit, I need to throw in the citations in all of them.
