Yeah, probably not "exotic." My first thought was to name him Mephistopheles or Mephisto, but it's got such a tiny brain and snakes don't have external ears, so I want it to be simple and almost guttural, a very "round" name with a prominent O or U or both.

I have a cat named Venus and a cat named Roxy and a cat named Milo, and there are humans who have those names, but, like, /Richard/? /Michael/? Those are /definitely/ "people names" LOL

Ideally, the name wouldn't overlap with any of the cats' names. My mom thought Milo's name should be Brutus, but I shot that down because of the overlap with Venus.

Anyway, thank you for trying to help :)
