Oh don't get the wrong idea, my mom chose the names Venus and Roxy, I had nothing to do with either of them. I got Milo's name off a list of pet names. When I was a very small child, probably between the ages of 3 and 5, I had a series of fish (because fish are short-lived) and I named every one of them Cleo because that was the name of the fish in Pinocchio. I wasn't particularly fond of the movie, it was just the only movie I had seen that had a named pet fish when I was that age. I've had this snake for 6 weeks and I haven't given it a proper name yet.
