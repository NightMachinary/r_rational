When I think of snakes, I am invariably reminded of Ancient Egypt, and there are some cool two syllable Egyptian names like Djoser, Neheb, and of course Apep. That being said, corn snakes are not Egyptian and given your reference points are Morty and Noodle you are not looking for anything exotic.

For maximum snake irony, there is always Adam (Eve is monosyllabic of course). Alex is popular, genderless, and inoffensive, with a pleasing sound. I find Mary, David, Richard, Harry, and Hanna to have nonzero personality without being Chad, or similar. The suite of angel names, Michael, Raphael, URIEL, etc., convey tiny amounts of mysticism without being Hastur, although some are longer than you specify.
