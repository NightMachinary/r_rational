I recently (well, a month and a half ago is /relatively/ recently) acquired a corn snake hatchling. I was concerned for a while that it was going to be a nonfeeder (meaning a snake that goes its entire life without eating; as you might imagine, the period of time covered by "its entire life" isn't particularly long). I tried a lot of different ways to get it to feed and eventually I had to force feed it, and the snake didn't regurgitate so now I know it's just a stubborn feeder and not a nonfeeder. It's not gonna up and die in the next few weeks (it'll probably live around 20 years) so I'm now allowing myself to become more emotionally attached to the snake.

I've been calling it Mister Noodle, but that feels wrong, like naming a dog Doggy. I've tried out the name Morty, but I'm having trouble disentangling the name from associations with the character from Rick and Morty, it just doesn't feel right coming out of my mouth.

Do you, dear lovely reader, have a suggestion for a name?

I'd prefer the name to be two syllables with emphasis on the first syllable. Names of either gender will be considered equally. Snakes' brains are too small and simple for there to really be any meaningful behavioral differences between the genders, y'know, they only just barely have a personality at all, a snake's personality is snek, so all I care about in a name is that it looks aesthetically pleasing on paper and feels good coming out of my mouth.

EDIT:

I want the name to be simple and almost guttural, a very "round" name with a prominent O or U or both. I have three cats named Venus and Roxy and Milo. Ideally, the name wouldn't overlap with any of the cats' names, nothing like Tidus or Rocky or Shiloh.

EDIT EDIT:

My mother, when given the constraints listed in the previous edit, almost immediately suggested the name Rudolph. I'm iffy about the fact that it begins with an R, and I don't like the fact that I think about the reindeer every time I say the name, but it's very close to what I'm looking for.
