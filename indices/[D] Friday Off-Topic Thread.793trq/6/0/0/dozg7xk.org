I have opinions about the importance of good governance and therefore am attracted to the idea of working in some public planning field or attaching myself to some politician (in the event that I get the connections to some politician.) For practical purposes, if I move, it is likely to be to the New York City or Washington areas, since the first is where my friends are and either place is a good fit for 'what I would like to be employed doing in an ideal world'. A friend of mine urges me to go into the nonprofit field in New York City (what she does and where she does it) but it doesn't pay well. I might be interested in that if it was something on the more effective altruism end of the spectrum but generic politics is more interesting to me than generic nonprofit. More generically, history and linguistics are areas I have strong interests in, but the job market seems decidedly not great for those. More broadly, my personality tends me towards the 'sit at your desk researching' type jobs than the 'interact with random members of the public in PR or sales' end of the spectrum except in areas where I have strong motivation (like politics.)

Who I would like to spend time with: my tastes run variably highbrow and mildly nerdy and many of the people I currently spend time with are more towards the god, guns, and nascar end of the spectrum. I go onto Meetup.com periodically and there are a handful of interesting local groups doing things like hiking or discussing atheism or watching non-action movies but they mostly meet at times bad for my schedule and most of the local groups are things like bible study. Lots of Ithaca NY groups seem interesting - it is close enough to me for those groups to show up on Meetup but sufficiently far away that I can't really go to any of them.
