Content note: whining

I am dissatisfied with my life. My life isn't currently that awful, but isn't where I would have hoped it would be if you had asked me when I was much younger. Studied Arabic in a fit of idealism when I was in college in the 05-09 period, didn't effectively use my college period partly due to personal flaws and partly due to economics (never pieced together the money to do study abroad which is a highly advisable thing to do when studying a foreign language.) Then the economic crisis happened and I had trouble getting and keeping a job for a while, and also a close family member died. I currently am stably employed and am paid better than at any of my previous jobs, but it is at a fairly boring factory job, sitting in the stockroom opening UPS deliveries, giving the stuff to the maintenance department, updating the database of what we have, and listening to my coworkers talk about how great Trump is. (I am a democrat in one of the most heavily republican counties in my state.) I like the scenery in the area where I live but don't have much of a social life and most of my college friends who I still talk to live in cities far away from me. I would love to get out of my current situation but feel like imposter syndrome will kick in whenever I try for a job I might like.

I ought to return to school or something but am somewhat anxious about giving up a paid job to do it, and also am torn between doing something I like and something that looks like it plausibly pays money. Technical stuff seems like it pays well these days but I am a more humanities oriented person and am inhibited from studying things like programming because I am unsure what thing I could apply it to that I would be motivated at and there's lots of competition from more interested people, but professions like 'history teacher' are also lacking in prospects and so on and so forth. My main problem here is probably actually more about anxiety forcing me into inaction, though. If I thought I had a good chance at some decent civil service job or had a flash of insight on what kinds of interesting jobs I'm not thinking of, I would love to pursue those, but I keep on having the anxiety spiral.

The good thing about my current job is that I enjoy reading and it has great breaks (insert joke about being in a union) so I can manage to get some good reading done on the days I bring a book to work.
