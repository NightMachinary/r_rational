  Be sure to not just wax poetic on your love of neural nets of whatever, but provide concrete examples of your consistent interest and competence in them (ideally in ways that aren't immediately obvious from the rest of your app/cv).
#+end_quote

Well, I'm not exactly trying to study neural nets... and I can't really show competence in the thing I /am/ signing up to study, because it's fairly unique to these few labs. And new.

So I'm settling for showing consistent wide-ranging interest in the subject, and hopefully making as nice a picture of my quantitative background (I have one, just not in neurosci) as possible. This will definitely show interest that isn't just apparent from my CV.

But yeah, I think for the computing departments, I can pitch myself as an interdisciplinarian looking to build out computational models of the stuff being discovered in neurosci and cogsci, which also lets me work on the neurosci/cogsci side in mostly the same labs, while also having the excuse /not/ to wave my hands about how the calculations happen when writing papers.

  Overall though I don't think a personal statement is too make-or-break-y, but maybe it's different in neuro/cs departments.
#+end_quote

I mean, it's still got to be /good/ when you're trying to change from one field to another, especially when the new field is... well, was only really /born/ in the past decade or so, so it's not like you can have a publication in it already.

Gosh, that's a surprisingly positive way to think of my chances. My tutor /did/ mention that only 5% of admits to my top target department /actually/ had any kind of publication going in, and that they really like to admit from quantitative backgrounds for their neuro/cog programs rather than just biological backgrounds.

#+begin_quote
  Also, by citations, do you mean more ~5 or, like, 50?
#+end_quote

More like five. I just started looking it over, and I've really had to throw out most of the actual non-personal neurosci stuff from this statement.

  (and regardless should imo seek to integrate yourself into multiple groups to allow for greater flexibility on future job markets -- put on your neuro hat when applying to neuro jobs, your cs hat when applying to cs jobs, etc.)
#+end_quote

Most of the labs I'm applying to are interdisciplinary cognition labs: combinations of comp-sci/cog-sci/psych/neuro/linguistics. My real needle to thread is getting the space/excuse to implement some computational stuff based on theoretical neuroscience, while also getting the neurosci-side excuse to turn the computational stuff towards problems related to actual, embodied minds.
