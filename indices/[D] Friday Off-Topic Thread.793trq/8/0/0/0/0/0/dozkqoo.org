  It's not even vaguely relevant except for being in a quantitative field.

Sounds pretty relevant to me! at least insofar as it demonstrates your ability to do math-y stuff with computers, which is most of the battle anyway. Irrelevant would be if it were on some philosophical description of fashion trends in 17th century France, or something, which would still be relevant to the extent that it shows you can write

  Shit, I should try to get time with them as well as the profs.

Yah definitely! They're the ones to tell you what it's like actually working in the lab (and will usually warn you if the PI is really appealing before you're in but turns into a monster later on). Plus, unless you explicitly tell them not to, they'll probably mention your call/skype/email to the boss, which'll further serve as evidence of your interest and can-do, go-getter attitude :]

edit: though I should note that the student-student talk usually occurs, in my experience, after you've already been accepted to the program/lab, and are trying to decide whose offer you want to accept. But I reckon most grad students would be happy to chat with a prospective labmate so long as you don't occupy their time for too long
