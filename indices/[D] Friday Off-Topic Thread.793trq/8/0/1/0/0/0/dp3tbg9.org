It was all in one state, actually! California, up along the coast, from the Mexico border to Oregon (the distance technically looks to work out to 1,171 miles with 61,000 ft of dE, but close enough). I think she walked a lot of it though (she's been recovering from some gnarly injuries and it was unsupported, so she had to carry a bunch of backpacking equipment and stuff). But still, daily average was over 26 miles! I've done that backpacking a fair bit and it's pretty hefty bookended by shorter days, much less for weeks in a row!
