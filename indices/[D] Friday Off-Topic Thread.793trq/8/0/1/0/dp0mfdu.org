Ah it's a longer distance for me currently (getting back into running after a break of nearly a decade). But my reference group may be non-representative. I only really talk about running with two people: my wife, who goes on 10mi runs pretty regularly, maybe once a week, and a good friend from ugrad, who seems to have switched to running stuff full time in recent years and regularly wins races in the 50-200mi category (incidentally, she aced a math/cs double major and then went to work at nasa, mit, harvard, etc. and then was a few years into a math/cs PhD before quitting to become a runner). Her easy runs can get up to 30mi lol (on which she'll sometimes forego food/water to "build endurance" O_O). She actually just set a fastest known time record on a ~1200mi trail a few weeks ago! And then my third interaction with a runner recently was finding out that one of my current goals, which I'm closing in on -- a sub-20min 5k -- was [[https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/747pcm/official_qa_for_wednesday_october_04_2017/dnx6byq/][not even mildly impressive]]. But I'd thought it at least sort of decent, so I think I'm just really miscalibrated.
