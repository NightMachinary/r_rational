Well... yesterday i had to write an essay as an exam. We had like 60 minutes to cover 2 A4 pages. It was as a kind o exam/test if you had understood and read the lecture( the lecture being "crime and punishment" by F.Dostoyevsky). So the question we had been asked was "Can morality change ?"

I ofcourse answered yes and listed some examples from the book. Today i learned that the answer was supposed to be no, morality isnt something that can change. The teacher argumanted that by saying that its in the context of the book so we have to kinda use the arguments the author of the book made. Meaning that since we answered wrongly we didnt really understand the book. I get that and i know it makes atleast some sense to me but why even ask us the question if no matter our argumentation the answer will be set in stone.

i was really bugged by this and i dont know what to think about this. Kinda mad i wont get a good grade since i thought my response wasnt half bad.
