I have to leave in just a moment, so just in case this slips my mind the next time I'm able to type, [[http://howtogrowthefuckup.com/post/87238065412/how-to-grow-the-fuck-up-guides-to-life][this]] should be helpful.

Also, save money and write a budget. That isn't news or anything, I just want to emphasize it. I like Excel, personally, and there are templates that you can use.

Oh, and don't be bothered by other people's notions of what Adulting means. Everybody is making it up as they go along, more or less. You want to live in a houseboat and walk dogs for a living? Congratulations, you can make a fair amount of money walking dogs, and I hear that houseboats are awesome (and cheap, if you know where to look).
