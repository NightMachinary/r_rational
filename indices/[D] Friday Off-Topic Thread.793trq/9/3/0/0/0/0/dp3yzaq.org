Known present-day factors:

- Global warming
- Economic stagnation since 2008
- Economic stagnation since /the 1970s/, with productivity-growth rates being surprisingly low
- The number of war deaths has started ticking up again starting in 2011
- Economic and cultural crisis driving a descent into authoritarianism and demagoguery in most developed countries
- Antibiotic-resistant bacteria

Exotic possible future factors:

- Economic inequality crisis induced by automation
- Unfriendly artificial general intelligence
- Biotechnology making bioterrorism cheap-as-free
- Distributed manufacturing technology making firearms and other weapons impossible to control

Again, I don't think there will be any single huge "BANG!" to which to point and say, "That was it, that was the end." It feels more to me like more and more of these things are just /piling up/, and if we want to avoid catastrophe, we need to start actively moving through the pile /solving them/ and driving away the danger. Instead, we're fighting each-other over trivial bullshit.
