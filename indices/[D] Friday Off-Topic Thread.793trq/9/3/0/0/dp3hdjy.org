It's not sarcastic. It's that as far as I can tell, our civilization is just piling up dramatically huge horrible problems and eventually some combination are just gonna get us. Doesn't have to be any one problem alone, it just has to be some temporary convergence of events that pushes most of human civilization past its breaking for /just long enough/ for the damage to be permanent.

Infected stab wounds are fucking terrible, but can ultimately be treated in a way that may leave you severely injured for life but alive. Cancer is likewise. Getting infected stab wounds while also having cancer leaves a lot less chance of survival.
