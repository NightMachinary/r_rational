  What ought I prepare for?

Getting mostly pretty fucked-over by society, and having to figure out how to live and help your friends and family despite that.

Also, should you want to be materially secure, some form of remunerative career. Also, should you have some cause or plan you care about, how to execute on that.

  What ought I do now?

Ace everything in high school, or somehow manage to take uni-level classes in high school and ace them. Get some work experience too.

When I was young, I knew that my time of ever having any free time or leisure was counting down, so I wanted to take advantage of it. That was a bad decision.

When you're young, you have almost no real choices in life, so each one where you do the "responsible" thing and constrict your options to a bunch of hard work and stuff feels like utter shit. Problem is, the returns on those Responsible Things compound into adulthood, eventually giving you a lot more choices as an adult. You're sacrificing choices as a youth to have more later on.

Shit sucks, but it's an investment.

If you get the sense that the world is coming to an end, you're entirely correct. Please help the rest of us handle this.

Adulthood is difficult and draining, and that's why the adults around you seem so damn drained.

Solidarity and love for others are essentially all we fucking have right now, and that's a /really bad/ situation to be in, actually.

You are going to die, and you may experience real personal suffering at any time.

Civilizational crisis and climate apocalypse aside, almost everyone you meet has more potential than they're getting to really express. Help with that. If you ever wanted to be a hero, now's the time.
