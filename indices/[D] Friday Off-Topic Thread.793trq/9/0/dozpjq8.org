  What ought I prepare for? What ought I do now? What should I know?

Are you under/over 18? Going to college in less than a year? Just started college? Have two or more years left of highschool? Have more than a year of college under your belt?

"What should I prepare for" depends on what plans you have for the future and "what should I do now" depends on what your "now" looks like.

As for what you should know: "who you are as a person" might change significantly and not-infrequently as you grow older. I'm 28; I'd say I've been no fewer than 9 different people since I was 14.
