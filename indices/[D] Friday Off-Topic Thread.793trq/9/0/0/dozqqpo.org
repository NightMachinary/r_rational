To finally destroy any illusion of anonymity I might have, I am 16.

In terms of future plans, I want to do something about the long list of horrible problems the world has, especially problems in how people think or fail to. In terms of interests, math, computers, etc., as you might expect.

I have not changed much over the years in qualitative ways, unlike most people I know. Any advice on how to change for the better?

EDIT: I find it vaguely disturbing that this post has more likes than my top level one.
