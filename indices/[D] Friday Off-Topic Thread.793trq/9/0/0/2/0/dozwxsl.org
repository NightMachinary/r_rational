  I'm of the opinion that the Ivy's and small private schools

I don't think these should be discounted entirely, especially if you don't come from a middle class background, since they give pretty fantastic need-based aid than can often (partially) stack with merit-based (and if you're upper class it might well be your parents can pay out-of-pocket). Plenty of them have solid departments for research, too. I went to a small-ish private university primarily b/c they agreed to cover my costs and then some -- I think my living stipend after tuition and fees were paid was something like ~$15k-$20k per year, which was more than enough for food and housing, a comfortable travel/adventure budget, and a nice kickstart to investments in a (then) future runway + emergency fund.

(I do second the PSAT point -- I think around $5k/year of the money I received came from that national merit thing, and some of the schools I applied to gave considerably more)
