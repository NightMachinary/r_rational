  I hope I don't come off as totally naive!

Don't worry kid, you're fine. "I want to do something about the long list of horrible problems the world has" just sounded a bit idealistic is all.

  I hope your reference to HPMOR means you know that I know that there is a close to zero mapping between a given human's internal world and external future.

That alleviates my concerns. I, myself, was utterly convinced from the ages of 6 to 14 that I was going to be a genetic engineer when I grew up, with the end goal of /cloning a dinosaur/. I don't know if all schools do this, but we had something called "pathways" where all the students had one specialized class a year in things like graphic arts or business or whatever. They had a pathway Medical Science, and I chose it /specifically/ because I thought that'd be the path to take to accomplish my goal of /becoming a genetic engineer and cloning a dinosaur/.

They should give children aptitude tests to sort them and not allow them to make their own decisions.
