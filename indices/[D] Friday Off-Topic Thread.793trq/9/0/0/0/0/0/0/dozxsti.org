I told the school counselor at 12, in response to a vague question about what I wanted to achieve in life, my brilliant plan of discovering room-temperature superconductivity, repaving every road in America with said material, and building cars so energy efficient as a result of lower friction that they could be powered by solar panels alone. This impressed her so much that I decided to really plan it all out. Then I realized that I had no idea that I was going to discover room-temperature superconductivity, let alone get funding for I was quickly discovering would be an insanely expensive and unpopular infrastructure proposal. That day marks one of perhaps four shifts in maturity that I have actually noticed.

All the yes to this, to the extent that it is not obviously horrible, and they should also use those tests to determine credit requirements. I know someone with an insane capacity to memorize historical material and correlate it into models. The person in question may also literally fail too many math courses to graduate high school. Clearly there is something wrong here, when people's grades can be that stark.
