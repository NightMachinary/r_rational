I did competitive math for a year, before my life took one of its more exciting turns, but I am likely to get back into it this year, if for no other reason than that I would make the 4th member of the school's team. In terms of math knowledge, I am taking BC Calc (basically Calc 1.5) this year and know a good deal of popular mathematics. My expertise is basically, "has read two decision theory papers, does physics homework sans calculator."

In terms of computers, this is a very recent interest on my part, although I do program for my school's robotics team. I have no idea what to actually do to meaningfully progress past the, "Quick study; knows some Java and C++" stage.

Mostly I was trying to emphasize that it is all rather free-floating. I know /things/ but not on eminently marketable level.
