I wanted to custom-write a set of especially insightful advice custom-tailored to your personality that would sound incredibly clever and pertinent, but it actually sounds like you mostly have your shit together, so I don't have that much to say.

But smarter people than me do have much to say! What you said earlier about wanting to change the world made me think about [[http://kazerad.tumblr.com/post/90923468138/depth][this article by Kazerad on challenges and expectations]]; he wrote a few articles on the subjects of [[http://kazerad.tumblr.com/post/92214013593/power][responsibility]], activism, and how we personally relate to them which felt to me like a pretty fresh insightful perspective you don't really see anywhere else.

Actually, I do one have custom-ish piece of advice for you: try to chill out. It's something I often say / want to say to trekie140 and eaturbrainz; I don't think it applies to you quite as much, but in a way it applies to anyone who identifies with the rationalist community.

Don't take concepts and ideas to seriously. Question yourself often, but don't question yourself /too/ hard. Don't spend all your life trying to prevent the end of the world; focus on yourself, on your comparative advantages, and have fun. Don't rationalize yourself into a corner of obsessive misery.
