If I could send a message to my 16-year old self that he would take seriously I would say the following:

1. develop smart study strategies since simply relying on natural smarts will eventually come to bite you in the ass-- I recommend looking into Cal Newport's books, getting good at using a Spaced Repetition program like [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/][Anki]], and generally becoming more comfortable with working hard on stuff. If you're puzzled about what to learn, try the Ultimate Geography [[https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2109889812][deck]]. Do 5 new cards a day and you'll learn every country's flag/capital/map_image within a year-- makes international relations/news/politics surprisingly understandable when you understand the geographic relationships between places.

2. get more physically fit/aesthetic, for the aesthetic/social benefits if nothing else. Yes, it's shallow, but if you go from unathletic skinny or fat male physique to even kind-of in shape ('swimmer's body'), you'll be quite happy with the change.

3. realize that social status (popularity) is usually something you have to work for, not something some people just naturally have. Status games/hierarchies vary widely depending on context but in nearly every social circle I've encountered, the combination of confidence, calibration (something vaguely like social intelligence or skill at reading the room or body language skills) and being good at something will reap dividends. If you're like most people, no matter what you try to convince yourself of, your place in the social hierarchy will play a big role in how happy you are. Learning to play the social game early on will be helpful for basically every other endeavor, though some professions (STEM academia, tech sector) will have other ways of raising your status, like being really good at what you do.

4. for #3, there isn't any single resource out there that's comprehensive. The classic advice of "How to Win Friends and Influence People" is not bad, but the book is a little too vanilla and bland to be super useful. "Models" by Mark Manson is a good book too, though not all that actionable. For me the combination of meditation and social immersion was key, along with befriending more socially skilled friends. I went from mild/moderate social anxiety to basically socially fearless over ~5 years-- it was an effortful transition, but well-worth it.

5. Ala Gwern's [[https://www.gwern.net/The-Melancholy-of-Subculture-Society][piece]] on subcultures, never forget that if the social circle you're currently in is toxic or causing you lots of unhappiness, you can always opt out and choose one you're more suited or interested in. Of course, don't let the low cost of switching deter you from eventually learning the important skills of socializing and hierarchy navigation.

Above all, I'd say the following:

-whenever you feel particularly emotionally shitty, try your hardest to take the outside view-- most things are temporary, this too shall pass, and in a week or a month or a year, whatever has you so down will probably be nothing more than a faint memory with little emotional impact. Remember that when things get overwhelming!
