  Anyone have any tips for how I can best learn from this experience? My first thought is, I had the assignment since some 2 months ago, I could have spent 1-2 hours a week on it and saved things.

That's the big tip I've been given recently. Just allocate time by subject/unit/job, and invest a fixed number of hours in each thing daily, until you completely run out of things to do for it. Then start working ahead.

  Fucking around with LaTeX/BibTeX only wasted maybe 1 or 2 hours.

That's actually very, very little.

  But I am kind of bummed. Life has been hard lately too, so many things going wrong by my uniquely privileged white western sense of going wrong.

You know, at a certain part I started thinking, "oh fuck all that 'privileged Western sense' shit". Because right now the "privileged" world is in nonstop crisis and catastrophe. So fuck it, we get to feel legitimately bad right now.
