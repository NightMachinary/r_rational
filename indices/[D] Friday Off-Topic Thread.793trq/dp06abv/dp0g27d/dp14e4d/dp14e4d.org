  That's the big tip I've been given recently. Just allocate time by subject/unit/job, and invest a fixed number of hours in each thing daily, until you completely run out of things to do for it. Then start working ahead.

Yeah, I think I should have done the "working ahead" on the assignment rather than "I have read every single reading and every single lecture that is currently available, time to watch TV!" that I actually did.

    Fucking around with LaTeX/BibTeX only wasted maybe 1 or 2 hours.

  That's actually very, very little.

And my partner waxes lyrical about LaTeX being such a timesaver??? Then again another student was talking about how she spent tons of time on her margins and fonts which I spent 0 time on, so maybe I'm not doing so bad. And I likely spent comparatively little time on my references too...

  You know, at a certain part I started thinking, "oh fuck all that 'privileged Western sense' shit". Because right now the "privileged" world is in nonstop crisis and catastrophe. So fuck it, we get to feel legitimately bad right now.

As I said in another comment, I actually was feeling bad for being a priviledged /Australian/ since I have a job I basically can't get fired from (for real) and can take last minutes days off and an extremely cheap system of student loans that I only have to pay back when I earn over a certain salary. You were talking about losing your job, and I felt kind of bad writing a whole bunch of stuff about "an assignment I'm doing for a course for a qualification that earns less than the job I'm doing now was hard and I feel sad". Was trying to be sensitive.
