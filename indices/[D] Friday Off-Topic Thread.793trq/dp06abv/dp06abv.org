I had an assignment to do, and I estimated it would take me 12-15 hours. It took me something like 30 hours. I spent basically every waking moment I wasn't at the office on this damn thing for a week. I took a day off work last minute to finish it.

Like, I'm normally pretty good at estimating how long I need to do an assignment. There was an assignment for a "harder" unit that took me less time. I've never been down to the wire like that before, where I'm trying as hard as I can but still not getting finished.

Anyone have any tips for how I can best learn from this experience? My first thought is, I had the assignment since some 2 months ago, I could have spent 1-2 hours a week on it and saved things.

And I'm trying to think how I "wasted time" to make it 30 hours. I can't think of anything. I think maybe the 2 hours I spent on the beginning on literature review was inefficient and I should have incorporated those into the main assignment-doing-time. Fucking around with LaTeX/BibTeX only wasted maybe 1 or 2 hours. So maybe that's what happened, a "death by a thousand cuts", with a pomodoro here or there wasted?

I don't know. I feel like such a failure for this, even though it's stupid: I had the resources to do the assignment and I did it, and I'm sure I'll get a good mark (not to humblebrag but I'm on a high distinction average at the moment and I only need a middling credit average to get into the masters programme if I decide that's what I want to do). But I am kind of bummed. Life has been hard lately too, so many things going wrong by my uniquely privileged white western sense of going wrong. Hopefully things will get better. I know I'll kick butt at both my exams, so that's the next thing to focus on.
