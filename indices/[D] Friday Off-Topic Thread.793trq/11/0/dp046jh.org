Something I've said before about that critique:

Ugh. This review is sneering so hard that it comes across as the author having an axe to grind, which would be tolerable on its own if they actually made good criticisms, but instead within a few paragraphs they get many parts of the plot or themes of the story blatantly wrong or show that they massively missed the point of it.

Criticisms of the actual science would be useful if I could trust the author to know what he's talking about. Having found out that he's been using alt accounts to lie about his experiences and credentials in argument threads massively lowers my confidence in anything he says being worth following up on beyond the amount I normally do for new ideas I encounter.
