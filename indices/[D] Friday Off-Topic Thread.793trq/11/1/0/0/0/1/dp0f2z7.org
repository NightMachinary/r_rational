Honestly, I'm amazed the internet is still functioning as a place with /any/ social trust at all. You can lie all the time and it's not that hard, you can pretend to have expertise you don't have, and you're never going to get caught unless you're sloppy.

When you think about it, it's kind of like a giant experiment where everybody is given Plato's ring of Gyges at the same time, and for some reason most people only use it for being really passive aggressive.
