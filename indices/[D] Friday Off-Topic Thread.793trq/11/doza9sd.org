I think I've mentioned that using hyperlinks in text is wonderful because it allows the writer to add another dimension to his 1D text without resorting to the cumbersome workaround of footnotes. See also fancy Javascript footnotes that pop up when you move your cursor over them ([[http://www.gwern.net/Death-Note-Anonymity][example]])---but I generally dislike the use of Javascript when HTML and CSS suffice for the purpose.
