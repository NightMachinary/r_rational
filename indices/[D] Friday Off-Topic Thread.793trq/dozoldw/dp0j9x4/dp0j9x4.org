There's always [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros][Ouroboros]] (Ouro for short) the metaphorical snake that eats its own tail, symbolising eternity (especially a cyclical eternity). Pronunciation varies, so I'd just go with "Oo-row" for the short form.

Other possibilities:

- Rook or Brook
- Muon or Gluon
- Fuse (you can joke that it was short for "Refuses to eat")
- Bluey (only if the snake is definitely /not/ blue, preferably red instead; this is an Australian style of nickname that may not translate)
- Cue ball (if white)
- Oolong (a type of tea, often [[https://www.organicfacts.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Oolongtea1.jpg][this sort of colour]])

None of those are particularly similar to "Rudolph" though.
