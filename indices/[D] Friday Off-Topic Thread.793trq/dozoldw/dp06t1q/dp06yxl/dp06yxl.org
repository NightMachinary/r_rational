Yes but that's ... I mean, on a scale of "round" to "sharp" it's not necessarily a "sharp" name, but it's not particularly "round," either. Snakes don't have external ears, they're not technically deaf per se but they're a lot more reliant on vibration than we are, so I want the name to be semi-guttural.
