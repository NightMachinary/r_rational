You don't have to ignore privilege, but you also shouldn't be letting the fact of it make you feel terrible for feeling terrible about genuinely bad things that happen to you.

You can always say, "sure I may be underemployed and have student debt, but I'm privileged enough to have square meals each day!". But that doesn't help anyone. Worry about your privilege when you're on Team Building Day at a nice job drinking craft beer or some shit like that.

Also, excuse me if I want to check that you don't post to right-wing subreddits, since that username sounds really conservative to be speaking nice social justice language.
