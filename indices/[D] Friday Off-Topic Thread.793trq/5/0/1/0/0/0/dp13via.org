  Neither does ignoring your privilege.

Yeah, especially on this thread where I saw some people from the US discuss job lossess, college aspirations, etc. I'm in Australia and I've got a ton of priviledges in that regard: I work for the government and get paid well enough, and because I work for the government /I basically cannot be fired, ever/ (yes, that is really how the system works). And if they do fire me and /I agree to it/, they give me 12 weeks of pay.

On top of /that/ I'm studying a degree I don't "need", and I am getting an effectively zero interest loan from the government to pay for it (and I only have to pay that loan back if I'm earning a certain amount of money). On top of /that/ I'm able to take time off work because I have 9 weeks of leave (4 of which are required by law, 5 of which I "bought" by lowering my pay rate). On top of /that/ I had a comfortable upbringing, supportive family, good schools, genetics, etc that allowed me to be smart enough to have an average of high distinction when I work 4 days a week while studying a 50% load.

Like, priviledge is oozing out of my every pore to borrow from a copypasta. So I thought me complaining that I was able to take a day off work at the drop of a hat and receive literally no consequences for it might seem a bit rich to many people here.

I'm not even thinking about people in war-torn parts of Uganda who don't have enough to eat. I'm thinking about /Americans/ when I mention my privilege.
