  You can always say, "sure I may be underemployed and have student debt, but I'm privileged enough to have square meals each day!". But that doesn't help anyone.

Neither does ignoring your privilege. In fact, it does the opposite, since a part of white privilege is the default ability to survive and thrive in the kind of society that damn near requires "student debt" to do so - so the outliers that can't are punished almost as harshly as underpriviliged groups. This is just like the MRAs who ignorantly oppose feminism because of issues caused by the patriarchy and toxic masculinity in the first place.

  Also, excuse me if I want to check that you don't post to right-wing subreddits, since that username sounds really conservative to be speaking nice social justice language.
#+end_quote

That's interesting because the actual intent was to signal "social justice" without being too obvious about it. How did you get conservative from that?
