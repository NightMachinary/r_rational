Think in terms of what you /can/ do, what the circumstances of your life, your interests, your character afford to you. What are you good at, and what kind of issue or problem can you tear off and make doable on the scale of ten to 40 years worth of effort (depending on how long you think you can go on one thing without society wrecking your project)?

  EDIT: I would like to emphasize that I don't blame people for not doing much, given the demands of just staying in place. I have no illusions about what most lives entail.

Thanks for that, on behalf of everyone I know just trying to survive and feel ok right now. Including me, actually.
