  If you get the sense that the world is coming to an end, you're entirely correct. Please help the rest of us handle this.

Oh my sense is far worse than that. Throughout history, humans have always been screwed over by things we didn't see coming. Right now, there are a small list of plausible near-term apocalypses, but of course I don't need to tell you that. It seems likely that we are going to get massively fucked, to put it as bluntly as possible, by something we didn't even consider. The only thing that makes me confident that we know what will get us is that very few people seem to notice, which while marginally comforting, is also incredibly alarming on its own merits. Manhattan Project level efforts would not be a bad place to start.

I am getting the sense that there is something /I ought to be doing/ about the almost comical misallocation of resources we call civilization, but I am not sure what. Most intelligent adults I know seem content to do nothing about anything, which in fairness does appear to be the education system's opinion on the matter as well.

EDIT: I would like to emphasize that I don't blame people for not doing much, given the demands of just staying in place. I have no illusions about what most lives entail.
