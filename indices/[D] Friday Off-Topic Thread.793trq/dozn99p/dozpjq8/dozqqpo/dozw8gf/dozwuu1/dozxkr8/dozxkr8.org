If you ever get serious enough about it to visit, drop me a line. I still have a bunch of friends there and am in town fairly frequently, and probably will be for the next few years until my GF graduates. I could arrange a campus tour (Or, a more interesting and honest one than the official ones) and possibly some introductions in the CS department if you were interested in that direction.
