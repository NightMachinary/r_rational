If you want to make a large impact on the world's horrible problems, your three main routes are startups, politics, and academia. Pretty much all of those require a bachelors to be taken seriously, so college is basically a must. The following advice is largely USA-centric. Try to get into a state school, ideally with enough scholarships to cover at least tuition + room and board. Landing a national merit scholarship via PSAT score will help hugely with that, they can easily be 20k+, and usually qualify you for other school specific merit aid. I'm of the opinion that the Ivy's and small private schools aren't really worth it and that if you're good about finding research opportunities, you can learn and do far more at a large state research school.

From there, consider college as the time to lay groundwork for your future plans. While you will be academically busy with classes, you will have a relatively open schedule and access to a ton of technology. I'd recommend getting involved with a lab that takes undergraduates, but there are no shortage of other things you could be doing. Have fun, learn things, spend at least one summer doing some sort of actual work related to your field, and make friends. Also, obligatory plug for Texas A&M University, as I am an Aggie (Class of 2016!). Also we do cool shit with robots.
