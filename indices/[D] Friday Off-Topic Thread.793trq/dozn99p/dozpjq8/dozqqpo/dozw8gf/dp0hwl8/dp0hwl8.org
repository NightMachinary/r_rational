  I'm of the opinion that the Ivy's and small private schools aren't really worth it and that if you're good about finding research opportunities, you can learn and do far more at a large state research school.

IMHO, it's bimodal, and [[/u/LookUponMyResearch]] should try for both. If you get into an Ivy-grade STEM institution (Stanford, MIT, hell, even RPI), you will receive a /superb/ education and /astoundingly top-rate/ research opportunities, plus they may go ahead and give you loads and loads of scholarships. If you get into Harvard or Yale, you have a straight beeline into politics or law.

"Public Ivies" like UWashington or Berkeley are also great options, and you can throw in a whole bunch of them up and down the selectivity spectrum without actually sacrificing quality of education to get into a nice school.
