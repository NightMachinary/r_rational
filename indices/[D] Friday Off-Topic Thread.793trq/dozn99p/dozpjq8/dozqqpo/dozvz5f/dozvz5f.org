  In terms of future plans, I want to do something about the long list of horrible problems the world has, especially problems in how people think or fail to.

That's admirable, but it's pretty abstract, and a little naive. There is no "changing the world" profession, that's a passion project you have to do on your own time. The vast majority of people aren't lucky enough to end up in a profession that aligns with, much less furthers/promotes, their values.

My advice would be to come up with a concrete plan, like go to college and become a dental hygienist or a teacher or do some sort of trade program and become an electrician or some other such profession where you can start pulling in forty to fifty thousand dollars a year in your early 20s. If you can manage to do that, you'll have a wider range of options in the future for going back to school or changing careers. Don't major in Philosophy, don't major in English or History unless you have a strong desire to be a teacher, y'know, stuff like that. Don't assume that your personal interests ought to play a role in your future profession, that's not particularly pragmatic. /Everyone/ your age is interested in computers, y'know? I certainly don't mean to discourage any ambitions, but you /need/ a concrete plan or you'll end up like me.

  I have not changed much over the years in qualitative ways, unlike most people I know. Any advice on how to change for the better?

I'm sure you've changed more than you think you have, but that's the thing of it; you haven't experienced it yet and it's hard to describe, but you're likely going to experience more in the next 5 years than you have in the last 10, since the last 10 for you have probably consisted mostly of being taken care of by adults and spending most of your days within the rigid structure of the school system.

When I started college, I'd be walking around campus and end up walking 20 feet behind someone who was smoking a cigarette and I'd think about how disgusting it smelled and how people shouldn't be allowed to smoke in public. Within less than a month I started smoking and had gotten drunk for the first time, even though I had recently thought of myself as the type of person who didn't do those types of things. I believed in the truth of Christianity my entire life up until the age of 19, at which point I became so preoccupied with the wonders of college life that I entirely neglected to have a single thought about religion for almost an entire year. When I realized at age 20 that I hadn't thought about it in a year, I also realized I didn't believe in any of that religion stuff anymore. I thought "atheist" was a dirty word until the very moment I became one.

There's no way to anticipate how you're going to change, but I will say this: humans are prone to becoming more like the people we associate with. Your behavioral and speech patterns will shift to match your peer group, and your thoughts will shift to match your behaviors.

As far as general quality of life advice, if I could go back in time twelve years and say something to "16-year-old me," I would implore myself to begin exercising and working out, to walk an hour a day 5 days a week and to do pushups and pullups and squats 3 days a week and to eat more protein. It's much easier to add muscle mass when you're a teenager / young adult than it is when you're pushing 30. It's like in chapter 12 of HPMOR, your future self will wish they could go back in time and do it, and all that jazz.

EDIT: I went back and gave your top level post a like to balance things a bit for you LOL
