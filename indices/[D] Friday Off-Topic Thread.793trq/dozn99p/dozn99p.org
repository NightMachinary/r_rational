I have been in a reflective move about my age recently, and I realized that in a period of let's say 1-4 years I am going to become an adult. I further realized that I have no idea what that entails besides the obvious changes in my legal status and the associated societal expectations. Given that this is a sub whose members are probably much more similar to me than average, I have a rather stereotypical set of questions to ask you all: What ought I prepare for? What ought I do now? What should I know?
