Wow. I tried their quiz and found out that /none/ of the stuff I put in can get them to recommend /anything/ to me but nonprofits, management consulting, and policy civil service.

Like, I've always kinda wanted to do policy work, but I don't have the connections to get into that field. Management consulting is vomit-worthy "sounds neoliberal but ok" /crap/. "Effective" nonprofits and EA orgs? Well /why/? What I /want/ is academia, and what I already have is tech skills.
