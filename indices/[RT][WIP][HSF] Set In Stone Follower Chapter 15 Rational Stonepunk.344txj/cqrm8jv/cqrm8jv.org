Have you thought of creating a glossary page to explain the definitions of all the new words you are introducing? It would help to be able to look up on your site what jake, adze, tannin, and elefant mean. The words that you either modified or words so rarely used that most people don't know them are slightly confusing when I read them for the first time and I keep stopping to Google what they mean.
