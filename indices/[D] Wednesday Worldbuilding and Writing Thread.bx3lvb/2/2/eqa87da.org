  The remaining survivors are on fleets of magical airships (which conveniently happened to exist in large numbers already, because they were used for trading and war),
#+end_quote

So is the world saved by the hot air balloons of UPS, or Amazon Shipping?

Can people make new ships?*

#+begin_quote
  What interesting consequences might there be here? How might people organize themselves?
#+end_quote

There could be ships, there could be fleets. They could organize themselves into self-sufficient units, or specialize. Imagine a world where everyone lives in mobile homes, and possibly runs a business out of.

#+begin_quote
  Some fragments of the old world were caught in the apocalyptic storm that destroyed it, and those swirling fragments make up the new sky. Occasionally, a chunk of land will fall from the storm, slowly descending into Hell as the magic keeping it aloft fails and triggering a desperate expedition to scavenge resources from it.
#+end_quote

Is there anyone still living on the shards? (What's keeping them up?) What are cultists up to these days?

#+begin_quote
  What problems are likely to be an issue for ships and fleets, assuming they've got food mostly handled via divine or nature magic?
#+end_quote

Aside from possibly crime/factions, do they have nutrition and (clean) water handled? Hygiene? (How do they handle education? Law?) Do they grow plants for sustenance?* How? (Everyone in their own homes, or specialized ships or fleets? Aquaculture? Hydroponics? How much sunlight is there in Hell?) Are there seasons/days and night, is everything the same temperature? Is there weather? Do people have trouble staying warm, or cold? (Is Hell hot, or freezing? Or both, desert in the middle of a continent style?)

#+begin_quote
  divine... magic
#+end_quote

Is anyone turning to lower deities? What do the Gods below have to offer? Is hell inhabited? By the souls of the damned? (Or just people who worship fire/ice?)

*May be related, depending on how airships are made.
