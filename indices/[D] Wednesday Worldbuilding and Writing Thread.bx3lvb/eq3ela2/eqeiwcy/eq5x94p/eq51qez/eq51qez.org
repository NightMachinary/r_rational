I'm writing a world with a bunch of magic systems. So I'll probably be doing a bunch of these (once a week). These are mostly to confirm what I already thought of but to make sure I'm not missing any consequences or ideas /about the magic/ not necessarily the spells I present as examples. I'm mostly interested in munchkin opportunities and professions in a modern world.

Nature Magic. Nature magic is about using the conceptual attributes (that the object is notable for) of a natural object into effects and enchantments (which like all enchantments are subject to universal limits). Anything within the realm of nature can be used to power these effects, which covers a wide variety of things from stars to rocks (gems, metals, and so on), gusts of wind to animals, blades of grass to mountains; notably if these things have been worked by human hands, either domesticated animals, tended gardens, or worked stone, they loose most of their potency (depending on how wild they are). Once an object has had an effect pulled from it, it is unusable for a time (by any nature mage) until it recharges (which varies based on the object).

Examples:

- Stoneskin: By pulling the hardness quality of stone, one's skin can be made to have similar hardness characteristics. Metals or gems also work here.
- Godray: A common offensive spell that pulls from the sun (which recharges extremely quickly as to be effectively un-exhaustable) of concentrated light and heat, the sun must be "up" though.
- Animate Object: By pulling the characteristics of an animal, exaggerated versions of those characteristics can be applied to an inanimate object (until the animal recharges), with slight commands embedded. A pack of wolves could be pulled into a pack of stones to make a pack of vicious hunting rocks. Or migratory bird (or fish) known for it's precision at distance pulled into a message could deliver it. A raccoon pulled into a bag could search someone's trash for interesting things and put it into itself.
- Astrology: Pulling the visible signs in the stars (like most celestial objects, they recharge quickly) can be used to create minor blessings and enchantments that last a day based off of what they signify.
- Gem Magic: A specialized magic, that's effectively it's own discipline focused on the variety of characteristics ascribed to varying gems.
