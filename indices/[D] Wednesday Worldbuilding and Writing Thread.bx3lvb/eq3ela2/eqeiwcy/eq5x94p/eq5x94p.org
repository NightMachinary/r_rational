I'm working on a D&D setting for a campaign I'm planning. The basic premise is that it's set after a cult successfully triggered the apocalypse; the world has cracked into fragments and fallen into Hell. The remaining survivors are on fleets of magical airships (which conveniently happened to exist in large numbers already, because they were used for trading and war), using a variety of magics to prevent starvation.

One of the setting-specific changes is that there's an easy to learn cantrip that produces a tiny amount of the magical fuel that is used by airships, so nearly anyone can convert their time into value at a (fairly low) base rate. All PCs are allowed to know this cantrip for free.

Some fragments of the old world were caught in the apocalyptic storm that destroyed it, and those swirling fragments make up the new sky. Occasionally, a chunk of land will fall from the storm, slowly descending into Hell as the magic keeping it aloft fails and triggering a desperate expedition to scavenge resources from it.

What interesting consequences might there be here? How might people organise themselves? What problems are likely to be an issue for ships and fleets, assuming they've got food mostly handled via divine or nature magic?
