How long ago did this cataclysm occur? Years? Centuries? Is it possible the cult/some of the cultists are still around? Was this a ritual gone horribly wrong, or horribly right? How much time was there for the evacuation to the skies, or did everyone on land when it happened just die? Is time travel a possibility in this world, and is fixing the planet a possible goal?
