One thing you could do is have the summoned be from the same family. (Or families.) You start out with someone, maybe they're a hero, and they're great, which is how the story of summoning (and it's initial popularity) gets going. And then they have kids, and they get summoned, and it's the story of this family. One reason for this could be - people try and summon people who'd have a lot of magical power, and magic tends to run in families.
