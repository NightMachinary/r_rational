I've been trying to plot out a book with the WIP-probably-not-actual title "Isekai Everywhere", which posits a world where "summon protagonist from another world" is pretty damned cheap and getting used for a lot of things that are trivial, not quite approaching Meseeks level, but at least a little bit close.

What I think interests me most is something like /World War Z/, where there are a bunch of stories linked together by a frame story, each of which touches on a different issue or theme, but which taken as a whole are an exploration of the world and its history, especially the moral/ethical issues with summoning someone from another world, the impacts to society, the winners and losers in the scenario, and the unexpected aspects.

So ... for a long time, I've been wanting to write a fantasy travelogue, kind of a slice-of-life thing that involves visiting different places. The structure of it seems pretty obvious: you just have the protagonist learn and grow along the way through his experiences, all of which are fairly mild, you start at the beginning and end with him returning home having changed, maybe making a decision or two along the way. That's the natural shape of that kind of story, at least to me.

But for a story composed of stories like Isekai Everywhere, I'm less confident that I know what it looks like from a structural perspective, even if each story is saying its own thing about something, or building on a meta theme. My natural instinct is that I'd start from a place of stability, have the stories set in unstable times with character/theme/plot links between them, and end with a different kind of stability when everything has settled into some kind of new normal. But I'm not sure about it, and I'm hesitant to do outlining for all the stories if they're going to be stops on the road and I don't know what the road is going to look like.

Advice/thoughts would be appreciated.
