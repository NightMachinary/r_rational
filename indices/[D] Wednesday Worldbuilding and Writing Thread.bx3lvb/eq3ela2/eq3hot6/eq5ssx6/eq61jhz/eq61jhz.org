Your MC objects to Isekai Summoning on ethical grounds, and leaves every place where a Summoning happens. They see Summoning as a form of slavery; they seek a fabled land where no one Summons and where all the necessities for life are produced free of the taint of Summoning.

Every place the MC goes, they discover new ways Summoned people are being used.

A major character development point could be their turn from someone who runs from Summons to someone who banishes Summons, to someone who asks Summoned people what they would prefer.

Similar in feel to the anime Mushi-shi.
