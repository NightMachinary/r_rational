You could play with Magic the Gathering's idea of "Sparks."

The difference is that, instead of being able to change planes on their own, these Sparks are people who are susceptible to being summoned.

The result is that you've got a lot of summoners calling people, but they tend to draw from the same general pool of people.

So, your travelog can be the MC going from a newly awakened world-traveler, to an experienced old hand. Or just talking to other Sparks in the bar where they all hang out between missions.

A "same people, summoned many times" thing also explains why random summoning are better than just picking some guy off the street. Sure, the first time a spark is summoned, they're just some guy. But after the 1000th summon, they're probably pretty competent just by virtue of experience
