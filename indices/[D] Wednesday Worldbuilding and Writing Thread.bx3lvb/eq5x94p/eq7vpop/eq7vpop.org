So everyone's living in relatively close quarters to one another? Is there room to grow and have a family? Who owns the space people live in, or is there no class divide? Is there any kind of economy, or can everyone produce their own food and water? Do individual ships have unique resources? What hobbies can people engage in? Sports? Can one study and be a more productive member of society or is there no impetus in that direction? What impact does Hell have on their day-to-day lives? How are the suicide rates - is there a goal for making the world whole again or getting off the ships? Are there any surviving animals or pets? Mutated monsters or the like attacking the ships? Have people changed due to the altitude or die younger? If they have everything they need. What resources are they scaveging from the fallen chunks of land?
