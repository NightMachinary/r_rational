It sounds like something I would enjoy reading, especially if the MC is using otherworldly knowledge gathered along such a long lifetime to further his goals.

I'm assuming the MC would be going on a quest to patch the veil, once s/he learns what is happening? Or perhaps he becomes *The Golem God of Science* filling the vacancy in the pantheon of Gods so that the poor souls with No True Religion (such as he once was, as many from Earth are) have representation and judgement and can finally RIP?
