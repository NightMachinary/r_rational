Golem world: Golems are an ancient technique that never saw very much use, because in order to animate one, you needed a soul which was not going to any afterlife. A hero too righteous to go to any of the hells, who had somehow offended the gods, a heretical philosopher, or certain kinds of mad(wo)men. For thousands of years, golems were the personal bodyguard slaves of the very rich or powerful, maintained with excruciating care and built to be nigh indestructible.

Then the Academy of Night breached the veil and started hovering up the souls of earths dead. With no True Religions, earth is trailed by a cloud of souls counting many billions. Most summoned by the academy of night are promptly judged and sent onto afterlives that are, uhm, very unexpected, to them, but quite a high faction is claimed by no gods.

Hence the Golem Revolution. The Academy of Night gets very rich and makes many high minded speeches about how their sales of golem power and cognition crystals is just funding their philanthropic endeavor to rescue alien souls from limbo. Also the silk sheets in the student dorms.

MC keels over dead from a stroke at age 98 at a protest rally, and comes to in a student side project with some pretty obvious flaws in the control logic.

Does this sound like a story I should pour some time into fleshing out?
