We're are mostly in agreement on this. What I see is believable human behaviour. What I don't get is how you could choose 5 people out of all the human population and not find someone more suited to be your champion than this. If someone gave you such a pick and you were looking for the best people to fight for sustainable civilisation, would you choose Linka? Surely there are at the very least 5 people more suitable on the whole Earth?

  This meant that the factory suddenly lost its disposal system, which could be an issue for it, but one easily remedied if they bothered to use proper channels.

Because the incentive for the people in the factory to go through proper channels is overwhelming, is it? Maybe this is hindsight bias speaking, but the reaction depicted looks pretty predictable. You go with the cheapest and fastest solution unless there is some reason for you not to, and we have already established that whoever makes the decisions does not consider care for environment or regulations to be terribly important. I also think that author made a bit of a misstep with the arson. People in Russia *know* that your property is liable to mysteriously burn down if you refuse to sell (albeit you are not usually trapped inside), so the decision to just sit tight is a bit suicidal.
