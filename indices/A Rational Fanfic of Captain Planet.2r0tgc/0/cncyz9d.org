I'm up to chapter 8 and expect my opinion to change if I ever read it further. My problems with it so far:

- Ontologically basic fire, water, earth, air and life in universe exactly like ours in every other way.
- Physics broken with no justification provided.
- Gaia is speciest. A natural volcano eruption resulting in an ice age and tremendous changes in ecosphere would not bother it one bit, but human activity somehow is special. Humans obey the same laws of physics as volcanoes. If you are not going to blame a volcano for erupting and killing things, then it's silly to blame humans for behaving as they do. This only makes sense in a world with a magical free will element.
- Gaia conforms to human gender roles.
- Economics broken with no justification.
- According to this fic, humanity is polluting the environment because we're evil and not due to coordination problems. Fight for an optimal ecosphere framed as "Bad vs Good" conflict.
- A fetishistic attitude towards nature.

If I ended up on a the same planet with a sentient agent capable of mass destruction on the scale of gaia and found out that this agent is as dumb and petty as this fic's gaia is, my first priority would be to GTFO. And probably nuke it just to be sure it does not come looking for me later with some other imagined grievance. An alien agent blackmailing/mind-controlling people into it's service under the threat of annihilation of the whole species is not something I appreciate.

EDIT: After reading chapter 8 I can add to my problems:

- Absence of a working brain in Linka's head. Only the first day of superpowers and the death toll is already in double digits. And a minor ecological catastrophe to go along with it! Seriously, who would choose this person to be one of the 5 people to bring about "balance" to the ecosphere? Well, I guess one could interpret "bring balance" to mean "kill humans". Then it works out.

EDIT2: Apparently "nobody was killed" in the indecent mentioned in the previous edit. And there will probably be no negative consequences at all. Because tornadoes are known for spontaneously neutralising toxic industrial waste when they destroy chemical plants. That's just plain author fiat at this point.
