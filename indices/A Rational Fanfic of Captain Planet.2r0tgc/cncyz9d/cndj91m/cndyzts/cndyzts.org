I shall attempt to clarify my position a bit.

- My point is that getting angry at human civilisation for behaving as it does makes about as much sense as getting angry at the sun for solar flares.
- "Unchecked greed and lack of empathy" sure seems a bit evil to me. A story with an environmentalist message that attributes the problems with implementing a more sustainable civilisation to the influence of selfish greedy short-sighted arseholes is monumentally missing the point. Far more insidious and dangerous are coordination problems. I recommend you read [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/][this post]] to get a good idea of what I mean by that. We should create a set of incentives that allows us to cooperate on the problem, not try to shame people into going against their own interests. Even selfish people would prefer a clean Earth to a polluted wasteland. Framing this problem as "good people vs. greedy arseholes" is counterproductive.
- I would say that Star Wars had a Force fetish if the central focus of the characters was to spread force as widely as possible while constantly thinking how beautiful the force was and how greedy and selfish people not using it were. Note that I'm exaggerating for clarity here. This fic is not that blatant and annoying about it. This is mostly a matter of opinion, so it's not really worth debating about, I think.
- I agree that her actions are totally understandable. What I don't agree with is a total lack of fallout, which is pretty much declared by author fiat. A couple of hypothetical questions if you will (let's pretend we are talking about an event in the real world and not a story):

  - What probability would you give that a tornado strong enough to completely demolish an industrial chemical factory would not significantly injure anyone inside it, conditional on there being absolutely no warning given to the people inside?
  - What probability would you give to violent destruction of chemical plant resulting in considerable damage to the surrounding environment given that the factory was known to contain toxic waste and produce pesticides?

What possible criterion could gaia have used to choose its champions that resulted in this short-sighted of a person? Without author protecting her from the consequences she would probably have done more harm to environment on her first day then the factory would do in a couple years. The fact that she's directly responsible for Ruby being an orphan does not endear her to me either. Did she even try to predict what would happen when she started messing with the factory? This lack of foresight is not a characteristic I expect to see in a champion for environment.
