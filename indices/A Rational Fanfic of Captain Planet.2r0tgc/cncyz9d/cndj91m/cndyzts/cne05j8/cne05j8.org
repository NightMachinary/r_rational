I see what you're saying with most of your points. With the Linka thing, I can see what you mean in being annoyed at the handwaved "No innocent people died" thing. Death is approached naively in this fic, I will say that. If not necessarily by the story itself, then by the characters.

As far as her messing with the factory, I believe she deserves more credit. Her first attempt was very well done. She caused little to no damage. All she did was move the river, essentially, which meant the factory couldn't illegally dump inside of it anymore. This meant that the factory suddenly lost its disposal system, which could be an issue for it, but one easily remedied if they bothered to use proper channels. Her second attempt was one driven by fury. Linka IS impulsive, and she clearly loves deeply, so to see two of her small tribe get murdered, is going to impact her emotionally. Hard. And I can see an emotionally devastated teenager with a tornado ring taking out what she perceives to her enemy.

I agree that the damage could've caused a bigger disaster. I'm not discounting that. But I don't think Linka was in the right frame of mind to make her decision either. It was an impulsive decision, that made sense to her morals in the most primitive of ways. Her tribe was attacked. Attack them back.

I don't think Linka's lack of foresight in this decision should be criticized as the author's mistake. i believe the author intentionally set this sequence of events up, to showcase that Linka is impulsive, and loving.
