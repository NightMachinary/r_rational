I like most of your points, but I have an issue with a few. Firstly though SPOILERS up to chapter 8, below.

- Speciest. Saying Gaia is speciest is like calling a country racist for fighting back against an invading country. Gaia's issue with the humans is that (based on the story, anyway) they've hit a point where they're not existing in a sustainable fashion. The other large, acts of destruction, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, ice ages, etc. do their damage in a way that nature can recover from. Humans consume in non sustainable ways. Ways the planet doesn't naturally recover from. Mostly due to our proliferation, and also the rate of consumption of our race, especially those in first world countries. Gaia isn't mad because humans kill things. She's mad because we are removing things from her cycles. At non-renewable rates. With continued, unchecked removal, her cycles will be irreparably damaged and the environment would cease to exist (admittedly, humans MAY die off before we got to push the environment to that point, simply because we would die off much quicker than the environment would) Conclusion, Gaia is mad out of self preservation. Where natural things, such as trees, water, etc. are how she bases her vitality and sense of self.

- Doesn't ever hint that humans are polluting things for the sake of being evil. It states that humans are polluting due to unchecked greed, specifically "The Corporation" and its unchecked greed, and a disregard for the environment due to a lack of empathy for it.

- Fetishistic attitude about nature. <--- Nope. It heavily promotes nature, and sustaining it. You can almost call it a soapbox, but even that's stretching it. It's a story about the Earth's Spirit finding pro-Earth people to fight for it. Do you also want to say that Star Wars has a Force fetish? You can't pick up a story and accuse it of fetishism, simply for sticking to the subject matter.

- Linka. I'm not pro or anti Linka. But I don't think you can say she has no working brain. She's impulsive, single minded, and short sighted, sure. But I think her actions were more than reasonable, and consistent with her character. The factory was threatening her tribe (for lack of a better term) for years with its pollution of their water source, and she fixed the issue safely. Then they proceeded to threaten her tribe. And kill two members of it. Her decision to attack the factory was impulsively taken, immediately after she got the news of the murders. A crime of passion, if you will. While not rational, her actions were more than understandable.
