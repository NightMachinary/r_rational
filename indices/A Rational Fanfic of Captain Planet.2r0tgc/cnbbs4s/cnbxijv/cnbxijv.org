I can't say I agree with all the adaptational changes the author made, but on the whole, this is the best Captain Planet-related thing ever and if they ever make a movie, it should be based on this fanfiction.

That said, while it has rationalist elements, I feel like the aim was more realism + Gaia. And I use realism loosely, since the premise behind The Corporation is kinda hilarious (Where did the incentives come from, and how did the economy not turn into a sac of kittens as a result?).

But granting the two weird premises--The Corporation works, and Gaia/the rings work as portrayed--it does an excellent job.

For bonus Rationalist Fiction points, Gaia is considerably less mentor-like and more Emergent Planetary Intelligence-like, so she doesn't give the planeteers much guidance, forcing them to figure out loads of things on their own. They don't get anything for free other than, perhaps, enough local termoil to let them up and leave home for planeteering.

It's been a few months since I've read it, but if a discussion is to be had, I'll gladly reread so I know my memory isn't betraying me.
