Read the entire thing. A very interesting take on the series. It's pro Nature, most definitely. Very green. But come on, it's Captain Planet. What can you expect?

Very well written overall, a pretty good read. You don't need any foreknowledge of the series either. Gaia is handled in a much more mature away, as cae_jones has remarked, and I agree with its depiction.

Rationally, must certainly be taken with a grain of salt. The conceptualization of elements is always tricky to do in a way that's sensible. Gaia's existence mirrors biological entities (self preservation instincts, emotions, etc.) The Corporation, to people that know economics, doesn't seem feasible (I am NOT an economist, but I have economist friends)
