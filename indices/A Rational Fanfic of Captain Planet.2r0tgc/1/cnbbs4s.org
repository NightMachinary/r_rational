I haven't read this fanfiction yet, but this was recently added to TV Tropes under [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic][Rational Fiction]] and I don't have the time to read through it. So I'm hoping that there's someone on this subreddit who has and can give their opinion how good the story is, and how rational/rationalist it is. ;)

As a reason to read it, it's already complete so there's no torturous waiting for updates like we already do with HPMOR.
