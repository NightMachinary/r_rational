I am a full blown addict for this story. Nic is an amazing protagonist who is just so willing to shred his own assumptions in the face of new information. The supporting cast just makes it even better.

Simole just casually being a badass and Nic having no problem with that/ never acting insecure that it's the girl handing out the asskickings.

Fanny and Davo could have their own comedy duo with the way they're going. They ground the whole story in a way that is as necessary as it is hilarious.

Dizzy is great too. The way her character just /dismantles/ the whole 'long lost childhood friend' trope is brilliant.

Love this story. Love it to death. Can't wait for next week.
