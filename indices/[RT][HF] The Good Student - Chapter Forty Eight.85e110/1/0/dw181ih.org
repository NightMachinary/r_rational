(Before I forget, the concern about demons being an exhaustible resource is that they would /run out/, unless there were means of replenishment. Or alternate sources.)

I'm now reviewing chapter 48 (the denouement), 38 (the story), chapter 40 (the almost-denouement), and our communication in chapter 39's comments.

Hm. Both the 'for a demon to have desires' and the 'failure because of a rejected truth' fit the mould of 'for a demon to accept it as a possibility, the demon must admit it to be possible which was thought impossible'. From 40 and the analysis of the 'Librarian', it suggests that the demon was already concept with the concept of a demon having desires, and was only pretending that /that/ was a worldview-overturning thing. (I came to the same conclusion as you about the Librarian, as primed by the wraiths!)

(I still don't understand the exact nuances of meaning in the pug conversation. Between Roke and the All-Mother, did either lie to the other? The situation sounded more as though they were in cahoots, with Roke lying to distract him and the All-Mother cooperating.)

It bothers me that the denouement doesn't slot into the rest of the story. If it's an ending-which-satisfies-but-doesn't-actually-follow, then perhaps in the same vein as the 'has blood ever returned to an open vein?' direct contradiction. Why would the demon's inability to lie make it fail? Why would its ability to lie depend on its acceptance of the truth? Would its acceptance of the truth truly grant it the ability to lie? Thinking back to the demon having been the Green Demon, in a sense--is that something that the demon in fact tried (to openly be accepted as a demon leader), but failed, and didn't know why? But the denouement makes no sense unless it's true, and the demon could really have become able to lie (not impossible?). A sneaky way (story, direct contradiction) to deliver the greatest shock to (/spring it on) the demon?

So far the genre still sounds like fantasy to me, but hard(?)/nicely-structured fantasy, with the 'sufficiently advanced technology indistinguishable from magic' applying. Or rather, 'magic' can be treated as a separate set of laws which haven't been coupled to known science or pseudoscience (whether wraiths are controlled via magic and force of wlll, compared with swarms of nanomachines, say). The stars don't necessarily have to be different from our stars for magic to apply. Speaking of which, I've lost track of what happened with the stars--were the stars blotted out only around the Academy, from the dome? Or were they all blotted out a long time ago, with Roke wanting to reach the real ones? Hm.

(Incidentally, the All-Father story was very nice, particularly the human's wish. It's unclear to me why the demon went along with it, instead of continuing to wait for a wish which could satisfy its aim and not sacrifice anything. Unless it also was happy to change, if that was even better for it than going home, and if that helps explain how all the other demons could be depopulated... there's also the question of whether other dragons come from, asexual reproduction or whether they themselves are demons.)

I'm tempted to put forward a counter-proposal that demons are how more dragons get made, but that wouldn't explain the unconsciousness when becoming a mage, unless... hm? The first human, /he/ became a mage while the demon became a dragon. The All-Mother knew of this, and knew that there were more mages and more dragons, but the demon didn't seem to have concluded that the same thing had continued to take place. If that's not it, then what's the secret?

Amusing if the demon becomes the 'human' and the human becomes the dragon, and that would explain the unconsciousness--oh, and the dragon-longing-for human would have gotten to /be/ a dragon, which would be awesome, but why have the demon think he was a mage (and die?), then?... oh, and incidentally conceiving of another pattern whereby mage-candidates (actually dragon-candidates) are turned into new dragons, and in the process an old mage (demon) replaces the new mage-candidate, taking on the new identity and memories, number of mages being limited by number of demons while number of dragons can slowly rise, limited by lifespan and deaths... both ways, there's the question of gradual demon depletion by either mage or dragon death, depending on which they are...

The above musing doesn't solve the problem of why, with more mages and dragons, demon conversion/exhaustion couldn't be satisfactorily posited/concluded even without going in person and determining the exact situation. And it's as yet unexplained how Simole exists! If the demon becomes the mage, turning the human into a dragon, then presumably she would be a human-demon hybrid, but then what the identity of her mother? Or else she'd be a demon who was raised from an infant, getting the full demon potential (with a human's outlook) rather than limiting it to the bounds of an already-formed human personality? That--an infant mage ritual--sounds simpler (Occam's razor) than a new unexplained hybrid possibility. A mage-from-birth, something created not because it couldn't be before, but because no one other than the Archmage (and collaborators) would dare to unlease such a dangerous/hard-to-control *weapon*...
