  Why would the demon's inability to lie make it fail? Why would its ability to lie depend on its acceptance of the truth? Would its acceptance of the truth truly grant it the ability to lie?

I think that's just generally how lying works. If you don't know the truth you wouldn't be very confident in your lie.

Say you have to lie about the capital of Greece and you don't know a single thing about the history and geography of the region. It would be very difficult as you'd have to fabricate virtually everything.

Meanwhile, if you had a lot of knowledge about all these things you could use that to your advantage. It would be easy to come up with something plausible, you could mix truth with lies and you would be more confident at lying (as you're more secure in your own position).
