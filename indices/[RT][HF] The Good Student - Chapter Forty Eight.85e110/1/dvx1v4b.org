Well, well, well. [[/u/MultipartiteMind][u/MultipartiteMind]], if I'm reading this correctly, it appears that [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7fqdbf/rthf_the_good_student_chapter_thirty_nine/dqen9ju/][we have called it]]. Nic had an insight regarding a demon's possible behaviour that the actual demon wouldn't have accepted: that there could be a situation in which a demon would want to /reject/ the truth.

--------------

*Prediction:* Mages are made by making demons possess humans, then brainwashing them to believe they're the humans they're possessing. Essentially uploading humans into Arcanum/demons' essences, then having said Arcanum possess the initial meatsacks.

Holy hell, the latest few chapters were just constant plot twists. I can't even keep the /genre/ straight. [[https://i.imgur.com/d83ioGS.jpg][Is it fantasy? Is it fantasy with sci-fi tropes? Is it secretly hard sci-fi?]]

I'll have to make a thorough analysis to break down out what the truth was vs. what people/entities at various points assumed was the truth vs. why (or by whose plot) they assumed that. It's quite a mess.

Hm, if Nic's demon is the last demon, what about the Librarian? Was she just an aspect/fork of her, as per Nic's wraith trick?.. Come to think of it, she did say they were in constant communication, and knew everything Nic's demon knew, e.g. the Green Demon story. It fits.

In fact, it /explains/ a few things. For example, it appeared to me that she was by far better at social than the other demon, and yet she wasn't the one sent to the Other Place, even though the All-Mother's plan was to acquire a demon who is good at understanding people (or so Nic assumed), which caused me some confusion... Wait, is that even relevant? It wasn't the All-Mother's plan, it was Winnum Roke's plan, and she didn't need a people demon, she needed /a/ demon to power her spacecraft... Ah, wait, Roke's plan included giving the world over to the All-Mother, and she still needed a people demon, it all fits then.
