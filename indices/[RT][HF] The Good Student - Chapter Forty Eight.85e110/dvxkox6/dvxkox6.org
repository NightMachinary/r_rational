So. Winnum Roke and All-Mother made a deal, ages ago - the planet for the spaceship. They swapped places, however Winnum Roke felt cheated because she wanted to go to other stars, but couldn't, due to her lack of imagination. Somehow, she was in contact with the Royal College and Simone, along with Delcroix, were a part of her plan.

Nic, however, seems to be a variable introduced by the All-Mother. To quote him directly:

  â€œIt's like I had been prepared for this place. I guess that's why she sent me here. It's always been very clear to me that there is more than one truth, and that they can exist alongside each other..."

The nature of the demons is very interesting. In this chapter, we've seen it become convinced it's actually one entity instead of many. Could something similar have happened at the very beginning? Maybe it's not a demon at all. Maybe the native people of Nic's world believed the advanced tech of the demon was magic, and through their belief, they managed to convince it to change its nature.
