  I still don't understand the exact nuances of meaning in the pug conversation. Between Roke and the All-Mother, did either lie to the other?
#+end_quote

I think the All-Mother "lied" to Roke in the sense of letting her fail. Their agreement was, the All-Mother provides Roke the starship, Roke lets the All-Mother have the planet. Except Roke didn't manage to get anywhere with the starship, and I think the All-Mother /knew/ that this would happen, and let it so that she would have Roke's direct help with taking over human world (instead of simple non-interference).

#+begin_quote
  Why would the demon's inability to lie make it fail?
#+end_quote

That seems unclear, yes.

  'sufficiently advanced technology indistinguishable from magic'
#+end_quote

Yes, I agree. What fascinates me, though, is this part:

#+begin_quote
  For her it was always very simple. My truth is better than your truth. That didn't work here, with unlimited Arcanum. Everyone's truth was as strong as everyone else's.
#+end_quote

Apparently the demons lived in a post-scarcity society. Is the All-Mother their FAI?

#+begin_quote
  of which, I've lost track of what happened with the stars--were the stars blotted out only around the Academy, from the dome?
#+end_quote

Yes. I think those are entirely separate things. Roke's stars were blotted out because of her lack of imagination/Arcanum/magicbabble. The dome was the Archmage's plot, to fully isolate the invading demons in one place, nothing to do with stars in particular.

#+begin_quote
  It's unclear to me why the demon went along with it, instead of continuing to wait for a wish which could satisfy its aim and not sacrifice anything
#+end_quote

Maybe it didn't realize the implications right away. Maybe it was committed to granting the wish after Yagare told it, likes it it or not.

#+begin_quote
  there's also the question of whether other dragons come from
#+end_quote

Recall [[https://moodylit.com/the-good-student-table-of-contents/chapter-ten][chapter 10]]. There's only one male dragon, the All-Father, the rest are female, and it's mentioned they're completely subservient to him.

That said, in support of your theory...

#+begin_quote
  “The dragons the other day, they smelled their father on you. It was enough for them to bow their heads. Lots of bowing in dragon culture. Not so much like dogs. *More like people*.”
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  The first human, /he/ became a mage while the demon became a dragon. The All-Mother knew of this, and knew that there were more mages and more dragons, but the demon didn't seem to have concluded that the same thing had continued to take place. If that's not it, then what's the secret?
#+end_quote

Well, now that you've said it, that seems blatantly correct. It's also something Nic could have figured out instantly, and he did say he knew the truth already. Why didn't the demon figured this out...

- Did she not figure this out?

- Does she know the truth about the All-Father?

In fact, the mages system and Arcanum were, according to the story, a long-term assimilation plot by the demons. Unless they deliberately set it up to be +brain+mind-washed into becoming dragons, there probably should be some other (demon-friendly) way of creating mages, that the Royal College abandoned in favour of their own.

Maybe the demon doesn't know how the All-Father ended up, and thinks mages are made the way the demons intended it. Or maybe she figured it all out and just pretends not to.

#+begin_quote
  the question of gradual demon depletion by either mage or dragon death
#+end_quote

Seems simple: when "mages"/"dragons" die, demons the Arcanum entities don't die, just stop playing their roles and go back to the Royal College.

#+begin_quote
  Simole created by an infant mage ritual
#+end_quote

That was my interpretation, and I'm not sure why it's not Nic and Simole's default interpretation either. She was just made a mage before she could form conscious memories.
