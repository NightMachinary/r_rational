That then would suggest that a demon could say something that was clearly an untruth, but be caught. Have demons (in this universe) in practice been able to say untruths, caught or not..?

(Related thought, I'm assuming the Librarian used phrasing that, at the most, only referred to herself in the third person, but did she in fact lie and state that merging had taken place, which hadn't? I should go back and reread that.)

More relevant to my earlier impression is that the lack-of-confidence matter only kicks in when talking about something that touches on the truth. If you want to lie that you're in communication with the other demons, but you're not, then you can be caught in the lie when you don't actually know the truth. However, if you want to lie about other things, such as to do with being a leader of humans, then you only need to know the truth about human things. Unless your actions are stemming from knowledge which you won't consciously allow yourself to admit, resulting in dissonance. But you would still have 'the ability to lie', just not about things where that dissonance was related.

Rereading; chapter 46. A lot of amusing 'I can read hers. As well as I can hear my own thoughts.'; 'I was as captivated as she'. But also 'She has merged with you, thanks to your story.'. 'You won her trust. She thinks you will change her'...'It was a wonderful lie'. Lies? If truly lies, then I could claim that the demon has, in fact, learned to lie. That I'm really curious about how, despite being able to lie to that extent, she still failed at being a human leader. When Nic said that she had to learn to lie, he should have more precisely said lie about /what/ that would have allowed the humans to accept her as their leader...)

(And now I'm thinking about the stories, and how the demon has evidently displayed the ability to at least communicate things not literally true, though the stories might still be metaphorically/euphemistically/non-literally true...)
