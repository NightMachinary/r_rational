You're given a choice between two weak versions of the Death Note: a Happy Note or a Sad Note. When a person's name is written in the Happy/Sad Note, their entire utility function is modified such that they feel slightly happier/sadder about everything (by the same amount). (It's hard to quantify happiness, but let's say, roughly the amount of happiness an average person would get from hearing a good joke.) When their name is erased from the Happy/Sad Note, their utility function returns to normal.

Which Note do you choose and what do you do with it? What unorthodox uses for these Notes are there?
