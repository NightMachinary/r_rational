  I think it would be morally repugnant to rewrite someone's utility function without their consent. Whether we do that by just speaking to people in our day-to-day lives is debatable. I'm just going to stop considering the moral implications for now, but I wouldn't use either notebook without examining the question further.

Definitely something to worry about. I wouldn't be happy about someone messing with my utility function either. But then, you could always ask for their consent before using the notes.

  Want someone famous to quit using twitter? Sad note them for a few minutes every time you see a new tweet.

LOL. That's the most petty evil I've seen on this sub. I love it.

  Make babies on planes stop crying through introductions and small talk with their parents.

I don't think the Happy Note is strong enough for this. Being on a plane is an absolutely stressful experience when you don't have any idea what is going on. Plus if it did work, I would be worried if the baby was actually crying for a reason. What if it was crying because it was hungry? Would the Happy Note make it stay happy and silent even while it starves to death? ^{oh hey that's an unorthodox use...} /Cough/ Ahem, err... what were we talking about?

Oh the notes, right. Huh, I guess these Notes are pretty useful for training other people's inner pigeons. You could probably train yourself with them too, making yourself feel happier every time you take an action you approve of.
