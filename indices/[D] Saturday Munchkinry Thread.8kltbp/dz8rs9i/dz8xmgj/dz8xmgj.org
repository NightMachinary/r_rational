I think it would be morally repugnant to rewrite someone's utility function without their consent. Whether we do that by just speaking to people in our day-to-day lives is debatable. I'm just going to stop considering the moral implications for now, but I wouldn't use either notebook without examining the question further.

Both notebooks are useful for forming associations. Want people to help you more at work? Happy note them for ten minutes after they help you. Want someone famous to quit using twitter? Sad note them for a few minutes every time you see a new tweet.

In general, I think it's easier to use the happy note to get what you want--you can happy note anyone you are about to interact with, and let the positive associations do work. Let's consider only the happy note, for now. You could become a behavioral psychotherapist or devious salesperson. You wanted unorthodox uses, though...

Embarrass and befuddle public figures by making them smile inappropriately during speeches and debates.

Form a medium-size cult by giving your brainwashing sessions a boost.

Become a very successful comedian by having your patrons sign in before performances.

Make babies on planes stop crying through introductions and small talk with their parents.

Make any club or activity more compelling to the members. (That's why they have pizza!) Actually, we're back to the mundane.

In the limit of trying to get every human being on Earth to sign a page of the notebook, with the ability to tear out five regenerating pages (at a time) per second, and 30 names per page, it would take you about a year and a half of continuous tearing to supply enough happy note pages. You'd need a network of people to distribute the pages. Perhaps talk to James Randi, then the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Anyway, with four hours tearing pages out per day you could supply enough material to improve the happiness of everyone on Earth in less than a decade. You'd also develop really tone forearms.

That's assuming a machine can't tear the pages out, without compromising the power. (I assume machine writing doesn't work on the notebook.) If a machine can tear pages out, you need to set up a printing press. You might even put your ideology on each sheet of paper, so that people think they not only get a happiness boost but that it comes from them agreeing to behave how you want them to behave.

Trying to get the world to not freak out about signing contracts with direct psychological consequences is another aspect I'll not consider for now.
