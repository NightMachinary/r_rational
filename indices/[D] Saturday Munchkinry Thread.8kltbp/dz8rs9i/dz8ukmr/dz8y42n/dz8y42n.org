Antidepressants help some people, but I'm not sure they would help everyone. It might be that improving everyone's mood reduces their motivation to solve problems, or to be nice to others, or even to interact with others at all. Maybe happier people are also happier not trying to be nice to each other, and the world total happiness would remain constant.

Also, if the note stops working for whatever reason, that would be a dark day for humanity.

Despite these objections, I like your idea quite a lot. "Pay it forward" works even better if the first interaction hits thousands, and is more immediately self-reinforcing.
