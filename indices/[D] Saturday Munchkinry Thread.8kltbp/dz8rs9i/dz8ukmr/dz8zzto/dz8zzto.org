Keep in mind that the Happy Note makes people happier about /everything/. So they will be happier about helping people, but also happier about hurting people. If you write someone's name in the book, and they turn out to be a corrupted official, they enjoy their corruption more. Effectively, writing the names of bad people in the Happy Note could give them more motivation to do bad things.
