Imagine a large sphere, with a single spike on the bottom, pointing down. Imagine this directly over the opponent's avatar. The huge boulder gives it a lot of weight, and the needle underneath puts all that weight on a point - it's really simple, so it's easy to create, and if I pile my willpower into the /point/ of the needle, then the rest of the boulder doesn't use much will. Sure, creating that at a distance will take a lot out of me, but it's going to be rather difficult to defend against... it should smash that point through any armour unless I'm /totally/ outgunned in the Will department.

Can I do light-bending objects? Like magnifying gasses or funhouse mirrors? Because if I can make the other guy think I'm over there when I'm really over here...

--------------

Can I create sounds? A voice yelling from behind my opponent has all /sorts/ of uses...
