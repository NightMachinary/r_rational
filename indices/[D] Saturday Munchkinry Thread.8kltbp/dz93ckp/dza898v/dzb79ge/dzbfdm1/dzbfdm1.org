  Imagine a large sphere, with a single spike on the bottom, pointing down.
#+end_quote

A single spike is easily dodged, though the huge boulder isn't. I can think of two counters: either don't get close enough for the enemy to visualize a huge boulder above you, or put your own objects above you. Visualize a whip and spin it around above yourself. Since objects can't be visualized within other objects, your enemy won't be able to visualize a boulder where your whip is. He would be forced to visualize it further up in the air, costing more will and making it easier for you to dodge.

  The only sounds of this world are your direction-less communications with your opponent and the sounds of simulated objects colliding, which i imagine to be dull thuds.

  gas isn't a thing,
#+end_quote

Wait a tick, if there's no gases, there's nothing for the sound to travel through to reach your ears. Sounds don't travel through vacuums. Though I guess since this is a VR you could just alter the laws of physics to make it work.
