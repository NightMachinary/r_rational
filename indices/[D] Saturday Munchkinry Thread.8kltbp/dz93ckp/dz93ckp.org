The setting is a virtual reality videogame with full immersion. The game is composed of duels to exhaustion.

Your avatar is your mental image of your self. Moving through the simulation feels like moving through reality. You can equip yourself with weapons and armor by visualizing them in sufficient detail. The game does physics simulations on objects after they are created.

Some rules:

- Stronger visualization means a stronger object.
- Practice makes perfect for visualizing objects, and it's easier to visualize named things from real life.
- It's easier to maintain an object than to create a new one.
- An object's appearance can vary, but simulation-wise everything has identical density.
- Larger objects, more objects, distant objects, hidden objects, objects moving independent of simulation, and transforming objects are harder to visualize--they require more will to create and maintain.
- You can't materialize an object inside of another.
- Colliding objects tend to bounce off each other with deformations that cost will to reverse (or a small constant level of will to accept). Stronger objects deform less, and slow collisions don't damage either object.
- The above means that sharp objects inflict greater 'damage' (cost to will) on objects that aren't sharp, depending on how they collide.
- Spending more will can make a weaker object outlast a stronger one with repeated collisions.
- Objects vanish when players choose to stop visualizing them, or are forced to stop from exhaustion.
- A duel is lost when a player's brain is too tired to keep the mental image of self coherent. IE, your HP and Mana are the same: your ability to concentrate. The game rough-estimates willpower as an HP bar.
- Direct collision between an avatar and an object is much more mentally taxing for the player who owns the avatar.
- Duels take place on an infinite featureless plane with consistent lighting.

Finally, for the sake of scale, assume that at most you can maintain a visualization of 100 cubic meters of ephemeral unmoving blocks, or 10 cubic centimeters of inviolate material, without draining your will excessively rapidly.

Under these conditions, how would you go about becoming a successful and skilled player of this video game?

What sorts of avenues would you explore regarding fighting style?
