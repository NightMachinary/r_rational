So: it takes about a week for big changes like stores to propagate, but small things like product changes or display moves takes a day for already established things. That does open the idea of just stuffing a vault with gold and other valuable things, thanks. People would probably steal a gold building before you get to it.

Yeah, monsters drop energy cores. Monsters are also based on stuff from the building the dungeon grew from. Living sculptures from a museum, power tools from a hardware store, etc. This follows the same scrambling logic of everything else, and there tends to be a lot of variety.

Power is more like calories than xp, yes they can make artifacts, but the limiting factor is power growth and teamwork.

Destroying a building closes the dungeon until the building repairs, and you only get the sparse stuff, weakest monsters when you level it.

Unfortunately, that just gives you monsters that are death traps, or traps the monsters control.

Dungeons look like the building they came from, just proggressively more warped the further in you go, with wonkier products filling the shelves and wonkier monsters attacking you.
