This doesn't quite compute for me. Do you mean, the outside of a building is scrambled?

If I go to a large bookstore's location, could I get books out of the book dungeon?

My plan would be to open a mall and stockpile whatever people want to buy. Sell only half your inventory in a day, go to your mall in the dungeon world to restock.

I'd look into setting up a pipeline from the dungeon for a lake--infinite water. I'd also look into dumping sewage and nuclear waste into a pit dungeon, which presumably the alternate Earth can dispose of with the same magic it uses to generate things. And I'd see how much power I could draw from a dungeon with electrical lines in it.

All of these possibilities depend on how things are moved between worlds: if I can move truckloads of food, I can probably move truckloads of water, waste, and batteries. Whether it is worth it to do so depends on the specifics.

Now I know where all those IPhone knockoffs come from!
