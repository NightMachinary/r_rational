No people, but there are animals? So... you could basically obtain any (non-extinct) animal for any zoo or park anywhere?

You could save species from the brink of extinction! Depending on exactly how the alternate Earth works, you might even be able to bring back animals that humans have made extinct, like the passenger pigeon! (If you find you can do this, then beware diseases that have been eradicated by humans).
