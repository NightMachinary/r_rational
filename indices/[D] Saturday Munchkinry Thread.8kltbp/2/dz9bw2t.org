I need help exploiting a setting I've designed.

Basically, imagine you have access to an alternate earth with no people in it, but otherwise almost identical to the normal world. Text, logos, and other aesthetic stuff is scrambled. It fixes itself when people aren't around, and it usually only takes around 24 hours to reset.

Furthermore, large enough structures turn into dungeons. Dungeons are infinite, based on the building it grew from, and as you go deeper in the warped-ness of the products, the strength of monsters, and the general bizarreness of the structures increase. A normal, fit, experienced human can go about 5 building lengths into a dungeon before being overwhelmed, more or less.

Deliberate alterations stick around for more than 24 hours if you maintain them.

The size required for a dungeon to generate is approximately large enough for a little kid to get lost in.

Open air malls turn into dungeons, cities don't. Parks, even national ones, turn into dungeons, while unclaimed or unimportant wilderness doesn't.

Your goal is to extract as much value from the alternate earth as ethically possible. Selling gold, jewels, and electronics is in, selling drugs is out. Donating truckloads of food is one of the things my characters are going to do.

What other methods of money making are there? I thought of stealing paintings from a museum dungeon, and then selling authentic forgeries, as one possible method of revenue.
