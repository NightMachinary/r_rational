  People would probably steal a gold building before you get to it.

Do it secretly? Or rather, how are they going to steal a building in the alternate earth? They could try to steal the building on the real earth, but you can just hire guards to stop them from doing that. The building is basically a large bank vault, you just have to guard it the same way banks guard their vaults.

  Unfortunately, that just gives you monsters that are death traps, or traps the monsters control.

Hmm... okay, suppose a construct a building that is just one large spiraling ramp going round and round into the depths of the earth (for say 10 basement levels). I also build a large boulder outside the entrance of this building.

When I go to the alternate earth, can i just push this boulder into the building, causing it to roll down the ramp, and crush tons of monsters into paste?
