There's quite a few ways I can think about beating that. For one you could just add complex side passages since you would still be able to kill all the monsters on the main path. Plus if the boulder was outside the dungeon it doesn't seem like there's any reason dungeon generation would be smart enough to somehow take its use as a weapon into account.\\
Not to mention you could just item dupe lots and lots of explosives.
