No, you said a building that was constructed out of valuables. A vault you owned is valid for item duping.

Unfortunately:

1. That's not complex enough to make a kid lost.

2. Dungeon generation can inherently defeat that design, say, by widening corridors

3. Monsters are going to be strong/smart enough to bypass this by the time it becomes viable.
