What are the rules for structural transfers between worlds?

If you build a building on the normal earth, does it appear on the alternate earth? If so, you can construct buildings with layouts designed to give you an advantage or give monsters disadvantages.

The next question is: is there any merit for fighting monsters? Do they drop valuable stuff? Magic equipment or materials? Do they give you experience points that let you improve yourself?

If there are merits for killing monsters, the next question is: define kill. How does the world tell who is doing the killing? Can you build a very fragile building in the real world, transfer to the alternate Earth, then knock it down and effectively kill everything inside the dungeon at once?

If the fact that the dungeon is infinite somehow strengthens the structural integrity of the building, what about creating horrible death traps in the real world building? Fill it up with all kinds of horrible machinery turning it into a massive meat grinder, then go to the alternate earth and turn it on to grind up all the monsters.

Alternatively, what about item duping? If buildings built in the real world magically appear in the alternate world, can you just construct a building out of extremely valuable materials, then go to the alternate earth every 24 hours to take it apart for materials over and over?
