I didn't want to get into the morality of altering utility functions. It's true that speech alters the listener, but I think these notebooks are on another level. After all, you expect them to work on the depressed above and beyond mere speech--necessitating the burning of one, and the rushing of the other into service.

Which isn't to say I disagree with your plan. It seems alright to me, mostly because you'd ask for consent.

Also happy cake day.
