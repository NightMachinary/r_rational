Happy note, definitely, then I'd just start writing every name I could starting with the most influential people I could think of. Our every interaction alters the mood of everyone we interact with, and the better position we start from the more likely we are to improve the the mood of the person we're interacting with.

Every little smile, sure, but also every time we don't complain or get exasperated or fail to make eye contact. Each point of contact has the opportunity to improve or deteriorate the life experience of not just the person we contact, but every person they contact for the rest of the day, the week, the month, the year, their life.

The ripple effects are small, but they're continuous. No matter how bad things are, no matter how bad they get, they'd be slightly better. For everyone. A little anti-depressant for the world, one interaction at a time.
