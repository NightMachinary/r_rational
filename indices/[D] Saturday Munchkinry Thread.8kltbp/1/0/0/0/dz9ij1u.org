More questions: Is the ground breakable? Can you dig a tunnel and hide inside it?

Can you visualize gases, or things that will turn into gases? For example, can you visualize a block of dry ice, which will rapidly create a suffocating fog? (Do you need to breathe? If not, it is still a good smokescreen.)

What about radioactive material? Does it count as a transforming object? Can I visualize a chunk of uranium large enough to explode (or any bomb really), killing us both? I would win if I visualized it closer to the enemy than myself!
