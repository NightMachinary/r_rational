  Do you just mean this as in, normal physics?
#+end_quote

Pretty much. I just wanted to emphasize that deformations depend on the specifics of the collision, and that the intuition that spears need to be sharp still applies.

#+begin_quote
  Does complexity matter?
#+end_quote

Yes, complexity adds difficulty.

  can you visualize a magnet

  To make this not game breaking...
#+end_quote

I was going to go with 'no.' I'm not sure how to handle 'magnet to draw my opponent's sword,' vs 'my sword isn't magnetic', so magnetic forces are left out for now. If you visualize a magnet, it will be magnet-shaped but otherwise just a thing.

#+begin_quote
  Is there gravity?
#+end_quote

Yes.

#+begin_quote
  Once you get above your opponent you can just start visualizing stuff to drop on them

Excellent strategy! Preventing objects from falling requires will, however--they aren't static once created. Flying has a will cost, so a counter-strategy might be to flee in some direction and wait for the flyer's willpower to deplete. Running on the ground is nearly free. Also, falling and hitting the ground strains your avatar, so having to dodge while flying is high risk.
