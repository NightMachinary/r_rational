  The above means that sharp objects inflict greater 'damage' (cost to will) on objects that aren't sharp, depending on how they collide.

Do you just mean this as in, normal physics? Or is there an actual sharpness bonus? In other words, are we going to be rewarded for visualizing pincushion armors? Should everyone just turn themselves into Hedgehogs with spikes everywhere?

  Larger objects, more objects, distant objects, hidden objects, objects moving independent of simulation, and transforming objects are harder to visualize--they require more will to create and maintain.

Does complexity matter? E.g. does a crossbow cost more to visualize than a cube of the same volume? I'm assuming it does, otherwise victory goes to whoever designs the greatest tiny non-self-moving machines.

Also what about objects that don't move, but exert forces on other objects? For example, can you visualize a magnet? Then visualize magnetic stuff and move them around with your magnets? To make this not game breaking, the visualization cost should scale upwards with the amount of force exerted, otherwise players would be able to visualize ridiculously powerful railguns.

  Duels take place on an infinite featureless plane with consistent lighting.

Is there gravity? If so, the next question is how hard is it to fly? Can you repeatedly visualize a board under your feet to jump off as soon as it appears? Having the high ground offers a great advantage if there is gravity, so there will be a lot of players researching different methods of flight to find the cheapest ones. For example: visualizing compressed springs under you that immediately decompress, shooting you upwards (or in whatever direction you prefer).

Once you get above your opponent you can just start visualizing stuff to drop on them, while they will have difficulty fighting back since they would either have to visualize stuff near you (which is far from them and thus costs a ton) or visualize stuff that moves itself towards you (which is self-moving and so costs a ton). At sufficiently great heights, you wouldn't even need to visualize heavy blocks to crush them flat. Just visualize needles, they're deadly enough and very hard to see, making them hard to dodge.
