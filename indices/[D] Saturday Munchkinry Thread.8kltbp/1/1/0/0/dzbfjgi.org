  How would you counter such a strategy?

Hide. If I can't be located, I can't be sphere-and-spiked; and a long, low wall will make it hard for him to tell where I am behind it. Tricks with mirrors and fake noises can also make me appear to be where I am not, hopefully forcing him to waste willpower on sphere-and-spikes in the wrong place.

And if I can make my long wall one-way transparent, then I can hide but still see him.
