That's a good strategy. Successful players will be afraid of death from above. How would you counter such a strategy?

  Can I do light-bending objects?

Another good thought. How exactly would you use mirrors to fool an enemy? Perhaps a long mirror angled to one side, so they have a fifty percent chance of misplacing their sphere-and-spike.
