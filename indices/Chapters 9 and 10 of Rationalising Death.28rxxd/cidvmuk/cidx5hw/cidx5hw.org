[Spoilers for chapter 10]

I don't have that problem because I generally don't virtualise characters as smart as I am (or smarter, in the case of Misa), and even when I do, I cripple them in that front. Mostly. People think in different ways, and not everyone smart makes all the necessary leaps to reach that conclusion, and even when they do they might do it in different ways. Light and Misa reacted in wildly different manners to the existence of the death notes, and L himself, in spite of not knowing explicitly about the DN, has his own ways of dealing with the knowledge.

That said, it's a thing that's been... /irking/ me in most rationalist fiction, especially fanfiction, or all fiction that has supposedly ultra-smart characters, that /no one notices/ that they're obviously in a Dark Lord (or god) world. So you can imagine how happy I was at having a character /finally/ realise it.

And as Yudkowsky once said, realising that nothing exists, or that everything is a dream, or that reality is a simulation, none of that really solves any problem. Sure, reality is a simulation; what /then/? What new predictions does this allow me to make? What kind of simulation is reality? What are its rules, how does it work? Those are all things that can be explored and exploited, and in the end, they all make for a good story.

And of course, if a character focuses too much on the fact that they're not in a "natural" world, they might lose focus on the world they can /actually/ affect, and achieve nothing.

So what I'd say is: if all your characters end up realising they're fictional, /what then/? What happens? How do they react? What do they do? That can be /awesome/ fiction to read! I'd love to see where you take a story where all characters know they're in a DL world and how they use that knowledge.
