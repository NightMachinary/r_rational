  */Bob and George/* was a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_comic][sprite-based]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webcomic][webcomic]] which parodied the fictional universe of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man_(series)][Mega Man]]. It is written by David Anez, a physics instructor who lives in the American [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States][Midwest]]. The comic first appeared on April 1, 2000 and ran until July 28, 2007. It was updated daily, with there being only 29 days without a comic in its seven years of production and with 2568 comics being made altogether.

  Most /Bob and George/ strips are still images. The initial strips were mostly done in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF][GIF]] format (occasionally using [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG][JPEG]] for more graphic-intensive comics) before converting to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics][PNG]] in May 2004. In addition, occasional comics are animated using either animated GIFs or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macromedia_Flash][Macromedia Flash]]. Some of the Flash comics have the characters speaking, voiced by Anez and others (often forum members). Animated comics are generally used for the annual week-long anniversary parties (usually culminating in a brief animated comic that recaps the events of the past year in a matter of seconds), for especially climactic scenes, and for a series of videos depicting an in-comic event known as "the Cataclysm".

  The comic's plot is mostly made up of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story_arc][story arcs]] of varying lengths. Amongst past story arcs there have been retellings of various Mega Man games (which often play out quite differently from the originals), as well as battles against powerful foes. In addition, many of the story arcs involve either [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel][time travel]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_universe_(fiction)][dimensional]] travel, and villains who want to kill all the characters.
