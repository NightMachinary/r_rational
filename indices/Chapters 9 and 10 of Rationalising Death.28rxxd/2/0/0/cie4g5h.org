It isn't exactly rationalist fiction, but [[http://www.undefined.net/1/0/][1/0]] sounds similar to what you're looking for. The author features directly in the story though, so it's pretty different from what you would get if there is no line of information to outside the Matrix.

If you realise you could be in a fictional world, not just a simulated one, but a work of fiction, you can in principle become genre savvy. Try to figure out what the author wants or how they think and how you can use that to your advantage. Misa can reasonably establish that, being one of only two known humans with access to supernatural artefacts, she is a main character.

That means her atypical properties are probably intentional, such as her humanity, Japanese nationality, intelligence, her habit of carefully checking her conclusions, her rationalist knowledge, and her discovery that the world might be fictional. Combine these, and you find that if it's a fictional world, it's one written by humans, with near-baseline intelligence, with a major theme of "what you do if..." - both about the death note and the discovery of the fictional nature of herself.

Given this, she would have to answer what the moral value of herself and other fictional characters is. Her instincts are designed to mirror those of a real human, so empathy may be a case of undue anthropomorphisation. And sure, she might think she feels, but that's exactly what fictional characters who are nothing more than a basic simulation in the mind of baseline human authors and readers thinks it thinks: "Maybe this is what being read feels like?"

I don't know how this can be discovered by people inside the matrix, but the moral consequences are massive. If the author is human, then the people of her world are not even sentient, and her goals should focus exclusively on affecting the real world. It might be that the best she can do is to shut up and be a main character, but that seems unlikely. For one thing, the real world is probably notably lacking of /her/, so if she's even slightly selfish, she would support the notion of being made real (by making people remember her and create a sapient being in her likeness after the singularity). Also, the readers are morally important, so she should be invested in making a good story.

If it is a simulation or fiction of a different sort, it is possible that her world does have moral value. That she and perhaps even the other people can't be neglected. In that case, she should care about the state of the world she lives in, and try to steer it to a good result. That may be as simple as proving to her author that her world is morally significant and begging them to improve it, but the author might not be so kind. Escaping the matrix is nice, but more complex.

To summarise, depending on her ideas, some good ideas for what she could do are:

1. Continue to test and think about world status.

2. Check moral status of herself (or protagonists in general) and the rest of the world given likely scenarios.

3. Try to break out of the box, or create something similar to her outside the box.

4. Fourth wall breaking stuff. Tell the author to talk to her if she's being uninteresting, make jokes at the fourth wall, try to make a good story, etc.

5. Make sure her world ends up well. Not likely to be important, but who knows.
