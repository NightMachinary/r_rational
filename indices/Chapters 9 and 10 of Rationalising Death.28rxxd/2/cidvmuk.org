I posted this in my review but will do so again here. Minor spoilers for those who have not read past chapter 10 I guess.

I have trouble keeping characters in my head, they all end up like Misa in chapter 10 as aware of being a character within the mind of someone else and then become puppets. I can't stop them from having the thought and just stop acting out the stories in my mind. I put to much of myself into the characters for I can not abide by someone not thinking every once in a while their existence and what they can do about their life.

This makes it really hard to write stories for any length of time for me. Perhaps I am just being silly, and this is just me drifting away from the topic I want to write. Anyway, I just want to hear if anyone else has that same sort of trouble as myself when it comes to writing.
