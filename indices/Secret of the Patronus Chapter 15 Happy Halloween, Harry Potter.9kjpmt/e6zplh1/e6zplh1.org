This is a very interesting idea but I find the way that this version of Harry Potter is perfectly okay with depersonifying and contributing to the genocide of a sentient species out of disgust over their physical appearance to be both extremely disturbing and radically out of character for the HPMOR version of Harry.

Am I missing something that explains this radical change in personality? I would like to know more about how this fanfic alters the character of Harry before I get into it.
