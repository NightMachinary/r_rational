Are you talking about the Acromantula? He never actually intends to kill them. He's worried about man-eating spiders roaming near the school, and he's angry because one of them threatened the students. He's depersonifying them a bit because his dark side is in control, but he has no intention of committing murder. He just intends to threaten information out of one of them, so he can figure out how much danger the students are in.

Also, while the ending of the chapter is a little ambiguous, the Acromantula aren't exterminated in the end. Just relocated.
