Wait, the Augur foresees peasant revolts if Procer makes peace with Callow, and the Tyrant just happens to have a guy who specializes in creating present revolts. So if a truce happened, the Tyrant is going to nudge the Hierarch into the provinces that Black razed and encourage him to do what he does, and since the Tyrant's plans is one step removed and the Hierarch doesn't have a specific plan at all, the Augur can't see them at all so all she's left with is Cordelia's plan for a truce -> present revolt with the middle steps missing.
