Wow... so the Tyrant, or anyone else with the resources to ruin Cordelia's day can essentially communicate conditional threats through the Augur. Even without knowing her plans, simply by pre-commiting to punish actions they don't want (or presumably reward those they do) they can influence Cordelia's plans.
