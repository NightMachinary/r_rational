Wasn't there an open plot thread about how the Augur was the secret to controlling Cordelia? If you could somehow influence the Augur's prophesies, you can control what Cordelia will do because she trusts her cousin implicitly. I think the Wandering Bard was playing some high level moves with developing certain stories at certain times to influence what the Augur can see.

Does any of this sound familiar, or am I making things up? I honestly can't remember.
