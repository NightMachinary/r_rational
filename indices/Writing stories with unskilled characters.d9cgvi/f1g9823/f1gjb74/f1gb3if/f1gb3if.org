From the writers perspective, one good option is to take the excuses away and the temptation with it. To take the protagonist 10000 years in the future, or another planet, or even another plane of existence. Someplace where basic shit like how the fauna behaves, the chemistry of plants, how to make a shelter and things like that can't be explained as previous knowledge. The protagonist will have to learn things the hard way and the audience gets to learn it with him.

He may need a reasonable starting safety net, like a brief contact with someone from there, otherwise the amount of luck he will need to survive the first few days are gonna get unrealistic. Employing common sense should be fine, as long as it's doesn't leave the audience scratching their heads. Also, and this is paramount, the protagonist should have at least as many fails as he has successes if not more. Successes make for great "lighting the beacon of hope" epic scenes while fails can ramp up the stakes, creating tension, dread or new challenges. One keeps the reader around, while the other keeps the story fresh.

As to how not to write shitty characters, that's another very long conversation I'm not going to get into here. Suffice to say, there is plenty of literature on the subject.

As for examples or recommendations, unfortunately I can't say I have any good ones.
