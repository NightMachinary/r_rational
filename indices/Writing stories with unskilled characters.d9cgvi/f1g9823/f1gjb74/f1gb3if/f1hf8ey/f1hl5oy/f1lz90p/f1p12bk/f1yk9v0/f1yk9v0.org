I really do try to pretend that the characters who

- fancy themselves super-experts in my field, and

- know a superior way of doing things without ever considering an expert, then

- succeed using a stupid, moronic, or insane tactic because

- the author read something popsci 10 years ago and thinks they know how things work in every related industry as a result

are still rational. I also notice I don't read many R!sci-fi stories except those which are actually blatantly pure fantasy with "tech" as a magic substitute.

A more humbly written character might be more appealing in this case.
