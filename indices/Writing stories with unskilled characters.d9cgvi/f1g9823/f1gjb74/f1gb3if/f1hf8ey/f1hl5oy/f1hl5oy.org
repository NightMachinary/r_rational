An interesting point is The Silent Tower and The Silicon Mage. You can make the research part of the story.

In the first book, a character from earth ends up in a medieval world and is hopelessly lost. She quickly picks up some skills and is competent, but clearly out of her element and cannot do basic things like start a fire.

In the second book, she is ready for a return trip. She did read a few books and took a survival class. She also picked up some clothes that fit that other world better, added some necessities, as well as tools, a gun, and some synthetic gems to barter for coin of the realm. She kept it in a bug-out bag in her trunk.

It worked very well to reverse the damsel in distress believably.
