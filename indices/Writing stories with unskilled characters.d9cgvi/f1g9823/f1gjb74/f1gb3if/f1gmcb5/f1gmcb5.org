I have some space australia story I dusted off and changed to something more original. My limitations were everyone is a blue collar worker and their chain of command is gone. Everyone else got routed and the only ship to arrive was labourers. My biggest ass-pull so far was a foreman half remembering that they used to make gunpowder from piss. They know what it's made of but have no idea what the hell potassium nitrate is.

I'm trying to make a story of people trying to reverse engineer technology when they have no idea how things are made. And then applying their own knowledge and frame of reference to it. (The local craftsmen spent a month trying to make guns and the best they could do is shotguns after one month.) Then I tried to work on things they can accomplish with what they know already. E.g. We got concrete buildings, working plumbing, and aqueducts; but no one has any medical skills beyond treating wounds. At least we have three fully functioning and well stocked bars. We may have no agriculture besides the few guys who had gardens back home, but hey we know how to use steel!
