Minor nitpick of your excellent post: if someone gets in close when you're using a spear, you're much better off using it like a quarterstaff than choking up on it. Quarterstaffs are hard as hell to fight against because a moderately skilled user can attack from virtually any direction at once by alternating between the two ends, plus can strike at range with a thrust that will be nearly as effective as a spear. It can also deflect swords if you got them on the flat, and if the staff is solid enough (eg ironwood) you can even block the sword's edge with only minimal damage.
