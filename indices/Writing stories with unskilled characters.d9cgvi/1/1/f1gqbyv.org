I should add in with the spear example our protagonist should have a basic grasp of stuff, usually unrelated but useful. Such as "They say the spear is the king of weapons yet swords are so cool, I wonder why." Or the more mundane logic of "I should grab a spear because I'd rather not get people close to me." Basically people can come to conclusions with basic logic without an informed choice or trial and error.

Or to the insulation example from earlier, MC-kun knows what insulation is and that it is important but has no idea exactly how it's done. They make their best guess of leaves and eventually replace it after they learn something completely different and realise they can apply that.

And for a third example, explaining something through an entirely different discipline. This is rare and also my favourite trope. In your group is a pharmacist and a biologist, who is currently performing surgery? A butcher, she might be more familiar with taking animals apart yet in a pinch she knows how to remove that arrow and stitch you up without knicking an artery or tearing muscles. The only problem is your anesthetic and disinfectant are a bottle of vodka because that's the only thing she knows that would work. (She almost used urine cause she wanted a shot as well.)
