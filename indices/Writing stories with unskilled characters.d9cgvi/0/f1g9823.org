I will throw in that a main character who is less knowledgeable or competent than the average reader can heavily turn a reader off, at least from my limited experience, with the frustration of characters repeatedly being utter idiots. One of the appeals of rational fiction is avoiding plot forced stupidity, but replacing that with a character who makes obviously stupid choices because they lack knowledge that the majority of the readers possess can drive people away. I get what you're saying, but this can end up with characters frustratingly missing things.
