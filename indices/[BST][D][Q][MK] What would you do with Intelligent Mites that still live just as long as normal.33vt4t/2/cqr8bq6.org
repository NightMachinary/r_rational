?

If the former, fish already die in numbers beyond my ability to grok. If it were just a normal fact of the world, I wouldn't behave differently beyond culturally accepted low-cost ways to reduce cruelty to mites. (note: predictive, not prescriptive).

If the latter, they're an existential risk because there's no reason for their values to be in line with ours. While individuals can't learn much, there are trillions of them, each as intelligent as one of us (and the most intelligent more intelligent than the smartest human who ever lived, by the laws of statistics).

If we cooperate by giving them tools which they can use to build a society, like some here suggested, we may be letting the a tiny little unfriendly intelligence out of a tiny little box. And before you know it, they release a bioweapon, kill all humans and take over the world. So we should keep them from developing in an as humane way as possible^{1} until we know the future is ours (e.g. after fAI has been built).

And in the mean time we should also investigate how they manage to cram so much intelligence into such a tiny head with so small power requirements, because that doesn't fit within the known limits of biology.

[1] I don't know what this would be, though it depends on the mites.
