The answer to your question is they are within human intelligence / mind capabilities.

However as a species the mites don't have a lot of necessities to demand invention. Their extremely durable, can live their entire lives in a human eyebrow. There is not a lot for them to do with their intellects and even their geniuses have to contend with having three months of activity to learn anything.

Mites don't generally manage to learn to read anything as complex as english.

Those that do are pretty incredible And it can still take A week.

The mechanics that make the mites possible make much more dangerous and horrific things then the mites.

Their on the safer side of things that use the forces involved.
