Ah okay yes I do see the thing that is going on here, the main piece of information missing is that Genetics are not a factor on why Mites are intelligent.

Their genes are actually the same as that of their mites.

Another process is providing the energy and processing power for their brains.

That said the cultural thing is definitely a good point, mites or those that work with them are going to be very very good at training mites in a short span of time.

Although I suspect there is an upper limit on how much can be transferred to any one individual given the limit in time frame.

If humans only lived fifteen years I'm pretty sure we would be a lot more dependent on the exceptional individuals who are able to do something economically useful by age ten.

If the distance in time and space is too great between those individuals then we would never have them able to directly interact.

So in effect the Mites are suffering from a variation of the drake equation.

Their exceptional individuals have an extremely narrow window that they can overlap with one another to progress their civilization before they have to fall back on whatever their 'average' citizen can support.
