In the game of evolution, there is no such thing as sufficiency. If there is a world of plenty, the population will blindly grow to its carrying capacity, and then the tautologically unfit will start dying again. If that isn't true in the first thousand generations, it sure is true in the thousand after that. For humans, who wins and who dies is determined by strategy and politics. Forging alliances with different tribes, create ambushes, etc. For mites who have three weeks to learn it would be harder to outweigh strength, but if one in a trillion families can manage to develop meaningful strategy, it will appear and spread in years.

Mites which manage to pass along more information to their children in those three weeks will last better, so education efficiency will be selected for. Breeding has a chance of being discovered, like humans did, and with channels of passing along knowledge this makes eugenics or perhaps the breeding of other tiny organisms possible. Eugenics with a generational turnover of weeks builds up meaningful results quickly, creating more genetic diversity in a century than humans have since leaving Africa, and there is always pressure to pass along more information more quickly with less loss.

In my estimation, this sounds ripe for civilisation to flourish, even if individuals die in three weeks.
