Hmm, caloric restriction has never been properly tested in humans so I'm not sure whether it would make people depressed. In mice one of the articles from google scholar is telling me that caloric restriction can act like an anti-depressant. I found another paper saying that it does cause depression in rats but I'm not sure about the methodology of that one (it seemed more like food restriction than caloric restriction). I guess there's no way to know for mites without testing it.
