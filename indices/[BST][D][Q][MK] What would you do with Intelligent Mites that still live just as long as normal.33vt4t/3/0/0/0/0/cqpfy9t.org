Well, they seem to take orders pretty well. Ration their diets for them. Come up with a reasonable sounding explanation for why they can't eat as they want. To avoid unrest, start by rationing the younger generation but not the older one. The older ones are the ones with power but they won't complain that much if they're being fed the same as before. After a few generations they'll forget what the old standards of eating were.
