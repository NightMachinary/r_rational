Maybe not oblivious but the scope of what the larger things mean is massively outside their realm of experience.

I suppose though given the sheer numbers they would have their "pioneers" that really appreciate the larger scale of their works while the rest are more comfortable with drudgery.

The easy cryo is a great point. And might be the main way to get around the "generations in a year" problem.

Micro surgery probably requires pretty close supervision but I can definitely see that.

Thanks for the thoughts.
