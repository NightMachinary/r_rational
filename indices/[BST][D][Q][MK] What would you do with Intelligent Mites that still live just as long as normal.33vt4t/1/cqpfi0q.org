What /I/ would do is make them as enriched as possible and then cryopreserve them. i think we can cryo and revive insects, currently, should be easy. But, if you're looking for ways to /exploit/ them...

They might be useful for nano-tech research, and/or to physically implement the things we would ordinarily want nano-tech for.

Making things /really/ clean

Weaving spider silk

Micro-surgeons. (If we give them protective suits they could potentially live inside a human body. With the help of tools to augment sensory and motor ability they can potentially do surgery at the level of removing individual cells level.)

Also, there's really no need for them to be oblivious - it shouldn't be hard to give them sensory input on the macro-sized world. Just hook up a video camera to a very, very small screen (or whatever a good sensory modality is for dust mites). They can help build the tiny parts. The possibilities really open up if they can tell what's going on.
