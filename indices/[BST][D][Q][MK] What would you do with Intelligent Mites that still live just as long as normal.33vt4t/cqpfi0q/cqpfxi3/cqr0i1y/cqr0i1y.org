Oh I was assuming their services being used/rented out by other races. I can imagine devices that have spaces built for mites into them and have little electrodes or any kind of input/output that would allow for mite-other communication.

For example, imagine a glove with a million piezo's woven into it. When attatched to a decent computer, this glove could individually activate mites at the million sites and those mites could rebuild a surface that glove was touching on a microscopic scale. Coordinated by the computer this would allow for them to do anything really. They are just receiving a simple command, "touch the surface in front of you remove/deposit/eat x micrograms of the material" and the computer is controlling what that will be on a macroscopic scale by sending different messages to the different mites on the glove.
