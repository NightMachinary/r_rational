A mad scientist has designed and spread an airborne virus that gradually overwrites an infected person's DNA. After infection, a person's physical appearance will slowly change to look more and more like an androgynous average human. Within a few years, everyone over 20 will look like the same person. Everyone under 20 will look like younger versions of the same person.

Effectively, people will no longer be able to recognize each other based on physical appearance: you could wear some distinct clothes/masks/etc and claim that it is you, but anyone else could wear the same clothes/mask/etc and pretend to be you. You could use passwords to identify yourself using cryptographic hijinks, but anyone who steals your passwords can pretend to be you.

What issues would humanity face as a result, and how could we overcome them?
