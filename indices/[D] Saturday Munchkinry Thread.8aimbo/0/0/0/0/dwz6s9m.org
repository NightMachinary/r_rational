Why do you lock your car doors? Do you lock your car doors because they will surely keep someone willing to dedicate time and effort breaking into your car out, or do you lock your car door so that somone looking for a quick grab n' dash from stealing your CD's?

The tattoo's solve probably 70% of Identity issues if they are managed well. 25% would then rest on the Tattoos simply being so similiar that it takes a bit of time to fully regster the person. Think about talking to identcal twins or dopplegangers. If you know the person well enough you could figure it out quickly, otherwise it may take some time. The remaining 5% comes down to people who would get permanent tattoos to impersonate somone else permanently. Assuming that the andogynous form has both the same fingerprints for everyone and also the same eye markings and DNA inprint, getting the tattoo makes you almost a perfect double. The issue comes up mainly for famous people at that point. Every government would likely have a tattoo body double for every high ranking officer in every foreiegn government as a saftetynet/espionage set up. I imagine anyone who is famous would probably get some micro surgery done on their eyes and keep it extremremely safegaurded so that no one knows what it looks like to duplicate. Basically the Tattoo works as a deterant, extrasecurity measures would be required for true security to be held.
