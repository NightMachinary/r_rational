  The standard size for things would make some choices disappear. My mom is 4'10" or 147 centimeters but I am assuming that this androgynous form cause her to grow taller. My Father-in-law is about 500 pounds, so the question I have to ask is does that change? Is he still fat, or did he become skinnier?

Everyone's physical appearance becomes the same. So they all get the same height and fatness. Once you hit peak fatness (where any more would make a noticeable change to your physical appearance), any excess food eaten just passes through your body without being converted into fat. The only exception is if you do something like starving yourself: then you look like a starving version of the person everyone has become, since the virus can't create matter out of nothing.

  You would see the biggest effect here in undeveloped areas where they are currently surviving on 700 calories a day and surviving because of their form, but now they need 1,200 calories.

Uh oh. Yeah that will definitely happen. They have a few years to notice their growing calorie requirements and make plans to get more food, but yes I see plenty of starving going to happen.

  , but anyone who held their beliefs and had them backed up by groups they are a part of could become radicalized pretty fast.

Huh. What could these radicals even do though? Now that everyone looks the same, how would they know who to target?

  All media would change. Every comic book hero, movie star, etc. now looks the same. The way we share these stories would adapt as people learn to identify themselves in new ways.

I just realized I created an anime world: everyone has the same face and they have to be distinguished by having distinct hair styles and dying their hair with visually striking colors, in other words [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimeHair][anime hair]]. That amuses me greatly XD.
