I have prosopagnosia (a mild form), and in short, I can't recognise people based on the way their face looks. I've had it all my life and people like me manage to function seamlessly in society (to the point where people just go through life thinking they're "bad with faces" rather than realising they have a qualitative difference in ability).

So for me, this homogenisation would pretty much put everyone on the level I'm at, and I think commenters are /probably/ overestimating this.

For starters: I can recognise people fine. I can recognise people across a football field by the way they dress, style their hair, and most importantly their gait. I think there is zero chance of someone impersonating, say, my husband well enough to fool me. A photograph, sure. But not a conversation. And they could certainly shave my husband's head and put him in an outfit he wouldn't normally wear and it'd take me a good 20-30 seconds to believe it was him, and every time I caught a glimpse of him in the corner of my eye for a day or so I'd have to consciously remember it's him and that I shouldn't cry out in surprise at this strange man with me.

People are talking about con artists getting tattoos to impersonate people and all that, but come on - do con artists learn how to perfectly imitate Melania Trump's voice and mannerisms so they can hire a model in a wig and makeup to waltz into her penthouse and steal shit? Like, if you've seen RuPaul's Drag Race, you can use makeup to make you look like pretty much anyone. (Again I have prosopagnosia but I get the impression the likenesses are very good). Sure, people impersonate celebrities all the time and get good restaurant tables or something - but nothing on the order of what you're implying might be possible here.

The issues would be on the order of stuff like sports, modelling, acting. If the DNA was all the same we'd have easy organ transplantation, which'd be nice.
