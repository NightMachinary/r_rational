Well yes, impersonating someone in front of people they know well isn't likely to work. Even if they are completely blind and deaf, if they know someone very well they are going to notice something is off. After all, every interaction is really a sort of password (a private memory shared by only the people interacting), and every inside joke or trivia is basically a cryptographic hijink that let's you know who you're interacting with while not giving away the joke (passwords) to other people watching.

I was thinking more along the lines of impersonating someone in front of people that /don't/ know them well. For example, impersonating someone while robbing a bank. That way the police starts chasing the person you impersonated instead of you. Or impersonating someone in front of their employees/clients/investors/etc. Lots of people have to interact with plenty of other people that they don't know very well, so impersonating them in such situations is quite likely to succeed.

  People are talking about con artists getting tattoos to impersonate people and all that, but come on - do con artists learn how to perfectly imitate Melania Trump's voice and mannerisms so they can hire a model in a wig and makeup to waltz into her penthouse and steal shit?

You probably won't be able to get into the white house, but you could do things like impersonate the president and pretend there's a conspiracy afoot where the "you" at the white house is a fake and you're the real one, and then you could rally people to do things in the name of the president.

  Like, if you've seen RuPaul's Drag Race, you can use makeup to make you look like pretty much anyone.

I'm aware of this, but the issue is one of ease. To give an analogy, suppose that one day all pick-able locks magically fail to lock. Well, pretty much anyone can learn to pick a lock, so that might not sound like a big deal, but you can bet there will be a large surge of crimes until the locks are replaced with working ones. (If there isn't, then why do we even have locks?) Hence the need for permanent tattoos and tattoo registries in the original scenario.

  If the DNA was all the same we'd have easy organ transplantation, which'd be nice.

Unfortunately it is only the outer appearance that changes. Organs are inside and so will have rejection issues as normal.
