Three problems:

1. Mutations are still random, and since there is no known plant that stores oxygen this ability would have to arise by chance rather than proximity integration. So getting any nonexistent feature to arise could take an indefinite amount of time.

2. The thing where genetics between two organisms integrate is both random (no guarantee that other plants would get that characteristic) and takes many generations so without a mokuton user nearby this might not spread on its own. Although they could plant seeds and speed grow them in mass quantities I guess.

3. Where's this oxygen being stored? If it's stored in pockets/sacks it could be released by cutting the trees open. If it's stored in the cells, is this thing even a plant any more? It's likely these plants would also be very flammable maybe even explosive.
