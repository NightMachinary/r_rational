Plan to take over the world:

1. Create a plant that does not release oxygen when it photosynthesizes (it just stores it inside itself for respiration or something).

2. Grow it near other plants, causing their genetics to mingle and so they also stop producing oxygen.

3. World oxygen levels crash, everyone suffocates to death except you and your clan, who have started living in an airtight greenhouse with oxygen producing plants that have not been infected by your mutant plant.

4. Once everyone else is dead, create a second mutant plant that reverses the effects of the first and spread it throughout the world to bring the oxygen levels back to normal, and take over all the ghost towns left behind by the other ninja clans that suffocated to death.
