Problem: if the mutations can be non-beneficial, many children die of genetic diseases.

anyhow you could have humans with echolocation. Or stronger humans. Or humans with the ability to stick to walls like geckos or spiders. Or humans flying. breathing underwater and on land, like some crabs. hibernate . regrow limbs and organs. virgin birth (like some lizards and sharks)

Plants: faster growing, easier to harvest plants. Or poisoned apples,
