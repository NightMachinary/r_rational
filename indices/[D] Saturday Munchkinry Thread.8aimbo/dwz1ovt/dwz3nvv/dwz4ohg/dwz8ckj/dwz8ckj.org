The fact that doing that is an incredibly bad idea? Whatever con you are running, you would now have a permanent record of having done it on your face. Excellent way to wind up behind bars, that.

This does assume that there is a register of taken tatoos, to prevent accidental duplication, so that having someone elses replicated is proof of ill intent.. but that is a given.

That then leaves you with the issue of making pleasing tatoos that are unique in vast numbers, but this is something computer aided design and lookup would help with a great deal. And of course some people will just want to not be mistaken for anyone else, and go with an entirely algorithmicly generated wreath of flowers (99 billion possible color combos, almost all of them look nice, and easily identifiable) while others drop major-art-purchase money on having someone try to put their soul into ink.
