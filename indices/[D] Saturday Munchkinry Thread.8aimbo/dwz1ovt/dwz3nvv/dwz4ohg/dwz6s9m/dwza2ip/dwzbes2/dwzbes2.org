For the generation in which it occurs, there would be huge changes for 5-10 years as we get used to the new identifying features. Younger generations would largely bypass this and within three generations, the way we used to identify ourselves would be as novel and alien as ancestor worship. (Maybe that is extreme, but you surely understand).

The standard size for things would make some choices disappear. My mom is 4'10" or 147 centimeters but I am assuming that this androgynous form cause her to grow taller. My Father-in-law is about 500 pounds, so the question I have to ask is does that change? Is he still fat, or did he become skinnier? If we all normalize in height and stature, the daily needed calories would increase for some and decrease for others. You would see the biggest effect here in undeveloped areas where they are currently surviving on 700 calories a day and surviving because of their form, but now they need 1,200 calories.

Until tattoos become cultural identifiers, and possibly even afterwards because I imagine standard tattoos would take time people would become more empathetic toward one another. I believe studies have proven that we more prone to care about people who resemble ourselves and our loved ones, and now that everyone looks like us, we would keep that biological facet of our mentality and utilize it for humanity as a whole. Initially, racist/trans-phobic people would be pretty shaken up. I imagine something like 70% of those people would let the issues go, but anyone who held their beliefs and had them backed up by groups they are a part of could become radicalized pretty fast. I'm not just talking about southern american racism here though, but cultural ethnic animosity where you once could say, hey that guy is Ethiopian because... but now that feature is gone so you just don't know.

All media would change. Every comic book hero, movie star, etc. now looks the same. The way we share these stories would adapt as people learn to identify themselves in new ways. Anything pre-virus would probably rise in value but a few years down the road it may rise in infamy as we look back and wonder why we made fun of certain individuals based on appearance alone.
