You're in the mundane world we all inhabit. You have the following, somewhat weak, superpower: you may choose a small volume (at most as big as a large human, approximately) and mirror it about any axis. The mirroring is instantaneous, but takes more energy (from your internal chemical energy store) if you have to overcome a potential energy barrier (e.g. if a piece of stone is partly inside the region and partly not, cutting it requires energy to break the forces holding the stone together). What can be done with this (other than winning Randi Prizes and the like)? After you mirror someone, presumably they're dead unless you unmirror them / mirror some food for them to eat that will have the achiral biological compounds correct (is this true?). Is threatening people this way the best that can be done?
