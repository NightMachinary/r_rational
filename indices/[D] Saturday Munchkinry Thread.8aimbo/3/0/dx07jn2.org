After a quick google search, I found a [[http://www.nsta.org/publications/news/story.aspx?id=49792][short story/science lesson]] that answers your question.

In short, yes, mirrored people will starve to death. They can still drink water and breath air though, so it will take a pretty long time to kill them that way. Long enough for them to realize what you did to them and try to punch you until you undo it. Punching works even when mirrored, unfortunately for you.

If you wanted to use your power to kill someone, it would be far easier to just spam mirror tiny volumes of space inside their bodies. The energy cost for cutting them open like this should be fairly small if you keep the volumes small, but the effects should be quite deadly. [[#s][Examples:]]

The most obvious use of this power is to be a chemist. There are still plenty of molecules out there that we don't know how to make or are ridiculously hard to make. With your mirroring power, you half the search space since any method you find to make a chiral molecule lets you make its mirror molecule. (Though it wouldn't work for the achiral molecules.) With every new molecule comes new potential applications that can help benefit humanity. (Though most will be useless.)

But there is another use: Faster-than-light Teleportation. If you mirror a volume of space with an item on one side, it instantly teleports to the other. Effectively, instantaneous mirroring is faster than light travel. I'm not familiar enough with physics to immediately see the ways you could abuse this given that your range is limited to the volume of a large human, but I bet there's plenty.
