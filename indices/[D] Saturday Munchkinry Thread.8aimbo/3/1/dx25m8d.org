evil stuff:

- mirror people and blackmail them for food. (without revealing your power) maybe make your own village

- going through walls? and robbing places. building tunnels would be impractible?

non-evil stuff:

- science expirement: brain research: will people now only be able to read mirrored text?

- industry: mirror a chiral molekule. there are probably some molekules that mirrored versions are more expansive to make. So just sell them in bulk.
