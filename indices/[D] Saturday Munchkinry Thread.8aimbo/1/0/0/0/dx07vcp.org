Actually now I'm confused. Could you explain exactly how the upgrade energy is flowing? What does the Mythical cuckoo bird do exactly? Is it breeding its own new species? When you say a modified creature gives a 10-20% upgrade to a consumer, what exactly does that mean? I just need to eat 10 modified creatures to get an upgrade? Will predators that eat way more than they need evolve way faster? If creatures can only pass on energy to their predators, how do the primary level creatures even get their energy? Also, what happens if you have two species that eat each other? That can happen in nature, especially since many animals have really weak and nutritious babies.
