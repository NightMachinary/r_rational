I definitely see what you are saying, but I don't think the low levels on the food chain would improve too fast simply because the changes must go up the food chain. So when the rabbit dies, the modified creature that follows must be a second level consumer, not a first. I forgot to outline that when the top predator in an area receives an upgrade, or when there are not enough Jules for a top predator to receive an upgrade, the modifications expand outwards and start over.

Humans are probably level 4 or 5 consumers, but with the cultivation techniques, they may be able to get around some of the other requirements.
