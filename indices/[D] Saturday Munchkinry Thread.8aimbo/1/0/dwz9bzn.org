To answer that, we need to first identify the upgrade costs. Every level up the food chain doubles the cost, but what level are humans? We eat just about everything, so we can be placed pretty much anywhere on the food chain except the bottom. If we all become vegetarians, will it be easier to upgrade ourselves?

If not, humanity is in serious trouble. The fact that other species will be evolving far faster puts us in an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alienators:_Evolution_Continues][Evolution]] scenario, but without the plot armors to ensure our survival. The primary consumers will get upgrade after upgrade, leaving everyone else in the dust. Depending on how far up the food chain we are, by the time humans evolve to something better, rabbits will have gone all the way to hulking superpowered behemoths with 1km instant-death aura. They'll become strong enough to fight off all their predators and monopolize their food supplies, so every thing above them in the food chain dies off from starvation.

If we had technology, we could still do something like mass cloning modified creatures and mass eating them to rapidly upgrade humanity. But seeing as this is a pre-industrial era, the only hope is to wipe out all life from the mystical cuckoo. Set fire to forests/grasslands/etc. where the cuckoo effect has been observed, as well as any nearby ones. Then send out hunters to wipe out every last living thing in the area. Our only hope is to press our current advantage and wipe out all other species before they can out-evolve us.
