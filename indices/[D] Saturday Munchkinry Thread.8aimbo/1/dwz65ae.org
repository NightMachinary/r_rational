Background: High Fantasy Setting, likely a Wuxia Setting. The Universe has become wholly unbalanced. Humanity has systematically managed to subjugate almost every type of creature, and yet humanity has not progressed. Pre-industrial, mystical martial arts society is ruling and has ruled for some number of millennia. The stagnate stability humanity has created has knocked the Universe's chaotic aspects into disarray, and therefore a new creature is birthed from the imbalance.

The Creature/Power: A Cuckoo bird is notorious for its Brood Parasitism, that is, preying on other creatures by tricking them into raising their young. The Cuckoo Bird will lay an egg in the nest of another bird, and this other bird will unwittingly raise the creature as their own. Often the Cuckoo youngling will even kill the biological young of the bird that is raising them. The Mystical Cuckoo Bird is the Universe's attempt to give an upgrade to nature so that humanity can be overthrown, and the stagnate balance can be undone. The Mystical Cuckoo after it dies breaks down its soul and uses it to modify creatures around it ultimately seeking to evolve them and remove humanities stalemate.

Rules:

- The Modified creature only affects the species as a whole if it matures to adulthood and breeds, and also if it's children do the same.

- The Modified creature gives a 10-20% upgrade to a predator that consumes it.

- The Modified creature's spiritual prodigy must be in an embryo state when the soul is upgraded

- The modified creature's spiritual prodigy must be within a 50-mile radius to receive the upgrade. The closer the receiving creature is to the modified creature the better upgrade is received.

- The receiving creature must be a higher trophic level than the modified creature

- When a Modified Creature dies, it produces 16 joules of modification energy.

- Primary consumers use 1 joule to upgrade. Secondary consumers require 2, Tertiary consumers require 4, Quaternary consumers require 8, quintenary consumers require 16, and so on and so forth. There is a possibility that some creatures may have extra joule needed because of innate aspects like human level intelligence, cultivation techniques, legendary/mythical status, etc.

- The Biological children of the modified creature do not spread the modification spiritually, only physically.

Example of a modified creature: Rabbit->Horned Rabbit. Voltage Wolf(Ability to build up immense static electricity in fur)->Magarmored(Iron Fur controlled with magnetism for offensive and defensive purposes.) Wolves

A small clan of humans had the brief opportunity to study the cuckoo when it was first born and have created a cultivation technique modeled after the cuckoo's ability. How do they rise to power and safeguard/advance humanity in the face of this calamity? How have they adapted the Cuckoo's ability to best suit humanity? Assuming the Human's don't realize the amount the Cuckoo's Soul Prodigy have spread for 15 years, how screwed is humanity?
