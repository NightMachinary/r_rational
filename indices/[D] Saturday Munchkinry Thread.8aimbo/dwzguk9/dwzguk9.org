Background: We're in the Naruto universe, but there are two laws/principles for how chakra can affect genetics.

1. Areas in which high levels of ambient and/or foreign chakra are present in an organism's environment during their gestation have been shown to dramatically increase the rate of mutation. Example: the forest of death.

2. There has also been an observed connection between the intermingling of two organisms' chakra over many generations of cohabitation leading to a sharing of genetics. For organisms of the Kingdom Animalia to share genetics through chakra, they must at least be of the same biological phylum (does not apply to the Plantae kingdom). An example of this is the Inuzuka clan whose people have acquired more carnivorous qualities and their canine counterparts that display higher than average intelligence and an overall increase in size.

Now we've got two groups that can take advantage of these two laws with their ability to use chakra to manipulate the speed of gestation/maturation and behavior/movement of a specific branch of organisms.

- Mokuton users whose branch of organisms is the entire Plantae kingdom.
- The Aburame clan whose branch of organisms is the entire Arthropoda phylum (I'm aware this isn't canon).

Basically, either of these groups of people can place two different sets of organisms (a male and female of each organism) within their domain of control in close proximity to each other, force reproduction, increase the speed of gestation/maturation, and repeat. The result is a rapid production of multiple generations with each having a high rate of mutation and a chance of genetics being integrated from one organism to another. By discarding offspring with undesirable traits this should allow for rapid and directed speciation.

So the question here is what sort of interesting mutants would be worth creating by abusing these laws/principles and what type of worldwide consequences might result from them. Assume oxygen levels, arthropods, and plants are all consistent with our world.
