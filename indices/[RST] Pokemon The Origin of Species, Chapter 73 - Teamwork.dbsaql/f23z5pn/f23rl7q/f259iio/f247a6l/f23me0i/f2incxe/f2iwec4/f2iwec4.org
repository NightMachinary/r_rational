I'm sure it's super possible, and many people have brought it up before.... I just don't have the time/energy to do it right now : / Any free time spent working on that is time I'm not spending writing, or doing podcast stuff (which is already woefully behind), or catching up on my reading list. If most readers were on my site rather than fanfic I might think it's worth the investment, but so far that hasn't been the case.
