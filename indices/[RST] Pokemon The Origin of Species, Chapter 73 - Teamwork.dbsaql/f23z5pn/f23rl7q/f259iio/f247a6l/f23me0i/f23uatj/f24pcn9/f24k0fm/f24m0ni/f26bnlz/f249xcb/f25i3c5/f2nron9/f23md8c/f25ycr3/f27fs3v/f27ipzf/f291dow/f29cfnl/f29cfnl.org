pokeball training would probably cover how the pokemon should act if their trainer dies, shouldn't it? Would be a bit of an oversight if surviving pokemon could attack people getting close to the body of it's trainer. Pokemon aren't even supposed to be trained to attack humans even if their trainer orders it(although as seen in this chapter it's not a regulation that's very followed), so it would be strange if a trained pokemon attacked another human without an order from their unconscious/dead trainer.

Don't know if pressure could deprogram training, but there's probably not enough time over the course of a single event to do it, even if it's trainer was dead.
