  I think Blue has not really considered the emotional impact of what he's done. He hasn't thought "Wow, that was an incredibly difficult call for Red to make, he must feel terrible even though his choice was what kept him alive in the end."

Not only that but blue needs to realize that what he wants his grandfather to do is basically what red did, not help someone if it means their death.
