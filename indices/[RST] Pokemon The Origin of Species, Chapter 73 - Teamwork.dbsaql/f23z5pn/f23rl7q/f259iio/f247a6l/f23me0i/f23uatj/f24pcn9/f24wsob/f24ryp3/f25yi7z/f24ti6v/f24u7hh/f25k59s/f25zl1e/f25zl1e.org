The difference being that Professor Oak actually succeeded in rescuing his family members, and events proved that Red would have failed and died if he had entered the building. Both of them apparently made the right call in their particular circumstances. And yet Blue disagrees with both of them. He would have had his grandfather stay out, potentially losing Daisy and/or a number of civilians, yet he would conversely have sent Red into the building to die.

What makes Blue's attitude even worse is that he claimed to Red that it was a matter of principle. "That's what it means to be someone's /friend/," Blue says, looking back at Red now. "That's what you don't get, Red. You're talking about risk and the smart thing to do like it's a game, like your decisions don't say things about who you are, how people see you. Forget strangers you're on a mission with, how could anyone trust you to have their back on a journey, if they know that's how you see things?" And yet, after making such a bold "friends stick together even if it's risky" stand, he immediately about-faces when it's his own grampa at stake. Well, I say that makes him a huge hypocrite.
