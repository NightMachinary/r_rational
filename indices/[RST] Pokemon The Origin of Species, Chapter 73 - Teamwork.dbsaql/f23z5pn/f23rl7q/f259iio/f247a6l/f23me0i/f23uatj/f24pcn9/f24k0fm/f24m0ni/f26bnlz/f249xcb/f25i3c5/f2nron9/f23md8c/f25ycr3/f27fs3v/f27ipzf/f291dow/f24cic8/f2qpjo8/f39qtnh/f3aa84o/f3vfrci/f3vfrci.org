> egg moves - in the games, egg moves couldn't be found on wild pokemon, but I think this fic is unlikely to have the same limitation. From a rational standpoint, you have to keep in mind that fact that all pokemon are born from eggs in the wild

I'm interested in the answer to this, but I expect it's easy to rationalize it away as "egg moves are moves that pokemon need to become familiar with at a very early age that aren't exhibited in the wild, but need pokeball technology to train them" so basically a specialized TM.
