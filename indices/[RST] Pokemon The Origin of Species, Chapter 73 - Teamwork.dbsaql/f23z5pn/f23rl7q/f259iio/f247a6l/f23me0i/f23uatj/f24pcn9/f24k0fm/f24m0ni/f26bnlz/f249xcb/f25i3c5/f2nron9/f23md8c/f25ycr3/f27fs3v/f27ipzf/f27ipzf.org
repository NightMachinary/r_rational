Depending on the circumstances and decisions involved, would Lt Surge have given someone who lost all their pokemon a badge during the debriefing? On the one hand, if they had made the right decisions, it'd still be reinforcing Surge's virtues, etc. But on the other hand, shit's just not fair sometimes.
