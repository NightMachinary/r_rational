I agree he made the right call, but it's more complex than that. Staying out was risky too, because it meant that people definitely wouldn't be saved when perhaps they could have been. The question is, how great are those risks; are they justified by their potential returns, or not? Red judged not in this case, and the outcome suggests he was correct.
