The first chapter had this passage:

#+begin_quote
  Red once explained for five minutes to Blue how a researcher in Johto discovered that, after breeding a slowbro and a bayleef, the baby chikorita that hatched was able to heal those around it: a power no other chikorita had ever dispalyed, but that the slowbro father had learned [...] [Blue] wasn't the least bit interested in the implication that pokemon retained some intuitive, genetic grasp of how to use abilities they didn't normally have
#+end_quote

So in this fic, egg moves don't need pokeball technology to train them, they're just moves a pokemon would not "normally" have, i.e. learn over the course of it regular growth (or have already learned by that point in time).
