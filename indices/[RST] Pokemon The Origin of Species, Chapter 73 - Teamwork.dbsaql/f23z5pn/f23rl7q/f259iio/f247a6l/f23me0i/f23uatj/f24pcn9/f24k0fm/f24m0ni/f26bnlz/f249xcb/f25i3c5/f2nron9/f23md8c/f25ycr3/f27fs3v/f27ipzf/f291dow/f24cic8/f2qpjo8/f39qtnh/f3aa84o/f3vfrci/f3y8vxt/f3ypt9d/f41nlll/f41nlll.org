Yeah, the world has a lot of details put into it.

So much so that in retrospect, I realized egg moves from the moveset of a different-species pokemon, while theoretically possible to show up in the wild, would still probably be extremely rare because it looks like in the wild pokemon would usually only breed with another of its kind... But egg moves that are also the more powerful moves a pokemon would learn at higher level should probably be more common, unless the chances of getting an egg move was lowered in this fic compared to canon.
