True! And since pressure affects humans differently depending on the person, it's not a stretch that some pokemon could be affected by having parts of their training supressed or their natural instincts brought forward. I'd have to reread the absol and Stormbringer chapters to remember what details we got about pressure affecting trained pokemon before.
