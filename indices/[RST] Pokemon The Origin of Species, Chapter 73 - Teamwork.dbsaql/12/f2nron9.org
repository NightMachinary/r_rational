I kept expecting the last survivor to be in the voltorb building, being a suicidal mission and making Blue confront the same situation Red had to (since Sabra knew and helped prepared the challenge). Maybe he would have lost the challenge after entering the building and Sabra or Surge would've given him a talk that made him realize he was wrong about Red. When apologizing to Red, Red would have told him with tears in his eyes that if it were Blue who entered that building, he would have followed him to his death.

I just hate them being like this :)

Unfortunately, I caught up with the updates so it will be months until we find out what happens. Damn.
