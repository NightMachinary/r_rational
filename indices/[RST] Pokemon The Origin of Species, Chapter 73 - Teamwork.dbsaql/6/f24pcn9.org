Every chapter I get more and more excited for the inevitable confrontation between Blue and Red. I honestly think Blue will realize he's wrong at /some/ point, only because if he doesn't that would be a hit to his character, but my worry is that Red (or at least, "Past Red") will have internalized the whole "you should have gone in after her" thing to the point that it's too late to take it back.

What I /want/ is for them to make up and go back to being best bros but looking at the source material this fic is based on, it's not likely. I can dream, though!
