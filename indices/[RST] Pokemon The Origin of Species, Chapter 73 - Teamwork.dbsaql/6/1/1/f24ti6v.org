It is a very tricky thing, but I think Blue has not really considered the emotional impact of what he's done. He hasn't thought "Wow, that was an incredibly difficult call for Red to make, he must feel terrible even though his choice was what kept him alive in the end." He straight up told Red "then you should have died", and I /know/ he means that more metaphorically than literally, but it's still a terrible thing to say to someone who just psychically felt their own friend die in a fire.

That isn't to say that Red didn't say some bad things himself--the whole "Aiko thought she had to go in there because of you" didn't help his argument at all, he just said it to hit Blue where he knew it would hurt--but to be fair, Blue struck first. I don't think either of them are 100% morally free of blame, but I think Red is definitely in the right in this particular argument, if only for the fact that if he didn't do what he did he'd literally just be dead.

I understand your point, though. Blue's main issue isn't of what Red /did,/ but rather the fact that Red thinks "I was in the right and I'd do it again." However, we know that ever since that argument, Red has indeed been doubting himself--the "Past Red" part of him, for sure, says that he feels "guilty about Aiko" and that he's still not sure if he did the right thing. I think current Red is operating off pure logic, because he's partitioning off his emotions, but when he allows himself to feel everything he realizes his...I can't call it a "mistake" in good faith, to be honest. He knew it was too risky. He knew he would die. I can't wrap my head around how Blue can blame him for thinking "If I could do it again, I would take the option that wouldn't kill me," solely from a human nature standpoint (never mind the fact that Red's greatest fear is death). And if it bugs him that badly, why can't he just accept that, in his terms, Red is a coward? Why does he have to completely cut all connection and make Red believe that one of his only friends wishes he were dead? He wishes Red went into that building, so therefore, he wishes Red had died. If this is how Red is thinking right now, I can't blame him at all. Maybe part of my judgment is just coming out of pity for Red.

Anyway, uh. Sorry for writing an essay. This whole thing is really complex and part of me wanted to just get my thoughts on it down somewhere. :p
