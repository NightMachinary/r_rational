I'm still not convinced Red was right. I said this way back, in response to the chapter where Blue and Gramps and Daisy took down the Titanic Trio: Just because you happen to have been correct one time does not mean the thought process you used to make your decisions was a good one. Someone who buys lottery tickets and wins is still an idiot for buying lottery tickets.

Red managed to avoid a pointless death /that time/, but it does NOT mean he was right to decide as he did. I'm not on Blue's side either. I just don't know. It's an incredibly hard thing to figure out.
