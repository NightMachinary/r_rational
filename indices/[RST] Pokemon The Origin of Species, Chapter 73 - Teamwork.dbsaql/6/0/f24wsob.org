I'm fine with Blue committing to being an ass about this, reading stupid smart people I can empathize with is rare. Interesting, in that I think I empathize but don't sympathize with blue. When I extend sympathy to someone there's an element of kindness to it, while I feel empathy towards blue there's also a lot of loathing there.
