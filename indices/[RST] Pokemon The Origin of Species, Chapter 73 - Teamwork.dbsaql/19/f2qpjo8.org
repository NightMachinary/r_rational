I don't see any theories as to how Blue's pidgeotto was able to identify rotom-frost as a threat at all. Foresight is an egg move for the pidgey line in the canon, so that seems unlikely. Has "Keen Eye" been buffed in this universe?

Also, I was curious about how rotom's typing would be handled in TOoS. Looks like it does effectively "lose" its Ghost typing when inhabiting an appliance, as it no longer has the permeability(?) or surrealism, but can still use its Ghost type moves; just like the canon. Interesting.
