RE: pidgeotto identifying rotom - my first thought was that since scientific effects corresponding to Types are a must in this universe (e.g. the Flying "particle", and really the method(s) by which all moves work), it wouldn't be out of the question for some pokemon to have sensitivity via those kinds of interactions. For example, pidgeotto could have detected Electric-type "particles" off rotom, or its own Flying "particles" were shorted off near rotom's area. But this explanation may be falling into the trap of shoe-horning all unknown events into a single convenient phenomenon. And as a counter-example, it's not like pokemon don't identify danger by sight alone - they're trained to go tense at the sight of a Pokedoll, for instance, seen all way back in chapter two.

RE: egg moves - in the games, egg moves couldn't be found on wild pokemon, but I think this fic is unlikely to have the same limitation. From a rational standpoint, you have to keep in mind that fact that all pokemon are born from eggs in the wild. It's probably only TM moves that are reserved for non-wild pokemon, though even that might have (or start to have) small exceptions if a trainer releases their pokemon back into that wild and they're successful in surviving and having offspring.

RE: rotom's typing - I'm not sure if rotom lost its Ghost typing here. Blue mentions, when he first sees the rotom, that "It's a strange sensation, having knowledge blocked somewhere in his own head [...]", which seems to indicate surrealism. +Also, he notes after seeing the rotom use Blizzards and an unnamed electric attack that "The overwhelming strength of his opponent is balanced a little by it not using only its most optimal attacks" - which reads to me like either the electric-type move or the Blizzard, one or the other, isn't benefiting from STAB.+

+Well, that's what it sounded like at first.+ Thinking about it, it could instead mean the usage of Ice-type attacks that Snorlax is particularly effective at tanking against. And Blue did mention that this rotom was Ice type, as in the Pokemon type...but could possibly mean "Ice type", as in rotom's form...

And now I'm wondering if Red should work on his theory of pokemon with more than two types by starting with rotoms.

[[/u/DaystarEld][u/DaystarEld]], can I ask you about this last one?
