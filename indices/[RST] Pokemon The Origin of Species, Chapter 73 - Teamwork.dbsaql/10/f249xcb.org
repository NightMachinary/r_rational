(Great chapter as always) I am actually very surprised at the choice of teammates, it feels like Blue went with virtually none of his closets teammates for this one, no Glen, no Elaine, etc. I understand that they were practicing as opposed teams, but I imagine the plot structure also factored in - Blue spent the vast majority of the scenario separate from everyone else, so there wasnt going to be big character beats like Red+Leaf in the storm. Minimal personal investment leads to a focus on the battle.
