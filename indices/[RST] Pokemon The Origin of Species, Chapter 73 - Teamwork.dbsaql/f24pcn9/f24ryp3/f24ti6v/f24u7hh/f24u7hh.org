Please, don't apologize for giving actual thought to the subject and having a lot to say. I /like/ these kinds of responses. There's far too many "Cool chapter, bro" responses to a lot of the fiction I enjoy.

And now, having said that, I don't actually have anything more to add to this, since we seem to be thinking along the same lines.

Cool response, bro.
