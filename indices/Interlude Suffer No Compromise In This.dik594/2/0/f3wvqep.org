below don't pass judgement in the same way above does, Below pretty much give people a big cash check and tell them "don't do something i would not do" and wink, and it's up to the person to use the money responsibly...something we as human seldom do if we come into money suddenly.

Above try to guide their heroes and have a much more hands on approach, telling their heroes to do this or that for the greater good, meaning they have a more direct influence.
