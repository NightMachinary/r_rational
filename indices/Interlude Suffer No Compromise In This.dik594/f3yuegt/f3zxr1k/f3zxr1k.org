...I mean, Judgement tried to stop Hierarch a few times. It's a decent theory, I could see it going that way, but I don't think Judgement is terribly concerned with mortal laws and courts, considering their refusal to stand trial and repeated attempts to murder a judge. It's more "judging to see if it's a net positive or negative" rather than actual justice. Although they have been called Justice a couple times, so who knows?
