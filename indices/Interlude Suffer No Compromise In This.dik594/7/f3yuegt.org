i really like one theory I saw in the comments of the chapter:

The grip was the Choir of Mercy, trying to save Judgement by stopping Hierarch from finishing the sentence. This was all according to Tyrant's keikaku: the Tribunal literally HAVE to be Just, its in their nature. And the Choir of Mercy just did something objectively unjust right in front of them - they tried to stop Hierarch from sentencing Judgement, in the process effectively confirming his verdict as valid (if it weren't valid, they'd have had no reason to stop him).

Judgement is now compelled by its nature to destroy Mercy. /That's/ why the grip is gone.
