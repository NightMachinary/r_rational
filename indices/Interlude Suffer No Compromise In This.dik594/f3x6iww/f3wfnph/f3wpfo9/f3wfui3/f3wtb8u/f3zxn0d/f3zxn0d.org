I think Kairos trapped the Choir of Mercy in a logical paradox. Assuming they can only have their attention on one entity at a time (strong assumption, but not completely unmerited): if they don't attack them, he's lying so they have to attack him. If they do attack him, he wins, and they're attacking him for telling the truth. He's trapped a whole Choir in a no-win situation.
