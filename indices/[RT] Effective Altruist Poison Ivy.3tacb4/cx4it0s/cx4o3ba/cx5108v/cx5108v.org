The smart goal-directed characters generally do a good job taking advantage of the tools they have available to accomplish their goals, so I'd call it highly rational (perhaps not /perfectly/ so, but people are flawed so I don't mind a few exceptions). One of the few sci-fi settings where revolutionary new technology gets introduced in a particular plot and then later on becomes a basic part of the background for subsequent plots.
