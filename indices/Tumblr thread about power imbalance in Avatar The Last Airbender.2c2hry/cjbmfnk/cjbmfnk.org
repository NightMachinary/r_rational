I would say, in response to the bonebending, that earthbending is quite terrifying enough without giving it direct access to the salts in a person's body(huh, well that puts a new and horrifying spin on the growing crystals King Bomi used) when you can just remove the ground from under your foe to encase them in the earth. Earth Bending is used to raise a city from nothing in less than a day, it is the greatest force of industry available to all the nations. Water Bending too can also be used in this respect and both are limited to the most prevalent resource. Fire Bending has their metal processing but it does not hold a candle(heh) to an Earth or Water Bender just saying I have a house now.
