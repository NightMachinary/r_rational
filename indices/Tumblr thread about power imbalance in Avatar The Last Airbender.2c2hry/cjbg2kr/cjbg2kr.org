I'm two chapters into doodling a Rational!Avatar fan-fiction (or maybe more accurately, a Science!Avatar fanfiction) but the two chapters are not meant to be the /first/ two chapters, so I'm still trying to decide if I should wait till I have a coherent story woven together, or just put the individual chapters up as short stories. It may be a while because it's not the only thing I'm writing, and I've spent most of my time thinking of how to set up the world mechanics in a more rigorous way so that people can Do Science to it.

Anyway, suffice it to say that there are some fairly cool things you can do with firebending without introducing any new mechanics if you put your mind to it - and not just for military applications.

(I've actually been somewhat struggling to find equally awesome stuff for the other elements - though I'm ultimately not opposed to ending up with a power disparity, i would like to at least try to max-out the potentialities.)
