I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5398503/1/Embers][Embers]] by Vathara managed to construct an AU where all of the nations really made sense. The story mostly follows Zuko and Iroh. By more strongly integrating the concept of the spirit world and the Avatar's role as the spirit bridge, a very interesting story creeps up.

One of my favorite parts of this story is the absolute terror that having the Avatar, whose job it is to mediate with spirits partly on mortals' behalf, actually merge with the water spirit at the North Pole causes across the entire world.

The story is complete, everything is resolved, although the final chapter feels like it was a cap put in place to allow the author to finally just finish the story. The 700k words before it are golden.
