Earthbending can raise houses, and dig tunnels, which makes it pretty damned good for starting up a community, but after that ... the utility starts to drop. It's possible that you could make an earthbending engine in order to mill your grains into flour, saw logs, etc., but the same is true for all other forms of bending as well.

Contrast with waterbending, which can be used to make engines, ice houses, /and/ for healing, /and/ for food preservation, which cuts out a large amount of labor.

Contrast with firebending, which has by far the most industrial uses. Sure, they can't build their own houses like the waterbenders or earthbenders, but once they have a village established, they can build similar engines and basically cut out all need for ovens and/or heating, which is enormously useful. That's without even getting to the metallurgy that they're capable of given the amount of heat they can produce.
