But the major difference is that Harry Potter has an enormous world full of details that beg to be fleshed out. Harry Potter was made for fanfiction. But the HP series deliberately makes a choice to focus on the milieu at the expense of the bland, predictable characters. A:TLA deliberately makes a choice to have a simple plot and a simple world to bring the characters into strong focus. Considering how bland and empty the world of A:TLA is and how simple and derivative the magical mechanics are, what exactly is the point of writing fanfiction about /that/ as opposed to about the characters, who would do well in any world? You are very nearly writing original fiction; might as well make it something you can sell.

Besides, I really don't understand the appeal of the game of pointing out the ways in which people who can casually violate the laws of our universe could indeed dominate it. Just seems rather vapid. Well, who am I to judge other people's fun?
