  The connection between bending and personality is a big part of what makes bending so interesting. We see this most clearly when Aang is learning earthbending. He has to overcome his natural inclinations and learn to stand strong and face things head-on. The other elements also have their associations with personality traits which come out in various places.

I think you're right, but I don't agree with the dilemma you're proposing. It's possible to create "bending flows from your personality" and "bending must be used intelligently and effectively" in the same story.
