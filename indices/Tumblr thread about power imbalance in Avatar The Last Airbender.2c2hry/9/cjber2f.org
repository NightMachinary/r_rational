I feel like this basically misses the point and appeal of various elements of the show. The appeal of bending in the first place is simply that it's cool. If it was something you had to think about, it wouldn't be as much fun. /Harry Potter/ also puts no thought into its magic, and both of these series are wildly popular. This should tell you something. It doesn't matter how the Fire Nation wiped out the Air Nomads. It's the start of the conflict. Who cares how it happened? The bending fights are not about /bending/, they're about clashes of personality and power. The differences in the fighting styles between Azula and Zuko in their final battle symbolize their character arcs. Zuko has found his center. He is calm and capable, and this is seen in the way he holds his ground the entire fight. Azula is cracking under the pressure of power and paranoia, and this is shown by her erratic and wild motions that carry her around the battlefield. The fight would be worsened if they had to instead fight with intelligence and munchkinery instead of symbolism.

Not that the appeal and point of a story can't be changed to be other things. But it's worth appreciating how a lack of attention to certain details can allow other things to come to the fore, and how necessary those details are in the first place to crafting an enjoyable and popular story. Certainly one can't lose track of storytelling elements simply to be rational. Have Zuko and Azula fight rationally, but it still needs to be symbolic of their opposed character arcs.
