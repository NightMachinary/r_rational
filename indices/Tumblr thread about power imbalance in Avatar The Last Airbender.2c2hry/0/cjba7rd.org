I really do like Avatar, and Legend of Korra. Generally speaking, they do a really, really good job with the world they've built ... for a kid's show. You see all sorts of examples of mundane utility with the powers, and in general people aren't stupid for stupid reasons. Aside from a few missteps, they're stupid for smart reasons. But yes, I would like to see an "adult" fic with all the schools of bending taken to their logical conclusions. Maybe not even set within the canon plotlines (even though that cuts down on the need to build up new characters), but just ... taken farther than the show does.

For the record, I don't think that bonebending would really work, given how difficult bloodbending is supposed to be, and how little mineral there is in bones compared to how much water there is in the body. That's not to say that it's an unbelievable extrapolation, but it seems kind of iffy to me - if it were easy, you would expect bloodbending to be a /lot/ easier, so I have to think that a person's chi interferes with bending, making bending their internals very difficult. Same reason that you don't see dessicationbending, where a waterbending simply pulls all the water out of their opponent.

I would totally write a rational fic for Avatar if I had the time - it's one of my favorite series. I think it somewhat unfortunately covers a lot of its bases in a way that certain other series don't, which makes it a little less of a likely target.
