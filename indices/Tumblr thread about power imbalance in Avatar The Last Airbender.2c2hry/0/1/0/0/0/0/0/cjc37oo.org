Well, I don't mean a strict version of the Manton effect, but the more general principle of "there's something that stops it from happening". The Manton Effect was Wildbow's attempt at solving one of the big problems with superpowers, which is that there are an enormous amount of lethal possibilities for someone that can, for example, create a forcefield through your chest or telekinetically crush your heart. I'm not proposing that the exact same thing applies here, just that the general principle is probably the same - the reason that we don't see people freezing brains isn't that it has never occurred to them, but because it's not possible (or very difficult).
