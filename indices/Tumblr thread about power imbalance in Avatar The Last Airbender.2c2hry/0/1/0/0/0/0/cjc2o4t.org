Bloodbending is a learnable and teachable skill canonically, and most waterbending such as chi healing could most certainly be used in such a fashion as you propose. It would require a person who is motivated and empowered to do so and overcome whatever metaphysical resistance of their target. There are also people who can bloodbend outside of the full moon's strengthening influence in Korra's time.

Firebending is shown to be an outward skill, with only a few focused on the internal effects you can do with it. Iroh, Dragon of the West, Learned internal firebending skills from both his dragon master and his observation of the watertribe to understand how one might manipulate internal chi to redirect lightning. The Breath of Fire, an internal technique, seems like it is not a common skill and something that Iroh might have learned from his Dragon teacher to which he passed onto Zuko.

The Manton effect applies in Worm as a set law of the universe with Faultline being unable effect living wood with her power and we can clearly find evidence that bending can be used on living subjects of both plant and animal in the Avatar Universe. The Foggy Bottom swamp bender that used the trees, Katara drawing water from the plant life around her as examples where a Manton effect would forbid such things from happening. Explosion Man too is an example of an unusual firebender who could cause explosions at a distance unlike how it is normally done. If he could score a direct hit, I would think that the flesh itself would be superheated and then explode.
