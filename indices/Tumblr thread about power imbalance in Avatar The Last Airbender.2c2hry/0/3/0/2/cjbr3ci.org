I like your ideas!

  it seems like a bit of a stretch to go from "bending fire" to "bending all forms of energy".

But isn't all energy one in the same? The charged particles that start the chemical reaction of fire are presumably the same that manifest as lightning. There appears to be no fuel furebenders are summoning to burn, just the fire, which is what led me to believe it is simply raw energy. I guess it ultimately depends on the mechanism of fire bending. But I still stand by my assumptions. Taken to its logical conclusion, the chemical reaction of fire is simply a byproduct of a firebenders input of energy.

Hah, on the E=mc^{2} note, yeah I was actually going to argue that an advanced firebender with a little concentration could transmute any element from thin air. But manipulating elementary particles into existence might require some finer instruments that human hands.

Regardless its fun to think about.
