Because probably the world of Avatar isn't redutionistic and the ontologically basic entities are fundamentally mental, so there's no such thing as "oxidation." And even if there were, the bendings don't actually follow "chemical" or "physical" rules, they follow mental ones, with /spirits/ and things like that. So I don't think any of this talk of "what you can generalise from bending" applies.
