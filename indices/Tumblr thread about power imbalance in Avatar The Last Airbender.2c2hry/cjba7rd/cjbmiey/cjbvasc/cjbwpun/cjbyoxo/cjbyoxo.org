It almost certainly does apply, which is why bloodbending is so hard. The canonical explanation of bending is that it's the extension of your /chi/ outside of your body, so it makes a whole lot of sense that you can't extend your /chi/ directly into someone else's. I would be very, very surprised if the Manton effect were not in play.

Edit: Because if it's not, firebending should be able to flash boil a person's brain from the inside and waterbending should be able to freeze a person's brain - neither of which is used or even hinted at, even when the opponents have lethal intent and little in the way of moral constraints.
