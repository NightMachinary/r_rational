To me, it seems like a bit of a stretch to go from "bending fire" to "bending all forms of energy". That's like going from "bending earth" to "bending all forms of matter." For that matter, why not go all the way? Given that E=mc^{2,} then shouldn't a bend-any-sort-of-energy person be able to bend matter as well, basically making them a Reality Warper?

Then again, fire is just a chemical reaction--oxidation. If you can bend fire, you could perhaps bend any form of oxidation. Rust metal instantly, mess with cellular respiration...lots of possibilities. So, yeah, definitely overpowered if you use it properly. Not sure that it's /more/ overpowered than any of the others, though.
