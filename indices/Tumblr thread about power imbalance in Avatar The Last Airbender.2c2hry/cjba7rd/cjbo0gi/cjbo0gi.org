I don't think people are giving firebending enough credit. I mean, at it's core, firebending is pure energy manipulation. Thinking along those lines, you could do amazing things. Surround yourself in an unfocused aura of blazing radiation. Good luck stopping a stream of high powered gamma rays! Release enormous flashes of intense light to permanently blind your opponents. Charge the air so that a single lightning bolt forks outwards to dozens of targets. And of course firebenders can manipulate electricity, and that's what neurons run on. They could send someone into seizures just by firing a little static into your brain. Or manipulate your emotions by stimulating certain areas of the brain. Or increase their own brain power with Electrical Brain Stimulation to increase their learning, memory, and reflexes. And other benders can bend their environment, so why not firebenders? Concentrate the full power of the sun on a person, or a whole city! They'll be reduced to ashes in seconds. Want to be subtle? Just bend the sun's ultraviolet radiation onto a target, no one will see or feel a thing- at least until a few minutes later when they break out in a terrible sunburn and die of radiation poisoning.

And that's just the start of it. If, hypothetically, an firebender (i.e. energybender) can add energy to a system, then maybe they can take it out. Halt the kinetic energy of projectiles (or increase it), freeze water in an instant, bring the flow of air to a complete standstill, or instantly drop a persons temperature to below zero. But admittedly that's just speculation. Perhaps something for our protagonist to research...

Firebending is without a doubt the most overpowered bending by a factor of five-hundred thousand, no, make that five-hundred trillion. The firebenders just need to realize it.
