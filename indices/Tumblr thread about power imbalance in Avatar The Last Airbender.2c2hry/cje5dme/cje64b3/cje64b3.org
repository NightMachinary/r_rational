I just want to point out that firebending does involve some sort of heat control, since Iroh is seen to heat his tea with it but doesn't use any flame (and there are a few other examples from canon). So it's /slightly/ more useful, but in terms of sheer combat potential, still has to be one of the worst abilities, second only to air (unless you assume that vacuumbending is a thing).

Industrial applications, on the other hand ...
