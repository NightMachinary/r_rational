I'd expect vacuumbending to be a thing, but even if it isn't, people (Aang) are shown in canon using air as a blade, plus crushing people's lungs, and if that's too hard just make them fall and crush their ribs with air pressure from above.

It's not /directly/ combat, but it's not absolutely useless. And it has some of the most powerful AoE capabilities.
