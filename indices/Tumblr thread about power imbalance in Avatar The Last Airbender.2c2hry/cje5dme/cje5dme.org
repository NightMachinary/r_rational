I haven't read all of stuff here and if this has been said I apologise, but I've seen people both in the tumblr thread and here talk about "bending energy" or "bending oxidation" and...

This is probably not what's going on? At all? Avatar has spirits, spirits of the /ocean/ and the /moon/ and spirits of /good/ and /evil/. It's a world where mental things are fundamental. When people bend fire, they're not doing anything as prosaic as bending oxidation of anything (after all, they're bending fire out of /thin air/), they're doing spiritualsy stuff that corresponds roughly to some conceptual idea of fire.

The most obvious point of evidence here is earth bending. What the /hell/ is /earth/?! Earth benders can and do frequently bend a /lot/ of different types of earth all over the world, so it's not any specific precise chemical composition. Besides, all earth has trace metal, so what's so special about metal? This does not /look/ like a reductionistic universe, it looks like one that's fundamentally mental with the "concept" of earth directing the bending and not any specific chemical or physical consideration. That, or earth and water and air and fire are /fundamental/ elements just like carbon and iron are in our world.

Which constrains very little our anticipations! It looks like you could argue anything into being called "earth" or even "air." So we take our cues from canon, and in canon, the /least/ versatile element /is/ fire, which is basically only seen as the destructive force, with fire, explosions, and lightning being the only examples we're shown. Contrast with water, that can freeze or melt or boil, that can apparently /heal/ (how on /earth/ does that happen?!) and control internal bodily fluids (to the point where [[#s][Spoilers first season of Korra]]!!!)

So yeah, I maintain my original position on tumblr that fire is the least useful bending :P
