From watching the show, it's almost certainly something much harder to pin down. A mostly canonical explanation goes something like this;

Everyone has a /chi/, and bending can simply be described as extending the influence of your /chi/ beyond your body in order to manipulate your surroundings. This is why bending is so tied to martial arts - the physical exertion serves as a focal point to /chi/ extension, but isn't strictly necessary.

So it's not really something that can be measured in terms of meters, because it requires metaphysical concepts.
