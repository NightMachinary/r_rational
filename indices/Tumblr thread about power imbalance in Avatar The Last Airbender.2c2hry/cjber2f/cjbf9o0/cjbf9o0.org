To add to that, a lot of the fights are about personality, not bending. Aang can beat Zuko initially becuase Zuko is so uptight and obsessed with his vision of himself capturing the Avatar and regaining his honor that he can't focus on the task in front of him. Aang is clever and quick, and so he easily exploits that. But in the underground crystal cavern place Zuko can take Aang on because Zuko has just gone all-in by betraying his uncle and siding with his sister. He's utterly desperate and truly focused on success /at this moment/. He is not even thinking about his father. Azula is stronger than everyone because she is pretty darned rational and gets under everybody's skin. That's why she easily beats a pissed-off Zuko, but as Zuko becomes calmer and more collected and at peace with himself it becomes harder and harder for her to fight him. That's why Katara can beat Azula as well: Katara goes into mother bear mode, which Azula's mind games simply don't work on. But Aang never beats Azula because Aang never quite overcomes his personality flaw of being unwilling to use direct and overwhelming force.

The connection between bending and personality is a big part of what makes bending so interesting. We see this most clearly when Aang is learning earthbending. He has to overcome his natural inclinations and learn to stand strong and face things head-on. The other elements also have their associations with personality traits which come out in various places. If bending were instead merely about how some people can control some elements and that allows them to do all kinds of terrifying things, a lot of the emotional appeal of the show would be lost in place of smart but meaningless action scenes.
