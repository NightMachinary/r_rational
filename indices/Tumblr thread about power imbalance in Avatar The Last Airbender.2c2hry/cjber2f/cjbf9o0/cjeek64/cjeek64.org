  To add to that, a lot of the fights are about personality, not bending. Aang can beat Zuko initially becuase Zuko is so uptight and obsessed with his vision of himself capturing the Avatar and regaining his honor that he can't focus on the task in front of him. Aang is clever and quick, and so he easily exploits that. But in the underground crystal cavern place Zuko can take Aang on because Zuko has just gone all-in by betraying his uncle and siding with his sister. He's utterly desperate and truly focused on success at this moment. He is not even thinking about his father. Azula is stronger than everyone because she is pretty darned rational and gets under everybody's skin. That's why she easily beats a pissed-off Zuko, but as Zuko becomes calmer and more collected and at peace with himself it becomes harder and harder for her to fight him.

Wouldn't this fit /perfectly/ with worm-style munchkin-vs-munchkin fights?
