I think you can enhance the fire benders industrialization as shown in the show, and make that one source of their strength. This would allow a connection to lightning/electricity, as well. I'm unsure how you would prevent other nations from simply copying Fire, though. Maybe it could have pollution issues? Maybe there's a spiritual or quality of life element as well? Maybe the energy conversion is only sufficiently efficient if a firebender is present, due to different physics? Or, suppose that Fire benders live in an enormously dirty and crowded overpopulated area, because they're in a Malthusian trap, or something like that. Other nations would be reluctant to enter the Malthusian trap willingly, so they fight back without resorting to industrialization. Maybe industry is taboo. Maybe it's unknown, and a few leaders are the ones who made the decision.

Motive is another problem. Perhaps Fire nation destroyed their homeland in their early attempts at industry (maybe something like the scenario in The Last Ringbearer, where Mordor accidentally ruined its own agriculture?), which is why they're desperate to take over the land of others?

I think addressing the "Chosen One" vibe that Aang gets would be necessary for this fic. Relying on one person to stop a war? That's just stupid.

Lots of potential here. Good job OP.
