[[/u/reuben_]] [[http://www.reddit.com/r/TheLastAirbender/comments/2cgx1x/av_club_comment_on_the_villains_of_each_element/cjfhv6h][broke down]] how ridiculously overpowered the lavabending subdiscipline of the earthbender villain in the latest Korra series is over in [[/r/TheLastAirbender]] a few days ago, compared to the average firebender.

  Trying to make bending fit our physics can only go wrong, but let's try. Something tells me Ghazan heating up earth to create lava makes him the most powerful bender in the entire LoK universe, and I get pretty pissed at how the show has been all over the place regarding people's powers.

  In the latest episode he turns a decent chunk of earth into lava, creating a pit looking thingie to fend off the attacks of the metal clan guards. Let's guestimate its size at 5m radius, 1m deep. That makes it 25π cubic meters of earth that was heated into lava. According to Wikipedia, "lava is a liquid at temperatures from 700 to 1,200 °C". So let's say 1,000 °C, and let's also assume that's exactly the melting point of the rock, to make the math more simple. Looking at [[http://apollo.lsc.vsc.edu/classes/met455/notes/section6/2.html][this page on the thermal properties of soil]], it says the temperature of soil 30cm down doesn't vary a lot, staying at about 35 °C at any given time of the day. The same page will give you the specific heat of solid rock, at 750 J/(kg*K), and its density, 2700 kg/m^{3}.

  So we want to get ~212,000 kg of rock, from 308.15 K to 1273.15K, and then we want to melt that rock. The initial heating takes 212,000 kg * 965 K * 750 J/(kg*K) = 153,435,000,000 J of energy. Melting takes 212,000 kg * (225,000 J/kg) = 47,700,000,000 J of energy, totaling about 200 GJ (gigajoules), [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_%28energy%29][equivalent to about 180 lightning bolts, or 4 MOAB bombs, the second most powerful non-nuclear weapon ever designed]]. That means Ghazan can produce as much energy as 180 of the world's best firebenders, in a few seconds.
