  What is the origin of humanity? How did the first colony developed?

Ideas:

Normal evolution in a world split into two (or more) parts: Chakra monsters originated on one side, then expanded to the other(s) as an invasive species. Humanity has been on the decline ever since.

Colony mission from Earth (or some place without Chakra monsters), something went wrong and memories were lost, or old earth became a legend became forgotten. But the materials from the ship were used to form the first colony.

Chakra is a technological development of humanity gone wrong. It warped the planet and animals, making the world as it is. It's only success was the few powers it granted humans, who have been backpedaling ever since.
