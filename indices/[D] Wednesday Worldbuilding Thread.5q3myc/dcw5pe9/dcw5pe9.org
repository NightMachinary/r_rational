Continuing where I left off [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5optr4/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/dcl9ap0/][last Wednesday]].

Kung Fu Battle Wizard setting:

*Concept:*

Humanity isn't on top of the foodchain. Rather, humans are forced to huddle in heavily forified settlements while being surrounded on all sides by all manners of scary animals, many dwarfing the size of humans, and still very agile.

Nonetheless, there's still a need from time to time for humanity to step outside, explore the world, and gather resources, or to travel from one settlement to the next.

Enter the elite soldiers known as ninja, who wield the power of chakra better than any other in combat environment. They are heavily specialized for movement and parkour, and their effort is focused on outrunning and outsmarting monsters rather than hunt them, perfect for the environment and challenges they contend with on a day to day basis.

There are three classes of ninja in this setting:

Scouts - Free ranging explorers. They look for opportunities and dangers. This may be looking for resources, or looking for creatures which may endanger supply lines.

Runners - Couriers who runs on known fixed routes. They carry packages in pocket dimensions and are the crucial supply lines between settlements.

Heavy combat - Their job is to defend settlements, resource extraction locations, outposts, convoy, and VIPs.

*Environment:*

If there is anything to be said about the environment, it is their sheer scale and lack of flatness, starting with the very ground.

Earthquakes are a frequent occurrence, running the gamut of very strong but rare to weak but frequent, causing the ground to take all sort of shape, anything but flat. Most of the ground would be very tough for humans to walk on, as they are frequently very steep.

Another force of nature to contend with are fast moving waters, which are unpredictable and torrential, carving cave systems, creating further elevations.

Finally, life itself seem to frequently be on the large side. Trees often rose hundred meters into the air, their branches and roots creating natural highways for humans and other critters.

Beasts of all kind frequently outnumber humans, are huge, and often have their own special chakra abilities.

*Resources:*

Light crystals: Useful crystals that usually emit the right kind of wavelength, without emitting useless infrared radiation. They are the primary mean of growing food for colonies, or otherwise it would be impossible to practice agriculture.

*Power and Abilities:*

Every human beings born uses chakra, and have roughly the same basic powers, though only a fraction of the population will be scouts and warriors.

Chakra Adhesion: To navigate the three dimensional terrain of the world, they must be able to stick to walls and other objects. Otherwise humanity would not survive in the world. Charka Boosting: At time, jumping between chasm and gaps may be the only option. Enhanced Kinesthetic Sense: Anybody could easily fall to their death if they made the wrong move, so it's important for people to be highly aware of their own bodies and what they are doing. Enhanced Upper Body Strength: Since the world is three dimension, all four limbs must be used. Sigilism: A relatively undeveloped science. By drawing diagrams certain way, it's possible to create chakra effects independent of a person. Justu: Any techniques casted by the user in the form of handsigns to create effects. Although handsigns are not strictly necessary, and could be omitted, it makes creating effects easier. Using a justu without handsigns is often a sign of mastery.

*Sigilism*

The art of creating magic through the drawing of sigilism and its infusion by charka.

Sigilmasters - Scientists, engineers, and craftmen who study and practice sigilsim. They spent their time drawing and infusing sigils, but also experimentation. Almost every part of the process must be done with care, lest harm will come to sigilmasters or their users.

Crafting or drawing sigils must be done with good craftmanships as the tolerance for error is high. Infusion of a sigil must be done with knowledge of how it work and how to shape one's charka.

Materials must be chosen carefully. Drawing must be done with charka-conductive materials, such as blood, ink, certain type of metals, and so forth. The medium must be nonconductive to charka. Frequently, this would be animal skin, wood, or clay.

Type of Sigils:

Storage Sigil - Store objects in pocket dimensions at the volume of one cubic meter with one-fifth the mass. This is what make ninja logistic and trade between colonies possible.

*Colonies:*

While there are hunter-gather bands, most humans live in colonial cities. Colonies, unlike our cities are self contained supporting environment, heavily fortified. The world agriculture is synonymous with cities.

*Questions:*

What is the origin of humanity?

How did the first colony developed?
