I'm thinking of a rational reason for why magic can be used by everyone but very few people become full fledged mages, so I'm going into this with how education or language evolved in human history, now I'm no expert in this field but I'm just using the basic knowledge that I've learned about this area.

So it is possible for everyone to use magic, think of it as an extra sense just like seeing or hearing except it's more intuitive but just like how you need to learn to speak or read, similarly, you need to learn to use this extra sense to use magic but a certain level or type of magic can be very easily learned like how we can learn to speak as we grow up , now, my world would be same old medieval era kind of world or even older so schools and such are not common.

So first thing, humans can easily become proficient in speaking a language if they grow up with everyone around them speaking it, similarly some simple types of magic is very common and almost everyone can use them because it's just easy to learn. Next is that some people are born with a special talent, just like how some people are really talented in arts or science or such, similarly people proficient in magic or certain types of magic are also born, these people can either be pioneers into a new field of magic or just easily able to grasp certain magics when taught. This leads to continuous improvement of magic over time.

Use of magic is very common among the people but there's also other races that exist so it's not all peaceful, though countries are not always at war but there is heavy focus on combat magic for war, which leads to some talented people not being able to reach their full potential.

The commoners can only use very basic magic barring some talented people, because similar to how commoners in ancient times could not read or write or have access to education, similarly, high level magic is protected by the ruling classes as this is the main reason they were able to become nobles, the noble houses are those who have some sort of strong magic that has been developed by their predecessors and so they are very proficient in it, and some of the older noble houses can have more developed magic as it's always being perfected through the generations, and they can also have a more kinds of magic either by acquiring them through conquering or by other means like political marriage or having genius ancestors.

Now, the reason why noble houses came to be is because their founder or ancestor was able to create/use advanced magic which lead to them becoming rich and also starting their own family magic, many noble houses have unique magics (which I think I'll make based on modern science), (and I'll need some reason why these unique magics are very very difficult to learn by other or to steal,)

I'm also thinking of people being able to awaken/create bloodlines, so if a person can have sufficient mastery over a certain type of magic, it can manifest as a bloodline leading to the creation of a new house. The bloodline will allow the persons descendents to be able to more easily learn their ancestors magic(or type of magic). (I'm not sure if this idea is okay or not, what do you think ðŸ¤”?)

So since my world has these realms of elementals and also some special realms(like heaven or hell) , which can be accessed from certain locations(its actually very difficult to find and entering is very very risky), and also there are mythical beasts and other sort of more common animals which are magical so some people can tame the common magical animals while others can steal the bloodline of the mythical beasts (I need some ways to incorporate this bloodline system, it's basically stealing one of the abilities of the mythical beast but unless you steal it from the king of that race, every beasts have a king, you can't pass on that bloodline.) (I seriously need more ideas to flesh out this bloodline system)

Back to the magic, so basically what I'm thinking of is that the more you use magic the more proficient you became at it and also that the capacity of mana that you can use is limited, actually the way to use magic is that you absorb mana (like oxygen) which your body converts into magical energy which is then stored in your body to be used later, so magical capacity can be increased as well, your body can become more efficient in converting mana or storing the energy(like marathon runners or sprinters). And this can be affected by your house, the older the better your body will be at handling mana. And also that the more advanced magic is the more efficient it has to be in energy expenditure which can only be achieved through trial and error,

Eg;a commoner may be using mana to power fire magic but an advanced fire mage from a noble house would be more efficient in the mana expenditure and a genius may use modern principles and rater than fire use heat gathered from the sun or the surroundings. A water mage will use existing water but a genius will pull the water vapour from the air while a commoner will directly convert magical energy to water,

So any ideas if this is going in the right direction and any comments or flaws, please do tell me,
