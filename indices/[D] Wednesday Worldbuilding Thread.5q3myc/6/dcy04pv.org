(Using [[/u/hackerkiba]]'s format since I found it really neat-looking.)

Concept:

The laws of mathematics are moderated and regulated by human beings. Each topic of mathematics have a single appointed human being or guardian to moderate the topic as they manifest. When the first quantity was counted by a human for whatever reason, the numbers king was born. He would be the leader of all of the guardians, and had ultimate power over his guardians in terms of what they can or cannot do.

The highest power would be the God of Logic. This is the embodiment of humanity in all of its facets. The good, the bad, the intelligent, and the ignorant, the evil, and the good, and everything else combined into a single, statue-like, unmoving being which only serves as the universal glue of all things.

More guardians other than the numbers king showed up as mathematics became more and more complex, and more topics began arising. When the first computers arose, the Computer mathematics guardian came into play. When probability and chance was first discovered, the guardian of Probability and statistics manifested.

All these guardians were once human beings, but were appointed by the God of Logic to become the representative of a certain mathematical topic. Should a guardian grow weary of moderating their mathematical topic, they can resign and appoint their own guardian of their own choosing.

The only reason why mathematical topics need moderators are because mathematics was injected into the context of humanity. The collective complexity of all human beings is enough to disrupt the balance of mathematics, which is why guardians needed to be appointed in order to rectify any and all chips they see in their given topic. Further out into space and guardians wouldn't be needed as the wavelength of complex intelligence emitted by human beings would fade. All intelligent civilizations across do have their own mathematical guardians, though.

Environment: The world at large have little to no knowledge on these guardians for a large part of history. The old ones felt no need to expose themselves, and they spent little time in the output realm, (which is basically earth). They chose to simply stay in the Input realm, where they moderated mathematical topics around earth.

After a complete change in management in the present day time, a new set off prodigies were appointed to becoming guardians, but they did expose the existence of mathematical guardians as they didn't see a reason not to, which nearly lead to a global upheaval, but was curbed. Now mathematical guardians are almost seen as god-like figures, but not by everyone. There are still disbelievers in the world.

Also, the simpler and more elementary the topic of mathematics is, the more powerful the guardian is.

Characters:

The Numbers King - Guardian of all numbers. Keeps track of all numbers

Guardian of arithmetics

Guardian of Probability and statistics

Guardian of Algebra

Guardian of Calculus

Guardian of Geometry

Guardian of Computation

The list goes on depending on which mathematical topics had been discovered and categorized at the time. For simplicity's sake, assume that all the mathematical topics that have been already categorized in the present time have their own guardian.

Powers and Abilities:

The Numbers king is charged with keeping track of all numbers within a reasonable and calculable sphere. This also means decimal numbers within a certain amount of decimals that has any chance of being used. Failure to do his job would result in worldwide catastrophe fraught with non-existence of logic. Shit would go down, basically.

Other than that, the Numbers King has complete jurisdiction over what a guardian can and cannot do. If a guardian, say, wants to increase probability of good fortune world-wide, he can choose to deny it if he wishes.

Every other guardian has abilities based on their given mathematical topic. A primary ability would be being able to alter the rules of their given topic, while a secondary ability would be near-perfect mastery over their given topic.

The God of Logic has laid out some ground rules for all guardians to follow. One isn't allowed to harm a human being. The whole point of being a guardian is protecting their world from mathematics imploding on them, fucking everything up. Although the God of Logic isn't capable of enforcing his laws, the Numbers King, the right hand of the GoL, is tasked to do so.
