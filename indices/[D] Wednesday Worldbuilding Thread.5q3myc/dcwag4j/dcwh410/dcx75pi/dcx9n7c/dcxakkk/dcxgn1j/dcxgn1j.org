Correct. I probably got a bit too excited about the question and doing the math for it and glossed over that part. At 100x time acceleration, luminance of room-temperature objects should approximately match an incandescent filament. Ouch. Peak energy output wavelength for objects at human body temperature will be about 95 nm which is in the near ultraviolet range. Due to the flatness of the curve, you're probably going to be getting a sunburn if you get too close to the zone and stand there for a while.

Visible light would be shifted into the soft X-ray range (3.8-7.4 nm in the 0.1-10 nm range). Total power output would be 10,000x the original output. Even if you were exposed to what would normally be only 1 watt of power in the form of visible light, once it exits the zone you'd be hit by 10,000 watts of x-rays. If you're 70 kg (154 lbs), that would work out to roughly 140 Sv per second. 3-4 seconds of that would give you symptoms of radiation poisoning. 14 seconds would produce severe radiation poisoning, 38 seconds would be usually fatal even with prompt medical attention, and 76 seconds would be fatal regardless of medical attention.
