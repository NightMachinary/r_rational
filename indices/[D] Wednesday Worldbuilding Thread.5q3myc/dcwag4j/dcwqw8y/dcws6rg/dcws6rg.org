Good point on the framework being important. I'm imagining our world, our physics (as closely as possible), and the universe being a computer simulation. "Time sped up" then means the affected bubble receives 100 simulated frames of plank time for each frame of the simulation of the outside universe. This makes sense if everything can be described as discrete particles that can be simulated but breaks down if not. For example if light acts as a discrete point in space it either receives 100/1 frames of updates or it does not. However if it is a wave bordering the edge of the bubble does it receive 100, 50, 1 or some other amount of updates? Does the uncertainty principle apply to the underlying computer or is fuzziness a part of the map and not the territory?

I am not certain about a lot of this but I probably will hedge in the direction of vagueness because I don't want the inhabitants of said universe to be able to use time bubbles to leak details of the above universe.
