I love questions like that.

Some other things (assuming the above have been magically fixed):

- From an inside PoV, Earth's gravity will drop to 0.098m/sÂ². So if the person inside is not aware and careful about this, they can accidentally launch themselves into the air without any means to control their flight trajectory, and end up finding out on themselves exactly what kinds of weird things are happening at the bubble's surface.

- From an inside PoV, some things that are outside [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/EM_spectrumrevised.png][will change their colour,]] some things will become invisible, others that were invisible before will become visible. Or everything that was visible regularly will become invisible, and some wavelengths that were invisible to the human eye before will now be perceived in regular colours.

- Radio-signals that have to travel through the bubble will reach their destination a bit sooner.

- It will be possible to burn something that's outside using a regular source of light, especially if it's a powerful laser pointer.

- solid bodies that are hitting the bubble's surface from inside (e.g. bullets) will crumble into themselves, or just bounce back upon hitting it. I'm not sure how Newton's Third Law will interact with the bubble.

  - same bodies hitting from outside will get pulverised. Or maybe a continuous series of atomic explosions will be happening?

- Radioactive elements that are inside the bubble will be much more dangerous to the outside environment.

- maybe the bubble will effectively become a hole-puncher in the world, if everything that enters it accelerates and leaves its current frames of reference.
