  Radio-signals that have to travel through the bubble will reach their destination a bit sooner.

So the FCC won't be approving this sort of device anytime soon. /snark

  From an inside PoV, Earth's gravity will drop to 0.098m/sÂ². So if the person inside is not aware and careful about this, they can accidentally launch themselves into the air without any means to control their flight trajectory, and end up finding out on themselves exactly what kinds of weird things are happening at the bubble's surface.

That strongly follows [[/u/ulyssessword]] speculation about pressure and heat too, I am thinking this bubble more and more strongly represents the vacuum of space as time passes.

Seriously though, thanks for the speculation. I think I have a solid framework I can use to write about and build off of. Affecting the EM spectrum was not something I had previously considered.
