Why is such enforcement required? In such a futuristic society, why is there more leniency given to a human that commits a crime compared to a robot?

And, in such a society, wouldn't a bot arbitraging the price of skins at speeds faster than a human can click buttons be beneficial to the stability of the economy? From Valve's standpoint, the CSGO and TF2 economies are like minigames to traders, and so they don't want bots on them because the economy is part of what makes the game fun. For a real economy, such gambling bot wouldn't be a crime.
