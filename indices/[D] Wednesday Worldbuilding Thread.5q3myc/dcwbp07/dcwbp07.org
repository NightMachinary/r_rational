I just saw a YouTube video about Valve cracking down on illegal gambling with CounterStrike GO skins and I've got a cool idea for a Black Mirror-esque sci-fi story I want to write down. The way the gambling works is that skins are traded between Steam accounts between gamblers and bots run by the gambling dens, so I got the idea about criminals in the future using robots who pretend to be human to commit crimes in the real world.

It probably wouldn't be that easy for a robot to get fake ID in the future, but it's still a really cool idea. It could be like Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, except the rogue androids are acting the behest of other humans instead of independent goals. Or maybe it takes place in a world where humans have started uploading their minds and suddenly there isn't an easy way to tell who's a bot and who isn't. It's just a thought, but it's one with a lot of potential.
