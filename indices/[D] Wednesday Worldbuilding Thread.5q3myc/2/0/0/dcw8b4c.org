/I'm always partial to "Humanity isn't from around here." Could humans ultimately be descended from Earth? If there's chakra to begin with, it wouldn't be unreasonable to suppose that there are places with more or less chakra. Maybe there was a shift in the amount of chakra in Earth's universe, ultimately allowing people to figure out how to use it to cross to other universes (with Earth as a hub)./

I probably have humanity come from somewhere else, most likely from another universe with chakra metaphysics.

/Also, can light crystals be grown?/

Light crystals are definitely grown, if not naturally obtained from the environment. I haven't decide on a mechanism, but it will probably include some sort of chakra spring or vein.

I probably change how light crystals work. Maybe they aren't one hundred percent efficient for plants, but varying level of efficiency? The perfect light crystal will emit 100% useful energy to plants.
