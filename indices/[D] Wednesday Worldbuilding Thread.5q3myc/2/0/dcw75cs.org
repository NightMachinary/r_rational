  /What is the origin of humanity?/
#+end_quote

I'm always partial to "Humanity isn't from around here." Could humans ultimately be descended from Earth? If there's chakra to begin with, it wouldn't be unreasonable to suppose that there are places with more or less chakra. Maybe there was a shift in the amount of chakra in Earth's universe, ultimately allowing people to figure out how to use it to cross to other universes (with Earth as a hub).

Then there was another shift, and the outposts in this (and every other) world were cut off.

Also, can light crystals be grown?
