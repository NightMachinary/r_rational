  I like the idea that there's a shortest program that can experience happiness.

/And we haven't found it yet./ There is a rift in the philosophy community, between those that want to create more happiness in the world right now, and those who want to spend those resources researching new, more efficient algorithms.

Another debate is whether old processes should be killed to free up their resources for the newer algorithms, given that the oldest algorithms that can experience happiness are less than 0.1% as efficient at creating happiness as the newest generation.
