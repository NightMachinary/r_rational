I like the idea that there's a shortest program that can experience happiness. This idea could fit into lots of other settings.

In the cyberpunk future, a sect of philosophers begs borrows and steals computer time to run this program as much as they can. Of all people, Bitcoin miners completely sympathise with their quest to run quadrillions of iterations of a program that just solves the same mathematical problem over and over, and only debatably produces anything useful.
