But is it flawed? That's the real question. Is there any difference between sentient individuals' happiness and non-sentient ones'?\\
Is there any difference between smart or self-conscious happiness and stupid or simple happiness? Is there any difference between AI happiness and 'real' happiness? (bear in mind that we could be AI's without knowing it)

Life as we know it is constantly being in the way of happiness. Wouldn't it be easier to simplify it?
