I don't think consuming hard drugs results in more happiness. Besides, if everyone was constantly drugged, it would result in 0 productivity and eventually the extinction of the human race.

I don't have the background in philosophy to really argue with you but I would gladly exchange my autonomy for a life full of happiness.

Also, I don't know why you're talking about what humans would do. Humans don't do the right thing. That's why I took robots. AI's are obliged to take the 'right' solution .
