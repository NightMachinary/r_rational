  I like being autonomous because it brings excitement, change, happiness,etc... and the prospect of maybe being happier later. But if you promise me that I will have more happiness by lobotomizing me, go for it! I don't understand people's attachment to things like that. I like living in freedom, but if you can convince me it is better not to, Id live without it... Why do humans absolutely need autonomy? (certainly if it stands in the way of something better)

To be clear /any/ solution that leaves humans alive, is not going to be maximizing happiness. Humans are made of resources that a AI utility monster can make a much greater amount of happiness with.

  Yeah, well all it takes is a powerful orator convincing them or a few mad scientists with my opinion here and there we go...

See I don't think you realize how rare classic utilitarians like yourself are. The number of people that would be totally fine with wireheading, or the human race being consumed to feed a utility monster is utterly microscopic, to the point I've never actually heard of one existing. Wireheading and utility monsters are treated as deathblows to classic utilitarianism /precisly because/ basically no-one is willing to bite those bullets, so it's extremely unlikely that you could convince enough talented AI researchers to be likely to get your way.

See we fundamentally aren't going to convince people with each others values, because we have different terminal goals. I (and most people) care about autonomy over maximizing happiness and would oppose the creation of utility monsters, because most people are closer to preference utilitarians than classical ones.
