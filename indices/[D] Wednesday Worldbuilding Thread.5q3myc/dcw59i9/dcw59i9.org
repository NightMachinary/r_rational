So I've got this world that is basically robots building and maintaining facilities around the stars, that use their energy to power servers that simulate happiness.

Basically, people (in the far future) discovered that you could upload your mind onto servers and have a simulated awesome life with lots of happiness. Everyone did that and left everything in charge of robots. Now the robots, being pragmatic, simplified the codes, to optimize happiness and also created new servers with other simulated lives, but this time they didn't even upload minds, they just created AI's. Eventually, they simplified it to just a few lines of code, outputting happiness.

The robots, with their only goal, being to create happiness, just build servers hosting lines of codes having continuous orgasms. This until the heat death of the universe or until another civilization interrupts them.
