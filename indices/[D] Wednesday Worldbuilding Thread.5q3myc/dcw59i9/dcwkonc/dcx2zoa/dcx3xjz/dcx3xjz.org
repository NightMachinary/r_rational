  Life as we know it is constantly being in the way of happiness. Wouldn't it be easier to simplify it?

Not really, if we were trying to maximize happiness we would have done quite a lot more drug and brain stimulation research in an attempt to male everyone happy all the time.

As for asking whether it's "really" flawed, that relies on assuming there /is/ a objective morality, but it's about happiness and not autonomy. It seems abundantly clear that given all the talk of "biting bullets" that it seems difficult to really argue that morality isn't just about trying to make our moral intuitions into something somewhat sensible, thus why so few people are classic utilitarians.\\
But even if that classic utilitarianism is somehow "right" nobody would care, because people care vastly more about their own convenience than they do about what's morally right anyway. So good luck getting anybody to get on board with a moral system that prescribes that all humans should be wiped out when it becomes possible to grow a super happy eldritch horror with the resources keeping them alive.
