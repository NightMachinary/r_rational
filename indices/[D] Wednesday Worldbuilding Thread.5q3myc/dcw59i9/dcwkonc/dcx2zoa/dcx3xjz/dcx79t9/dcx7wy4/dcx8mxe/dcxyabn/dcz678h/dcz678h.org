I understand that you care about your life and about the people living with you on Earth, but why do you care what happens to the human race after you're dead? I know I will be too dead to care... Do you care more about humans experiencing happiness than other beings experiencing happiness? I do, while I live. Because a happy community is better to live in. But after that, I don't know why humans should have priority.

I don't think you realise how fast opinions can change. Just look at history. 150 years ago, buying people was legal and 70 years ago someone convinced his nation to kill people for no reason.
