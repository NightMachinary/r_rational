Wait so you are actually saying you're fine with everyone dying so long as it's to feed the AI, which is basically a utility monster? Man i'm not sure i've ever actually met a classical utilitarian willing to bite that bullet.

As for drugging people into happiness, we aren't talking about just using standard methods which aren't long term sustainable. That's why I said you would need to do research, because the existing methods don't really seem adequate. Also you really should have phrased that better since hard drugs /cannot really be argued to not be enjoyable at least initially/, the problem is that they come with many problems, side effects, tolerance, addiction, etc.\\
As for maintaining civilization that seems an obvious consideration. So the idea would be to develop drugs/brain implants that would permanently leave you in a functional constant blissed out state.

  I don't have the background in philosophy to really argue with you but I would gladly exchange my autonomy for a life full of happiness.

How far would you actually go that route? As in would you plug into a machine that basically lobotimizes you and stimulates your brain leaving you in a perpetual mindless bliss?

  Also, I don't know why you're talking about what humans would do. Humans don't do the right thing. That's why I took robots. AI's are obliged to take the 'right' solution .

The reason humans matter here is because /they're going to be the one's creating the AI/.
