1. First, I'm not even sure of my opinion right now. I'm still trying to understand it. But let's say I do: I don't mean murder because that would bring a lot of unhappiness but by not reproducing. I do have a small comfort in the idea that humans may conquer the stars but once I'm dead, I'm dead. I don't care what's happen to them. And is it bad to just stop reproducing? Do what have a moral obligation to continue the human race?

2. That's what I meant when I talked about hard drugs. On short term I may bring happiness but the problems it creates doesn't make the equation positive. But yeah if we find a sustainable way to drug everyone in a sustainable way, why not.

3. I like being autonomous because it brings excitement, change, happiness,etc... and the prospect of maybe being happier later. But if you promise me that I will have more happiness by lobotomizing me, go for it! I don't understand people's attachment to things like that. I like living in freedom, but if you can convince me it is better not to, Id live without it... Why do humans absolutely need autonomy? (certainly if it stands in the way of something better)

4. Yeah, well all it takes is a powerful orator convincing them or a few mad scientists with my opinion here and there we go...
