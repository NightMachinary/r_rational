  The Romans once invaded an island next to Wales. When they arrived, there were a huge number of druides (some kind of warrior-priests) waiting for them. But to the Romans' surprise, they didn't attack. They just stood there and immolated themselves.\\
  They didn't use modern propaganda techniques to convince the druides they had to sacrifice themselves. I don't think there is any limit to what you can convince the people of.

The difference there is that the druids almost certainly believed in some sort of afterlife and had some justification for their suicide. Whereas convincing a bunch of probably fairly intelligent programmers, to wipe out all of humanity and themselves with no hope of a payout seems implausible. See convincing people to do crazy things usually requires that you get them on board with a insane belief system, within which those crazy things seem perfectly reasonable.\\
Point is I don't see any programmers ever deliberately creating that sort of AI, at least unless you somehow indoctrinated a bunch of genius programmers into a cult in order to get the sort of control over them you'd need.
