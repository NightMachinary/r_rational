Well, if you can convince someone to suffer horribly using some special after-life trick, you can convince people to 'not reproduce' the human race for unlimited happiness. Them being intelligent is a plus because, even if you may think it is wrong, this conclusion requires a certain amount of rationality. Don't forget that in my scenario, it is real and has real scientific proof.

You say my arguments are 'insane' which I find quite arrogant for someone who hasn't refuted any of them. Certainly for someone who has said himself that he didn't really care if the human species continued to exist.

In my scenario, all the existing humans get uploaded onto the servers and then 'simplified'. So they all gain from it. Also, since the robots will create new digital 'beings' far faster than humans can possibly reproduce, the 'simplified' humanity will reproduce extremely rapidly. The only difference is that they aren't really humans anymore. They don't have concepts such as autonomy, freedom, self-consciousness,... but these concepts don't even apply to them. So the only thing you need to say is: "If you follow me, you will have much, much, more happiness and we will spread much more happiness to the entire galaxy. You won't have all the things you like now, but you won't care since you won't like them anymore."
