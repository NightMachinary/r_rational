  I understand that you care about your life and about the people living with you on Earth, but why do you care what happens to the human race after you're dead?

See I don't care, but most people do have moral preferences that extend past their death. However since this sort of AI explosion might happen /while i'm alive/ (especially with medical advancements) I care a great deal.

  I don't think you realise how fast opinions can change. Just look at history. 150 years ago, buying people was legal and 70 years ago someone convinced his nation to kill people for no reason.

I think you totally fail to get just how abhorrent almost everybody find wireheading, but even separate from that I see no realistic way people are going to ever get on board with the idea of wiping out humanity in the creation of a utility monster.
