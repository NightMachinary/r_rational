Yeah well that's one of the reasons it is set in the far future. But I don't think it needs to be.

The Romans once invaded an island next to Wales. When they arrived, there were a huge number of druides (some kind of warrior-priests) waiting for them. But to the Romans' surprise, they didn't attack. They just stood there and immolated themselves.

They didn't use modern propaganda techniques to convince the druides they had to sacrifice themselves. I don't think there is any limit to what you can convince the people of.

As for real life, I am as fearful as you of something like this, because in the stage of technology we are now, I think it is very, very, unlikely that it will bring us happiness. What I am talking about is in that particular hypothetical scenario.
