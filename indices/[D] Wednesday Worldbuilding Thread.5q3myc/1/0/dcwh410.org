Looking into the sphere from the outside would appear incandescent white, (assuming it had an energy source, like IR radiation from body heat) not featureless black. This is because the number of photons leaving per observer-second is much higher, and also the frequency (and therefore energy) is higher as well.

It would also rapidly depressurize itself. Assuming that the bubble popped up in normal air, the molecules of gas would be leaving (due to random motion) at 100x the rate that they are entering. A similar thing happens with heat transfer, with heat flowing out very rapidly.
