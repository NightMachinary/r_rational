I've seen this question (or something along those lines) before on [[/r/AskPhysics]], and unfortunately, it's a lot deeper than it looks. You see, the answer really depends on how exactly time is being sped up. If you're actually somehow accelerating /the flow of time itself/, then you've already completely broken physics as we know it, and it becomes impossible to give you a good answer (since any such answers must rely on /known/ physics).

With this in mind, your first task should be one of the following:

1. Conceptualize a way to achieve this "acceleration" effect that remains at least somewhat compatible with real-world physics. (E.g. perhaps everything inside the bubble experiences reduced inertial mass? Pros: things mostly behave as you would naively expect things to behave in a region of sped-up time. Cons: it's unclear how such a phenomenon might affect massless quantities such as light, if it affects them at all.)
2. Invent a different underlying set of physics that your universe runs on which is compatible with such regions of sped-up time. This latter approach seems, if anything, even more difficult than the former, but if you pull it off successfully you might end up with something /really/ cool on your hands. (As a /very/ rough starting point: perhaps this is a universe where Newtonian mechanics or something like them holds rather than relativity? This has... well, there are a lot of problems with this that still need to be addressed, such as the fact that the speed of light in such a universe would be /infinite/.)

TL;DR: Talking about bubbles with sped-up time is hard.
