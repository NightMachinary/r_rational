  "Time sped up" then means the affected bubble receives 100 simulated frames of plank time for each frame of the simulation of the outside universe.

Ooooh, this makes a number of important differences. For one thing, it means that things leaving the bubble don't stay accelerated.

Consider an oxygen molecule, bumbling along through the air. It's in the time-sped-up bubble. travelling at 1m/s relative to the observer in the bubble (measured with his sped-up clock - the observer outside the bubble sees 100m/s). Then it bumbles off to the edge and drops out of the bubble; it loses 99 out of every hundred frames, but its speed doesn't suddenly jump up to 100m/s. Its speed is still 1m/s. So, to the outside observer, it suddenly drops in speed by 100x.

This is happening to every molecule that attempts to leave (and about 100 are leaving for every one that enters) so before long, you'll have a continuous, spherical wind blowing out of the timesped sphere in all possible directions.
