I am trying to conceptualize what a bubble of locally sped up time (say 100m radius, 100x time increase) what would look like to the inside and outside observer. Are there physical effects I am not considering in this event?

*Inside*: Because time is advancing more quickly, light is not entering the bubble often enough, and as a result bubble interior is quite dark. Weird things happening at the boundary (would anything going at different accelerations be sheared at the boundary?). Sounds coming in would be shifted into low pitch. You could not stay in the bubble for longer than a few minutes or the different rates of air exchange would cause the bubble to fill up with Co2 or other toxic gases. Other effects?

*Outside*: You can't see into the bubble of sped up time, it would appear like a black sphere. Possibly generating very high pitch noises if anything makes a sound inside. Other effects?
