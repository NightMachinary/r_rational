Running a quest on SV at the moment, and been thinking of the magic system I'm going to introduce eventually.

The big theme behind it is "Change". Essentially, you cannot create or destroy anything with magic, only alter it. Further, magic isn't something you learn, it's something you /use./ Belief (or Quintessence) coalesces into items that you use to perform magic through. There are three broad categories of items:

Charms: Small trinkets that can be made easily (eg Witch-Doctor rituals) that perform variable effects but have a one-time use. Like a feather that can let you glide for five seconds or a bead that will purify a pool of water.

Icons: These ones are rarer and take longer to make , usually the result of decades of investment by an individual or years of desperate need by a society. Like a doll that can help you in all manners of agriculture (and provides a bonus to growing plants) or a chalice that lets you absorb the strengths of any animal whose blood you drink from it (for a limited time).

Artifacts: Singular, unique existences that are the product of a culture believing in something for centuries. I have a few ideas, but the main one right now is a crystal ball that contains a God of Knowledge that will answer any question you give it (usefulness of the answers nonwithstanding).
