Oh no, the three categories are so I can keep track of them and easily delineate them for players. There's no in-universe difference between a charm and an artifact (some can even ascend the tiers given time), but I think it would be helpful to the players to know if they're dealing with a limited use item or not.

Although there is a sort of "self-perpetuating" mechanism going on behind the scenes. There's a physical source for all the Quintessence, something that turns human belief into tangible items. Outside of this area, belief doesn't coalesce into Quintessence. When Icons are taken outside of that range, they'll slowly degrade and lose their magical properties. Charms break apart almost instantly. Artifacts, on the other hand, don't. They have so much energy in stock that they can function outside of it's range indefinitely, sort of like a reactor.
