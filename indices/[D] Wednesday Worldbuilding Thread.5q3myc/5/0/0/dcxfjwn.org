I think that commoners will not have the knowledge for advanced magic so, turning magical energy directly to water will be incredibly inefficient, but if you can learn to use the existing water, it reduces the strain on your magical energy, leading to the mage lasting longer and the reason why I think using water vapour is very advanced is because it's probably something that people haven't discovered yet, so someone capable of doing that is using very advanced concepts(think modern science), possibly the only one with this knowledge yet, leading very high efficiency in his use of magical energy, higher efficiency means more magic he can cast, That's how I envision this system, some things that are common sense now weren't really known in the past, that's what I'm basing this system on
