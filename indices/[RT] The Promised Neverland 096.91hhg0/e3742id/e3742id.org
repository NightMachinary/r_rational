Didn't they say the shelter would be over capacity if they rescued Phil's group, /before/ having any knowledge of the Goldy Pond group, which is larger and older? They time-skipped four weeks too, so the potential explanation that the facilities won't support their needs in the long term but reserves are plentiful enough that they've got a while isn't as readily available.

Again, I really don't think blowing up Goldy Pond was a wise choice, narratively.
