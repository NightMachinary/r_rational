""I studded the walls with kryptonite," Lex said to the empty air." stuck out like a sore thumb labeled [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsYouKnow]["As you know, Bob"]], and could probably be outright deleted. It seemed too odd (for anyone, but especially for a character whose security concerns would have squelched any habit of talking to himself) to be anything but exposition, but as exposition it was unnecessary. Most of your readers probably figured out "green shards ... that Superman had taken with him when he went through the wall"; any who didn't would be able to piece it together from the discussion a half dozen sentences later.

That's my only worthwhile criticism. This is a fantastic story. Your Frozen and Terminator stories set me up with high expectations and I wasn't disappointed in the least.

(I do have one worthless criticism: for some reason Chapter 10 didn't feel as compelling or as interesting as all the others. I haven't figured out why, though, and if nobody else felt the same way then the flaw may be with me rather than with that chapter.)
