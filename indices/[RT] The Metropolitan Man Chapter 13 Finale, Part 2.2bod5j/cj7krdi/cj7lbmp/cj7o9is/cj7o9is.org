I think the confusion with Superman saying his ship was in the arctic was because isn't that actually true in canon? Or at least he has a fortress there? So it's sort of plausible enough to make you wonder if Luthor got a decoy, or if Superman stole it back, or something.

As for Luthor's line, I think it should probably stay. I think it needs to be made obvious that he did so, more than just a throwaway line about green shards which could be confusing or have other explanations, and Luthor's been run through the mill at this point and has finally defeated his foe, and may or may not be feeling some trepidation about being about to murder him. For me that's the message I got from his random slip into (a single sentence of) monologue.
