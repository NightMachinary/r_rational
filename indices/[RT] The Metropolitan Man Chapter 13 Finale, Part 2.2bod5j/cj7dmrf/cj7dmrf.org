In the end, I am left wondering if this was bigger than Superman. Of Krypton's message to humanity.

If Superman himself was the message - a controlled, demonstration by example. A mistake down the road they did not want developing sentients to make, like they did.

You left us sad, but Iâ€˜d like to think humanity passed. Thank you for writing the story.
