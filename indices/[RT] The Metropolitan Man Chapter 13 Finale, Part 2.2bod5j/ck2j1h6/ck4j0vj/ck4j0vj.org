  2) I do think Superman running out the wall like that was a bit of a fumble: with his ability to think and move so fast, he should easily have been able to simply stay a safe distance from the crystal as it was lobbed. A simple fix would be to depict it as so large that its effects press him up against the wall just by Mercy opening the door, showing that he really had no choice but to go through it.

This was the thing that sticks with me as problematic. We establish that Superman can take /days/ of thought in between the words of a sentence, and yet he decides that the most prudent course of action is to bail through one of the walls. Then the Kryptonite in the wall apparently weakens him enough to be shot, in approximately a second or less. So I'm not clear on why Superman chose to flee through the wall slowly enough to be affected by his weakness.

In addition, his plan to disarm Mercy and dispose of the Kryptonite once outside would somehow be different than the method he would use immediately upon seeing her with the chunk inside?

Maybe he could have seen Mercy with the rock and, thinking quickly, ripped one of the lead-lined walls open to use as a covering or shielding for it... only to inadvertently expose himself to the Kryptonite behind the lead lining. Just an alternate idea.

I loved this story, though.
