Finally got around to finishing this. As someone who has always disliked Superman while craving a better class of Superman story than the ones DC keeps churning out, I absolutely loved it. The idea of showing Superman realizing that despite it all, he's only one man and can't do everything alone, is exactly what Superman has always been missing, and him teaming up with Lex and/or Bruce to really maximize the good he does in the world is pretty much the best rational ending one could expect.

Two criticisms:

1) Lex never seems to consider that Superman, according to what he discovers about his "true" persona of Clark, ages. So unless he has a reason to expect him to just stop aging at a certain point, eventually Superman will die with or without Lex's interference: whether he'll do so before pulling a Zion is another story.

2) I do think Superman running out the wall like that was a bit of a fumble: with his ability to think and move so fast, he should easily have been able to simply stay a safe distance from the crystal as it was lobbed. A simple fix would be to depict it as so large that its effects press him up against the wall just by Mercy opening the door, showing that he really had no choice but to go through it.

In any case, thank you for writing this fantastic story, and sorry it took me so long to get to it :) Looking forward to reading more from you.
