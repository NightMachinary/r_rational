Thank you for writing this Superman fic. You have really increased my interest in the DC universe.

I will admit that your first bullet point about pitting Wayne Industries vs. Lex Corp sounds like a fantastic story in itself. Two brilliant masterminds, Wayne vs. Luthor would have a large number of possibilities/directions that would be very engaging.

I personally loved the ending. Thanks for going with it rather than trying to please the masses with a more optimistic ending.
