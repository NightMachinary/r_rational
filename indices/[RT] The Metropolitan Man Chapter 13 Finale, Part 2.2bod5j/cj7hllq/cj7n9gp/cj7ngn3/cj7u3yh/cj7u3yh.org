I think that's more how it was written (to keep the reader in the dark for the quick reveal/reversal just as Supes has 'won'). I have little issue imagining this Luthor actively hoping that Mercy would jump Supes with the kryptonite; even that assuming he didn't blatantly tell her to do so anyway in case Supes every confronted him in his office, which would be my assumption. Heck, that's what I'd have discussed with her at one point.

"Mercy, if Superman every confronts me, and I haven't warned you otherwise, jump him with kryptonite the first chance you get." Standing on the other side of a lead door was part of her preparing the ambush strategically.
