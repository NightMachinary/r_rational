It's more like a game of half-simultaneous [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bughouse_chess][Bughouse]] where a pair of Grandmasters (Luthor and Kent) are playing and Luthor is on the ropes, but the second game, which was basically an afterthought, is Kent vs. Mercy, and she pulls off a capture that gets Luthor out of trouble and wins the match.

I'd come up with a better metaphor, but there isn't a game I'm aware of where you can set up an independent friendly player. Maybe Civ V, but puppet states/colonies aren't guaranteed friendly.
