Smart to put Kryptonite in the walls. Smart to keep Mercy nearby. But as it's written, it doesn't seem like Luthor intended to spring the plan; Mercy did it of her own volition. Which is kind of like watching a long chess match, only for the winning move to be ignored by one of the players, so someone else has to step in and correct them.
