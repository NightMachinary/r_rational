  Mercy wasn't told to execute this plan, but instead did it on her own. So what would've been a masterstroke, a last ditch effort that resulted in the death of superman, comes off as blind luck. That's quite unsatisfactory.

I was expecting Mercy to be a major lynchpin as soon as the door closed and Superman and Luthor started their conversation without her in the room. Superman didn't have enough information to realize what a high-level threat Mercy was, but we readers did, so it was entirely appropriate. IMHO.
