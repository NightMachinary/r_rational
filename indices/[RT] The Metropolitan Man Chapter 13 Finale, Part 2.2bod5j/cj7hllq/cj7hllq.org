That was...still quite well written, but I think you fumbled it a bit.

So, this whole story we've been moving closer and closer to Superman's demise. Inexorably, Luthor continued his advance. We were made to see Luthor's point of view quite well, even to the point of thinking he was in the right. Superman was going to die, and we as the audience had accepted that.

...But then an alternative path presented itself. Superman was learning, he was ready to use his power for the greatest good possible. He could trump Luthor's efforts, he could overcome his weakness and be the Superman that everyone deserved. A Superman that transcended the comic book version, that transcended cynicism. A Superman that showed everyone that it's alright to hold your morals high and have faith in a better future.

Two paths. Either Luthor kills superman for the sake of humanity's safety, or Superman survives and does his best for humanity. For the majority of the story the Luthor path seemed unavoidable. I was fine with it, it would've been a fitting conclusion to a powerful story. But when that alternative path presented itself, I so dearly wished for you to pursue it. And you came so close to pusuing it. So very, very close.

But then Mercy pulls out the Kryptonite, and it's all over. And what's worse, judging by Luthor's thoughts, he thought he'd lost. He didn't have any contingencies left, Mercy wasn't told to execute this plan, but instead did it on her own. So what would've been a masterstroke, a last ditch effort that resulted in the death of superman, comes off as blind luck. That's quite unsatisfactory.
