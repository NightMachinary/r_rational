Tragedy has been an accepted form of story-telling for ages. Stories don't need optimistic to have a good conclusion.

I don't want to speak for the author, but the bad feeling you get from the ending might be completely intended. The ending is saddening, /because/ Superman's full potential wasn't realized. And as you can see from the other comments, not everyone is convinced that Luthor did the wrong thing.
