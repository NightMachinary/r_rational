Thanks. I guess I've been kind of shying away from the conclusion that killing him was the right thing to do, because the notion that that's the case elicits in me a pretty visceral disgust. That's partly due to the loss of potential good, but there's probably a pretty substantial irrational component to the reaction as well.
