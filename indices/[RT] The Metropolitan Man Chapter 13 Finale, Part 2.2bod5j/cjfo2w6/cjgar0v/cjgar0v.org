Sure, I think enough time has passed that I won't really be influencing anyone's reading of the story too much.

It depends. I mean, set aside for the moment all of the bad things that Lex does, and the ways that he pushes Clark closer to snapping, and just think about the [[http://www.nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.html]["existential risk"]] part of things.

Superman is an existential risk to humanity, given his power levels as presented in this fic. If we take that as a given, then the real question comes down to percentages. Lex says that if the risk is one in a thousand, that's the equivalent of two million people dead, but that's a simplification, since /all people/ dying is more than twice as bad as /half of the people/ dying, given that humanity would be ended forever and we place an enormously high value on humanity continuing to exist in some form, and existential risks don't allow for do-overs. So I think that Lex has a point there, and it's not entirely unreasonable to kill someone who poses such a large risk to humanity as a whole.

/However/, Superman also /lowers/ total existential risk, even as he raises it just by existing. He could stop an asteroid impact with ease, give a massive boost to space colonization, solve an enormous amount of problems, and stop nuclear war (which wasn't really a concern at the time this story took place).

The story is a tragedy, and it's got a bleak ending, but while Lex was at least in part motivated by an animal fear, that doesn't mean that he was necessarily wrong to do what he did. Hopefully the ending properly hits that note - you could argue it either way. It's a sad ending either way, I think, because even if you agree that Superman presented an unacceptable risk to humanity, you still sort of want to believe in him. If it weren't for the fact that an unhappy ending had been foreshadowed quite a bit, a "happy" ending where Superman puts a stop to Luthor's schemes and forms a partnership with him wouldn't have been too terribly unbelievable.

So I don't agree with Lex, in the sense that he's an amoral murderer. But if this were real life and he were in the news for killing Superman, I might argue on reddit that I could see where he was coming from when he did it, even if it makes me sad.

Hopefully that's not too much of an answer.
