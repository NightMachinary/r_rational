Great story, Ben, congratulations! I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.

Anyone else very conscious of how big a loose end Mercy is, though? I was more than half-expecting her to feature in the last few paragraphs in some twisty way.

She's a funny character. It seems I suppose, if I'm going to be critical, slightly unrealistic that Lex would have such a loyal, dependable, and implacable robot, ah, assistant who didn't crack all the way through to the end. I liked her though :P
