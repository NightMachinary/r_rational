This story had been brewing for a while, and in the very early plot sketches, Mercy got revealed to be something other - another Kryptonian, a secret identity for Wonder Woman, Raven, or something like that at an appropriately dramatic moment (and in an appropriately dramatic way, with plenty of foreshadowing that doesn't actually exist in the text). But while I kind of liked that twist, the story needed a pretty tight focus on just the three main characters (Lex, Lois, Superman) and so I just left her as this enigma, which hopefully works well enough.

Aside from never having full insight into Jor-El and the Kryptonians (a scene that I cut because it didn't really add all that much), she's the biggest question that goes unanswered. Hopefully that works - you never get inside her head, and she never really expresses herself, but ... if there was a scene where Mercy was walking down a dark alley and some thug started to approach her, you wouldn't be /entirely/ surprised if she quickly and efficiently dealt with him, or cast unnatural shadows behind her before revealing her True Form. But the story isn't about her, so she'll remain as this mystery that sits at the periphery of the plot. Maybe she's just very good at her job.
