Oh man, there were like ... four different cliffhanger endings that I was ready with, but I really wanted to avoid people messaging me about when I was planning on writing the sequel (because the answer to that is "whenever I get struck with an idea that I really like", which isn't really satisfactory). The short versions of the cliffhanger endings, in order of how likely I was to use them:

- Mercy and Lex are in his study, which has been renovated. Lex is reading from the Metropolis papers, while Mercy is sifting through the ones from other cities. As she's reading the Gotham City newspaper, she tells Lex that there's a masked vigilante there. Lex doesn't think this is worth his attention until Mercy reads that there are reports of the vigilante somehow creating constructs out of hard, green light. (Which would set up Green Lantern Batman for the sequel, with a layered conflict between Wayne Industries and LexCorp and an introduction to the wider galaxy.)
- Luthor connects in with the spaceship's "brain" and gets some information from Jor-El. It would probably have to be set years later, but I liked the idea of one of the computing pioneers getting their hands on ridiculously advanced technology (Alan Turing, shortly after publishing a paper on his novel "Turing machines" gets introduced to a ridiculously advanced computer). Jor-El gets bypassed, and the fic ends on "Welcome to the Brainiac system - what would you like to know?" (It never made it in the story, but Krypton was doomed by the Brainiac system - UFAI that shut down the species without them really realizing it. That was a thought I had when watching /Man of Steel/ and hearing that all of their many colonies had died on the vine. Three times, it's enemy action.)
- Mercy makes an uncharacteristic request for time off, which Lex readily grants. She goes down to the docks of New York City and boards a ship that has all female sailors, and the final words we hear are that they're sailing back to Themyscira. (Probably raises a few too many questions about what her motivations actually are - why she would help Lex, what she actually feels, etc. and would need to have just a touch more foreshadowing. I also worry that it would destroy some of the grounding of the story - introducing more of the metahuman DC universe might make it feel less like the real world)
- Someone shows up (Supergirl, Zod, Darkseid). Probably too bleak of an ending, given how fucked the world would be - I would probably have had to change current ending around to be more optimistic in order to allow for that to be acceptable. And the ending is already pretty damn bleak.
