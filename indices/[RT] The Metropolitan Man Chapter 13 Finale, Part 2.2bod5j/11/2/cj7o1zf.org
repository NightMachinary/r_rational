Mercy is one of Luthor's contingencies. Her insight and intelligence are his final fallback. A brilliant masterstroke doesn't have to be an obvious one, carried out by a stone-faced Luthor sitting a million miles away.

One of Luthor's limits is he is a single man who can only be in one place at one time- the obvious step to avoid this, is to have reliable agents who will act and think on your own behalf. Superman gambled everything on his own actions and limits- Luthor gambled on his plus his agent's. Paying her salary and training her for the past X years was his investment, and this was the payoff.

The true mark of brilliance is not knowing and planning everything down to the last variable; it's realizing A. you can't do that, and then B. having fallbacks for when those variables fly in your face. Mercy is that fallback.
