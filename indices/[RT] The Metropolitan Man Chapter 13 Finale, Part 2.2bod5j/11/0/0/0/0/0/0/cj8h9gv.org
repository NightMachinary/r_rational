Make no mistake, I still think that it's an exceedingly well done story. And yes, Luthor may well have done the right thing.

But still, for a story to project a hopeful vision stretching into the future, only for it to be stripped away...I just don't see the point of it in this case. Tragedy for tragedy's sake. I don't like that.

If Luthor had killed Superman because it was obvious at that point that Superman couldn't possibly live up to our expectations, I'd have been fine with that. Of course, I'd have been even happier with an ending that showed a triumphant image of what Superman could be.

Both solid endings. One showing the futility of the idea of Superman, that one person having so much power is doomed to failure, and instead we can only do the best we can as human beings. The other showing the possibility that Superman can prevail, that it's alright to believe in your heroes. To end it ambiguously like this, I think, just weakens the message, whatever it was intended to be.
