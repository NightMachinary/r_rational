I disagree that your interpretation of the story is the intended one. The author seems to be purposefully avoiding clarification about those topics. He outright says in his comment that he won't answer direct questions about interpretation. As other comments have stated, I believe it's blatantly left unclear whether Luthor was right. All we know as a fact is that Luthor won, not that he was correct. We're not given a direct vision of a dying world held in the grip by a mad Superman, space rubble. We're simply given Superman's final word that he's maturing and has a head on things, countered with Luthor's complete dedication to removing the Superman as a threat.

Luthor gets more talk time because his view on things is what's on display in this story. "Superman can be a good guy and help the world!" as been discussed and heard a million times over the decades.

I do agree that it missed out on dipping into Reconstruction; doubly sad that it clearly KNEW it could with Superman's final resolution to help in the most useful ways imaginable. But this Luthor was consistent from the beginning- reading up to this point, I would not expect to see this Luthor EVER accept a truce and/or alliance with Superman, and that held true. Luthor's character, as written, kept this from ever having a real shot at Reconstruction.
