It's a story that ultimately say that it's wrong to believe in Superman. And while that does make sense...I really wish it had ended more optimistically. Destruction wasn't a foregone conclusion if Superman lived; Superman very well could've lead the world into a brighter future. If you're gonna write a story with this sort of moral, it doesn't seem right for things to seem so very hopeful up until the last minute.

Deconstructions are all well and good, but it burns me that we were so close to going beyond that, but didn't. More than just deconstruction, there could have been reconstruction. Tear Superman apart and show him for all his flaws. Then, at the point where it seems foolhardy to believe in Superman, turn around and build things back up. Show us that, just maybe, he can be the hero that we always wanted him to be.

Is that an unrealistic expectation, a ridiculous moral? In practice, maybe. But in principle...sometimes things can turn out for the better.
