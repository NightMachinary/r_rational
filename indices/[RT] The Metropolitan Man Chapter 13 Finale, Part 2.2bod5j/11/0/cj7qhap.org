It's almost definitely that way by design. It's a downer ending, because the whole thing is a tragedy. Luthor has his flaws, and Superman has this whole speech about how Luthor is really driven by his fears rather than cold emotion. And you get this whole bright future stretching out in front of you as you realize that Superman really is offering a truce, only to have it snatched from your hands and smashed to the ground.

Luthor wins, but it's not clean or pretty, and from how he repeats to Mercy twice that it was the right thing to do you get the sense that he's trying to convince himself. I maybe would have liked for it to be more explicit than it was, but I don't think I'm reading that much into things there.

If it had simply been a masterstroke by Luthor, you might have felt that he was right to have done it. The way it played out, the reader is denied the satisfaction of seeing Luthor win, and that adds to the bad taste that the ending is supposed to leave in your mouth - which is probably why the whole story ends with a man laying at the bottom of a deep hole with a broken leg and nothing but certain death.

If the story had ended with Superman offering a way out and Lex accepting, then an epilogue about how they made the world a better place ... well, I think it was obvious that we weren't headed anywhere happy.
