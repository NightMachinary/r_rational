Now what I'd like to see: post end plot twist, superman's father/designer actually prepared for this contingency. Fusing the engineered organism of Superman with kryptonite only triggers the second layer of the plan, elaborated in case the original plan fails. In this second plan, Superman becomes one with the planet, and reaches his full potential as a quasi omniscient and omnipotent being, becoming some sort of oracle and source of magic for a selected few who will drive humanity forward.

Then Lex becomes Voldemort and everything goes awry again...
