I might take that line out, since I think you're probably right that it's obvious enough. Calibrating how much explanation is required is very difficult - the previous chapter included a line where Superman says that his spaceship is in the Arctic, which was meant to be an obvious lie to test Lois's reaction (and the flow of information), but that wasn't obvious /enough/. It's fairly likely that I'll do an editing pass and remove both of those.

Fanfiction.net keeps docs in the manager for 90 days, after which you have to go through this tedious process of reuploading from the fic itself - so I'll wait for more reviews to come through in order to identify the problems and then make the editing pass within a month. I'll keep in mind what you said about Chapter 10. I do agree there's a slump at some point, but don't really know exactly what's causing it.
