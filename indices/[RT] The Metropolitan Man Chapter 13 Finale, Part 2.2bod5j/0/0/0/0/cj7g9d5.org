Define near future. I have some original stuff that I need to finish up, but I'm not sure whether I want to serialize any of it. Not making it serial means the whole thing would be released as a lump sum a few months down the road - serializing would mean that the first chapter would be up in a few weeks. I haven't really decided which one I'm going to be working on, but it's either:

  *The Timewise Tales*

  Fantasy. The world is one giant stable time loop, and some people can traverse it with varying degrees of ease. Follows: Ellebeth, a coffee shop girl who gets stuck in a patchwork city following one of the time storms; Wendel, her boyfriend, who vows to reunite with her; Issah, a scholar who has seen his fate and wants to avoid it. First draft is complete at 90K words, but it needs serious editing and some plot tweaks.

Or ...

  *The Wayward Souls*

  Fantasy. Detective Jan-Fong dies, and two hundred years later his soul gets put into a new body so that he can help solve the attempted murder of the king. It's a fish out of water story that takes place in a pseudo-Chinese setting, with a lot of focus on souls - which actually exist and are readily apparent as this white glob that falls from your mouth when you die. First draft is at 46K words - I know what the end looks like, but I'm having trouble with the connective tissue.

Or ...

#+begin_quote
  *Vampire, Wizard, Robot*

  Fantasy. Set in 1970s New York City, where vampires have the headquarters of their new world government. The story follows some young wizards, the last of an ancient order, as they combine arcane knowledge with computer science to make robots that will hopefully beat the undead. First draft is at 20K words, meaning it's got the longest time to completion.

One of those three, but I haven't decided which, or whether I'd want to write it all as one lump sum or split it into chapters to post once a week (or faster). I'd appreciate any feedback on which of those sounds most compelling - my hope is to actually get one of them published in dead tree format at some point, and that means looking at marketability.
