I need to do an editing pass within the next month to fix a few fairly minor problems. After that, I might put it up on AO3 just to have it in a second place. All my near-future projects are original, which means that ff.net isn't the place for it anyway - right now, I'm thinking that if I serialize any of it, it'll be go to Fiction Press, AO3, and the Wordpress website that my wife is graciously setting up for me.

(Legal differences basically don't mean anything to me, as far as fan fiction goes. I don't own the rights to Superman, and barring me being contacted by someone from DC, it's highly unlikely that I could ever make any money from it or get it into wider distribution than "for free online". Nor do I really care whether people do their own remixing, translating, etc. I highly doubt that I would get sued, especially since I'd instantly comply with any demands that a rights-holder made, no matter how unreasonable.)
