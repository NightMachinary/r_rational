And that's the end. I'm submitting this one late at night after editing took longer than I thought, so hopefully I haven't missed anything too major and the number of spelling/grammar errors will be low. If you've got any questions that aren't matters of interpretation, I'd be happy to answer them either here or in a potential epilogue. I tried to think of everything, but sometimes it just didn't get put into the text because I didn't think anyone needed to have three paragraphs of Superman talking about how he stole a piece of kryptonite from a research lab.

Edit: And thank you so much to whoever gave me gold for this post! Also for all the comments over the last two months, and the help with fixing typos!
