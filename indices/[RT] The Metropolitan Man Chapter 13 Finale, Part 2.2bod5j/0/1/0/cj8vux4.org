I just realized that I never answered this question. Sorry about that.

At the end of the story, Lex has a huge number of research facilities, a super suit, a spaceship, and possibly some samples from Superman's corpse (it should be assumed that an autopsy was conducted while the body was surrounded by kryptonite, but I didn't really want to lose the narrative focus by making that explicit).

The research facilities go to work on all sorts of areas, with a preference towards those areas that can help lay the groundwork for future science or multiply labor. That means agricultural research, engineering, materials science, and communications. Beyond that, he'd put a heavy focus on getting into space as quickly as possible, since the existence of Superman implies the existence of other aliens (though the fact that this is the first time in a very, very long time that an alien has visited earth means that there's some breathing room). Atomic research is a focus, both nuclear weapons and nuclear power, especially given that other people are bound to be following those paths. Same goes for cryptography, which eventually leads to computing.

But most of that would get delegated to other people, since Lex has a bunch of stuff that he needs to keep very careful about sharing - the Kryptonian technology. It's got a working computer that wasn't actually shorted out (Superman lied about that for his own reasons) which can be used to communicate with Jor-El, materials that are foreign to Earth, the ability to slide through space at higher than light speed using the Phantom Drive, the creche that was used to fabricate baby Superman (and also the suit), and some other stuff like the sensors used to gather data about the planet. Much of it has been intentionally limited, but some of it can be reverse engineered. Lex would go about this carefully, and not share any of the technological advancements unless he was certain that they wouldn't lead to some other dangerous technology (balanced against the need to get humans onto a second and third planet as fast a possible).

I hope that's a complete enough answer for you.
