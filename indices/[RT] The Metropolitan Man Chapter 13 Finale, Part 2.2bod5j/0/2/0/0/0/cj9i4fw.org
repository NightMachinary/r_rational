A few reasons:

First, geography in the DC universe has always been a little bit screwy, so the exact location of Metropolis and Bludhaven is up for debate (and never made clear in the story, especially since Bludhaven is only mentioned by name once). Most of the time, Bludhaven is somewhere in New Jersey or possibly Delaware, but it's supposed to be adjacent to Gotham City, and I'd decided that was taking the place of Chicago (because in the DC universe as it's usually presented, Metropolis is more or less where New York City is, Gotham City is where New York City is, and New York City itself still exists - which means that there are three very large cities that are basically right on top of each other, and the audience is just expected to not think about that too much). Depending on the exact location of Floyd's hole and Bludhaven itself, the flight path didn't need to come all that close to it.

Second, I guess I never made it explicit, but I always thought of Superman's x-ray vision as something that he could turn on and off. This fic owes a lot to Tom De Haven's /It's Superman!/ which describes Clark as feeling his eyes go gummy when he uses x-ray vision or heat vision - as if there's some brief physiological change going on when he exercises it. /Most of the time/ he doesn't use it, and there wouldn't be a real reason to while in transit from Metropolis to the prison. (Note that he says "What do you think it would look like to my x-ray vision" instead of "what do you think it would look like to my eyes".) I figure most of his spare time in transit would be spent listening in on conversations instead of watching the ground beneath him. He's treated as though he has total information awareness by other characters, but that's mostly because he's a mystery to them.
