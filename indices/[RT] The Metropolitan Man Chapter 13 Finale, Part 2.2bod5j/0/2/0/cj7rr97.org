The kryptonite was put into the lead panels and then shipped to Metropolis for installment during the renovation. Lex doesn't discover kryptonite until after Superman has dropped into full-time Clark Kent mode (where he was waiting for his nemesis to make a move), and since the research facilities in Bl√ºdhaven and Dos Rios are beyond the horizon, Clark never saw them, since he spent most of his time either keeping a careful eye on Metropolis (mostly Lois, who was a likely target for his nemesis), or delivering stuff to Floyd.

So Superman doesn't learn about kryptonite until after some random guy walks past him, at which point it becomes incredibly obvious to his eyes, but by that point the new lead panels have already been put in, so the only way for him to know that they have kryptonite in them is to figure out that this is the sort of precaution that Lex would take. Lex also has a convenient excuse for the renovation lined up; he got word from a source within Wayne Industries that they had made a breakthrough in non-x-ray imaging (which is of course a piece of disinformation that he fed to himself).

Hope that answers the question to your satisfaction.
