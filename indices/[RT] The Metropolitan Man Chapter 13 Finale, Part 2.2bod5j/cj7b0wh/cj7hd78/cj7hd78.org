Idunno, it seems pretty clear that Lex made the right call.

Supes was already starting a 'super-prison'. His psychology and neurology seems to be mostly human, so that's in all probability the start of a slippery slope. How easy is it to start just taking more and more power, once you put yourself in a position of authority like that?

How long before Superman puts /most/ of the people he catches into superprison? How long until he uses it as the solution to all his problems? Nobody can stop him, and he's already pretty much implicitly declared himself above the law. Hell, he's doing it /for our own good./

How long until Supes stops being a vigilante, and starts just being a dictator, putting anybody who disagrees with him into superprison for life?
