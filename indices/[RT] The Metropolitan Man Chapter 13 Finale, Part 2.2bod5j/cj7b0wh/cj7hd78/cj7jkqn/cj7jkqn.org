A slippery slope that I think he had well in hand. Luthor had done so many bad things, was Superman's only threat, and he still wouldn't have imprisoned him if he agreed to cooperate. There are very few if any other people that Superman would choose to imprison, especially with Lois supporting him. It was wrong to imprison Floyd, but on the whole Superman still seemed far more ready to do good than evil.
