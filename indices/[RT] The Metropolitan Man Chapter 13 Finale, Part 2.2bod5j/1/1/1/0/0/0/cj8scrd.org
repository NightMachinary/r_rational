Look, not /every/ action is an existential risk. You're being silly and taking extremes of my argument that are wildly off course.

Yeah, science in general is gonna pretty much inevitably lead to scary stuff. But with any hope and a lot of carefulness, we can /see the risks ahead of time/ and mitigate them by creating defenses and counters to all the bad stuff. Or hopefully evolving our society to something that doesn't use bad stuff so much.

And in general, hazy future probabilities that might produce existential risks are a /lot/ less important than a single, extant, and /capable/ threat like Supes was. The only thing holding him back was /his choices./ And he was /very/ much basic-human in terms of psychology in a number of ways.

Superman's probability of being a threat was rising higher and higher. There were /way/ too many paths he could have taken to going bad, and those paths were each /not all that unlikely to happen./ Lex could see the risk of that ahead of time, and he chose to mitigate it by the only means he had.
