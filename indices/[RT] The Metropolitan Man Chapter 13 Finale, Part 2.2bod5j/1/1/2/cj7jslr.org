Yep, I bet there's been lots of revolutionaries aspiring to be rulers in history who surely had good intentions, but not a single of them has turned out to be nowhere near as good after being absolute power. Instead, most of them have become the kind of corrupted dictators we know many examples of. There's nothing saying Superman is any different from them, especially after the kind of behavior he's exhibited.
