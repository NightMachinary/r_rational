You don't think there are a lot of Willie Calhouns out there? A lot of people like those rapists? A lot of foul murderers and psychopaths?

And what about the world leaders who commit horrendous sins against their people? What about the warlords, the violent cult leaders. Not to mention /Gotham's/ villains, and all the rest of the earth-origin'd DC supervillains, if and when they start showing up.

Deadshot's sitting in the superprison, being a nice little bundle of no problems whatsoever. How many criminals do you think supes is gonna handle, how big of a problem do they have to make themselves in comparison, before Supes decides that he has better things to do than chase down the same petty criminals again and again?

He's already broken three times, for criminals who weren't the /worst/ that humanity has to offer by a long way. He'll break again, sooner or later. And each time he does, it'll get a little easier for him to break again.
