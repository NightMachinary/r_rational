Moral people like Lex Luthor? :P

I think it's too big of a risk for too little of a reward, since we're probably gonna get relatively close to a similar boost with Lex disassembling the Kryptonian spaceship (and probably doing tests on a few samples of super-hamburger) for fun and profit.

Supes could only be in one place at a time, no matter how fast he could move between places. Ultimately, the technology he brought with him was always gonna end up being a bigger boon to humanity than whatever services he could offer. We lose a bit by losing him, but we don't lose all that much overall. And it alleviates a /huge/ risk.
