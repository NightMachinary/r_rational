Yes, but it's still the life of one man who has done many reprehensible things, against the lives of millions that could be helped through such measures. Luthor had pushed and pushed and pushed Superman to his very limits, and that's why he got the treatment he got. Had Superman gone on to live another 100 years, the number of people who'd go as far as Luthor did against him would be utterly negligible.

He had a few kinks to work out, but on the whole Superman was a very moral person. And if dealing with all the horror he dealt with in his year of crimefighting didn't cause him to snap, it's not too likely that anything else would cause it.

...the mere risk of Superman going rogue puts Luthor more in the right, yes. But the risk was small enough that I very much wanted to put my faith in Superman.
