To be honest, I'm fairly certain Lex made the wrong call - as Superman suggested, probably because of motivated cognition.

Superman was, effectively, working for Lex in order to maximize utility. Unless Lex really thinks Superman was working anywhere close to his maximum QALY output, I think it's clear the benefits outweigh the risks here. (Heck, Lex himself is working in nuclear power!)

Worse still, Superman's existence implies highly advanced aliens - with Supes himself as the only weapon we have that could come /close/ - unless Lex is going to singlehandedly create the singularity over a century early, which seems ... unlikely.
