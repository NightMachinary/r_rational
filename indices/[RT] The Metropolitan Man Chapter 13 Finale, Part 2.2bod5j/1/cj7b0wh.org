I love this ending. Its wonderfully hazy as to whether Lex was right. He judged that if Superman ever snapped then the world could end, but didn't counter balance this with the good Superman could do. Was he right? In this story, Superman does kill one person and leave another in a hole in a ground. He is not necessarily to be trusted. But Lex does spend a lot of life to find a way to kill Superman. Utilitarian calculation are always quite scary (and often the hallmarks of a villain) when handled by humans in particular.

Loved the writing of this, and I think the ending is as good as it can be.
