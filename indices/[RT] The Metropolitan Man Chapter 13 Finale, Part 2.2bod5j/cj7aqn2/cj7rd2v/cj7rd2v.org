One is tempted to ask why Superman overlooked putting Kryptonite in the lead walls. After all, this involves a moving a fairly large amount of something bright as sun into Lex's house and sudden vanishing of it.

One can argue that Superman isn't able to overlook this even if he tried to; Kryptonite just is too noticeable.

I'm not that person I'm referring to; I'm playing a Devil's advocate here. But still, I would be interested in some handwaving addressing this.

PS. I greatly enjoyed your work. The characters are intelligent, interactions are believable, both Luthor and Superman look like people who belong at LW meetups, and I still unsure about Bad/Good Guys of the story, which is something you were clearly aimed to achieve --- and succeeded.
