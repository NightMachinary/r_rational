Maybe a good epilogue would be a conversation between Jor El and Luthor on their respective visions for the world? The whole technological advancement thing is somewhat ominous, given that the whole theme is that one man having unlimited power is dangerous for the world.

So my question would be what sort of technological advancement would Luthor pursue? Is the world going from having a moral but apathetic superhero caring for it from an immoral involved supervillain?
