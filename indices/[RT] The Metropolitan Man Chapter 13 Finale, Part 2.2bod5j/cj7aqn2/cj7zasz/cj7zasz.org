A minor typo: you have "affect positive change" instead of "effect".

Anyway, I loved the story! I've read and enjoyed all the work on your FF account so far. I think you're really good at nailing this type of fiction.

Something else: have you consider publishing to AO3 (archive of our own) as well? As far as I can see, it's a strictly better ff.net (one that I don't have as much frustration with on mobile). I would like to hear others' opinions on it though; I don't know much of the, say, legal differences (if any).
