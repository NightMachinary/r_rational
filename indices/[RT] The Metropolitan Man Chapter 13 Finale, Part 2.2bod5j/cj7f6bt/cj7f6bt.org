Damn, that was a downer ending.

Having read the whole thing now, I have to register the complaint that Lex Luthor is completely unrealistic as a character. He seems not to have any emotions, he's too robotic, too Vulcan. I don't think people like him exist.

That said, I don't think it's completely impossible for a person like him to ever exist, so suspension of disbelief is mostly intact. However, I'd have liked him to have a bit more flavor than simply "ruthless pessimistic utilitarian optimizer".
