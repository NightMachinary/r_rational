Right, so enhancement metals, weird esoteric abilities that we largely don't know anything about. Probably very useful for hacking magic systems, but not that interesting in isolation.

As per usual, I am filling in some of the gaps in what the metals do. Specifically, feruchemic aluminium letting you use other peoples metalminds is speculated on in the books, but never confirmed.

The ability to burn away metals outside a persons stomach is never seen on page, but it is confirmed to be canon through author comments.
