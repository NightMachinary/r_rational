*Mistborn Munchkinry Miniseries Part 9: Aluminium and Chromium*

Ok, week nine of the mistborn munchkinry miniseries, for a general overview of the magic system, see [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9zz4sa/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ead595h/][part one]]. I strongly recommend reading the first part of that comment if you weren't here for the past weeks and aren't familiar with the mistborn setting. Parts 2 through 8 can be found here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a23pe3/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/eauwn90/][2]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a4be9x/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ebcx4eg/][3]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a6ftyl/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ebuo08h/][4]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a8lgsu/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ecbqhr8/][5]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/af85cz/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/edw9q7a/][6]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ahmsgc/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/eefzs0m/][7]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ak1kjr/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ef0o7jj/][8]].

/Spoiler note/: I will avoid things that I consider excessive spoilers, but the exact workings of the magic system are moderate spoilers themselves, so if you intend to read the books and are sensitive to spoilers you should probably skip this one.

This week we start with the enhancement metals. Since these metals are more obscure and limited in what they do and what we know about them I will tackle them in two groups of two, this week we'll take a look at Aluminium and Chromium. As always we're interested in what a aluminium or chromium twinborn compounder can do, both here on earth (where they are the only one with this powerset) and in Era 2 Scadrial.

Chromiums feruchemic half is problematic for this miniseries as we don't really have any idea what it is supposed to do, all we know is that it stores "Fortune" (which is a cosmere specific term that is distinct from luck) and one character uses a power that is similar to feruchemic chromium to routinely be in the right place at the right time. I know I've filled in gaps in our knowledge of powers in the past, but this really isn't a lot to go on so I'm going to skip this one.

*Allomancy*

Allomantically aluminium burns away metals (and foreign investiture, but that is less relevant without considering other magic systems) inside the allomancers body. As soon as the allomancer starts burning aluminium, any metal that is inside their body starts to vanish rapidly.

The tiny flakes of metal that allomancers like to swallow in order to use their powers are small enough that they vanish pretty much instantly, while larger things like the oversized piercings that some feruchemists use as metalminds might take a few seconds. Notably, the aluminium that is being burned is not exempt from this effect, meaning that you can only really burn it in short bursts.

There is a niche use case for aluminium in that a full mistborn can use it to prove to an opponent with a bronze allomancer on hand that they are unarmed (or for said opponent to force them to disarm themselves), but otherwise aluminiums allomantic side is considered to be of little value to the user.

Chromiums allomantic power is identical to that of aluminium, except chromium burns away metal inside another person. This effect requires the allomancer to be touching their target, but otherwise there is no way for the target to defend themselves against it. Because chromium does not affect the allomancer themselves it can be burned for longer periods of time if larger pieces of metal need to be burned away.

Both powers only work on metals and alloys in their metalic forms, metal atoms inside other molecules don't count (so you can't, say, burn all of the iron out of someones blood) and in the case of piercings you only burn away the parts of the metal that are inside the body.

*Feruchemy*

Feruchemically, aluminium allows you to store Identity. Identity in this context is another cosmere specific term. It is kind of like the cosmere equivalent of a soul (except that there are at least three other things that could qualify as the cosmere equivalent of a soul), but for our purposes the most relevant aspect it is that Identity is what prevents people from using other people's metalminds.

The way this works is that each persons investiture (magic) is infused with their identity, when you try to use another persons metalmind the two Identities clash and this prevents the magic from doing its thing.

When an aluminium feruchemists is storing Identity, their investiture seizes to be linked to them. This allows the feruchemist to use metalminds that were created by other feruchemists, though they still can't use metalminds of metals that they aren't able to store themselves (with one notable exception that will become relevant next week). So an aluminium feruchemist would only be able to use other people's aluminiumminds, but a full feruchemist storing aluminium is able to use any metalmind.

Similarly, when a feruchemist storing Identity fills another metalmind at the same time, that metalmind is not tied to their Identity (because they didn't have on at the time), creating what is known as an unkeyed metalmind. Unkeyed metalminds can be used by any feruchemist that is normally able to use metalminds of that type.

Tapping identity (your own or someone else's) doesn't do a whole lot that we know of, it might do some weird things when interacting with other magic systems, but for our purposes the only useful bit is that you become slightly more resistant to soothing and rioting.
