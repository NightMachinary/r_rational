Yeah, overthrowing a religion is tricky. Because even if you got, say, the pope to say "pachinkle" all the time, or something, people would just assume the pope was sick/etc and it wouldn't shake the religion.

I didn't have anything particular in mind for any of the goals: I GM and my modus operandi is "set up a big challenge, make sure you account for everything, and because there's four of them and one of you they'll think of something you didn't anticipate^{*".} So I figured someone here might be able to think of something.

^{*} once my players found themselves locked in a vampire base and set off the alarm by accident. all hell was about to break loose on them. they worked out they could /set a werewolf PC on fire/ and because the werewolf battle form soaks damage, the werewolf had a healing power, and fire does a surprisingly small amount of damage, they had enough time to run the werewolf up the main corridor, frenzy all the vampires, and have the non-werewolf PCs flee out the front door which the demon werewolf would break down. Fortunately it was based on a real place in the city we lived so there was actually a nearby pond that the werewolf was able to jump into to put the fire out. I had no idea how they were going to get out of it before they had that idea, I was going to have to have the BBEG imprison them and hope they could figure out a way out...
