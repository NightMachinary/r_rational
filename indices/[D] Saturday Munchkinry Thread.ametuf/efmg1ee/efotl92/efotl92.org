To ruin a religion cursing the religious leader into wanting to ruin their religion might work. though its not a very small curse.\\
maybe you can curse the religious leader whith something smaller that doesn't go away unless they ruin their religion , or that makes them think they need to ruin it .\\
getting the the pope to say "pachinkle" all the time would .getting the pope to actively try say things(and take decisions) that can potentially destabilize the religion .

The pope is probably not a good example since catholic Christianity is more difficult to ruin than smaller and newer religions , and if you just want to ruin any religion there are probably easier targets.
