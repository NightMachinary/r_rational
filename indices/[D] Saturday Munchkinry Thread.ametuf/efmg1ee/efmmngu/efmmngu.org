Curse a religious leader to always act according to the mandates of whatever religion his followers believe they're following. (Worded this way so it also captures that Satanist megachurch, almost all of whose followers believe they're Christians despite no mention of God, Jesus or any other Christian figure ever being mentioned during the preaching hour, except maybe in commercial breaks).

In simpler terms, the leader must act according to what their followers think they should believe in.
