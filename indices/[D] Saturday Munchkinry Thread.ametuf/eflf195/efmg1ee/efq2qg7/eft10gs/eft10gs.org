I'm not sure this can be exploited, for the simple reason that this is a superpower that already exists in real life. If anything, the real life version is stronger since you don't have to suppress your own emotions. Some people are just really good at reading facial expressions and body language, while most people are terrible at controlling those same expressions to stop themselves from giving away their emotions.

At best, this superpower would be slightly useful for detecting spies and infiltrators who are trained to control their expressions. But those same spies would probably be trained to control their emotions as well so even if you can see what emotions they feel, that might not give anything away.
