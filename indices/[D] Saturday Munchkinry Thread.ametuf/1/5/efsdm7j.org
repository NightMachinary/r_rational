  Cursing someone to essentially be in constant pain doesn't sound like the smallest curse you can put on someone, though! (Also, plenty of people have chronic back pain, and unless they were, like, athletes or something, their lives remain pretty un-ruined).

Cursing someone's inner ears to randomly expand and contract would be very debilitating.

​

Overthrow a religion is harder; if you could curse a position or item instead of person you could make minor phenomena that would cause a lack of trust. I.E. Curse the Pope to make the devil appear on whatever he's wearing or make all crosses turn upside down. Or curse a cleric to project the image of Allah every time he opens his mouth, or curse the Kaaba to flash pictures of pigs randomly or make pig noises.

​

Politics is easier and much harder. Become someone in the line of succession [hard], and then curse the Oval office or the President to make infrasound.
