Ruin someone's life can be accomplished with a small gas lighting curse that makes them perceive things slightly differently every day.

Not sure how the others are supposed to work when you can only apply a small curse on one person. You can curse a leader, but they would just retire or get deposed, and presumably you can't just curse a religious leader with "no one believes you" to overthrow the religion since that's a really overpowered curse that messes with the minds of everyone who hears the person you curse. You could try "constantly act suspiciously" to get a somewhat similar effect, but that just seems to lead to the deposed outcome.

I suppose for ruling people you could try a curse "obeys any order given by a person whose name is X", where X is your own name. The curse is small in the sense that it has no effect on the curse target until you give them an order, but that still seems like a pretty big curse.
