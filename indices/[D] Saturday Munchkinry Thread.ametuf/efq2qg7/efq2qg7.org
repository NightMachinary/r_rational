To what extent could the ability to feel someone else's emotions be exploited ?

The built-in limitations are that the target must be seen (it works through recorded images, including still pictures, and to some extent it works through sufficiently accurate descriptions of such pictures ; but then it only gives the emotions that were felt at that time), and the perceived emotions are added to instead of substituting for the abled individual - so you can only get an accurate read if you are yourself suppressing efficiently your own emotions.

What could be achievable using this ability, apart from the obvious options (becoming a rich dominatrix or a wildly successful psychotherapist, or both) ? Also, let's stay within a reasonable ethical range of actions (no coopting the insecurity of desperate people to rope them into a world-dominating cult, please).
