No, this is just a short news article from a journalist's perspective on the series pilot. FIO is its own thing, and not the only [[/r/rational][r/rational]] MLP fanfic out there. I can list two more off the top of my head: Sassaflash the Necromancer (inexact title, rational protagonist in a Lovecraft pastiche) and The Celestia Code trilogy.
