I have completed the reading of the chapter and have come to tell you all the results.

It's ok I guess. One major complaint is that sometimes it is hard to tell from whose viewpoint the story is being told, at the beginning mostly switches between previously established Mimnay people from where our main protag is coming from, and the new Northerner Lands commander.

A minor refresher as to what is happening in story with all the plot threads and all the characters would be neat too.
