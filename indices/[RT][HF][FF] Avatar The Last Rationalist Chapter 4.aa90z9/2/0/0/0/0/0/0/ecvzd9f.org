Would all the exposition need to be given to reader immediately? Part of the information could be boring and not so relevant and you could just let the MC have a degree of understanding about the world after the talk so he doesn't have to be surprised about everything. Could say Gran Gran told him about a basic thing behind the scenes when a basic thing appears. So the exposition wouldn't have to be that long, but the character could still know some things.
