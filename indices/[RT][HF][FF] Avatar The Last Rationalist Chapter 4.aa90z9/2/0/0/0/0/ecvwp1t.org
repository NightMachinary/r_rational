Heh, I'm only planning to write stuff myself. Don't take me as any kind of authority. ;)

These just feel so... small, but important bits that they shouldn't be all littered throughout the fic. I think you could have a paragraph or a chapter where the MC would have "the talk" with folks he finds, trying to make sense where he is and either spam them there or just say they talked about all these issues and he decided he is not in Kansas anymore and call it a day.

I'll still read this either way. It just feels like characters are often not curious at all to actually solve things when they find a friend and could ask all these questions.

On the other hand, it could well fit the character to be very disoriented and not thinking coherently yet, as he just had a heart attack and was thawed out of ice. Icy brains not good. If he was coherent, first priority before even figuring out where he is could well be exploring his newfound powers. I'd forgive him for any weird thinking right now.

edit: And I'm mostly talking about him figuring out where he is and who he is and what kind of world he is in. Especially what is this magic everyone is using. The whole translation machine/magic thingy probably needs more exploring anyway and he can't get straight answers to that from them.

But it's your story, you do you.
