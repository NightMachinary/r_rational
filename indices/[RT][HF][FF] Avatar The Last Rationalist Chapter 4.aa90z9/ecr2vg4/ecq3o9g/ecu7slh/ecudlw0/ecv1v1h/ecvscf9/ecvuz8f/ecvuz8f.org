I thought about that, but then there was the issue of decimals when converting between units. If there were different units throughout the nations then I think people might start to notice the translation service when it translates units.

A) One solution would be to have only two systems of units. One for the Earth Kingdom and the other for the Fire Nation. The water tribes will use the Earth Kingdom's by default since they side with them. I'll make the conversion simple like 2 FN units = 1 EK units = .745 meters (I'll make it more exotic for Aang's units).

B) The other is to just make it so that everyone in the world uses the same units of measurement and only Aang can hear the measurement conversions since he expects it to be different. I could say 1 world unit = .745 meters or something like that.

Honestly it's a fight between convenience and realism I guess. Let me know what you think and thanks for commenting!
