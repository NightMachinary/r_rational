On a note from a conversation with [[/u/GabeRocking]], what are some of the more obnoxious premises for stories?

Trekie already mentioned one, the evil corporation premise, and that one bothers me a lot, but another one that annoys me a bit more, is the "radioactive spider" premise of spider man. Not that the spider gives magical powers, but that the company wouldn't realize it works on real people at some point down the line.
