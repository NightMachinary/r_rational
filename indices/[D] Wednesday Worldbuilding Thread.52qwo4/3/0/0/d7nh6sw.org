Interesting! Because in the origin stories of the movies like S1-3 and The Amazing Spiderman, the companies could have replicated the testing, like the loose spider bite from the original, that spider never got out to have babies, or never bit other people? (it's been a while. don't remember if the corp finds the spider and returns it to its cage or not). In the Amazing Spiderman, at one point part of the whole plot was the fact that spidey's dad had made the radioactive spider stuff.

I would love to go back and rewatch those movies to look at the premises of each and compare them with the actual comics origin stories.
