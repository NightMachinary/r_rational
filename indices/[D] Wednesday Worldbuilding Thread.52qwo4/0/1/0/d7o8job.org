I've heard of stories where superheroes are celebrities, but never read/seen any, but I am familiar with stories where characters' special abilities require infrastructure to support them, like Ghost in the Shell. I want to leave the mechanics of powers open to whoever decides to use this setting, I'm no writer, so I just imagine the world having as much weirdness as any superhero comic.
