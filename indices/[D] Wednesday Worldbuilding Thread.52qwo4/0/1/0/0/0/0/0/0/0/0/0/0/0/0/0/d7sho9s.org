I wanted to keep powers vague since I don't intend to write the story, their sources could range from taking drugs to magic rituals to really expensive gadgets. The government allowed the infrastructure to be built in the first place as part of regular R&D, and outright nationalizing it would make for bad press in the international community. Governments don't buy things just to keep them from being used, and companies are already being watched since they're defense contractors.

The first superheroes would have to be low powered with abilities that aren't directly offensive. They'd probably start off handing out powers like invulnerability and flight, which can't legally be considered weapons. Once heroes caught on, the government would hash out permit and registration laws.
