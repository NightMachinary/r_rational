According to current good samaritan laws, superheroes actually aren't liable for collateral damage most of the time, but if they were I would think that'd make corporations avoid responsibility for their actions. The way you describe superheroes makes it sound like they're just unusually powerful mages, in which case I don't see why they'd be celebrities. It seems like they'd have the same role in society as alchemists in FMA, who are constantly doing mundane work because their abilities are so useful.

I can see you exploring themes about truth with magic in a cyberpunk dystopia, but I don't see how superheroes fit into that even if they're celebrities. The only stories I've seen with celebrity heroes use them to make you feel cynical towards society. They represent the corruption of the fantastic and righteous, and mainly serve to set the stage for stories about other people dealing with them. If your setting already has that with magic and megacorps, why add an additional element that's normally used to inject fantasy into a mundane setting?
