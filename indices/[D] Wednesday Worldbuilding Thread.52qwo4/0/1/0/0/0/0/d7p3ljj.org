I guess, that the overarching theme of the setting as whole would be related to lies and pursuit of truth. IMO it ties underlying themes (Plato's Cave, crapsaccharine cyberpunk dystopia and commercial superheroes) quite well.

Superheroes never were illegal, but vigilantism just had a dubious legal nature, what was exploited by big corporations. As for gains from selling out, the biggest ones were corporations taking responsibility for heroes' actions (so they weren't e.g. pursued by law enforcement for collateral damage, which issue is often ignored in superhero fiction), additional resources and access to corporate labs to develop their abilities further. The last one was especially important, as the powers in my setting resemble [[https://redd.it/4f3vkq][mix of magic and reality programming]] rather than [[http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/748/694/41e.jpg][usual comic book superpowers]], so corporate superheroes had it easier due to better means of honing their talent and spell blueprints written for them by specialists hired by their employer.
