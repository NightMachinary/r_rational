In my world, nations due have their own heroes but only commissioned a handful due to new arms treaties. Corporations decided to create more traditional superheroes as a marketing ploy and managed to eliminate legal responsibility for them while also holding them to the standards of ideal good samaritans by establishing them as nonprofit charities. They weren't effective altruists, but they got a lot of publicity and made sure to thank their sponsors.

When villains appeared, heroes had already earned the trust of the public by saving lives and fighting more mundane crime. The issue of collateral damage went nowhere since the villains usually started the fight and heroes were very good at presenting themselves as someone who just showed up to help. Whenever a hero did screw up or commit a crime, their sponsors would just take their powers away and replace them.
