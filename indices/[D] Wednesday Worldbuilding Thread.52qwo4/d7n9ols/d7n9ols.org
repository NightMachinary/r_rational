I've got a story idea.

In my world, there is an Eldritch Abomination at large in the ocean, every person is aware of its existence. In fact the biggest tragedy of the world had happened only because humans had attempted to kill it once. The disaster was so big that it had killed off 80 percent of the entire population and sent a civilization on the cusp of the Singularity back to the medieval ages, technology wise.

Modern technology still exists but is treated as artifacts of an arrogant culture that didn't know its place. There are churches of said Abomination.

And there are a group of people that believe that the abomination was sent to halt the development of the human race because somewhere, something was /scared/.

Obviously I need to hammer out the details and stuff but I think the premise needs some tweaking before that.

Edit: The majority is heavily indoctrinated by the abomination's worshippers from childhood.
