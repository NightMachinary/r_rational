  In my world, there is an Eldritch Abomination at large in the ocean, every person is aware of its existence. In fact the biggest tragedy of the world had happened only because humans had attempted to kill it once. The disaster was...

Honestly everything from this point forwards seems to deviate from the core of the setting.

Do you want the major source of conflict to be the discussion between allowing the Eldritch Abomination to roam freely(with occasional high number casualties I expect), versus trying to destroy it when the retaliation potential is far too big? Or is it about pulling out a twist to surprise the reader?

Because if you reveal the truth in the status quo on the beginning(like you did here) then the reader will be slogging through descriptions of the society that do not address the main problem. If you pull it somewhere along the 2nd act, then it's sort of only a grimdark twist "if you try and kill it, 80% of the world will die like once before" isn't as impressive as it sounds in story terms because it's such a huge impact that it loses all meaning, you can get the same effect by scaling it to a nuclear explosion level of destruction of a single city for instance.

Also, this might be because I've been reading [[http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=32341][Shamus Young's Final Fantasy X retrospective lately]], but it really reminds me of its themes? It's not necessarily bad, just a point of comparison to keep in mind.
