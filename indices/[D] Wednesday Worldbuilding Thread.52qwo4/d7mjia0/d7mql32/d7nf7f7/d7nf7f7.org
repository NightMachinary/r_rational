Thank you. The only other setting I've seen pull off cyberpunk megacorps is Eclipse Phase, where all Earth governments were destroyed in the backstory and humanity has fled into space. The companies founded a new psuedo-democratic government and put themselves in charge because they owned most of the infrastructure. The rest of the solar system is either dictatorships, anarchist communities, or an experiment in socialism, so people are hesitant to leave.
