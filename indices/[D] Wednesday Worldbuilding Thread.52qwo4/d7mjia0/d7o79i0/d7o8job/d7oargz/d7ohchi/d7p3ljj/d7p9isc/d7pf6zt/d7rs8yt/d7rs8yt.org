I still think that the circumstances under which superheroes appear in settings are different from the ones you present. Live streaming crimefighting I understand, but there doesn't seem to be a reason for superheroes to appear in the first place, let alone become corporatized later on. If people feared Alchemy of Forms being used for combat, why would they be okay with vigilantes? If vigilantism has no legal protections, how did anyone keep doing it long enough to gain public support?

As to your reason for adding superheroes, I feel like you're trying to justify something that doesn't need it. Sure, people would be afraid of Alchemy of Forms being used to hurt people, but that doesn't mean people wouldn't ever use it for combat. People would learn how to fight just out of fear of getting into a fight. It's not like you can stop people from using magic however they want, but you can deter them with laws and capable authorities.
