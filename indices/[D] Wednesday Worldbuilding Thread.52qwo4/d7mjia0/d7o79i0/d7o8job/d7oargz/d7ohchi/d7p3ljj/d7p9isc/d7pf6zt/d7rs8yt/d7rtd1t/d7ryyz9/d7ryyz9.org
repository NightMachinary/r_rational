It still seems unusual to me that people would be more okay with military-grade magic being used by people with no accountability to the public compared to the government, even if the government was unpopular. Why would people be so afraid of government abuse of power that they would demand independent vigilantes as leverage against it, instead of demanding legal protections to hold the government accountable?
