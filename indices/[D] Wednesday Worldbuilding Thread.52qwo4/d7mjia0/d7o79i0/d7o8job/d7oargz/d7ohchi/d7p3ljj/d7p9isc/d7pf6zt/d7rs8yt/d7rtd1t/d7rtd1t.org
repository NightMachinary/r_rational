Superheroes appeared for the same reason as they appear in most of superhero fiction (yours included) - certain people had more power than most of the society. And didn't fear Alchemy of Forms being used for combat, because that was already happening, but rather it being researched for combat means by military. That's quite a difference. Also the fact that vigilantes weren't employed and controlled by governments meant, that they cannot be used as a policing force of currently ruling political party to create a totalitarian regime. Them being independent was what appealed to public.

Well, just learning how to fight using Alchemy of Forms is not enough to use it for combat for the most of people. It's not like every alchemist is equal. Majority of casters wont get past reheating soup, even if they trained their entire lives, while some people can overpower tanks or high yield explosives within just few months of developing their talent.
