Not all countries have good samaritan laws and well, these usually apply to rather minor things. When supers are throwing at each other equivalents of bullets, grenades, rockets or even high yield explosives, good samaritan laws seem kinda out of place. As for the issue of responsibility, corporations haven't took it for all heroes, but only for selected and popular ones, what gave them large income because people more eagerly bought products advertised by heroes.

The comparison with alchemists from FMA is kinda off the mark, as Amestris isn't a highly developed in terms of technology. In a cyberpunk world most of mundane work would be rather ceded to machines. A lot of casters of Alchemy of Forms is still used in research, medicine, agriculture, industry or entertainment, though usually rather in fine stuff rather than physical labour, that can be handled by specialized robots. Superheroes became celebrities precisely because of the fact than in era of advanced Internet their deeds were streamed getting to wide audience. In a current day there are many channels with footages, interviews or reality shows. BTW the issue of people not using their powers to mundane jobs applies to pretty much every piece of work from superhero genre.

Well, in most cases superheroes in my setting are not righteous "allies of justice", but just enforcers of law and walking commercials. Often they are even worse people than villains they face, but for the purpose of PR they create fake personas. On the other hand supervillains are usually just mercenaries of the same corporations that hire superheroes, but meant to do underhanded jobs and take part in staged fights or vigilantes trying to uncover truth about crimes, that were swept under the carpet. The entire superhero culture is built on lies.

In initials versions of this setting I actually haven't thought about adding superheroes, but then if the magic is public, its applications with offensive purposes would be most likely banned or at least heavily supervised. Governments using casters on military purposes could also meet a public outrage plus people with more power than average would be feared. After all how would you feel if someone in your neightbourhood was walking with a rocket launcher? Superheroes de facto familiarized people with Alchemy of Forms and made them feel relatively safe.
