Well, criminals already had military-grade magic, while government special squads were in many cases not enough due to asymmetrical distribution of powers. Especially since governments couldn't just forcibly incorporate anyone with powers into their forces, as it would be violation of their human rights, while hiring other supervillains as mercenaries was morally dubious. That's why initially police and special forces turned a blind eye on vigilantes, who did their job for them.

No one demanded vigilantes, but when first ones appeared media and public opinion were rooting for them, what along with leniency from police gave them a lot of leeway. And that's how they became a social phenomenon. If we discount vigilantes governments had two options: reduce freedom of people with higher talent in Alchemy of Forms to put them in special forces to fight crime or start creating infrastructure for law enforcement, what could take years during which supervillains would mostly go unpunished. Both of these were basically equal to a political suicide.

BTW why haven't national institutions create their own superheroes in your world? I mean an entire country should have means to create infrastructure essential to development of superpowers. Why allow private individuals or groups to basically create their own WMDs?
