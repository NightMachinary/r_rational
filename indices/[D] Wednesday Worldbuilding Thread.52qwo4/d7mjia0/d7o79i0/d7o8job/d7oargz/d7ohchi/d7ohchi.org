I'm subscribed to [[/r/worldbuilding][r/worldbuilding]], but I've never posted there. Your setting is kind of interesting, but I'm not sure what kind of story you're setting up. You've mixed a lot of different concepts together from different genres, all of which are good on their own, but there's no overarching theme to tie it all together. I just went for straight cyberpunk dystopia

The one hole in your setting is the transition of superheroes from illegal to corporate. My setting implies that they were legal to begin with, and were also established by corporations in the first place and rely on them for their powers. Heroes in your world started off as independent vigilantes and don't gain many advantages from selling out, so why would they?
