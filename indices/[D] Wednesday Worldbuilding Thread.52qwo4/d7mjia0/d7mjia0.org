A common feature of cyberpunk stories is to feature corporations in positions of power equal or greater than that of governments in developed nations. The simultaneously best and worst example of this trope is Shadowrun, where the Supreme Court granted megacorporations the same rights as sovereign nations, which I frankly find absurd even if it does a good job at justifying the dystopia. So I tried to think of a way to make the shift in the definition of business a bit less absurd, and I think I found the answer with superheroes.

In the setting I've come up with, all sources of superpowers require substantial infrastructure to produce and maintain, so large corporations are the only ones who can create them. However, new anti-trust laws and military treaties heavily regulate the usage of powers, so companies are severely limited in how they can profit from them. The only loophole is for when powers are used to be a good samaritan, so they decide to create superheroes and pass them off as a form of charitable donation.

The heroes end up being a huge success, and soon develop a celebrity culture around them and their exploits. The companies recognize a marketing opportunity and become sponsors of people that fight crime and save lives on TV. This is what causes a shift in the idea of what a corporation is. Suddenly, businesses are no longer just out for themselves, they are spending money solely to support the actions of real-life Supermen and using that money to hold them to high standards of behavior.

The appearance of supervillains backed by organized crime, which the police can't handle do to a a backlash against militarization, finally cements corporations as responsible protectors in the public consciousness. The brands people buy and work for become a mark of identity as much as the heroes themselves, and the companies that support those heroes are swimming in cash as they promote the image of responsible capitalism. Businesses begin internal crackdowns on abuses of power, even publicizing arrests of their own executives to prove their integrity.

Soon there are calls to loosen superpower laws and even deregulate other industries, and the liberals capitulate because the system does seem to be working. With the majority of corporate income now coming from what are basically taxes on customers, they begin building new subsidiaries to supplement public institutions as a way to further compete over PR. A few public controversies later, and people are demanding for-profit organizations be granted new legal protections from the tyranny of ideologues.

Where the typical cyberpunk megacorp comes into effect is that companies are more obsessed with their public image than actual business. They've taken every step they can to avoid or discourage accountability while also trying to slander each other, so private investigation and espionage is now an industry in and of itself. Workers and customers are also encouraged to become cogs in a machine while innovation has been stifled by a new kind of monopoly. The glitterati cape culture is social satire that writes itself.
