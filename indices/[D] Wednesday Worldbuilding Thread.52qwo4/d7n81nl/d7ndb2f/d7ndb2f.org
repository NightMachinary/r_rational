It actually does make sense in the original comic. The spider was irradiated by accident during a demonstration of some science device, without being noticed because it was so small, and then it bit a bystander in the back row who ran out of the building. A lot of superhero origins work the same way, it was just an accident that the company couldn't have foreseen and doesn't know occurred so they don't try to repeat it. Even in cases where the company does know it happened, they event is such a fluke it can't be repeated.
