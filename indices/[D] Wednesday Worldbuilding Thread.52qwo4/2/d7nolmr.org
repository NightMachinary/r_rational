So I like some ideas from Naruto and want to homebrew a setting that has those ideas but not some of the other ones.

The ideas I love in Naruto:

#+begin_quote
  3rd generation warfare in a medieval setting. You have small highly trained armies like in the modern world.

  Jinchuriku are human atomic bombs.

  Intelligent ninja animals.

  Lot of throwable weapons. The fights in general are close and personal, not the bullets from 500m away like in modern times.

  Clans and a highly devolped biology understanding.

Things I hate:

  Shonen power levels. Tailed beast should be the most powerful unstopable thing around. No exceptions.

  We have electricity and computers but still use knives to kill each other.

So let's make a working setting out of it.

My ideas so far:

  Normal word with humans

  Thousands of years ago 9 tailed beasts appear. They are natural disasters that sleep for decades and then go on short rampages destroying everything they see. When they are tired rampaging they find a baby human and go sleep inside him. This baby human become a Jinchuriku. He now has a chakra sytem and a nearly unlimited chakra reserve. If jinchuriku is hurt of seriously enraged the biju awakens (partialy or totaly) and tries to eleminate the disturbance (sometime along with the city he is in) and go back to sleep.

  Jinchuriku descendants have also a chakra system but a more limited chakra reserve. This is how ninjas were born.

  Each Jinchuriku is particular and his descendants show variations in chakra systems creating a clan.

  This coninued for many years until 1500 years ago a great disaster wrecked humanity. In this adverse condition life was hard and many normal human died while the ones with chakra system survived.

  In current day 20% of population have a chakra system. Of those around 3% are from clans. The other are descendants of long forgotten clans. [spoiler]The disaster was introduced to explain how in such a short time a large fraction of population obtained the chakra system[/spoiler]

  In the last century many clans united in city states and created Hidden villages as we know them today.

  Currently they are at peace as all have jinchuriku and a MAD scenary is very likely. A common use of Jinchuriku in wars was smuggling him in the enemy city and then pocking him until biju awakesn and destroy the enemy city. Also using a jinchuriku this way makes biju go to sleep on enemy territory and basicaly gives the enemy a new Jinchuriku. This offers intresting warfare tactics.
