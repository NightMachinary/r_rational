Perhaps there's still conflict? I mean, you can kill 4 out of 5 people and you still have like, 1.5 billion people hanging out. This wouldn't require industrial agriculture to sustain, but would still require like, really good agriculture and cusp-of-industrial-revolution tech. People might compete over resources.

Another source of conflict might be religious wars, which are always a classic. I doubt the Catholic Church would take the ascension of a bunch of devil-worshippers/heathens well! Perhaps the church could be the last maintainers of what is left of working knowledge, with monks passing down skills with engineering and technology in their monasteries.
