I wouldn't say I harp. One review compares stabbing a rat to death with a sharp rock to “kicking a rat” as if it is not a brutal act to put to a living being. I think in a life or death situation most people could justify brutality that is needed to come out the other side. My MC is not one of those people initially. I would say the greater percentage of people would freak out if they actually needed to bloody their hands, specifically when the adrenaline faded and the blood was still there.
