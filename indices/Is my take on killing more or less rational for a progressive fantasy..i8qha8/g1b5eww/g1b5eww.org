I disagree. When you are in "a world of killing", there is a lot of adaptation pressure, from everywhere around you. Humans are usually quick to adapt and to adjust to new environments. Want to fit in. When in Rome ...

It would be way more traumatizing / abhorrent to have e.g. a night elf appear bound in your current living room, and be told "kill it or else!". That would not be in tune with your environment, with the moral framework around you!

However, when you are surrounded by people killing, in "a world of killing", I think going with the flow would be easier than you'd evidently think. When you're totally immersed in a different culture, it's hard to cling to your old one, especially if your old one would also go counter to your survival instinct.
