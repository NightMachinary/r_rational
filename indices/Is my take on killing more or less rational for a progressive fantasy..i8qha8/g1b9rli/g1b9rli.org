When writing fiction, you have to juggle two forces:

1. Your story must make rational sense and the characters must act in a coherent manner.
2. Story must be digestible and entertaining, which means you have to somehow bend reality and use expected tropes even when they make no sense.

A perfectly rational story would be dry and boring as a pile of sawdust. We read stories to enjoy adventures and escapist themes by proxy, and the appeal of escapist adventure is that it is different from reality.

If your character takes a long time to adjust to killing, then either you have to rewrite the setting and plot so that killing is a rare and big deal, to everyone, not just the protagonist, or write the protagonist in a way that allows him to solve the problems without killing (like the Doctor, usually).

Havign a character that takes a long time tro adjust to killing is not only boring to the reader (especially if the protag monologues about the suffering of being a killer) but also not realistic. IRL, people in war/combat situations kill very easily and adjust to a reality of killing frighteningly fast. THey do not mope or bemoan their fate prior or during the killing, but AFTER, when they get PTSD, often months and years after the fact.

Ask yourself:

1. WHY are you writing progression? What is the appeal of that? Can you write a story that touches the same feelings as progression fic without falling into its pitfalls?
2. WHY KILL? Why is killing necessary at all in the story? Can it be circumvented?
3. WHY WRITE A PACIFIST? If somehow you need to have deaths in story, why insist on a non-psycho protagonist?

" I always read stories in which a character will flip a switch and absolve themselves of all the emotional ramifications of such actions. "

Because that is how it happens IRL. Read some stories on the Vietnam War, WW2, or people being recruited into gangs and terrorist organisations. Violent circumstances sneak up on you, and then you just pull the trigger not emotionally comprehending that you are destroying a life. Adrenaline (and often, brainwashing) shields you from the moral implications for a while...except on that one night, 3 years after when you wake up screaming and put a gun in your mouth, because the moral weight have finally reached you.
