It should also be noted that in modern combat the vast majority of bullets fired don't actually hit anyone (I've seen estimates like 250,000 rounds fired for one combatant killed) both because most fire is intended to control the movement of the enemy so other people can kill them and because hitting what you're aiming at is really, really hard. Though obviously this doesn't account for harm done by stray bullets.

So if you get to the point to where you have to think about how much seperation there is between a character needing to use a gun vs having to actually intentionally kill someone the answer is way, way more than you think.
