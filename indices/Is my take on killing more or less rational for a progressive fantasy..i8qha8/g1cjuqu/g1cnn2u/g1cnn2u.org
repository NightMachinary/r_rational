It's funny you mention combat because I brought up something similar in another comment with it being documented that a majority of men shoot their guns over the heads of the enemy.

One thing I should have explained in my initial post is that my character hasn't even come to the point where he will need to kill another human. The issue he has is first killing a living creature that is not intelligent then moving on to having to kill civilized monsters that are capable of speech. Part of his struggle lies in that he is stranded on this planet and these creatures are the first he sees that he may be able to communicate with. The other part I had him deal with was essentially what right does he have to kill in order to live. How many lives could he take with the justification of his own being on the line.

I love the mistborn series. It is part of the inspiration for my book. I made my character a rogue because of Vin.
