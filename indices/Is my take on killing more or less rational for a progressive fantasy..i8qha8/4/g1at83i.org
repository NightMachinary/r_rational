Can't really give a proper critique without reading the story in question, but here's some ideas anyway.

Consider the audience. Royal Road is focused on power fantasy stories on a reason - that's what the audience there wants. If the MC feels weak at any point for any reason then a portion of the readers will dislike it on general principles - that sort of thing is simply not what they go there for. There's nothing you can really do about that.

A more thorny situation is where the MC complains about having to kill in ludicrously justified circumstances - say, him being directly threatened by several opponents about to kill him.

Now, this is obviously a realistic emotional reaction. I don't believe anyone but a legitimate sociopath would be completely unaffected by killing another human being after a relatively peaceful life. But it can still be annoying to read yet another character angst about it, especially when the "correct" answer to the dilemma is /glaringly obvious/.

The best way I can think of to handle this sort of thing is to simply make the character acknowledge to the reader that this is an emotional reaction they have little control over, not an issue of beliefs. It's kind of similar to anyone in the modern world eating meat but balking at killing animals themselves. You /know/ you're being a hypocrite, but you can't really help it - so at least acknowledge it. You'd be surprised how much that helps.
