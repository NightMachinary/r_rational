Only if your taking a multiple choice test, and the instructions say so.

Which is least wrong - 2+2=5, or 2+5=5? Is either correct?

If your given the choice of torturing your Mother or Father to death or making them torture you - is any choice correct (except maybe choosing to rejecting the scenario)?

If you believe killing other sapients is wrong, is it suddenly right if they attempt to kill you? Or is it still wrong, but a transgression your willing to make to save your own life?

From a more pragmatic view, if you accept "least wrong" as "correct" then that sets a precedent, and removes the need to look for a better solution, or try to examine how the situation got to that point and head off future scenarios in the future.

A shooter enters school, and starts killing students. A police officer shoots the killer to prevent additional children dying. At that moment he feels it is the least wrong solution.

Imagine the shooter is a 14 year old boy. Still maybe least wrong, but is it right?

Imagine shooter is a 9 year old girl with a significant disability. Officer might still feel shooting her is least wrong in the moment, but will we be satisfied with the answer after? Were there other solutions? Could this have been prevented earlier? If so then I would rally hesitate to say it was "Correct" - and I expect the officer would spend the rest of his life wondering and mourning too.

I think the real world is very very rarely a matter of "Correct / Incorrect, or Right / Wrong, Evil / Good. " And any time we disregard all the grey to be satisfied with an absolute answer, we are really at a significant risk of starting something worse.
