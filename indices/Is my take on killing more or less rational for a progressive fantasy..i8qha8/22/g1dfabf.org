It makes sense for someone to have a hard time adjusting to constant death and killing. However, from a literary standpoint, it could very easily become dull and repetitive. Having the MC take his time to change his entire worldview is fine - harping on and on about how murder is bad is not engaging or interesting to read. If I were you I would stick to the vision of the story, but take the reaction and opinions of your audience into account. This is one of the greatest advantages of writing serially: being able to shake up your writing style on the fly. Take advantage of it.
