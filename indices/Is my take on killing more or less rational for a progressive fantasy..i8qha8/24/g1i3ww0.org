One interesting subversion: Have a protagonist who comes from a place where violence is unnecessary and slightly taboo (eg most parts of most 21st real-world wealthy nations) and is a prosocial member of society who has never been in a fight since grade school. Have them show up in this new world where violence is expected...and they find that not only are they good at it, they enjoy it. There's all kinds of character development to be had there, as your protagonist first thinks of theirself as a monster and fears that they might go too far...and then they slowly come to accept the new reality and adjust.
