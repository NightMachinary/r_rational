My personal theory is that this isn't a rationality issue, it's just a tired trope where readers are bored of hearing about protagonists struggle with killing people. Is there anything interesting you can do with the idea, create some novelty?

What if you reverse it, have someone who thought they would be deeply affected but just aren't? What if they get worried about the fact that they don't care?

What if they're ashamed that they aren't hard-hearted enough, that they're not like the Berserker on Stanford Bridge, mowing down Englishmen? What if they've idolized a fantasy warrior culture that never actually existed?

Obviously you can't switch back now but that's something to think about.
