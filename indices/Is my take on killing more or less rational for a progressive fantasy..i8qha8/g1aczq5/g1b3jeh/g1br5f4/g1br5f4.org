Not Vape, but while "no land for heroes" doesn't provide useful results, my guess is they meant /A Land Fit for Heroes/ by Richard P. Morgan of /Takeshi Kovacs/ / /Altered Carbon/ fame. While the descriptions on WP or TVT don't mention PTSD, context (cynical/gritty post-war fantasy) at least implies that it's likely a theme.
