Not all Opinions are equal, and since we make policy and laws based on this, we should probably be using Research (as the author does) instead of relying on Opinion. [[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/war-is-not-part-of-human-nature/]]

In world war I and WWII , one of the biggest problems that both German and "Western" forces had is that most soldiers would just fire into the air or ground rather than at each other. It takes quite a bit of indoctrination, training, or attempted subjugation to get humans to kill strangers.

The more we look, the more we see bias in the most "influential" (sensational) studies. When the same data is examined with more rigor, the results are consistently showing a much less violent species than expected. About the first time you start seeing large scale violence is when we start developing land "rights".

A big part of the book is trying to figure out why we all so easily accept the notion that humans are so ready to kill, and why debunked research like the Stanford Prison Experiment still get credence and why the story of the Killing of Kitty Genovese was so distorted.
