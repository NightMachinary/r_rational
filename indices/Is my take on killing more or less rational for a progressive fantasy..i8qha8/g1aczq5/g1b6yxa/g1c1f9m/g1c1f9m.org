That is propaganda that has been pummeled into our minds for generations but with little to no basis in truth. Humans evolutionary success is specifically because we evolved away from violence and individualism and into a species that is remarkably good at collaboration and non-competitive success. This is an excellent book on the subject: [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54775543-humankind]]

It goes through and reviews a lot of the experiments and anecdotes that make up the "proof" of humans as a callous murderous species and by meticulous research of original source materials and later studies debunks most all of them.

Humans thrive not because we are "Homo Murderous" but because we are "Homo Puppy" the primate locked in permanent adolescence.

Excellent read.
