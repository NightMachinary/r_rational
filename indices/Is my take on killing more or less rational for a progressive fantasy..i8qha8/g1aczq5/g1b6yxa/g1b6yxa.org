  We evolved not to kill other humans.

We absolutelly did not, that's why there are so many murderers out there despite the massive socialization efforts to discourage murder. In fact, we are no different than other primates where males kill each other in dominance fights on regular basis. It takes growing up in a very protective environment to be shocked by murder as adult.
