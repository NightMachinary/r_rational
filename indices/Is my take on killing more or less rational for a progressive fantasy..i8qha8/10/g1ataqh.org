You can read some war memories, especially memories of modern local/civil wars (you probably would have to use google translate, all of them are in local languages). From war memories it seems modern people mostly treat killing in the war like frag in deathmatch, even if then they are /not/ dehumanizing enemy. Of cause it could be sampling bias, may be people traumatized by killing in the war don't write about their experience. On the gripping hand people who can be traumatized by killing are not likely continue participate in the war, modern civil wars are elective for combatant.
