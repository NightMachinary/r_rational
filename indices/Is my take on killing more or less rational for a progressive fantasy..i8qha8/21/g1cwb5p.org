A story can be well-executed either way, or it could be poorly executed either way. Without having read the story in question, the only thing I can say is: The story is about whatever the text is about. If you advertised a story about violence and wrote a story about moral ambiguity, the readers you attract will be frustrated by the lack of violence. Meanwhile, the kinds of readers who would like your story won't pick it up because they aren't interested in reading about the kinds of violence you advertised but didn't include.

If the draw of the story is creative violence in a fantasy universe, you may want to consider skipping ahead to the part your readers are actually reading for. Contrariwise, if the story is about someone coming to terms with moral ambiguity, that's what the story is about; when the protagonist undergoes a change (loss of innocence, or preservation of innocence and loss of something else), that story is over, and there will be no more space left to tell a story about creative violence in a fantasy universe.

In other words, if you intend for the story to be mainly about violence, don't waste your audience's time with 50k words of buildup that isn't about violence. If your story is about morality, don't waste your audience's time with 50k words about violence.
