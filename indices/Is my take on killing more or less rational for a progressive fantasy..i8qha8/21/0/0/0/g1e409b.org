Yeah I read some advice from a well established serial author that was similar. If you put in certain aspects of your story for your synopsis you can avoid upsetting people that were expecting something else when they initially choose to read your book.

I believe the best way to put it is that in many parts of the book violence is the vehicle but never the destination.

I do love writing the fight scenes, but the book is more about unraveling the history. The series is about what events thousands of years ago led to the current system. I even include that in my series title in a blunt way. (Ramifications of the agreement)

I agree with you. The only part I would stress that I slightly lean away from what you are saying is that violence is extremely prevalent in my story, yet never the sole focus. I advertise that my story is about a mans journey through an unknown world. While there are violent scenes, a resolution never comes from those actions. Sure you get levels, stat points and cool items, yet winning a battle does not bring back lost loved ones, or fix broken parts of a man. It's not just that he struggles to kill it is that he has to kill while simultaneously deal with other traumatic events. One of my edits is going to be to highlight that. Thanks for your detailed input. I believe my understanding has grown considerably!
