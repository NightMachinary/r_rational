I plan an arc for my character to question that exactly. I agree with you. Have you heard of the Stanford experiments? I believe in real life people are generally good, but the world and outside factors can twist us into monsters. Finding who he was before through what he has been bent into conforming to will be an important part of my characters journey to who he wants to be.
