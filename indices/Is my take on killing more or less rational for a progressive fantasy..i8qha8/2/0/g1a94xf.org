Most of my readers have no complaints. I just have had a few people whine about his emotional turmoil and call it childish. Possibly serial killers in the making? Who knows. My execution is likely lacking either way. I do try to explain the though process he goes though, and the fact that kill or be killed is reinforced several times. You may be correct though. If I could think of some reason why he wants to be a pacifist, or make it easier to understand where he is coming from. Thank you for the input!
