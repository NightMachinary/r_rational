Make sure that the characters reluctance for violence makes sense in the context of the world and the story. Sometimes its frustrating as a reader to read about a character whose skills are exceptional but artificially gimped by his morality to give everyone else a chance.

This is especially frustrating when it doesnt make sense in the context of the story. If your character grew up in a rough and merciless environment, he shouldnt have any problems with violence as a general rule. On the other hand, if you explain that he grew in a peaceful, out of the way village, or in the nobility, etc, his reluctance then makes more sense.
