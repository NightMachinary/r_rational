Honestly? It makes sense for it to take sometime for one to truly adjust to a world where violence and bloodshed is the norm. Progression Fantasy has a heavy power fantasy edge to it, so the MCs have weaknesses like not being a murder on a dime psychopath can detract from the appeal for some.

But in the end, it's often a matter of taste. And I for one enjoy watching a MC harden up from their experiences.
