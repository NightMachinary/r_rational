Please don't cater to the lowest common denominator - we have plenty of that trash on RR. Please aspire to be better, and inspire better. Don't help normalize the idea that avoiding killing is weakness - it is strength, just like if it ends up necessary and is the least wrong choice, admitting and expressing the trauma and dehumanization it causes is a sign of strength. Lack of empathy / lack of sensitivity to violence are signs of damage and weakness, not weakness and definitely not rational, nor do they have a place in RationalLit unless it is to illustrate the problem. You might find this book iteresting as it debunks a lot of the myths about how "evil" humans are. [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54775543-humankind]]
