SpaceBattles? SufficientVelocity maybe?

Yeah, ignore them and write what you want. If you are concerned that the MCs turmoil is a poor simulation of reality, I don't think you have too many worries there. If you had 100 characters, 95% of whom were in similar turmoil, you would probably still be on defensible simulationist grounds.

Also, from the perspective of simulationism, the MC being "Childish" is a non-sequitur.

Lastly, if you want your MC to be rational about this, the important thing is how they respond to it. If they freeze up at a critical moment, do they take that into account when strategizing? If an ally horrifies them by killing someone defenseless, does the MC make sure to never leave them alone with a defenseless person again?

If they view it as a liability, do they try to desensitize themselves? If they view it as important, do they try to prevent desensitization? If they are confused, do they notice their confusion?
