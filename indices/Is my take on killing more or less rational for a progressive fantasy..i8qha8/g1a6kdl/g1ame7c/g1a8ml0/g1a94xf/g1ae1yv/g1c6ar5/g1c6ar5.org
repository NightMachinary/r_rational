A bit of a weird way to turn it about, but look at Evangelion: a deconstruction showing what happens in relying on emotionally broken children to put themselves in harms way to save the world.

A whole lot of people took from it “Why won't he just get in the cool robot and kill stuff!”

There is always going to be people who want it to be a straight power fantasy, or are not particularly interested in an exploration of topics. Or there's a certain genre savviness that comes from imagining dealing with the situation (and awareness of outcomes) versus /actually being in that situation/. It's easier for someone to go “Yeah gotta murder that dude because I might get caught / betrayed later” versus /literally having to murder someone/.
