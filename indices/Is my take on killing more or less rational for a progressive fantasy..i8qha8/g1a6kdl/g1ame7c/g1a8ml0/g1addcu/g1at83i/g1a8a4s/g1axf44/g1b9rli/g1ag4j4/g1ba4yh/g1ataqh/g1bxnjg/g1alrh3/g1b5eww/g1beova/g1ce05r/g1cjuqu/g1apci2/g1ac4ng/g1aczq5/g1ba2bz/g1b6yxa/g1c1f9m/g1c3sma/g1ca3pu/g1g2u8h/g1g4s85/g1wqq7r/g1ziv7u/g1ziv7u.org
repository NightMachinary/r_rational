Read the book/article. Not saying atrocities don't happen, but they are aberrations and the result of very specific scenarios, not the default behavior of humans when ever they are not tightly controlled. "Human Nature" tends towards non-violence/cooperation towards other humans, but is is not infallible or "Good" - its just not "Evil"

The WWII point was that even for soldiers, when push came to shove, they so frequently intentionally missed rather than kill (both American and German) that after WWII they totally rebuild boot camp and military training to condition recruits to kill on command, because they wouldn't do it on their. own.
