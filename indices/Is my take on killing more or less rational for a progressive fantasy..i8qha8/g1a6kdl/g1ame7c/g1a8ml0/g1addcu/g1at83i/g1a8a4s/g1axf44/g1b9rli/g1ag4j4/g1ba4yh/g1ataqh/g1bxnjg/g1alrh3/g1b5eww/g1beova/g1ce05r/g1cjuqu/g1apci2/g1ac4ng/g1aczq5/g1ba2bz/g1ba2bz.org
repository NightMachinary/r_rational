I would slightly disagree. I think that it is actually very easy to Justify to yourself that you need to kill, especially when there is some social pressure or brainwashing involved. Soldiers, gangbangers or terrorist recruits often pull the trigger on someone without thinking, they are temporarily shielded from the ramifications of their action by the adrenaline of the moment.

AFTER that, they get tremendous PTSD, but the first kill is often easy, especially if the "enemy" is sufficiently dehumanised.
