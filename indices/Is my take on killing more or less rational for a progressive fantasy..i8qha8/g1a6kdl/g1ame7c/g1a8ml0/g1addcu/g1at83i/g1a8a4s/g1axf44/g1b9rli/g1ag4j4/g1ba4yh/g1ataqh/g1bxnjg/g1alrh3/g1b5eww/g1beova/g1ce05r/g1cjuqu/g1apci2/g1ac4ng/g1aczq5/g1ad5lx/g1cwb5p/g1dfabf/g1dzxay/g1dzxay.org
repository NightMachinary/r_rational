  Any thoughts?

Angst is almost always boring. If I read a fantasy book I expect to read about orcs, not angst. Include it if you need to, but keep in mind that it's blocking the path to the next paragraph on orcs.

Also, if it's realistic and /expected/ then, well, it's expected. I know how this ends so I'm not looking forward to any twist on how the angst progresses - again, angst is boring. Maybe it's not /fundamentally/ boring, but in practice it it's written boringly.

So IMO keep it to a minimum - allude to it if you need to, maybe even have a throwaway line or two in between the killing of orcs.
