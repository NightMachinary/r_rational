I think it depends a lot on the presentation. If the main character is irrationally against killing to the point that they endanger their friends and loved ones, I get very turned off. If they try very hard not to kill but end up doing what they have to and suffer emotionally, that sounds like great character development. Many people in real life would struggle to kill in a life or death situation, but I don't want to read stories about them and they would probably end up dead themselves. Having a protagonist like that who succeeds feels like deus ex Machina in a highly lethal setting.
