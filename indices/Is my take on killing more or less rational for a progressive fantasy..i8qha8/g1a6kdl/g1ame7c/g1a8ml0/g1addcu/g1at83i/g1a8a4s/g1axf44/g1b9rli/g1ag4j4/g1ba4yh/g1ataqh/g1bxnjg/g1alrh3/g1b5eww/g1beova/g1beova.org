Honestly, if the character does not like killing, it is better to show that by said character putting effort into finding ways to not have to.

Angst is not interesting. Effort put into finding non-lethal ways out of situations can be. Deranged chemistry (there are not-very-hard-to-make compounds that smell just /incredibly/ badly.) magi-tech restraining devices, or the ever green standard, an extreme focus on mobility. You always get to pick if you want to have a fight if noone can catch you

Why is the world your protag is in so murdery that this is a problem that comes up repeatedly?
