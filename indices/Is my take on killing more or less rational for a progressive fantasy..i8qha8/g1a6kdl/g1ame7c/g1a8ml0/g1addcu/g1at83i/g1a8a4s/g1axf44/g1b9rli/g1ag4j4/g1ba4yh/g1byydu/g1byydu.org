Spoilers for the system in my book below.

My take is going to be that: Death is used to essentially punish “evil” people who have had their minds placed into he bodies of monsters. Forcing them to be in an endless cycle of pain. Adventurers are pawns in this scheme. As they fight through dungeons they do not even realize they are a part of this cycle of agony.
