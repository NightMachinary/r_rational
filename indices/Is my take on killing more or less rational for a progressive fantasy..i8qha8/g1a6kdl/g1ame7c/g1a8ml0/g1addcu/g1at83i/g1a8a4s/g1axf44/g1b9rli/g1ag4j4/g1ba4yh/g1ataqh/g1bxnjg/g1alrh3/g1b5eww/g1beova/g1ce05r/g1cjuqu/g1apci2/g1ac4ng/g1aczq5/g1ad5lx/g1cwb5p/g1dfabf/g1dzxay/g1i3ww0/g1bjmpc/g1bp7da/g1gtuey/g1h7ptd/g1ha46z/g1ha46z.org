Cool! Always nice to have a new story to try.

Did you ever read David Gemmell?

I'm rereading Waylander at the moment and it's weird how directly the beginning of the book parallels the topic.

(I'd love to say more but it moves pretty fast (the issue is pretty much on discussion from page 1) and anything I could say would be a spoiler. )

edit: though I suppose I should specify that this particular question is given more of a philosophical than psychological treatment. All of the concerned characters are pretty hardbitten. In particular the guy who is hesitant to kill isn't hesitant to die (badly), and internal psychological struggle hasn't been the main focus.
