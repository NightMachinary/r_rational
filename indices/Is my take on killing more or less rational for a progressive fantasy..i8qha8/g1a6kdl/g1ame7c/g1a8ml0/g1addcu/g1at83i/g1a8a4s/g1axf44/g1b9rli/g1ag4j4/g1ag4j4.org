I don't think it's a bad thing at all, one of the things I like a lot about Delve is the fact that the MC responded naturally and realistically to his life in the new world and the trauma he suffered. That said him acting "weak" is probably the most common criticism about the work. I really think that's mostly because the overall genre of rational/adjacent/related works has so many much more violent characters, and that that's the sorry of wish fulfillment a lot of readers are hoping for. Because of that for many a character like that send strange and unrealistic, in the same way that coconuts sound more natural than real hoofbeats in a movie

Personally I strongly think that this is one of those "don't listen to the fans, chasing after them will pull you away from the story and people you want to write in a worse direction" and not a "listen to your fans they have valuable insights in a more productive and rewarding oath for the story to take".

If you'd like someone that is more predisposed to the sort of story you are writing to take a look is be happy to take a look, you can PM me, it's certainly possible to go too far in the other direction... But in a genre filled with murder hobos you'll start getting criticism long before you actually go to far in that direction, so I find it unlikely.
