It makes sense for it to take a long time for someone who wasn't comfortable with violence to spend a long time getting comfortable with it, but I think there's a couple important caveats to that

1. If violence is extremely adaptive in that world, you can't cheat by having the main character engage in prolonged hesitation and vacilitation, where the logic of events would have normally killed him for such weakness, but he gets away with it because the world stands by conveniently on pause? Someone who is poorly attuned to their new circumstances taking a long time to adjust is normal, but if they are so poorly attuned that they are only surviving thanks to plot armour, that's unconvincing. If a pacifist gets dropped into a hellworld, they may naturally maintain their pacifist sensibilities, but they will need something like a silver tongue, or very fast legs, or an intense and proactive risk aversion (or a strong ability to go against their inclinations) if they want to survive. -- It needs to add up, it needs to make sense.

2. "heroes" are expected by default to be fluent with violence (not neccesarilly "comfortable", I suppose). Departing from isn't a big deal or renegement but should come with a bit of lampshading explanation just so readers can get their bearings: Why are they uncomfortable with violence? Are all earth humans constituted so? Or is it more a matter of time and place, upbringing, experience, values, etc? -Don't take the default assumption (the assumption that is normal here on richer parts of planet earth circa 20XX) and privilege it as a shared assumption between yourself and the reader. If they're all killing each other like flies over there, it's because of some circumstance about the make up of that world. If the hero, by contrast, was lucky enough to to live in a world where a prediliction for violence isn't a necessity, that is a circumstance too, highly interesting in itself (including for the way it goes against genre convention) and deserves firstly a nod and hopefully some investigation and exploration.

In short, just make sure that you are treating it as a character trait which exists in the character (who exists in the world) rather than a divine impetus which the world warps itself to make room for and accommodate.

edit: I'll add a "this is just my take" disclaimer (that was it right there) because it looks like lots of other people have said similar things and I feel obligated to make such a disclaimer when speaking with a crowd.
