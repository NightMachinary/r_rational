Yeah if I wanted to write this with such a simple premise I would not have taken months to plot out 50 years of back story. I am writing more of a slice of life where that would fly, but my characters growth and changes are not just about killing orcs. I believe fantasy books can have great characters. Brandon Sanderson never stops proving that for example. Depression if written correctly can be an interesting read. Thanks a lot though now I have to go an read the Dwarves series to get my fix of Orc killing!
