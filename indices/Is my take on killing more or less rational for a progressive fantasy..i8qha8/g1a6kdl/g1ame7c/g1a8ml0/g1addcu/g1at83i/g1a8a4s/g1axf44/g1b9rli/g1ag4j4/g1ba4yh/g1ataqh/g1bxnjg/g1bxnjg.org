What makes you think it's rational to take a long time to adjust to a world of killing? Just from the little bit you have written, you sound like someone who thinks that all killing is wrong.

In any case, you need to differentiate between your own ideals vs. your character's ideals, unless your story is a self-insert.

Who is doing the killing? Who or what is being killed? Why? These are just 3 of the questions that can change a person's feelings about killing.
