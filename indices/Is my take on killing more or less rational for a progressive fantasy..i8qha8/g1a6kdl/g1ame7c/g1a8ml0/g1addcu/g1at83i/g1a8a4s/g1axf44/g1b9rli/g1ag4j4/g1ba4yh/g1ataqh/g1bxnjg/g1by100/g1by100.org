The reason I think I am struggling with the character and writing their experience is because I do not believe that would be my experience. It is almost the exact opposite of a self insert.

I actually do address your questions later on in the story. The real problem was making it as rational as possible. With all of the comments here I believe I may be able to achieve that. My understanding of rational fiction was severely lacking. The motivation and thought process of my character are what I need to work on.
