Yeah that's my story! I just love dark and gritty characters. My goal going into writing the MC was more of a question of how could someone who is naturally gentle and somewhat against violence turn into someone who was. That transformation is something I am going to really focus on when I do my next round of edits. I have the bones there I really just need to build it all up more.
