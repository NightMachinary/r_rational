Yes! My only goal was character development. I have some instances of dues ex machina that are unavoidable because of the fantasy setting I chose, but I do want them done in the most rational way possible. The initial surviving is helped by a character that has no such aversion to killing. Who knows I may rewrite the entire beginning in a few months.
