Pardon my late contribution, but I think that it's worth mentioning that in modern combat, only one in four men will fire their guns. So if you're going to make killing a more common thing in your world, you'll need to show why.

- Is there a pervasive xenophobia throughout the world? If so, why?
- Is the value of a human life in your world less than in our own? Why/ Why not, and how does this change other things?
- Has the world been so desensitized to violence that killing is less traumatizing? Why/Why not/How does this influence other things?

A good example of something similar is Sanderson's Mistborn series. Why didn't the people rise up to fight the Lord Ruler? Well, in part it was because he had Soothers and Rioters spread throughout the capitol, suppressing passionate emotions and encouraging depression/apathy. It wasn't perfect, but it helped to serve as an explanation to why these people didn't do what would come naturally to us: revolution.
