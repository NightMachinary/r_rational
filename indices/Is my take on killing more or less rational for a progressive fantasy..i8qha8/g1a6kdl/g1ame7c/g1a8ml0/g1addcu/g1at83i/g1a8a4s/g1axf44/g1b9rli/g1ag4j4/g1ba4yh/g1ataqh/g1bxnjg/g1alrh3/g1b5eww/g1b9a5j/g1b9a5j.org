One thing I did not point out to readers that made his first kill worse, he can not eat the creature. It dissolves into a goop that the dungeon takes back. I think in many story's and if life if you are able to give purpose to an action it is easier to put away the negative aspects. My goal was not to make this a long term struggle, but to address it in a more consistent way than I usually see.
