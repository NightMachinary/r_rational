From the books about war I've read, it seems like a common reaction in the adrenaline rush of combat is that soldiers feel elated about killing the enemy, but later they may start to feel remorse, get flashbacks about things they did, etc

Of course this applies to soldiers who have been trained to kill, so maybe civilians will have a very different reaction.
