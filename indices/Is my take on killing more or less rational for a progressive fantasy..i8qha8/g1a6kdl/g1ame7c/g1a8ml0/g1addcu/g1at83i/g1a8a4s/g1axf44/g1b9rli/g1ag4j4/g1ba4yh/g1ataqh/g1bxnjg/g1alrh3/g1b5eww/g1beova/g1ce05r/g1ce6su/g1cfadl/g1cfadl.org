I'm very far in the "love it" camp, but only managed to get started on my second try.

The plot progression so far is very satisfying, and I'm invested in may characters. I find that it goes from decent, to good, to great.

I'm usually skeptical of mechanics like classes and levels in a story, but I find they're used very tastefully here.

There's also a great diversity of character types.
