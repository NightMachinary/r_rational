"Rational" does not mean an inherently better approach. Also, again, you can argue both ways- maybe it makes more sense for someone to be unable to flip a switch, but maybe someone who puts thought into it struggles with their first kill and gets over it quickly. Plenty of popular stories here have some highly utilitarian protagonists. Sometimes the killing doesn't get addressed and sometimes it's addressed post-hoc. And even then, even assuming it's written and presented well and is engaging (which it might not be), people are going to react to it different based on how it's presented. You also have to say something interesting about it, because both "I don't want to kill" and "murderhobo time" are both takes that have been done to death before.

Most of the most popular stories here don't just have it as a flipped switch. Mother of Learning takes a while to build up to it, desensitize Zorian over several time loops and his own deaths, and still has him reflect on his actions afterwards. Worth the Candle swings around- Joon's thoughts on it definitely start out reasonably freaked out before swinging around to the DnD adventurer mentality, but it's pretty explicitly in the "hey, this may be a TTRPG standard and is sometimes needed, but maybe don't murderhobo your way out of every situation as your first reaction." Based on how you count them, something like half of the conflicts are resolved by diplomacy checks. Not a rational fic, but Tales of the Abyss does a fantastic job dealing with it early on and has the character development part with regards to killing be more than just flipping a switch, without letting the issue overstay its welcome from a narrative or character development perspective.
