Rationality isn't a specific course of action, it's explaining what the character is thinking and why they are making the choices they are. You could have a character that is happy to kill all the time and it would be perfectly rational if you explained why (somehow, not necessarily by writing down every thought).

I don't know anything about your particular story, but maybe the problem is that you're not explaining it in a way your readers can emphasize with?
