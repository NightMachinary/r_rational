Yeah. Killing someone was traumatic. We evolved not to kill other humans. It takes something to cross that gap in a person.

Prior trauma will do it, desperation, lots of training.

However it is still traumatic untill a person has adapted to it. The tbings a person has to do to adapt are largely not healthy.

There was a book series not to long ago, no land for heros and a big plot point was dealing with the ptsd after a fantasy war.
