"About the plot," sure, but I'm going to double down. On some level, your story consists of a linear progression of sentences. Each sentence (assuming it's a complete sentence) consists of a subject, object, and verb. If you sum together those subject, object, and verbs, there must be patterns.

/Worm/ is a good example of a story that's /about/ fighting. The protagonist progresses from one fight to another. The plot is driven by the outcomes of fights. The first chapter is about why the protagonist chooses to fight, and the second chapter is about the protagonist starting a fight. If your story is aimed at people who liked /Worm/, they're there for the fighting. The climax is resolved by a fight; if the fight had gone the other way, the story would have as well.

Other stories are about emotional turmoil. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone contains fights, but it's not about fights. Look at the climax; Quirrel/Voldemort is defeated by Lily Potter's love. There's no rule in the magic system that enables Harry to defeat Voldemort, no spell, no trick, no plan, no strategy, no amount of force. The story is about the emotions of the characters, not the mechanics of the combat system.

If there was an elaborate, hard-sci-fi magic system in /Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone/, it would have been wasted when Voldemort was ultimately defeated by love magic, which isn't covered in the book at all, which is not associated with any spell or any rule, and which is only explained after the fight is over. The story was about love, not magic.

If your story is advertised as being about violence, if your audience is there for the violence, if the draw is the rules behind the violence, then your critics are right; your protagonist, like Taylor Hebert, should have taken the gloves off in Chapter 2 and started using the appropriate degree of force without remorse or sympathy. If that doesn't fit the story, you need to cut the first X chapters, making the new Chapter 1 a summary of the events up to that point and the new Chapter 2 the beginning of the first big fight.

If the draw is about the emotions and personalities of your character (meaning that the climax will /also/ be about these things and you will never transition to a violence-based story) then your critics are wrong and they should find something else to read.

Whatever the point of your story is, get there ASAP and don't tease the readers with implications that it might be otherwise. /Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone/ is about love and not fighting, it doesn't pretend its magic system is enough to carry a story, and it doesn't pretend Harry is capable of fighting Voldemort on his own at age 11. /Worm/ doesn't pretend Taylor is restrained, as evidenced by her inflicting life-threatening injuries on a deserving target in Chapter 2.
