everyone talking about the “psychological trauma of taking another life” ignores all the times throughout human history where non-martial people acclimated to killing with extreme, even sudden, rapidity.

i think it is slightly more realistic in the modern era, so it could partially depend on your setting.

that said, the only thing that matters is good writing.
