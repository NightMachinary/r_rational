  If the main character is irrationally against killing to the point that they endanger their friends and loved ones, I get very turned off.

So much this. I watched the first /The Purge/ movie a few weeks back, and I still get angry when I'm reminded of it. The whole main family is so actively stupid they deserved to die, except the father who argues for all the sane decisions - and is naturally the only one to die, after being told over and over again how he's a terrible person for wanting to sacrifice one kidnapper and would be murderer to save four innocent people. And the film ends with the survivors/idiot family members choosing to let a bunch of actual killers-for-pleasure go free without prison time because they want to 'do the right thing'.

Everyone who had significant input on the writing on that movie is a bad person and should never be allowed to create ever again.
