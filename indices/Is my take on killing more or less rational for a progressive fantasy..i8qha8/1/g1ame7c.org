"I don't like this violence" is realistic. Police and military studies will tell you that many (not all) people have great difficulty with killing, especially early on.

Unfortunately, simple doubt and suffering isn't very interesting to read. It doesn't go anywhere, it doesn't change anything, it's pain without meaning.

You can fix that, though. You just have to make it pain /with/ meaning. Show the /change/ it drives. Show the /useful impact/ of the doubt and turmoil.

Show how the turmoil leads to a more effective or unexpected path.

How are your hero's doubts and turmoil interesting? How do they lead to distinctive progress?

Examples:

(1) Troubled by killing, the hero discovers a coworker who also hates it, and they become tight friends in this uncaring world.

(2) Troubled by killing, the hero discovers a way to become a surgeon instead of a soldier.

(3) Troubled by killing, the hero finds someone who can reveal the secret history of how this world went violent.

(4) Troubled by killing, the hero with his questions earns an invitation to a secret spiritual order among the warriors.

(5) Troubled by killing, the hero resolves to win a rank that will let him insist on more mercy and less cruelty in his new people's wars.

If all you've got is, "no, he does what you'd expect, he's just sad about it," then I think you should summarize his sadness the same way you'd summarize his eating, sleeping, and brushing his teeth.

In real life, turmoil happens, and we suffer whether it's interesting or not. In fiction, when turmoil is more than a summary, it should not just be realistic -- it should be interesting.
