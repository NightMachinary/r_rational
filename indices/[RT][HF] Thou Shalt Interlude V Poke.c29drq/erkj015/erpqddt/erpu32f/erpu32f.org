I've never actually read The Gods are Bastards nor The Wandering Inn, so I'm not certain what reference you're referring to. And while web serials are certainly an influence (as that's the format), I read a lot of fantasy. My main physically-published influences are Brandon Sanderson and Jim Butcher, and I aim to replicate how good both are at plotting and writing epic climaxes.
