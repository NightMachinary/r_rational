To expand on this a bit: the system is set up so that the rng will not play a huge role. The results are going to be determined chiefly by the preparation the players put in before the attempt. So don't worry about the rng fouling up a perfectly legitimate strategy: if you munchkin hard enough in preparation, then no rng will stop you. Conversely, if you fail to adequately prepare for a challenge, no rng will save you.
