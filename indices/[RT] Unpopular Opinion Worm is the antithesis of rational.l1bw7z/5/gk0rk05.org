Since somebody else brought this up, an adjacent complaint: the Entities' goal/plan is asinine. It's roughly equivalent to the Pentagon deciding to test the F-35 by breaking up all its systems and distributing them randomly among a bunch of chimps who didn't understand them to see what they did with them. One ape gets the guns, another the sensors, a third the engines, a fourth the computer, and they all bumble around the jungle using these new tricks to dominate each other and secure the territories with the best hunting and fruit trees.

What would that tell you about the performance of the entire plane by a human pilot who understands its purpose and can use all of its abilities together to achieve vastly different ends? The same thing human capes can teach Scion and Eden: bupkus.
