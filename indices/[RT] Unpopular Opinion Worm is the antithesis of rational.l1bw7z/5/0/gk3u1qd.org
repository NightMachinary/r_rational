It's not quite as bad as that. The Entities are extremely uncreative, and while they have picked up a lot of technology from previous species I don't see them working out all the possible interactions on their own. They're also not distributing them at random, and the pieces can talk with each other while everything is happening. So it's closer to a distributed data system than complete disassembly.
