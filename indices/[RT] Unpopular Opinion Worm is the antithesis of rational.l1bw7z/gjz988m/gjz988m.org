This opinion isn't even unpopular ...

But I found this line so baffling that I have to respond to it:

#+begin_quote
  The major plot events are completely unforeseeable. Endbringer came completely out of left field. There was no way for the reader to predict that Endbringer would come, and he went from not-existing to existing in the span of one chapter, so I think that also breaks a core principle of rational fiction.
#+end_quote

Rational fic doesn't mean literally every plot event is predictable. That wouldn't even make sense - every core concept has to be introduced at /some point/. There's no point before the introduction of the Endbringers where you would need to know about them to understand what's going on.

In particular, the reveal of the Endbringers is the /introduction/ of a conflict, not a resolution to anything.
