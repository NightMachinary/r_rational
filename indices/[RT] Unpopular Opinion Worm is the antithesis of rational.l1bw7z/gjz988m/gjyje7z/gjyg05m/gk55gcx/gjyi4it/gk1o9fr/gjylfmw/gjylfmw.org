  Absolutely dog water take. Keep reading. Worm has probably the most rational explanation for powers I've read.

I know that I haven't read enough. I was wrong.

  Balance of power. There's a reason only the baddest and most evil villains actually kill or hurt people, and people know this. Villains in general cannot get away with killing. Besides, you think people mouthing off to their saviors is IRRATIONAL? Just look at 30% of the USA. People consistently act against and lash out at people or groups that actually serve their interests.

I'm not sure I agree with this, but I can definitely see where you're coming from

  Tricks? Tinker powers are very specialized. The only thing mannequin could actually do was create self-sustaining protected biomes. He also had a deathwish. When dying isn't something you try to avoid, you stop trying to actively survive. I'm not really sure what kind of tricks you expect him to have.

I still think that Mannequin was far too underpowered. In order for him to survive in Slaughterhouse 9, he had to have been competent and yet he loses to an amateur villain. IMO, This isn't very internally consistent.

  Once again, not only is it wrong, it's also not a requirement for rational fiction. Endbringers are mentioned at LEAST twice before that.
#+end_quote

Like I've said in other replies, the casual mentions only talk about how the Endbringer exists, and it provides nothing that suggests that Endbringer will come and destroy Brockton Bay.
