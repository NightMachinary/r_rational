1. If that's your criterion then I can't fault you. I have less stringent expectations from protagonists of rational fiction. If they and their biases are consistent and dynamic the way a smart person in their position plausibly could be, it passes my test. No real life human is perfectly rational after all.

2. By that argument none of the fantasy fiction on here is rational fiction. Even the most internally consistent magic system still either "just exist" or were intelligently designed by some super-being.

3. People throw stuff at armed convoys belonging to invading foreign forces IRL.

4. The antagonists lose to a new villain with backing from an old villain. I won't go further due to spoilers. Mannequin is certifiably insane.

5. The Enbringers were foreshadowed multiple times. Like before the bank robbery for instance. They were a part of the setting from the beginning and no less out of left field than a hurricane.
