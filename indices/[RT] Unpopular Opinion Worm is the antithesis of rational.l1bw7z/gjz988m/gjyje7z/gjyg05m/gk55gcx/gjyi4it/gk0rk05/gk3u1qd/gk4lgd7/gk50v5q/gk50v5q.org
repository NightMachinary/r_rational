Well, they're trying to find a way to reverse entropy, so any creative application might get them closer. As for Contessa's power, Path to Victory is hugely expensive, energy-wise; it's just that Contessa has so much less scale that there isn't nearly as much to calculate. So it might take 300 years for the energy well to burn out with her using it instead of a decade, for example.

As for what kind of useful information, well... ultimately it seems like it worked. For whatever reason, Contessa Titan found a bit of information that she was willing to give up in order to protect and pass on to the Entities. Tattletale seems to think it's the answer they've been looking for.
