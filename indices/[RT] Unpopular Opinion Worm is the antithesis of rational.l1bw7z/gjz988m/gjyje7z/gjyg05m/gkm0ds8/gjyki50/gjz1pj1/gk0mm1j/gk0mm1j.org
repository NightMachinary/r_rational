"It's not Chekov's gun if you see a penny on the ground and two days later the penny shows up and shoots you"

Coins don't shoot people. Don't make irrational arguments.

Entities with the name Endbringers in a superhero setting probably deserve the name.You know, doing things like destroying cities. And they wouldn't be much of a threat if they just handed a calendar to the president showing where and what day they are going to attack for the next 300 years.

Skitter thought they were a possibility in attacking the city, Tattletale thought of the idea morbid not silly, showing again that the city being attacked is a very real possibility. Imagine Skitter going

"Tattletale imagine one of the Endbringers attack, oh just in case you haven't heard of them even though you are not a cave girl who just time traveled from 20k BCE. Anyways the Endbringers are monsters who randomly attack cities and stuff, for example Leviathan attacks coastal cities with his water powers. He sank Newfoundland and a chunk of Japan into the sea before, you might not of saw or heard the news about that or noticed all the Japanese refugees. Oh just in case you haven't notice even though you been to the boardwalk, our city is a costal city."
