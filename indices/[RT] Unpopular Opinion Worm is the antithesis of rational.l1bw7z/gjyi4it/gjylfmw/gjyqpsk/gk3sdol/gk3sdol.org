Massive spoilers for both Worm and Ward below

I think I have to disagree with you on this. Given what we learned in Worm about how the S9 was formed and how the Shards are interacting with each other, I don't think it's inconsistent. Mannequin may not have had to go through the same tests as went down in Brockton Bay. The Brockton Bay Trials were a way for Jack to entertain himself, whereas he may have been piqued by the contrast between Mannequin and Sphere already.

Furthermore, as Taylor has the Queen Administrator shard she is going to subconsciously get fed information about the weaknesses of enemy capes. Her shard is designed for information and coordination and will happily pass that information to its host. You see similar things in most of her fights, actually; her ability to detect weakness is probably not just natural ability.

Also, we know that Tinkers are very, very susceptible to planning issues. They can be ridiculously overpowered if they prepare for the right situations, but if they encounter something they haven't already prepared for then it is almost impossible for them to improvise a novel solution. Especially if someone is feeding their enemy hints about their weak points.
