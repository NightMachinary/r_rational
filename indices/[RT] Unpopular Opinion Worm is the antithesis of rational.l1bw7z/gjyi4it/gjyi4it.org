  The world is inconsistent, and there is nothing really rational about powers. They just /exist/. This isn't bad, it's just not rational.
#+end_quote

Absolutely dog water take. Keep reading. Worm has probably the most rational explanation for powers I've read.

#+begin_quote
  The people in the world seemingly have no self-preservation, and they mouth off to a supervillain with SuperEvilBugPowersTM
#+end_quote

Balance of power. There's a reason only the baddest and most evil villains actually kill or hurt people, and people know this. Villains in general cannot get away with killing. Besides, you think people mouthing off to their saviors is IRRATIONAL? Just look at 30% of the USA. People consistently act against and lash out at people or groups that actually serve their interests.

  Mannequin, a superpowered robot, fails to do any sort of planning, and loses to spider silk
#+end_quote

Tricks? Tinker powers are very specialized. The only thing mannequin could actually do was create self-sustaining protected biomes. He also had a deathwish. When dying isn't something you try to avoid, you stop trying to actively survive. I'm not really sure what kind of tricks you expect him to have.

  evidence building up to major plot events (if I can look back at earlier chapters, I can see the event happening)
#+end_quote

Adjacent trope, not a requirement.

#+begin_quote
  The major plot events are completely unforeseeable. Endbringer came completely out of left field. There was no way for the reader to predict that Endbringer would come, and he went from not-existing to existing in the span of one chapter, so I think that also breaks a core principle of rational fiction
#+end_quote

Once again, not only is it wrong, it's also not a requirement for rational fiction. Endbringers are mentioned at LEAST twice before that.
