Wildbow have stated that worm isn't rational so you seem to be barking at a dead horse. That said

"Having not yet read half of the story I can confidently assert that there is no information in the remaining book that could possibly make the setting internally consistent"

If you really want it spoiled read [[https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Entity][here]]. Worm does a good job at creating a internally consistent world in which superpowered people in capes hit others like them, though at your point you lack the information to see the underlying reasons.
