Taylor tries to figure out solutions to her problems, in life and in battle, rather than waiting for a Voice of Wisdom to tell her the Author's Approved Answer.

Taylor tries (clumsily!) to make her life and her world better, rather than accepting that Just Because I Have Superpowers Doesn't Mean I Should Actually Try To Fix Things.

Taylor lives in a world where masked superheroes mostly feel like a force of actual chaos and social breakdown, rather than Somehow The World Isn't Changed.

Those three are what makes /Worm/ rational-appealing for a lot of people.

As you say, there are a lot of anti-rational elements. Taylor is /not/ sensible about her life choices outside battle tactics. The justification for the repeated failures of cooperation is mostly hidden from the reader until very late. Taylor keeps hitting world-scale people and issues like the Endbringers, for reasons that have a lot more to do with a fun story than justified logic.

But a story where the POV actually /tries to figure out answers while we're reading/ is so rare that /Worm/ ends up feeling rational-appealing to a lot of us anyway.

So if your definition is "how sensible is this hero?", /Worm/ isn't rational.

If your definition is "how likely is this series of events?", /Worm/ isn't rational.

But maybe your definition is "how much does the story approve of trying to figure out answers? Of using your situation to make your life and world better?" In that case, /Worm/ is definitely a rational-adjacent delight.
