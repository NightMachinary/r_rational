I agree that the Endbringers aren't really foreshadowed in the text. That said, I'm willing to forgive this for the most part, because they're foreshadowed by the genre. Monsters so dangerous that they force the strongest heroes and villains in the world to team up to fight them are a staple of superhero fiction---for instance, Thanos, Ultron, Doomsday, Darkseid, and more. I didn't see Leviathan coming, but IMO, it still felt like he fit into the setting once his role became clear at the beginning of arc 8. He's one of the Doomsdays of the Wormverse, one of the kaiju.
