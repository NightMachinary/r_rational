  Coins don't shoot people. Don't make irrational arguments

That was actually the point I was making. Nobody expects coins to shoot people the same way nobody expects mentioning the Endbringers in conversation summons them.

While I don't disagree with the point that foreshadowing isn't required for rationality, and that I was wrong in believing otherwise, I think my metaphor was pretty apt in explaining why mentioning the Endbringers in passing didn't make the attack forseeable
