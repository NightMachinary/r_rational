Man, I'm really liking where this is headed in terms of genre and story tone. I'm a sucker for both mad scientist driven pulp adventure and private detective skulkery. With a techno-marvel car to boot.

One bit of subtle world building - Velo has a flip phone. I can't think of anything in particular that would have impeded the advent of candy bar smartphones, especially since drones, the NSX, and Delphic being able to live and operate on the internet are taken for granted by everyone. Could be that Velo just has a particular preference for flip phones, or he decided to buy a burner for calling the illicit power enhancing agency.

Or, you're getting reeeeeaaaal deep here, and the presence of the flip phone along with the NSX taking months to order (when in reality I think they sold literally 5 last month) is meant to imply something about the overall structure and national competitiveness of different nation's technology sectors following the alternate ending of WW2 you've previously outlined. After all, it's a bit weird for a Detroit resident to be lusting after a Japanese super car. One would probably expect a ZR1/Viper/Ford GT or something else domestic.
