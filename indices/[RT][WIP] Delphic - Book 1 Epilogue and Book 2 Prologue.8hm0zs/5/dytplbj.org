*(figuratively) rolling on the floor laughing* /Delphic!/ Of all peop/le, Del/phic is using the excuse that using the Inter/net leaves damning reco/rds! Ah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah! If they could hear him, the people who've been fruitlessly trying to fin/d a GIANT HUMAN-LEVEL INTELLIG/ENCE hidden in the Internet for as many years as he'd been public would want to throttle him!

"Oh gods! He lifts all our most top-secret information straight from our systems without leaving the slightest trace that he was ever in them! And now he's telling us he can't do anything discreetly because it /leaves damning records!/ Ahhh!"

I am sleepy. I am very sleepy now. I am also happy! And happy to read these Delphic things!

*finishes reading* I'm very curious regarding whether the woken individual has memory loss, and if not then /where the data was stored/.
