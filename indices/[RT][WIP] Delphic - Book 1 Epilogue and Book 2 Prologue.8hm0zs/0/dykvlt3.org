Two excellent chapters. Very entertaining and satisfying. Feels like several momentous events occurred.

I've been enjoying your story for a while. This is the first I've commented. One thing that hit me as a bit strange was how "easily" Delphic resolved the NSA threat. Everything worked out so perfectly for him in just a few chapters. I'm always happy to see things go well for the protagonist and I like when the plot moves along quickly, but it had a bit of too-good-to-be-true feeling to it.

Please keep it up!
