Reductionism, with respect to personal identity, is the idea that "the self" doesn't exist. Put simply, what we call "the self" is /reducible/ to simpler components.

What this boils down to is that Tom Riddle's desire to never die is perfectly compatible with his apparent death (in the conventional sense), because he chooses to identify himself not as "a particular subjective point of view" but as a /pattern/, and not simply as a pattern predominantly composed of experiences and memories (as most reductionists would) but as a pattern predominantly composed of beliefs and values (what we might call "Death Eater-ism").

The most thorough work on (identity) reductionism is probably Derek Parfit's /Reasons and Persons/, but you could probably commit murder with a hardcover edition, so I would recommend /Personal Identity and Buddhism/ by Mark Siderits for a more approachable work that isn't (checks book) 500+ pages with a tiny font.

(This is my attempt to explain some of what's going on with Riddle without (a) spoiling future story developments or (b) writing a dissertation on the topic, which I guess could be fun but... I'd say "but it probably wouldn't be of interest to anybody here," except that I said that about the Margaret Thatcher letter and was proven wrong on that count, lol)
