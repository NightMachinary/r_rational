Thank you!

Now that I'm out of grad school, probably the only thing that'll actually kill this story is just...not getting any kind of reader engagement (which seems unlikely, because engagement has been pretty steady). There's a risk of burnout too, I guess, but the publishing rate gives me enough breathing room to work on other projects too (at present: an original fiction novel, some worldbuilding resources, and another Harry Potter AU that'll be /much/ shorter than TINTF).
