â€œOther Faces" is more like a collection of related stories, but folks have bookmarked it so I'm reluctant to just dissolve it. You don't have to read any of the earlier stories to make sense of TINTF.

(I'll probably reach out to the people who've bookmarked and let them know I'm reorganizing things, but for now I've just got a notice on the description that its days are numbered)
