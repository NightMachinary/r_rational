Some short stories published in print media, a lot more that are in the pipeline, and a couple of Creative Commons flash fics [[https://wmbsaltworks.wordpress.com/category/fiction/][here]].

I also have a lot of worldbuilding resources [[https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/10909/WMB-Saltworks][here]], and a (dead) serial called [[https://heroessavetheworld.wordpress.com/][Heroes Save the World]], which petered out mostly because I was in grad school + homeless.
