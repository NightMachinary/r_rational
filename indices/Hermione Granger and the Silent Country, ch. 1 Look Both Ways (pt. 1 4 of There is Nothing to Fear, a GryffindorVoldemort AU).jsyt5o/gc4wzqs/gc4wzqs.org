I love this series, but as I recommended it to a friend the other day I struggled to properly explain why. Part of it is the worldbuilding of course, everything seems thought through and both taking from and building on canon in clever ways. But there is something else that is really drawing me in - I can't tell if it's the story or writing style or what, I'm just absorbed when reading. I'll try to figure it out, but for now I'll just say kudos and please keep writing.

My favorite detail so far is the Roman Wizarding Republic - "not Roman, not really a Republic, but at least a Wizarding" is how it remember it going. Funny and clever.
