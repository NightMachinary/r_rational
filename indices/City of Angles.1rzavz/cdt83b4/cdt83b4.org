I liked it and found it very enjoyable to read, but I thought one issue it had was with the world being too unpredictable. Its not good for a plot to be too predictable, but when it is impossible to see coming, as in completely new things are introduced right before the ending, that grates on me. I've found this problem in other of this author's stories as well. Its not deus ex machina's at all, its more the reader not being able to predict the world at all, or know enough of it to guess.
