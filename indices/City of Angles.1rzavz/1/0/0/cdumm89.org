[[#s][ending]] and I'm not sure what else, but I remember having the feeling of having no idea where it was going. It just seemed like new elements of the setting or the world were constantly being introduced, which isn't a bad thing, but with it and the book after it like new stuff is being put in and every new thing will affect what happens. I read that author's Anachronauts series right after that though, so I might be transferring some of my impressions from that.
