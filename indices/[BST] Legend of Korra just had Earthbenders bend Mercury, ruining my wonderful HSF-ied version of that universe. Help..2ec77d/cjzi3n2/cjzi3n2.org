I'm going to go rain on the parade a little and question the basic premise of trying to combine bending with modern chemistry in general. It feels a bit like a fake answer, to explain bending with 'it's because they can manipulate SiO2!', because that just shunts the issue from 'how can they manipulate dirt?' to 'how can they manipulate Silicon Dioxide?'. No real analysis is really given, it's pretty much the exact same equivalent of dropping 'because god' as the final answer to a question.

This is a world where spirits exist and a spirit world exists somehow parallel to our own, which was somehow split apart from the real world at some point in the setting's past. I don't think it'd be too strange to postulate an alternate underlying set of physics that doesn't utilize our concepts of electrons and atoms and whatnot. Can't there be some sort of physics that involves spiritually-essential fundamental particles, like fundamental Water particles, or fundamental Earth particles, in the setting? It's not like elements are fundamentally complicated like minds are, they can still have particular properties that match their equivalents in the real world without having the same reasons for reacting the way they do as they do in the real world.

From that standpoint, it's not hard to see why the metal would also be controllable by waterbenders. The liquid metal and water share the property of being liquid at room temperature and pressure, and I don't think it'd be all that irrational to worldbuild your story such that these properties are associated with a fundamental spiritual essence of water.

This is all just a suggestion, of course. If you're going to work with explaining magic, though, explaining it by saying 'well it's because chemistry' doesn't always make for the most interesting or even realistic process. Modern knowledge of chemistry is merely the RESULT of the application of the scientific method to /our/ universe. The application of the scientific method to a different universe's physics may well yield- and ought to yield, in my opinion- completely different underlying mechanics of How Things Work.
