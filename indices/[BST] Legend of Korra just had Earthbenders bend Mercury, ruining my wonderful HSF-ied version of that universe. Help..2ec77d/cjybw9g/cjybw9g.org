Why not go the simple route: it's states, dependent on a combination of the bonding energy or density of a substance at the molecular level, that determine what can be bent by a given style of bending.

What "can't be bent" is based on mental blocks society has taught, or some strange quirk.

Don't hand-wave it but find/make some good or suedo-physics that can be used in your head to explain why these substances are easiest to generate a macro scale quantum effect that is "bending" first sudo-science that comes to mind is that the a fractal pattern the brain/effect can map to and influence, (it helps as it means the brain isn't affecting molecules individually it's affecting a pattern it somehow corresponds with) and a bender's versatility is based on the level of variation they can apply the pattern.

*tldr* Make it work for you, Ang is the way the physics says benders should be, because physical forces work on ally elements just to lesser and greater effects, benders can only do one style, because they have trained into it and you have to train to get brains to impose a quantum effect.
