I'm not a huge follower of avatar but that's why I went with state and densities. Also the unlerlying universality of bending would explain that these are extensions of the same pattern. I'd wadger it doesn't happen in the series but that you could have a water bender, a firebender, and a earthbender bend lava using diffrent mechanism. The earth bender might have trouble because they aren't used to having to impose stability when they want something to not move, and the firebender would have trouble because they are using the escaping plasma to guide it, and the water bender being challenged by how incredibly dense it is but that they could all do it, but its insanely hard if its not their traditional mapping.
