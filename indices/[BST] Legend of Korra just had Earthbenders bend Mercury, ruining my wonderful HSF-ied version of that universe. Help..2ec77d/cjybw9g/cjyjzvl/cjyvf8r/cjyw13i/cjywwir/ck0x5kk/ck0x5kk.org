  I'd wadger it doesn't happen in the series but that you could have a water bender, a firebender, and a earthbender bend lava using diffrent mechanism.

It actually does happen. Firebenders can manipulate the heat within the lava, cooling and heating it. When they cool it, the heat appears to go out through their other hand, as if conducted through them.

They haven't been shown controlling its movement, despite frequently being in situations where that would be useful. Earth benders can bend the lava itself.

In the sequel, which (i think) has been slightly more liberal with the extent to which they add additional fantasy elements in the middle of the plot, two earthbenders so far can heat earth into lava. Visually, it looks as though they're doing this by twisting it around until the friction gets it really hot, though that's open to interpretation.

Nothing so far with waterbenders and lava, but both waterbenders and earthbenders can work with mud.

In general, Avatar is actually fairly "rational" to begin with as far as kids shows go. They do generally explore the limits of the alterations made to the universe, and most of the little exploits you'd immediately think of do eventually happen.
