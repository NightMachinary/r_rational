fire would be more complicated than that. If fire was just burning electrons, then you wouldnt see it, as it needs to be hot enough to emit quite a bit of visible light. Also, if you gave firebenders control over electrons, then they are vastky more powerful than anyone else in the show. Maybe control over oxygen/nitrogen ions and creation of ions? Makes fire and lightning, I think, they cant do ither stuff with it, and would create heat from recombining bonds. Also, explains the charge up time for lightning.
