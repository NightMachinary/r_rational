  If you have control over electrons, you strip the electrons from the bonds in CO2 in the air so you get elemental carbon (and possibly molecular oxygen, possibly single atoms of oxygen) this would then naturally react with oxygen in the air in the same way that burning coal would.

Ha, that's actually /exactly/ the solution I had in mind.

It's especially important that the /carbon/ is ripped out, because the orange-yellow color of flames comes from the carbon spectra.

I still haven't worked out how Azula's doing the color thing, but note that hydrogen flames are blue and have a tactical advantage of being very hard to see, and there is hydrogen in the air, sort of. Or the carbon might just be more excited, I'm pretty sure carbon has a blue band.
