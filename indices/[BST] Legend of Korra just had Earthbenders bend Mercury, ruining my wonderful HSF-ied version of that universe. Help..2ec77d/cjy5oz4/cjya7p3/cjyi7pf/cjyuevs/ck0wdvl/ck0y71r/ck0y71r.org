You can color flames with additional elements and compounds, but combusting hydrocarbons, which most of our flames are, create a flame that gets its color solely from black body radiation. Thats why you can have mutliple colors from burning the same material, because a more efficient burn yields higher heat and an emission spectra that peaks towards the upper regions of the visible spectrum
