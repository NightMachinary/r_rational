  It feels a bit like a fake answer, to explain bending with 'it's because they can manipulate SiO2!

But what is an "explanation", after all, but a simpler description than the one which existed before?

  I don't think it'd be too strange to postulate an alternate underlying set of physics that doesn't utilize our concepts of electrons and atoms and whatnot.

No, you're right, it wouldn't be strange. But I cannot write the rules of that physics from the ground up, whereas I /can/ borrow the rules of our current physics.

You could make a really fun "soft" fiction with completely different rules, but the only way to make a "hard" fiction with an entirely new physics is to really write the physics and think through all the implications beforehand. The scientific method is a bit weird in a "soft" fiction because you're making up the physics on-the-fly and it's really tempting to just have the results be whatever is convenient for the plot.

In my opinion, one of the things that make "hard" sci fi and fantasy fun to read and write is that you aren't allowed the flexibility to introduce plot elements willy nilly, because you have to have a fairly well defined world /before/ you create a plot.
