Declare that in your universe, the substance known as "mercury" contains silicon dioxide. Or just that there was a bit of silicon dioxide mixed in to permit its movement (I don't know exactly what happened in the show).

Or take the approach I did with Pottermore and declare that you follow canon up until the point published when you started your fic, but no more unless you feel like it.
