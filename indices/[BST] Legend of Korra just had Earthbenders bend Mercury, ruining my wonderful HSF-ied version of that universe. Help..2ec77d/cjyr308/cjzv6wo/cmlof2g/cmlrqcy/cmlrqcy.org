Eh, it makes for good television.

Incidentally, four episodes into the next season and seven in-universe months later, it turned out she still had what looked to be about 30mL of the stuff in her (definitely more than the fatal dose of 1 mL), which was apparently too little to be noticed by the world's best living healer and bloodbender, too little to activate her emergency Avatar mode (which activates when her life is threatened and removes the threat, explicitly including normally fatal poisons), and leaves her weaker than normal but still pretty decent.
