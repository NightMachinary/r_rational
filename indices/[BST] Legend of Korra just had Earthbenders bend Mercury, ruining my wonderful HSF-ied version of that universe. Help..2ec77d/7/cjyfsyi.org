Personally I always imagined that science!waterbenders manipulate hydrogen bonds. That's why they can control water and change its state so easily. I have no idea how firebenders, earthbenders, and airbenders operate.

In the show though bending definetly involves a spiritual component. The air nomads were all airbenders because they were more in tune with their spirituality. Don't know how much of that you'll put into your fix though.
