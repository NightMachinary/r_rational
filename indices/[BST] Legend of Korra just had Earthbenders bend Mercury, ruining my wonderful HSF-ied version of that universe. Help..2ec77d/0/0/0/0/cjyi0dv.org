Well, I think you're probably right because of the mercury bit, unless that was just oversight. However, I had the feeling that back when they were writing TLA they intended to stay with the impurities thing being necessary, especially because of platinum being unbendable.

It doesn't need to be reductionist, but it /does/ need to operate based on logical rules. (The distinction being, a logical but non-reductionist universe might have complex laws. "Conscious beings can bend elements to their will in X, Y, Z ways" is a law implicitly containing a lot of complexity, but it's still essentially logical").

Bending and spirits aside, their physics seems /mostly/ the same. They've got stuff like mercury and nitroglycerin and it seems to work the same way as it does in our world. I think the best way to model it is our world, but with an overlapping spirit realm from which stem /additional/ laws.
