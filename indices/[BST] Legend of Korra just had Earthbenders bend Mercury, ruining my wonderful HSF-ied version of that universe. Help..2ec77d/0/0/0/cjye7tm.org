I'm not sure how canon it is, but I always thought that "sensing the impurities in the metal" was sort of metalbending with training wheels, and the true form involved actually bending the metal itself instead of the impurities. This is somewhat backed up by the show and the comics.

Of course, in the show, their physics work differently, and I think the world is best understood as actually being composed of spirits and the four elements rather than trying to go reductionist - but that is probably not the story you're trying to tell.
