Yeah, that was one of the few areas of the season where I felt that being on Nickelodeon constrained them from telling the story they wanted to tell - you could see that they wanted that explosion to be more "complete" than it was. I had just binge-watched Pyscho-Pass before the finale though, so maybe my expectations for disturbing imagery had been pumped too high.
