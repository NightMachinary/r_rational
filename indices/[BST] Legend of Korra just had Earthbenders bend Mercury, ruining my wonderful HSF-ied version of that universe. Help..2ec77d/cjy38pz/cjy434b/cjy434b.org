Not a bad idea, (although I'm not sure why waterbenders should be allowed to bend salt ions. Also, post munchkin that could potentially make waterbenders even more powerful than they already are.)

I mean, I guess there is no reason why there shouldn't just be a weird quirk where Earthbenders can bend mercury, in addition to SiO2, and whatever those two things have in common that Earthbenders can bend both of them could be left a mystery (and I guess that having the characters wonder about this would be a subtle little jab at the canon for doing it that way). It's not very elegant, but reality isn't always.
