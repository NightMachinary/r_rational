Why not give each bender a small range of things they can possibly bend due to how they manipulate things.

Most would be good at the basic particles you listed at the beginning, but others can branch out in their range to specialize in mercury and similar particles if they practice with them enough. The basic particles are easiest to learn to bend, and some are harder than others so only masters do, which would explain why some people don't know about it.

You could leave their range of particles somewhat mysterious in case the show adds more in the future. It's not exactly perfectly rational, but you always have to give a little when explaining magic.
