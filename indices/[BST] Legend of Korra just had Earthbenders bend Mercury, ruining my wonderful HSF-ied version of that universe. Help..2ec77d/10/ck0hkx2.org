I did not read the other comments, but this is my take on Avatar and any RationalFic of it:

I don't think you should have our periodic table. I don't think Oxygen and Nitrogen and Electrons are a thing in that universe. It's a universe with Spirits of Good and Evil, it's a universe where the moon is a spirit, and so is the sea, it's a universe where souls knowably exist, etc.

So I say /roll with it/. Benders don't bend /elements/, they bend the /idea/ of an element. Or rather, earth /is/ in fact a fundamental element, as fundamental as Oxygen or Helium are in our world; same goes for air, fire, and water. That world is one where thoughts and ideas have physical form, are ontologically basic. I think trying to put chemical elements and our science in it will feel... /forced/. Not natural. It's not the point of the story, and it doesn't feel a part of it.

So the reason earth benders can bend this or that and can't bend that or this isn't because they can bend SiO2 or anything. It's because they can bend /earth impurities/, and earth is a fundamental element.

Or something like that. In a world where there is a spirit for /everything/, I'm not entirely certain that the thing and the idea of a thing are different.

To make the rationalist in me sing: write a story where the map /is/ the territory. Where map and territory affect each other mutually and aren't different things even in principle. In our world, the map /isn't/ the territory, and we develop our rationality techniques around that; in a world where it is, what would you have to learn?
