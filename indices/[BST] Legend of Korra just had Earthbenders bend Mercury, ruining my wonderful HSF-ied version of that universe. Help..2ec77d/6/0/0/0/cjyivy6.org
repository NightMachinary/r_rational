Yeah, I was going to attempt to get around that by limiting the level of control they have over said electrons.

N2-O2 splitting may work better. I'd have to think about how it would work, if it would actually look like fire, if it could make lightening, and so on.

I'm not sure there are any elegant answers here. Would it be weird if fire-benders can just generate heat, light, and electricity at will?
