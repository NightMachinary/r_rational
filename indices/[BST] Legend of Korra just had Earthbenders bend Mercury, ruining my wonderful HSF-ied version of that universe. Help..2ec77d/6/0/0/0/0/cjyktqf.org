You could also have them able to produce plasma, which works decently and is simpler than some other answers, even if it isnt as reductionist.

Splitting n2 would yield a huge amount of heat when it recombines, as the n2 triple bond is one of the strongest in nature. Then if they could control the ions after splitting them, maybe you could make a charge gradient to produce electricity, I think. Electricity isnt my strong suit.

I think any of these answer is preferable to having firebenders be severely restricted matter manipulators compared to the other benders who control a few molecules or elements at most. It would be really hard to have a plot when a strong firebender can rip your molecules apart, shoot you with lasers, make impossible materials, and electrocute you.
