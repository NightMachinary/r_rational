They can destroy molecules with fire, but they cant look at you and have you explode a la Watchmen, and they dont have lasers at all. But yeah, they do have electricity. I think the chemistry approach is really good, as it allows a wide range of possibilities, but isnt inherently op. Maybe they have ion control and also very precise control over heat? This allows some creative stuff that isnt electron control. Idk, maybe ion control alone is good enough.
