Firebenders can /already/ shoot you with lasers, rip molecules apart, and electrocute you, in canon.

The implication that [[#s][spoiler]] is a rather major plot point. It doesn't even matter how firebending works exactly - the fact that they can /somehow/ control lightening in canon means it's possible to do to at least some extent no matter how it works precisely. [[#s][spoiler]]

But you're right, I don't intend to make it possible for firebenders to make impossible materials, manipulate all matter in general, or mess with the nucleus at all. All they have is a /blunt/ control of electrons - and explicitly /not/ the matter that the electrons are attached to. And for that, it doesn't relaly matter if they bend electrons directly, or control charges through some sort of proxy like splitting a specific molecule or something.
