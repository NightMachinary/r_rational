I understand now. Also you are right about the concentration, which I hadn't considered. In order to get a stoichiometric Carbon flame you'd need to increase the concentration significantly. Even a candle is 96-97% efficient, so with .04% CO2 in the atmosphere compared to 21% O2 you're going to have a bad time.

Actually, if you can split the CO2 fast enough, then you simply break it and recombine it over and over again - you need to concentrate to keep the flame going but it would work I think.
