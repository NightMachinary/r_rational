I feel like we're basically saying the same thing. Fire is a slightly ionized gas that is fairly hot, but it isnt a full explanation if you just say "firebenders control electrons", as you actually need to give a reason as to how the fire is created. Also, co2 isnt at a very large concentration in our atmosphere, which is why I said that n2 or o2 ion control would work a little more, and even if you could separate out the carbon from co2, it wouldnt recombine unlese heated sufficiently. However, if you could separate nitrogen from itself, it woulf react extremely violently and produce a gas hot enough to look like fire.

The reason I said that firebenders should control nitrogen and oxygen ions as opposed to electrons comes down to balance. Not balance in the sense of "I dont want firebenders to be more powerful" but more like "I dont want firebenders to be gods amongst insects compared to the other benders". If you control electrons, you are basically a matter manipulator, as most of the characteristics of matter come from how electrons interact. A master "firebender" would rearrange matter with a thought, dissolve any possible enemy at a molecular level, have energy weapons on the level of nuclear weapons, be able to make new types of matter with almost any desired property, and many more. Compared to airbenders who could maybe make a tornado or strong blasts of wind, or any other benders that would only be slightly different.

This is why firebenders should only be allowed to make ions from molecules in the air, as it would basically allow what is seen in the show with maybe a few extra powers, and doesnt completely break the world once firebenders realize how their power works.
