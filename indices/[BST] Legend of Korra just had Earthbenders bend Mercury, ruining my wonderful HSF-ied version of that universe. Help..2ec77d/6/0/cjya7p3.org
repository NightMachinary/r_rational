Fire is *not* more complicated. As I understand it fire is a plasma - gas which is hot enough to be ionised and the light given off is a combination of thermal radiation ('cause it's really hot) and electron emission (which is why you get different coloured flames when you spray salts into a flame). If you have control over electrons, you strip the electrons from the bonds in CO2 in the air so you get elemental carbon (and possibly molecular oxygen, possibly single atoms of oxygen) this would then naturally react with oxygen in the air in the same way that burning coal would. You can even handwave the "needing a source of flame"-bit as requiring some way to heat up the carbon to get it to react (carefully ignoring the fact that single atoms will react instantly while larger lumps of carbon generally dont).

As for needing heat, the heat is supplied by the recombination of the atoms, this is exactly what makes normal fire hot. And you can create even more heat simply by moving the electrons around a lot (lightning is apparently around 30,000K).

If you have control over electrons you have control over everything we can control with technology except nuclear (powerplants|bombs|radiation|etc.). All of our technology is based on the electromagnetic force=moving electrons around (bar nuclear*), so anything we can do with technology from creating fire to sending information to space and back you can do by controlling electrons. And I think the author knows this by the "munchkin that to the fullest extent" comment.
