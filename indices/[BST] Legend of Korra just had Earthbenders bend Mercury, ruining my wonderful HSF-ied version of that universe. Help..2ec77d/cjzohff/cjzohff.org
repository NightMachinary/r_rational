My advice would be to give up and declare that canonical bending can't really coexist with real world physics. Come up with a basic, uncomplicated alternative system of physics that gels with the idea of bending and arbitrarily justify any inconsistencies this creates.

Aristotlean physics is a pretty good basis. Four elemental atoms and all that. Maybe make spirit the fifth atom.
