I've done something similar to this in a fiction universe I made for a roleplaying game. However in my universe the Hydrokinetics controlled H2O, the Psammokinetics controlls SiO2, Ventrokinetics controlled N2 and Pyrokinetic controlled O2. This meant that pyrokinetics were actually feeding the flames to control their shape, direction and intensity rather than controlling the flame itself directly. I also had a X-kinetic ability for pretty much any chemical with that super high level of ubiquitousness.
