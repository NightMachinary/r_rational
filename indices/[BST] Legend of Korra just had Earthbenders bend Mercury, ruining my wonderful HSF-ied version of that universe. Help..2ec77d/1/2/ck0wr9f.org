Unfortunately, this is ruled out due to what happened in the show.

I know you said you haven't seen it, but people who presumably have seen it are up-voting so I'll briefly explain why it's ruled out: The Avatar was poisoned by the substance when the bad guys infused it through her skin, after which the Earthbenders drew the substance directly out of her tissues. Her tissues would have acted as a sieve. SiO2 isn't toxic. If what was drawn out was SiO2, the toxin remains behind. We /could/ have the unnamed substance which looks awfully similar to mercury be a poisonous compound bound to SiO2, but then we'd have to say that SiO2 can permeate tissue, which it really can't.
