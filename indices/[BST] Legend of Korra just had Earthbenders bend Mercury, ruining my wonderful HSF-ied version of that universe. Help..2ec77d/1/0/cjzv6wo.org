What happened was the following:

#+begin_quote
  benders of indeterminate type bend ~3 liters of unusually reflective liquid (don't remember if it's completely opaque) towards Korra, placing it on her arms and legs

  the liquid fully disappears, leaving the skin visually intact but causing Korra to gasp in pain

  Jinora witnesses this in astral projection form

  Korra experiences hallucinations, is forced into the Avatar State (natural defense mechanism of Avatars; power and skills increase, but Avatar becomes more animalistic and focussed on survival. Can apparently purge poison with focus)

  Fight breaks out, Korra escapes. Korra experiences physical weakness, finally collapses because the fight means she can't focus.

  Jinora calls a metalbender to remove the poison, saying the poison is metallic.

  metalbender moves hands, the visually same liquid as before comes out of korra's mouth)

  two weeks later, Korra is still confined to a wheelchair. Doesn't seem to move extremities, but it could be explained by the inherent simplicity of animation.

Notably, waterbenders who have well-established healing powers (put water, preferably "pure", over an injury (indeterminate red sore spots, because kid's show). Focus. The water starts to glow and make a noise. Injury disappears), and "bloodbending" (capable of moving human bodies like puppets and causing them to float, without causing injury), but despite a waterbender being present neither were used.
