If you didn't like season three, I doubt I'll change your mind, but here's what I liked about it:

- They removed all the relationship stuff that wasn't working.
- They added in character development for Bolin that I think was handed really well, culminating in the final episode.
- They created some really compelling villains (who also weren't wholly unsympathetic).
- They expanded the bending powers in ways that were logical and long-theorized.
- They put some new twists on old locations and somewhat returned to the adventure format of the previous series.
- The fight choreography was stunningly well done - it's always been a high point of the series, but I think in this season it was taken to another level. You could compare and contrast the airbending styles of Tenzin and Zaheer to see their philosophies in action.
- The finale specifically had so many cool "oh shit" moments - cool deaths, cool bending.

I'm not going to pretend it was perfect, but the original series wasn't either. The first two seasons were marred by large issues that I felt the third was almost entirely devoid of.
