It's one of those things that I'm not sure you're going to be able to make work. It's clearly mercury, not just in form, but in the symptoms (though the volume was a little extreme). The platinum thing is also troubling, since you should be able to form unmetalbendable bonds out of any metal that's had the impurities refined out of it. So it's going to be difficult to be truly coherent if you want to involve actual physics instead of just having more vague rules in place (like the show does).

On the other hand, this episode was some really great story-telling, and I think returned this show to the heights it hit during the original series. So I don't think it would be good to uncanonize it for your fic.
