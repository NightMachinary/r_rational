The current point-of-divergence is shortly after Aang defeats the Fire Lord and the events of The Search, of which the episode is downstream anyhow - though I'll certainly be using the characters and borrowing some plotlines.

The inconsistencies with the mercury really do bother me. They went through /so much trouble/ to clarify how metalbending wasn't really bending metal but manipulation of bits of earth stuck in the metal, despite how it would be really easy to just handwave and say that metal actually is Earth...in fact, up until today I was fairly certain that the writers had actually intended Earth to be SiO2 all along. But then, after /all that/, they just go ahead and let characters bend something which is all metallic down to the atomic level straight through Korra's bodily tissues in a manner that is completely impossible to explain via impurities, in total violation of everything set up prior. (And how do they even figure out that it's a metal poison in the first place?)

That aside, I totally agree about this episode being amazing, both in story-telling and in execution.
