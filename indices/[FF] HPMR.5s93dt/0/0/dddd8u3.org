It is an old fanfic of mine that was partly inspired by HPMoR (mostly its abbreviation). Of course, here the HP stands for Hewlett Packard and MR stands for an incorrect misname of Ronald McDonald (a similar mistake to calling Link by the name Zelda).

I explored similar rationalist themes in this short fanfic such as the merging of science and magic and its inevitable consequence: magic AIs. Ronald, as everyone knows, has chaotic reality warping powers: he is thus a fitting arch-nemesis to Hewlett Packard and his magic science.
