Dungeon Keeper is a game where you play at managing a dungeon by getting monsters and killing the good guys that explore the dungeon.

Sailor Moon is an anime about hero transforming school girls.

I've read a good chunk of the story while knowing nothing about Dungeon Keeper and only knowing about Sailor Moon through like memes and second hand sources. I can say that as the story progresses a fair amount can be inferred and a quick pop into wiki can help.

It's pretty good.
