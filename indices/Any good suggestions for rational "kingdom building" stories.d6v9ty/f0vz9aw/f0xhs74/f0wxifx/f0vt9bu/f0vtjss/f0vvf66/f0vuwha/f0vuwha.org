I had no foreknowledge of Sailor Moon and still enjoyed this story. It's competently written, and so long as you keep reading past your confusion you'll eventually pick up all the worldbuilding you need to know. A gripe I had was that she seemed to get shoved on the side of the â€˜bad guys' by author fiat more than actual character decisions and natural plot points, but it's easy to look past.
