Various fanfiction links reminded me of [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/factory-isolation-si-multicross.404479/][Factory Isolation]], factorio/others crossover.

MC is isekaed onto a biter planet, and given the controls of self replicating machine of war. Eventually he reaches other dimensions with poor living conditions and starts building a kingdom for refugees. Complete.

I found it a surprisingly fun read for this subgenre.
