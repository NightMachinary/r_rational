Note: Not all of my recommendations are good and very few are actually complete. Also, you will have to sort through it to find what you are looking for.

Personal Favorites:

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/19690/out-of-space][Out of Space]] - Not a very detailed magic system or even good grammar, but makes up for it with content.

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/19610/dah-ork-life][Dah Ork Life!]] - a warhammer 40k self insert, although not rational it is pretty funny.

- [[https://www.novelupdates.com/series/release-that-witch/][Release That Witch]] - if you can stand the translation it probably fits what you want the most, though with the large chapter count it does tend to drag in places. I've finished it and it was worth it.

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/18594/cultivating-civilization][Cultivating Civilization]] - might fall under "all my enemies are just stupid" but otherwise good.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/infrastructure-an-illustrated-original-work.209283/][Infrastructure]] very dry, lacking in character interaction. But look, Pictures!

Others:

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/saurons-world-lord-of-the-rings-fanfiction.589980/][Sauron's World]] - Same author as infrastructure

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15756/i-am-urist-book-2-start][I am Urist]] - Haven't read and doesn't look like there is modern knowledge otherwise but fits otherwise.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/fae-is-foul-sao-znt-crossover.252187/][Fae is Foul]] - has hints of industrialization like every twenty chapters.

- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/halkegenia-online-thread-24-please-stand-by.17386/page-263#post-12974511][Halkegenia Online]] same as fae is foul, a lot more content.

- [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/d6v9ty/any_good_suggestions_for_rational_kingdom/][A Young Woman's Political Record]]

There are a few in ASoIaF (I think):

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-song-of-ice-and-fires-that-werent-all-my-fault-asoiaf-dresden-files.336][A Song of Ice and Fires That Weren't All My fault]] - Has some (not much) future knowledge use.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-westerosi-asoiaf.393327/][The Westerosi]] - probably what you want but will take a while to get there.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-westerosi-ii-subprime-directives-asoiaf-star-trek-ish.561856/][The Westerosi II: Subprime Directives]]

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-farmers-tale-asoiaf.608353/][A Farmer's Tale]] - basically slowly introducing technology, didn't get very far in this one.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-king-in-the-long-night-asoiaf-got-stellaris-uplift-project.578392/][The King in the Long Night]] - Didn't get far in this one either but looks good.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/asoiaf-greyjoy-alla-breve-si.352019/][Greyjoy alla Breve]] Only recommending this because of how much modern knowledge he has (wikipedia in his head or something?) didn't read it myself because it's a self insert.

If you can stand ponies:

- [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/403715/zebrican-warlord][Zebrican Warlord]] - No actual ponies and surprisingly good. Focuses mostly on overthrowing a regime so far.

- +[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/133544/of-the-hive][Of the Hive]]+ Nevermind, no real otherworld knowledge.

- +[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/316852/empty-horizons][Empty Horizons]]+ Same as above.

- [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/439981/luna-is-a-harsh-mistress][Luna is a Harsh Mistress]] - This one is really good, about survival and building a city on the moon with magic. some modern knowledge

- [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/306787/the-diamond-dogs-guide-to-engineering][The Diamond Dog's Guide to Engineering]] - Human with knowledge of engineering then builds a civilization. Fair warning that is only part of the story and it is short.

There is also some in anime/manga/light novels:

- [[https://www.novelupdates.com/series/common-sense-of-a-dukes-daughter/][Common Sense of a Duke's Daughter]] - Honestly the only good one that I've found in this genre, the sad thing is that more exist they are just plagued by harems and generally bad writing.

Some that might possibly head in that direction and deserve an honorable mention:

- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/record-of-the-inherited-memory-girls-efforts-isekai.50880/][Record of the Inherited Memory Girl's Efforts]] - Written by the same person who wrote "A Hero's War" and waaay better than it even if it is a lot shorter.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/purple-days-asoiaf-joffrey-timeloop-au.450894/][Purple Days]] - I haven't read much of this one because the pacing is a little too slow for me, but I expect what you want will be an eventual outcome though that is a guess.

Stories about civilizations that have little to do with isekai:

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/hope-and-silence-in-the-hive-warhammer-40k-complete.583942/][Hope and Silence in the Hive]] - An eldritch comedy that is really good, occasionally confusing but worth it in the end.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/terror-peace-among-the-stars-sequel-warhammer-40k.672535/][Terror & Peace Among the Stars]] - a sequel to the above.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/contact-1955.328914/][Contact 1955]] - Pretty massive plot hole of how exactly technology does not develop when it has the whole galaxy (possibly larger) to work on it, even with magic involved, not very long either, but still fun.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/previously-impossible-futures-warhammer-40-000-original.752587/][Previously Impossible Futures]] - Pretty sure this one was a little dry but still interesting enough.
