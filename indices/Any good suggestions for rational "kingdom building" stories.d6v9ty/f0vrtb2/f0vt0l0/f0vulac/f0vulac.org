One reason you may have dropped it is that it's bad. A Hero's War starts promisingly enough, and then everything goes downhill from there. The thing is, it gives little hints of something interesting coming eventually to keep you reading and then it never delivers. Aside from the poor writing quality, the unfortunate fact is that it's very much not a rational story. There are two main characters, one in command of an army, the other a sort of innovator/engineer. The engineer dude just solves everything without effort because no one as ever thought about magic crossbows, or poisoning a worm, or whatever. He does this with no formal magical knowledge, just hunches, and he's always right. The worldbuilding is atrocious.
