[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dungeon-keeper-ami-sailor-moon-dungeon-keeper-story-only-thread.30066/][Dungeon Keeper Ami]]: Ami from Sailor Moon gets plopped into the Dungeon Keeper universe. She retains all her knowledge of engineering from Earth, and uses it to get an edge on her opposition, although she does so relatively cautiously in order to try to avoid reverse-engineering. She's not /trying/ to build a kingdom, per se, but circumstances keep on pushing her into it. And the story manages to avoid harem-related plot elements, making Ami too untouchable, and so forth, keeping the tension up even as she gains power and influence. So overall it seems like very plausibly the sort of thing you're after.
