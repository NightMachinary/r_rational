It's a regular horse for 3 books or so, a bit smart but just a horse. Then in book 4 or 5 it's revealed to be a shapeshifting AI or something sent by his future descendents to protect him, and also it's in love with him, and also it changes itself to suit his every desire.

To say this series jumped the shark after a while is putting it lightly. The new term should be "it fucked the damn horse", haha.
