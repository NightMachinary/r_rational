I enjoyed reading this. In hindsight it's a bit of a shame that Greenpill was killed so quickly, but I can understand it for narrative reasons.

The most obviously underpowered person here is Pinkpill. Unlike the red pill you don't need to be pretty stupid to pick it, since shaking hands before and after a meeting is common practice. This allows you to manipulate pretty much everyone you encounter, so you should be able to work your way to being King William's rival.

Graypill made the obvious mistake of being too greedy too soon. His powers could easily be leveraged into something that makes a lot money legitimately.
