There aren't very many characters and the sexuality of most of them wasn't directly mentioned or relevant so far as I remember. Although, I suppose it can be inferred from the male characters not thinking it's weird when they abruptly fall in love with Pink, in contrast to Blue's mention of "You're not a lesbian".

But then, Yellow seems to be female, at best guess by the surprise exhibited at how gross men are inside their brains (and also I just double-checked and there is one instance of "she" being used to refer to Yellow), and she has no surprised reaction when Pink suddenly seems very beautiful. Could be Yellow is non-straight.

It's not much to go on, but reactions to Pink make up almost all of the available information about their orientations. We also don't know anything either way about Green... unless I've missed something, I can't even work out an implied gender there.
