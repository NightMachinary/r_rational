Re: Punching bags; At the end of the story, Pink touching Red does not cause any change in Red. So, it's likely that Pink touched Red sometime earlier, and neither noticed.

Re: Redpill; Did you honestly read about Red and think, "I want to be just like that?" For me, it was "What a dumb, sad life." The story does not present redpill in a positive light at all, he was not the hero, he was not lovable. He was sad, in a comical way.
