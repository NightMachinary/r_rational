I always thought that there was only the first level timeline in which he writes "DON'T MESS WITH TIME" because he was so freaked out that his earlier self wrote "DON'T MESS WITH TIME."

It was the most elegant version of a stable time loop, at least in my head, since HPJEV's algorithm for calculating the P=NP prime number factors made my head spin (I'm not a math or CS geek.)

Do unstable time-loops actually exist in HPMOR, or are they all self-resolving to the most stable time-loop? I suppose they must, since Dumbledore had a few scenes involving time paradoxes.
