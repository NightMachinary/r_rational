ha, i was just about to post this. looks like i got beaten to the punch.

and yeah, i would agree that this is scott's greatest fiction. or at the very least, most satisfying; everything was tied together incredibly nicely and there weren't any loose ends, which is pretty rare. also enjoyed the (literal) twist, which was just brilliant.
