  Re: Punching bags; At the end of the story, Pink touching Red does not cause any change in Red. So, it's likely that Pink touched Red sometime earlier, and neither noticed.

I didn't feel like that was implied.

  Re: Redpill; Did you honestly read about Red and think, "I want to be just like that?" For me, it was "What a dumb, sad life."
#+end_quote

Are "I want to be just like that" and "That person is awful and has no redeeming traits of any kind" the only possible reactions to a character?

  The story does not present redpill in a positive light at all, he was not the hero, he was not lovable. He was sad, in a comical way.

He didn't save the universe (by turning the crank, and by taking the red pill to begin with)?

Are living an enviable life, having high intelligence and never being the butt of humor all requirements to meet the definition of "hero"? You seem to particularly focus on his intelligence.

Do you disagree that the implied contents and results of the "red pill advice" Red read were idealized, as compared with the depths that actual online "redpill" communities can sink to?

I defer to your judgment that Red's "true love" for Pink was unreciprocated.
