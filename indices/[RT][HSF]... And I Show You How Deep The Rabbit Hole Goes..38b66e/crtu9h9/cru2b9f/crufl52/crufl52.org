  Re: Gender roles, idealization of redpill; Literally the opposite. He's making fun of Red, not idealizing him. Red is shown as being incredibly stupid.

Red, the character (not "red pill", the ideology) is shown as being stupid; but also loyal and lovable and, in the end, the hero. The "red pill advice" he reads eventually leads him to true love and saving the universe; whereas a true redpill would be trained to recognize and resist "oneitis" toward Pink, hold frame and keep spinning plates.

It might be that we're meant to just see Red as too dumb to internalize any of the bad parts; but that seems (to me) overly convenient and [[http://web.archive.org/web/20100620113208/http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbIsGood][tropey]].

By "gender roles" I meant things like who took what pill, and everyone apparently being straight.
