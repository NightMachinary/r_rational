  Given that non-heterosexual make up around 10% of the population (that's with generous estimates and in a country that's relatively accepting), there's a 43% chance that out of 8 randomly selected people 0 would be gay.

So you agree that it's an improbable outcome, even if the story existed in a vacuum. There are also technically more than 8 characters. In particular, Pink's narration mentions her dealing with unreciprocated romantic interest from "a couple of guys"; only Pink's, and only guys.

  However we don't learn about the sexuality of Green or Black, and the story doesn't rule out any of the male characters being bisexual, so it's more likely than that. Roughly 53% chance for 6 randomly chosen sexualities, more if you account for the potential bi characters.

Stereotyping isn't negated simply by the offscreen possibility of non-stereotypical traits.

  Oh, but the bigger kicker is that Yellow is female and there's no mention of any discomfort at her being attracted to pink (conspicuous by its absence compared to blue) so she probably isn't straight.

I think I did miss the part about Yellow; thanks (though that arguably illustrates how missable it was). It could also just be a case of avoiding repetition, though.
