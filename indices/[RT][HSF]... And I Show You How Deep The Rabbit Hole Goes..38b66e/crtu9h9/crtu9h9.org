Damn it, it got me. [[#s][Spoiler]].

Minor nitpicks, some buzzkill: [[#s][Orange's power]]. [[#s][Red]]. [[#s][Red]]. [[#s][The black pill]]. [[#s][About Black]]. [[#s][If there's a God]]; [[#s][but then]]. And something about problematic gender roles/stereotypes, idealization of [[#s][toxic]] philosophy and [[#s][implied]] at the end.

[[#s][Further spoiler]].

As for my choice: orange all the way. The others would (mostly) be cool, but we need competence too badly. And maybe there'll be a way to duplicate the others' powers after all. Black might be nice, but I'm not prepared to trust myself with [[#s][buzzkill]] (edit: not to mention the risk of being locked into predestination like Paul Atreides).

(I know my formatting looks bad with custom styles on; but I'm lazy and unsure how to fix it.)

Edit too late to be seen: Stereotyped portrayal of Saudi Arabia.
