You are talking about some thermodynamic stuff and it's not totally wrong, but it can be made more precise. Also, Physics is harder to break than you may think.

When you are talking about "energy costs," it isn't exactly clear what you mean. In Thermodynamics, there are many "energy functions," which are often referred to as "free energy." Each of these describes the amount of accessible energy of a system as a function of certain parameters. The common free energy functions are Helmholtz free energy and Gibbs free energy.

The point is that the important quantity in thermodynamics is really an "accessibility cost" rather than an energy cost.

The Maxwell's demon paradox does bring attention to the connection between thermodynamical entropy and information (information entropy). However, to get physical implications out of the paradox is somewhat difficult. It's not as simple as, "free information = free energy".

There are many interpretations of Maxwell's Demon and it remains one of the most contentious thought experiments in Physics cannon. However, Bennett's resolution of the paradox (and I agree with his analysis) is that measurements can be made in principle without any entropy cost (and therefore without any energy cost).

An older resolution of the paradox (Szilard's) relied on the assumption that measurements increase entropy but I think modern research has overturned them. This implies that mind-reading powers do not violate thermodynamics as they are just another kind of measurement.

Interestingly, I don't think that Black's powers necessarily violate the second law either. There is a restriction in physics that information cannot be transmitted faster than is prescribed by the light-cone of two events. This is really just a restatement of the special theory of relativity. Of course, Physicists think about how any theory (including relativity) may be violated, but there is no known implication that such a violation would impact thermodynamics. There is actually a paper that considers tachyons (I think called the Tachyon Antitelephone) that rules out any violation of special relativity from first principles. Interestingly, Scott Aaronson has considered the informational dynamics of CTC's (Closed time-like curves) which he interprets as time machines under a self-consistency restriction. He concludes that they would have strong computational powers but not quite godly.
