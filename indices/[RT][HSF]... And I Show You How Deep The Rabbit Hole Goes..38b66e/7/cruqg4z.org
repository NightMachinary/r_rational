The most interesting thing about this story I just read was the fact that all of the pills could be used to break physics and indirectly generate energy or break information entropy which is strongly related to energy creation. Except maybe Pink.

[[#s][Red:]]

[[#s][Yellow:]]

[[#s][Black:]]

[[#s][Blue:]]

[[#s][Green:]]

[[#s][Grey:]]

[[#s][Orange:]]

[[#s][Pink:]]

Okay, okay, maybe I misspoke when I said that they all could be used to generate energy, but according to the laws of thermodynamics, it breaks physics to be able to do things without any energy cost. Perfect energy efficiency is impossible, otherwise perpetual motion machines would work.

For interest, the known males are Orange, Black, Red and Grey. The known females are Pink, Blue, and Yellow. I think for gender equality, Green is most likely a female.
