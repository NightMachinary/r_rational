So what you're saying is, you could teleport to the edge of the universe where the Big Bang hasn't reached yet, and thus see it occurring? Still not sounding like time travel to me.

Edit: To be clear, from your remark referencing relativity, it doesn't sound you mean that Blue could ever visit the same spot at an earlier time. The reason I'm confused is this doesn't make sense to me in the context of the comment you agreed with about FTL leading to broken time travel.
