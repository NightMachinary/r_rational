Surely pink says "can be turned off", not is turned off by retouching.

So it's a choice. I think that could have been done better. Equally pink suddenly becomes "touch bare skin" instead of touch someone. If I grab someone who is wearing clothes, I'm still touching them. You then also totally abuse it by implying love = mind control which is not how love works in the real world.

Blue for example, it doesn't say instant so you would expect that travelling to Alpha Centurai would take at least light years, so when he came back time would have passed. However you don't do that, so really the obviously solution to negative entropy was him.

Also the shapeshifter guy, shape shift into ant, or something like that, easily avoid death. Or like a dinosaur of some sort. He was also available for abuse.

So overall great, but pink was a real let down there, especially considering the really interesting ways you can go with that.
