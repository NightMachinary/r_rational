I was wondering if greenpill could turn you into different looking humans, thus letting you be the ultimate spy, but its never established if its just nonhuman animals or if humans are in there too, or if you have any degree of control over how you look when you transform. If you turn into a cat, do you control the fur colour you end up with?
