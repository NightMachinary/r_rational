Ants can fall at terminal velocity and survive uninjured. I wouldn't risk that, though, in case there are things that eat ants in the air. Tardigrades are pretty impossible to kill, do they have any natural predators? Emergency scenario could be become a tardigrade and wait for things to blow over.
