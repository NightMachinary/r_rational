Well, there's no "absolute" time frame within the universe, right? It's all relative, mediated by apparent fluctuations in wavelengths, always moving at c. So, what does instantaneous transportation mean? Going to a place at the same time you leave, just a different location? If you went far enough away - a few billion light-years, say - you'd end up at the spot where we see the big bang, only not really, because the big bang isn't anywhere meaningful, because it's the origin of everywhere meaningful.

Like I said, makes my head hurt.
