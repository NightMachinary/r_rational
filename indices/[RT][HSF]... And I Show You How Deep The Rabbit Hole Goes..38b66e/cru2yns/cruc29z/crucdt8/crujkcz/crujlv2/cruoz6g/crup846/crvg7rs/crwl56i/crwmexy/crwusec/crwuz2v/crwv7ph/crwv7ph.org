I'm sorry, but the way I understand this you both have it wrong. If Blue teleported to the Big Bang, he'd end up at the 'center' of the universe 13.7 trillion(ish) years later. FTL travel does not necessarily mean traveling backwards in time. It means looking like you traveled backwards in time to an observer. EDIT: For example, if one were to teleport to Mars and back again, scientists taking a photo of mars would only see an image of you thirteen minutes later.
