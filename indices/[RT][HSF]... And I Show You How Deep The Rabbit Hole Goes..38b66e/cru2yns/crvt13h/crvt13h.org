In bold defense of Pink!

Yes, Pink's description notes that it "can be turned off", which is a very /helpful/ little clause that I'm pretty sure Scott Alexander, of all people, noticed.

Either he chose to blatantly ignore it and at the end, Red just learns to love Pink on his own, OR he subtly implies with the below quote (which might also have just been a joke of little importance) that Pink was just discovering that her power had always been so much cooler than she ever realized.

  It took them a few hours of fawning over each other before she realized that nothing had happened when she touched him a second time. Something something true love something the power was within you the whole time?

Maybe!

I also find the power interesting if Pink /doesn't/ have the ability to touch her love-slaves. Perhaps God, the creator of the pills, would rather she not used her God-given gifts for intercourse?

Maybe!

Anyways, next you have to define 'touch.' If you grab someone's clothing, you could say you're touching the person, but you could also say that you're merely touching fabric. If you grab someone's bare skin, you could say you're touching a 'person' or you could say you're just touching dead skin. Even if you touch someone's brain, God seems to exist in this universe, so you might not be /technically/ touching a person because the brain does not /necessarily/ have to hold the soul. If a soul contains who a person really is, you might not be able to touch a person at all, because of a soul's nonphysical nature.

Sidenote: Even if touching skin wasn't required, one of the things that makes Black insanely powerful is that he can easily find out the specifics of powers by strongly precommitting to a course of action and seeing how the future looks then. If clothing didn't work, he wouldn't have done it in the first place. He would have just told Pink about his power and that if she tried to touch him, he would know beforehand and taze her into submission without warning.

I would also argue that a strong enough love is functionally equivalent to mind control. Think wireheaded patients, fighting to be stimulated again. Except Pink's victims instead have a strong desire to make their mistress happy.
