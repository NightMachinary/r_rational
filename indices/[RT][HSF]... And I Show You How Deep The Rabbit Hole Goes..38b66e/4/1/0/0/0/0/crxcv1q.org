I don't want to summarize it because of a slight chance Scott will someday make it available again, and it's easy to spoil.

It was published on his [[http://squid314.livejournal.com/][old blog]] at some point before 2006. Later, Scott hid the early entries, possible because he considered them obsolete/mildly embarrassing (he began writing when he was around 17, and at first the blog was fairly silly or at least nowhere near as serious as it became later). Everyone's understandably ashamed of their early work, but I actually liked that story a lot. I couldn't dig it out via the Wayback Machine, but if your google-fu is stronger than mine, feel free to try.
