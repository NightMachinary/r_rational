You could, actually- As long as you changed the answer before it was sent, it could work. You'd have up to X universes where it didn't work (Where X is the number of possible states the answer could be in) and an infinite number of universes with the correct answer. You should get the desired answered nearly all of the time.

Heh, you'd be brute-forcing the universe.
