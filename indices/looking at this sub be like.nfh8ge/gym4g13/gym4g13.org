I would like to state for the record that this is [[/r/rational]], not [[/r/rationalist]]. The sidebar explanation that rationalist fic is a subset of rational fic is good enough for me.

Sure, HPMoR was a founding work of the subreddit, but I'll wager a significant fraction of the members weren't in it for the didactic side. For all its flaws, MoR has some /incredibly clever/ ideas about what has to change from the HP canon in order to...rationalize...the weirder elements. That sort of thoughtful worldbuilding and internal consistency is a hallmark of rational fiction.
