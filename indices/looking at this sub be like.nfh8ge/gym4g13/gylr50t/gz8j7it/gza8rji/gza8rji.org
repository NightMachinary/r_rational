Mhh.. I see where you are coming from, but insofar as the world isn't even cogent the slightest, I don't know what you could judge characters against.

Like, assuming the worst case scenario that I can imagine (something like "star wars meets fast & furious in not even pretending to care about logics anymore"), the only reasonable thing to do for characters would be to spin in circles facepalming about the wretch of a universe they are in, with the very physical laws changing every odd hour.
