in essence, yes. though there are certain elements you come across a lot in fictions discussed on this sub that extend beyond common writing maxims. Trope deconstructions, logical (vs emotional) protagonists, DnD-esque magic systems with clear rules and numbers, etc. It's a mix of influences from genre fiction, fanfiction, Japanese light novels/anime, and of course, the spectre of Eliezer Yudkowsky.

I agree with you though. I'm much more a fan of thoughtful worldbuilding and internal consistency than any of the things I just listed. But I still check [[/r/rational]] because it's one of few forums where people who read stuff online discuss things critically and share things that are (generally) quite interesting.

It's not a perfect community and the term 'rational fiction' is a bit silly, mostly since it implies that things outside it are somehow not-rational (or perhaps irrational). Like naming your personal philosophy 'Objectivist,' it feels rather conceited and short-sighted.
