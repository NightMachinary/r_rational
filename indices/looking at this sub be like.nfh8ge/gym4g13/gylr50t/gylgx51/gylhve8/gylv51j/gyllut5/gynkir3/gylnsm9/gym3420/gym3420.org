Mother of learning is the superior book, but I did enjoy the absurdity of HPMoR quite a lot. Honestly I would say that the genre of true rationalist fiction is so small that you are basically forced to broaden your scope. There's only a small handful of works that take things to that level. Everything else is, as stated, just thoughtful world building and internal consistency.
