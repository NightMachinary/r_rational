The best understanding I've cultivated about what defines rational fiction as a genre is the specific feeling of /things making sense/. It's the feeling when all the pieces start coming together at the end of the mystery plot. It's the feeling when you connect the plot event to previous events that seemed initially unrelated. It's the feeling of reading bits of worldbuilding and seeing a coherent world assemble itself before your eyes. And my brain goes nuts for it.

Plotholes, by contrast, are when things explicitly /don't/ make sense, and just like I love things explicitly making sense I hate things explicitly not making sense. Put the two together and you get why I like rational fiction.

Some of this is just good writing advice, but it's distinctly more than just that. The specific feeling of things making clear sense is something that can be absent in other good stories which focus on other feelings that might resonate with people, and which can be present even in otherwise bad stories.

Rationalism itself, imo, is just an adjacent group that happens to attract the kinds of people who respond well to that feeling, which made 'ratfic' around seeking that feeling while being loosely defined as 'the kinds of stories we like'.
