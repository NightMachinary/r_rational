Reading was always something I pursued as a form of escapism.

That feeling of discovery with exploring a new world, playing a mental what-if. You get to travel with a good book. Sometimes you travel in someone's headspace, sometimes you travel through a narrator's eyes, and finding the good places is a real treat.

/rationalism has been a great way to taste a multitude of worlds and every now and then, chew on some wonderful mental problems. They won't all be good, but this sub provides a space for authors to develop and readers to encourage those authors to feed our addiction.
