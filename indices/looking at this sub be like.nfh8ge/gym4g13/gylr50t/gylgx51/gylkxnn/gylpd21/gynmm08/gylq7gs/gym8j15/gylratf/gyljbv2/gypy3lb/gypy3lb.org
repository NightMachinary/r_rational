So true!

Mother of Learning is the perfect illustration.

On one hand, it has thoughtful world-building, intelligent protagonists, and all the other goodies you expect from a good rational fic.

On the other hand, it promotes harmful and irrational ideas ("religion is good", "immortality seekers are bad").

It's like the best pie you've ever eaten, but with a few glass shards intentionally put in by the cook.
