You can think of thoughtful worldbuilding and internal consistency as a rectangle rationalism like a square. All squares are rectangles. Some rectangles are squares. All rational fiction has thoughtful worldbuilding and internal consistency, but not all works with thoughtful worldbuilding and internal consistency are rational fiction.

Honestly, I don't have a problem with these kinds of works being so prominent on the sub. It fosters fun discussion and lets us recommend some enjoyable works that we otherwise wouldn't know about.

I'm just making a mild critique on this sub because I like semantics.
