For the record I like Hpmor more than Mother of Learning and although I like MoL too I would like if there were more stuff like Hpmor in the sub(more than there are already is I mean, there's some stuff like OoS wich obiously qualifies and I also love that)

No idea about "most people" in the sub.

I mean threre's less rationalist fics out there in general so obiously they are going to be a smaller fraction of things posted and that's going to affect what kind of people is attracted to the subreddit but meh would have to do a survey or something.

Also you can be a fan of both things.

And like duno about the subredit but I have the impression most people active in the discord have read the sequences.
