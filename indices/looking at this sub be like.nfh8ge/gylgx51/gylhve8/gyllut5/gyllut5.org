It turns out that the borders of genres are NOT WELL DEFINED. Also if they're helping people find media that they enjoy that's pretty much the point. Genres are shorthand so we don't have to sit and describe a kind of thing we like for ten minutes every time we need to say it. Thoughtful world building and internal consistency IS part of the Rational genre because people use it that way and it can only truly be defined by its use.

Edit: Also concerning Mother of Learning and HPatMoR; same.
