I don't know. It seems to me more like having some special kind of /big empathic memory/.

Like, it's not that I'm forcing myself to be pedantic, it's just that if I'm completely immersed in the shoes of a character, the established reality/psychology bending over backwards like in a marvel movie completely trash suspension of disbelief.

On the other hand, some people I know (for as much as nerds) seems to live in a forever present where only the cool factor is important.
