I used to be part of a fan community for All Night Laundry, a somewhat-rational serial artfic.

In discussion, I would occasionally link short stories or articles about writing. Whenever I linked something by E.Y. or S.A. the moderator would delete the link and say something like "don't platform racist eugenicists."

I linked thoughful fiction and writing advice, not rationality blogs!

I'm banned from that community now...
