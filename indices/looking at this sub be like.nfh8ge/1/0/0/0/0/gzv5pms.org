"Worldbuilding past X is not necessary" kind of means that worldbuilding is necessary.

Then, I suppose in the sense that it's really hard to have a story move forward (and happen at all) only with static objects, characters are eventually more important.. but regardless "rational" still seems to apply to the overall result.

If I'm reading The Martian, and some rick-and-morty-like paradoxical event happens, then the protagonist can be as shrewd as you want, but the mood will be ruined.
