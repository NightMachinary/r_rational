For context, [[https://i.imgur.com/uLAJLnR.png][this exchange]] ([[https://i.imgur.com/RV0FRzo.png][page 2]], [[https://i.imgur.com/f1kkwwJ.png][page 3]]) happened in the discord server while I was lurking, maybe even to a different user. I don't know exactly how much of it is poor phrasing, misinterpretation, or since-deleted context, so I'm not going to offer any opinion on who was right. But the discord server owner interpreted the whole thing as nazi apologism, and acted accordingly.
