Speaking as someone raised in a Young-Earth-Creationist, Souther Baptist household, and believing it up until my first year of college... she really isn't a strawman. Very intelligent people can come up with extremely convoluted arguments to argue for things directly contradicted by multiple fields of science, and they can do so completely sincerely and honestly.

On the other hand, if you want to claim that that kind of Fundamentalist isn't good as a character of a rationalist fic, that is much more reasonable although I still don't necessarily agree.
