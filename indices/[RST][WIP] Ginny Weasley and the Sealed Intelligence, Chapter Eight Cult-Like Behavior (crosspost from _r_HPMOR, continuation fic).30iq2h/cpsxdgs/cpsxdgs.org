That was a very good chapter, and I enjoyed reading.

If the next chapter doesn't reveal that that ridiculous strawman argument was part of a ploy to make some deeper point - which, to be fair, would make sense, I can think of at least three - then I'm dropping the fic.

It's good, but ... there's been at one jarring, SoD-breaking thing per chapter. Which would be doable normally, perhaps, but with chapters this short ... it forms a sizeable percentage of the story.

Imagine if HPMOR had - I had a list here, but you can choose your own nitpicks - every few PARAGRAPHS, instead of every other chapter or so. It's a shame, because I do enjoy a lot of this fic, and I like the premises and even the writing.
