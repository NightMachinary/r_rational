There are creationists out there, sure. But you don't exactly meet them on LessWrong very often. I find this unrealistic, and it /is/ obviously motivated.

Also, this isn't really a great analogy for creationism, I think, since this is supposed to be the most common form of wizard!Christianity in this fic.

Buy yeah, if Ginny was a Creationist - even a wizard creationist! Magical creatures even look pretty artificial! - then it would be at worst a weak man, and I can definitely imagine a short story about a creationist encountering LW and losing their faith, even (although it'd have to be more sympathetic than this to work, IMO.) But this? This is /making up/ an opponent to argue with and then knocking them down. Ginny didn't even have any interesting arguments.

Although, as I said, I'm actually kind of hoping this is a "trick" - much like what Harry pulled. If this gets more ridiculous followed by the reveal that it was to teach us some deeper lesson, even if I disagree with the lesson, then I wouldn't object to the object-level terrible argument here and would indeed be kinda impressed.
