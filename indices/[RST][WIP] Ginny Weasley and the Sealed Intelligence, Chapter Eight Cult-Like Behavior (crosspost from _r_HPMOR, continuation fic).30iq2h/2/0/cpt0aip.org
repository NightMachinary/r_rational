Seconded, that broke any suspension of disbelief or any goodwill I had to plod through the writing.

Seriously what the fuck, you have a cloud cuckoolander Luna one chapter, and the next you have her cogently delivering the standard anti-religious argument? Or Ginny actually accepting it? ( in my experience people fight a lot harder to keep irrational beliefs even when they're exposed to the techniques. If she was going to break down that easily it needed foreshadowing, and internal cognitive dissonance /before/ Luna comes in to burst the dam. Alternately if you're going for something pedagogical there was a fine teaching moment missed where Luna fights back and later reflects on her actions, instead of becoming a good little rationalist in one feel swoop.)

Hell, Harry doing the cult thing was perfectly in character for something he did in the first few score HPMoR chapters, but we've been watching him grow more mature throughout that fic. His dialogue was incredibly wooden, and that whole bit was missing Harry's whole "Well, I just earned a few dark lord points. Fuck" internal monologue. (That's not actually an issue given choice of narrators, just jarring)

It's a shame since there's a few brilliant ideas in this fic. Not to mention that less wrong really does need chiding about its more subtle failure modes.
