So, Ginny is a Straw LessWronger.

Her obsessive and irrational personality traits are much larger parts of her personality than any sense of rationality at all. She's a stand-in for that kind of person who reads the Sequences, half understands them, and parrots them back without doing any kind of deeper thought about them.

Her actions in the cultish meeting were exactly those people criticize Less Wrongers for doing: telling people to 'Go read the [Methods/Sequences]', dropping jargon terms, acting generally condescending, etc.

She clearly hasn't actually internalized any of it, since one conversation with a (surprisingly rational) Luna hits her into a mental brick wall. Several of them.

I'm not sure if I'll drop this. It wasn't really high quality before this, but the chapters are five minute reads. But unless Ginny starts to change quickly, she's just not that interesting a character.
