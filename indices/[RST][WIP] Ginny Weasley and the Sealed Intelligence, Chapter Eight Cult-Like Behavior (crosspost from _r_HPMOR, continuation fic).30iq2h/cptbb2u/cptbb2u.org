Just started this fic and now I'm caught up. I was pleasantly surprised by Ginny being made somewhat likable (initially), and rational!Lockhart was refreshing. There are some good ideas here.

That said, I felt nauseous while reading this. The rate at which characters' mannerisms change completely to fit the narrative gave me a constant sense of literary vertigo. It's like the author wrote the dialogue first, then retrofitted characters to speak it. This is terrible. Much more thought needs to go into what each character would actually say and how they would act in any given situation.

Seeing as this is a continuation fic, it should be the case that everything not introduced by the author is held as constant as possible to MoR. Introducing Ginny, Luna, Lockhart, et. al. as characters is more than sufficient to tell the story without playing fast and loose with established characters and reinventing elements of the universe wholesale.

Every good moment is ruined by something ridiculous like magic as logic gates, nundus, and now apparently wizard religion. There are major problems here, and I feel the author needs a great deal more development before trying to tackle something like a MoR continuation.

Just my two sickles worth.
