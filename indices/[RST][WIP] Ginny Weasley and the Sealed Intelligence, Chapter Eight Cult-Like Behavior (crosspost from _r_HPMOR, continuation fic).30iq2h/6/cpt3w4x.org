I read twice that people think HJPEV is acting normally. I disagree. He's supposed to be a smarter rationalist by now. Think of his goals:

- Be part of the club

- show people he is a regular dude like them

- retain maximum membership

I just can't believe that he would think scaring everyone into action against him on the first day would be rational, here.
