The argument at the end is so blunt, and the suggested development (Ginny renouncing her religion through rationality) seem so, I don't know, trivial, that I'm suddenly worrying that the author intends to go 'one level deeper', and present Luna as an unreasonable and judgmental militant atheist, while Ginny would be this reasonable and tolerant religious person, able to reconcile her faith and rationality.

This would be an especially ridiculous plot for a presumably 'rationalist' fic, in my opinion, but the other option is that it's going to be a blatant atheist propaganda piece? And I don't particularly like blatant propaganda, even if I happen to agree with its points wholeheartedly.
