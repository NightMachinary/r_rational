Good read, but not that accurate, just look at printer ink and its prices in the real world...

The next problem is adventurers unlike e.g. bakers tend to walk towards a bit of danger thus somewhat unlike bands of brigands that can be hired for protection (where the example might fit) (go on tell the half ork barbarian not to push into undead territory to loot the city that had fallen and hasn't been looted)

Cartels do not need total market shares e.g. a blacksmith guild can underprice others due to their purchasing power, political influence and sheer propaganda
