  Zach is a very Naruto like character though.

In personality. He basically has Sasuke's backstory, though (last survivor of a clan of militants; rich but lonely; doted on by tutors; etc.)

  A spider brings people into the loop, people of her choosing, so the story plays out very differently to how it plays when the protagonist can bring people into the loop. He has far less control over what she does.

Still, the magic was introduced, and there's no reason given (so far) that Zorian won't be able to learn it for himself at some point. Other than that maybe being a waste of time with the loop winding down.
