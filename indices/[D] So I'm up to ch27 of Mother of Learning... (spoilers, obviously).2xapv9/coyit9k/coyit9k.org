Imperfect comparison. Many of your things are slightly rephrased universal elements of stories, others are poor comparisons, some are clear retextures.

#+begin_quote
  The protagonist is an intellectual with small mana/chakra reserves but good control
#+end_quote

For the first chapter, yes, but after that her reserves grow pretty quickly. By the end of the first chapter she can walk on water for an hour and I don't believe her chakra limits come into play much.

#+begin_quote
  who is reliving the same month repeatedly
#+end_quote

That's a very common plot point, very popular too. Time Braid was not the first one that did it by any means.

#+begin_quote
  as a result of being anchored to a charming but dimwitted boy with massive mana/chakra reserves whose entire family is dead.
#+end_quote

Sort of. In MoL he's more tightly anchored, and if Zach dies he dies. Plus he's in the same timeline. While Sakura is anchored to Naruto that doesn't really come into play for most of the story. Zach is a very Naruto like character though.

#+begin_quote
  The protagonist discovers at some point in the loops that they have a hidden innate power.
#+end_quote

As with most magical stories. You have to be vague because it's a very different power and as such a very different type of story.

#+begin_quote
  They bring other people/spiders into the loops by storing backups of their memories inside their own soul to be given to the next iteration of the other person at the start of the next loop.
#+end_quote

Sort of. A spider brings people into the loop, people of her choosing, so the story plays out very differently to how it plays when the protagonist can bring people into the loop. He has far less control over what she does.

#+begin_quote
  After enjoying a period of dilligent study and the occasional bit of messing around they discover that an enemy is also looping and has the means to deal them harm in a way that will carry over into subsequent loops.
#+end_quote

After they do stuff they discover an enemy that can cause them permanent harm is an almost universal property of stories. Students, predictably, study and mess around. For dramatic tension to exist the ability to harm people permanently should normally exist.
