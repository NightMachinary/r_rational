Ah, I see. Yeah, now your comment makes a little more sense. That's a crossover from [[#s][an anime]] (now spoilered.) I think the fic predated crossover tags on Fanfiction.net, but I'm not 100% sure of that. Also, marking* it as such would kind of make no sense for the first 80% of the story and ruin the surprise... Totally understand the confusion that would bring.

Anyway, didn't mean to be short with you or anything. Hope that helps you make sense of the madness.
