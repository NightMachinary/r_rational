Most people don't consider Time Braid crackfic. Crossover, yes, but most crackfic is intentionally humorous and self-awarely riffing on canon themes and characterizations. That's not what Time Braid does, nor does it identify itself as such.

Just say you don't like Time Braid very much. That's not exactly a super-unpopular opinion (see OP's shots at it).
