The thing that bugs me with this story is the disregard for safety by the doctors.

As I understand it there's no reason they couldn't be comatose after the initial locking of the virus and their personality.

Why not have a video of you talking with the doctor with certain parts censored and then you tell the camera, hey this video might be faked but it's gonna convince way more people.

Also think about how much abuse this system will have.

A test for paranoia should be administered immediately and they should be put in a secure room

Also anyone not wearing their mask at all times is crazy too

Edit: also I hope that we can all acknowledge while totally a possible character the assumption of malevolence is not remotely rational and I can think of very few situations where even Bayesian logic would have you assuming so.
