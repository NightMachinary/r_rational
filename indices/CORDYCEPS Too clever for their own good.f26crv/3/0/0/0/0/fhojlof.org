  No, and I think that's the point - Archive isn't rational.

The point might have been that he was too clever for his own good, but is that the point being that he wasn't rational. (I just realised that the pronouns are they/them aren't they? Woops.)

They were certainly clever, and if they were less clever they would have probably been fine. Being able to think fast, examine things from a variety of perspectives and with an insane amount of the ol' reckless/bold combo all led to their demise.

And they obviously weren't rational either. But lots of shows have a moral and you could say well obviously they weren't rational.

Not really important distinction either way, seems like semantics about what counts as a point

I definitely see this work as a tragedy though. You can really sympathise with Arc because even if they were far more reasonable, especially re: assuming they were kidnapped and the malice, and just questioning the amnesia and introspecting what they forgot, I think they were in a hopeless situation. Every time they wake up they'll progress further to undoing the amnesia lock, and it's because their mind will follow the same sensible pattern of thinking things over.
