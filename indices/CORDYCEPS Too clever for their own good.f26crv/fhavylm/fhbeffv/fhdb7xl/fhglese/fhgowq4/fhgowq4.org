  As I understand it there's no reason they couldn't be comatose after the initial locking of the virus and their personality.

Muscle atrophy? I agree, though. Surely 6 months is recoverable? It might be simply because the facility does not have the resources to handle that process.

  Why not have a video of you talking with the doctor with certain parts censored and then you tell the camera, hey this video might be faked but it's gonna convince way more people.

Might make some people /worse/. Might help though, yeah.

No, and I think that's the point - Archive /isn't/ rational. They try to use rational tools, but they don't succeed. Most people don't overthink shit as much as they do either - I think Arc has a lot of problems going on beyond the surface, and frankly, it just makes the character more believable.
