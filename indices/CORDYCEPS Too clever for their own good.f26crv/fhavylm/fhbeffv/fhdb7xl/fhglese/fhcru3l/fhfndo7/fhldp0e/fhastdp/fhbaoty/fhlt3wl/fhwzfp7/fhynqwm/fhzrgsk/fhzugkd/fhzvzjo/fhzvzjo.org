I don't care about genders. Generally, in short mystery stories every small detail counts, especially ones that are abnormal.

I thought the atypical pronouns had meaning that's connected to the mystery, actually I did not consider genders at all. Which is probably why it was so jarring.

When one of the MCs refers to the other as 'they', there is no indication that they can't tell the biological gender of the other person. So it was just inserted for no reason and the use of these pronouns is awkward in fiction writing IMO.
