Ooooh. Thanks for reposting this, I hadn't seen it before. It's really good!

It's always good to think about what you know and how you know what you know. The possibility that thinking would be bad...is scary. I'd be dead if I was in this story; please give me some heavy sedatives instead so I do not wake and do not dream.

I'd encourage everyone to read it, and also to remember (when you're lying awake at night trying not to think about pink elephants) that selective amnesia and alien tech as described in the story do not exist.
