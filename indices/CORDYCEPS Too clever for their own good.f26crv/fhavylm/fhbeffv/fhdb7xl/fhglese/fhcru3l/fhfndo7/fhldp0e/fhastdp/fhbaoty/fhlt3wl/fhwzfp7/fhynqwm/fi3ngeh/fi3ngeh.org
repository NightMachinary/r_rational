On the mind blowing twist, I actually think the 'twist' of the story is a sufficiently scary and neat idea that it suffices, but I experienced the same sort of mild disappointment towards the end and I think the reason is that it was pretty easy to call the 'twist' by at least the halfway point (if not earlier) and there was nothing else past that. I think the climax with Arc's death was quite strong but we never got payoff for it at the end with 6 learning about a friend that died in the hospital.

For the gender-neutral pronouns, my reading is that for some people gender is one of the 'core identity' details that got censored by the antibody. That said, it's not clear why this extends to /other/ people interacting with the infected person (like Gavin referring to Arc as 'they' even when Gavin remembered Arc).

I think with a rewrite to clear up the confusing details and either make the 'Pink Elephant' harder to figure out from the reader's perspective until the climax /or/ abandon any attempt at twist or mystery by making the 'Pink Elephant' known to the reader from the onset and instead building suspense through dramatic irony would make the story much stronger. That said, I found it a pretty engaging read and it gave me plenty of fun memetics ideas +(which is maybe a very bad thing)+.
