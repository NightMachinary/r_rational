If anyone is wondering, the game that was played in the story is [[http://www.koryheath.com/zendo/][Zendo]], which I think is a beautiful game that would be enjoyed by people interested in rational fiction. I looked it up a few years ago when this story was posted one of the other times and have played it a bunch since.

It's reminiscent of the 4-5-6 task HPMOR!Harry gives Hermione---you're basically doing science to find out the laws of the universe. It also uses pretty triangular pieces you can kinda buy on Amazon (for twice what they should cost) but are out of print. I emailed with the company that makes them, though, and they said they'd be making more available again in the form of a Kickstarter. There's a new version, but I prefer the simple pyramidal version where you make your own rules.
