Most of the chapters are from different viewpoints of various iterations of the same three individuals where the chapter title changes/updates when they lose their memories to the pink elephant amnesia.

The chapter names with numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 is all from one person, Gavin Batra. Yes, this means that chapter 2 (#24) chronologically occurs before the first chapter 3 (#1).

The chapter names with the elements H and He is another individual, Dr. Orchard.

The chapter names with letters N, O, and P is from a third individual, Arc. But there is nothing in chapter P because Arc decided losing the memories was worse than dying. In chapters #22 to 23, we see Arc (as O) dying for his convictions. How can there be a chapter P with Arc dead?

It wasn't obvious because the chapter titles are based on the doctors' names for the patient which isn't consistent with the names the viewpoint characters are choosing to go by.

It's why Benedict_SC is apologizing in the final author's notes for "this pointlessly mean final 'chapter' included". It's not for having nothing in the final chapter, but rather for getting our hopes up that Arc somehow survived.
