I see. I suppose from my perspective I didn't find it nearly as jarring, likely due to my social circle having normalized being open about personal pronoun usage; most notably, everyone on slack in my office has them declared, with a not-insignificant minority identifying as non-binary and preferring to use they/them pronouns.

As a result, their inclusion in the story felt a lot less arbitrary/awkward in the story to be, in the same way that one of the doctors being female didn't seem like a notable detail in any manner to me.
