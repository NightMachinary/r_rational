  I don't agree that that's the point.

Really? I didn't think it was very subtle, it seems pretty blatantly to be the central theme of the work IMO. Not necessarily to teach us not to be like them, though. I think this whole work can be seen sort of as a tragedy, in that it relies a lot on dramatic irony and the knowledge that things will not go well for our protagonists. But getting back to the point, it's the subtitle of the whole work: "/Too clever for their own good/".
