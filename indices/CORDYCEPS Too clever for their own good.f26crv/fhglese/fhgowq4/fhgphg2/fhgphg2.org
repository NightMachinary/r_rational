Yes, from the doctors. There's already a lot of malpractice going on and here a doctor can molest someone and wipe their memory afterwards.

To be honest the face to face is much worse. If the doctor is wearing a mask you're far more likely to believe you have an infectious disease.

Regardless I was referring to the lax guard, but I guess like any apocalypse you get used to it.

I don't agree that that's the point. I think it's simply required for the story. We're not meant to learn from his paranoia because you might as well write a story where it saves him. I do think the character is very believable whereas HPJEV isn't for example. Even his choice at the end while sympathetic is silly when you can read about yourself afterwards. Just write down some goals or motives and hope future you will carry them out. Better odds than death. Your brain is surely likely to be close to your utility function. Of course if you care about nothing but your ego then it's irrelevant but Arc professed to caring about Gavin and why wouldn't Arc2.0 also do so?

A rational actor would probably just listen to the doctor, think about what's most likely, and then obey the doctor.
