  Joffrey eventually discovers things about his world that contradict the established lore of Game of Thrones and will almost certainly contradict whatever the ending of A Song of Ice and Fire ends up being.

There's also some exploration of parts of the world where Martin hasn't gone, like the ruins of Valyria and an extremely prolonged arc in Yi Ti. The arc is necessary, as Joffrey learns a lot of things that he needs to know there, but it goes on a lot longer than I think it needs to.

This story is remarkable in that it takes the loathsome Joffrey right out of the show, right at the end where he had done all of the evil things that have caused so much havoc for his actor, Jack Gleeson, from people who can't distinguish fiction from reality, and actually puts him on a believable journey towards redemption.
