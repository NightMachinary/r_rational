That's very helpful, thanks. One follow-up question: How dramatic is the AU compared to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11861559/1/Wearing-Robert-s-Crown][Wearing Robert's Crown]]? I liked that fic (SI with knowledge of the series replaces Robert Baratheon's mind during the tail end of Robert's Rebellion, depicted entirely from other people's viewpoints), but it got /extremely/ AU around the time of Robert's death and I couldn't actually stand it. The most ridiculous thing was The Night's King or whatever term they used just... waved a hand and made the *entire Wall* contract to an ice palace in the middle of its prior length. Like the Wall had always been his own creation rather than a wall designed specifically to /keep him out/, and he could have destroyed it any time he liked.
