It isn't for everyone, but I enjoyed reading it. A variety of *deeply* satisfying moments right in Westeros and in far-off, unknown corners of the world. I can think of two that are straight-up cathartic. And not measly “successful revenge” cathartic, like... character redemption catharsis.

Don't take chapter 1/the prologue too seriously though.

Another thing: if you do not appreciate martial training, building renown among one's troops, and moments of glory in war then multiple arcs will feel like a slog to you.
