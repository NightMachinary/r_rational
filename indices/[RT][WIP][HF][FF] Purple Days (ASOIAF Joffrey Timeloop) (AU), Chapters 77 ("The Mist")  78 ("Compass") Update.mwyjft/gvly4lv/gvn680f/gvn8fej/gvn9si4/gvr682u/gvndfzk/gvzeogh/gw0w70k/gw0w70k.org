Yes, it does delve into AU territory. It's hard to say the details without getting spoilery, but you know the saying about how if you give Frodo a lightsaber then you also need to give Sauron a Death Star? That principle is in play in this fic, though it takes some time for the how and why of that to become evident.

But I would say that the AU-ness is done way better than what you described in that other fic. The story takes its time building Joffrey up after breaking him down, and any victories and advantages that he gets feel /earned/. And the obstacles that he has to face are interesting and satisfying to overcome too. Honestly, the best thing I can say about the story is that replaced the original canon for me in the same way that that HPMOR and Animorphs: The Reckoning replaced the originals in my mind too.
