  Anyone up for giving a more detailed summary than 'Joffrey Timeloop'?
#+end_quote

After Joffrey dies at the Purple Wedding (spoilers for /A Storm of Swords//"The Lion and the Rose") he wakes up back at his apartments in the Red Keep, three days after the death of Jon Arryn. The same thing keeps happening each time he croaks. Now he must decide what to do with this power, whether that means trying to win the game of thrones, finding some way to give meaning to his endless existence, or perhaps even learning why all this is happening to him in the first place...

  How long does Joffrey take to stop being utterly awful?
#+end_quote

Chapter 7 is when Joffrey hits rock bottom and starts reforming himself. The chapters before might be a bit of a slog because Joffrey starts out as his charming canon self and reading about his stupidities can get old really quick.

  In what sense is it relevantly an AU on top of a time loop?
#+end_quote

Joffrey eventually discovers things about his world that contradict the established lore of /Game of Thrones/ and will almost certainly contradict whatever the ending of /A Song of Ice and Fire/ ends up being.
