I've read this so long ago, I barely remember where I left it. I like this story, it's pretty fun for a timeloop story, has its own twists and worldbuilding expansion (somewhat reminiscent of time braid in this regard, the fact it expands on existing cannon). I hope to see a notification for epilogue one day, so I could do a proper reread.
