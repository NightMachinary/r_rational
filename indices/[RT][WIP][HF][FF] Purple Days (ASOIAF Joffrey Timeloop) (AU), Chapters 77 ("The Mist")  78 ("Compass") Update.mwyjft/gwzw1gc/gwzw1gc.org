Just got caught up on this. All in all, pretty enjoyable. Some of the arcs made my eyes glaze over a little, but my attention span is pretty damaged recently for unrelated reasons, so ymmv. I'm guilty of having skimmed a few of the chapters, but as others have noted, some of the big cathartic moments are pretty top-tier stuff.
