Probably [[http://royalroadl.com/fiction/3670][Wanderlust]] by [[/u/Lunitan]]?

The secret to finding it was querying every single instance of royalroadl in the comments of [[/r/rational]] with Google's BigQuery. Google searches through the text, not the links, and the naked link was never posted, so there wasn't any other way to find it.

#+begin_example
  SELECT
    *
  FROM
    [fh-bigquery:reddit_comments.2015_10] a
  WHERE
    a.subreddit='rational'
    AND a.body CONTAINS 'royalroadl'
  LIMIT
    1000
