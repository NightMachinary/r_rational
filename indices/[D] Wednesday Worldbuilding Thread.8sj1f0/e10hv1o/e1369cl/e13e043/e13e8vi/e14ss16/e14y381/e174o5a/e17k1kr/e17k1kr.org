I've actually got a super scummy meta even though I haven't rolled scum in years...

There's a new frustratingly always-town kid on the block, and things have slowed down a lot - one game at a time nowadays, usually only about 12 players. We have been having a hard time finding replacements lately (in fact this current game we might have to modkill at MYLO due to lack of replacements).

I've also modded 2 or 3 games now, and I find that a lot of fun, though coming up with mechanics less so.

btw, I'd appreciate you editing out my other username in your comment if that's OK :)
