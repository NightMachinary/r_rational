Magic which is highly dependent upon time of day and time of year?

Suppose the Earth were orbiting through a cloud of aether which grants magical powers to certain people if the right techniques to harness it are used. The cloud could stay in a fixed position relative to the sun, perhaps a kind of gravitationally-attracted dark matter with an ultra-low density, so it is actually pressure that pushes it out to the orbit of Earth, rather than it maintaining a stable orbit around the sun. This is how the Earth is able to move through the cloud during the course of the year.

Suppose the cloud has many 'bubbles', and 'pockets' possibly of various 'colors' which are different in different places. The different colors of the dark matter tend to be cohesively drawn towards accumulations of the same color. If different colors have different effects on magic, perhaps allowing different types of magic or not allowing magic at all, then you'd have substantial changes in your magic system during the course of the year. Constellations would just be a proxy for time of year, so if magic works one way when Orion is highest in the sky at midnight, it should work the same way at the same time next year.
