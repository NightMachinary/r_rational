Astron particles are produced whenever nuclear reactions occur. They have two odd properties: First, perpendicular interference of astron particles is destructive, 120 degrees between sources is constructive. Second, when produced they are in a weakly interacting state. They maintain this state until they enter the vacuum of space (until they escape the celestial body that produced them) and once there they start interacting with matter much more strongly. While in the weakly interacting state the astron particles convert between types readily, meaning that different celestial bodies produce various flavors and concentrations of particles based upon chemical composition. While in a strongly interacting state, they tend not to transform.

Life on Earth evolved to use astron particles from the sun to inform circadian rhythms. However, particles from the other planetary bodies also affect the rhythms of life. Neurons produce the enzymes that produce the chemicals that interact most strongly with astron particles. The specific enzymes that an organism produces in abundance depend on which particles it was exposed to first: in short, which heavenly bodies are visible at its birth. There is an epigenetic mechanism that affects a person's ability to interact with astron particles.

A further complication: humans can willfully change how many astron-interacting chemicals their bodies produce, along with the specific position of their nerves, to cast spells. With a gesture and some will: magic. If the heavenly bodies are currently producing a lot of astron particles that the human is attuned to, without destructive interference, the spells get stronger.

All stars that undergo fusion produce neutrinos. Some, however, also produce rare astron particles in abundance. Which? Only those that coincidentally fall into a pulsating state, in which variances in pressure and astron particle density within the star become stable loops that convert some of the star's heat into astron particles--and those stars with an elemental composition favorable to a certain type of particle.

Humans notice constellations of stars in the night sky, and constellations that happen to contain a star producing an abundance of astron particles tend to be reinforced in the popular imagination. After all, if fire mages tend to be born when Mars is in Leo (when a star in Leo is constructively interfering with Mars itself), you'd notice.

Feel free to use all, some or none of these ideas. Also, preliminary consequences:

- fighting with magic underground is impossible
- you could keep children underground until fortuitous alignments
- nuclear reactors in vacuum chambers could power up spells
- the only way to get an Earth mage is to have someone give birth in orbit... or in a chamber surrounded by vacuum
