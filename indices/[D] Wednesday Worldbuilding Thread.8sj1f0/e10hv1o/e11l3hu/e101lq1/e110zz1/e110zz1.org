The protagonist has been accidentally summoned to a different realm. He ends up as a student in a boarding school where students learn magic in addition to the normal subjects. Adjacent to this reality is a Virtual Realm that's based on a game that is suspiciously similar to Minecraft in our world. The protagonist is familiar with the game and is ludicrously OP (the entire thing is played for laughs). The story itself isn't very rational, but I would like to work on worldbuilding anyways. Here's what I've got so far:

- People are physically transported to VR through virtualization mats. If their avatar is killed, they simply respawn or return to RL. Despite this, people tend to treat death in VR just as seriously as death in RL. It's a little unrealistic, but it's necessary to set up some of the jokes.

- The magic system in both worlds uses magic circles, and the circles have identical meanings between the worlds. The only different is how they're used.

- Modern conveniences like indoor plumbing exist IRL.

- VR is split into shards, which are basically parallel realities that have different qualities based on the keywords used to create/access them.

- VR is very heavily gamified, with XP, crafting, loot drops, treasure chests in randomly-generated dungeons, and equipment and monsters of various tiers of strength.

- Physical objects cannot be pulled from VR to RL or vice versa. A banking guild helps move currency between VR and RL. Thus, events in VR can strongly influence things IRL and vice versa.

- Teleporters may or may not exist IRL. I haven't decided yet.

- A /lot/ of information about the game mechanics in VR have been lost to the ages. The protagonist knows /all/ of it, and constantly surprises his opponents. Like I said, it's played for laughs.

I guess my main question is this: in a world(s) like this, what large-scale resources are available, and how do those resources constrain or encourage population growth?

I realize that technically I should be the person to answer this, but it's just such a large question that I get a bit overwhelmed.
