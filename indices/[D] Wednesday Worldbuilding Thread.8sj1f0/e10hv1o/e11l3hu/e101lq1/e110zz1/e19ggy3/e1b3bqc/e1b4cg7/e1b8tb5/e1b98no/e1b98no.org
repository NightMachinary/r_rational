  No, you disappear completely in a flash of light as both your body and mind are converted to ones and zeroes. The body is used as a template to create the avatar, but what you were wearing is not used to create the avatar's clothing.

So, my clothing vanishes with me? Hmmm.

Let us say I have some small object (a key or whatever) which I wish to store securely and prevent anyone else from ever finding. I put the object in my pocket and upload to VR; as long as I stay in there, I securely deny anyone else use of the key, right?

  I was actually imagining something like the telepod from Chrono Trigger.

Hmmm. Since you exit clothed, that makes sense.

  Weird, huh? The spells in RL were essentially copied from VR, so there's a heavy focus on the sort of offensive spells you'd find in a JRPG. Ice Storm, Fire Bolt, that sort of thing. Off the top of my head, three possible plant spells are "Tangling Vines", "Vine Whip", and "Thorn Bush".

And not "Summon Crocodile"? That's certainly an offensive spell. (But not quite as offensive as "Summon Skunk").

  In theory this might be possible, but the VR mat technology is currently large and bulky and essentially connected to a land line.
#+end_quote

So, I put the Mat on a cart and - what happens if the landline is unplugged while the Mat is in use? Is the user killed or merely unable to return until it's plugged in again?

  No. There are all sorts of safeguards to prevent something like this from happening. The primary one is a Unique Identifier (UID) that connects each avatar with their digital soul, though there are plenty of other safeguards as well. There is no known way to hack the system (though there are plenty of minor glitches that don't actually detract from the fun), and to bypass the UID constraints you'd pretty much need to be at the power level of the deity who created the system in the first place.

Hmmm. What about genetically identical twins who use the same Mat?
