One Punch Man is similar to memetic Chuck Norris, in that their numeric power ratings are both "Yes". The difference is Chuck Norris jokes are "look at this thing Chuck Norris can do that people can't actually do," while OPM is "look how OPM acts, isn't that silly?"

Example 1: One Punch Man is facing off against a monstrous foe whose power limiter has just been shattered. It's a very tense, very serious, very dramatic moment. [[https://i.imgur.com/SvKPSHp.jpg][OPM's reaction.]]

Example 2: Saitama, the titular One Punch Man, gets his name because he is so powerful that he can defeat /any/ opponent in one punch. This is not a brag or an exaggeration. He is the strongest, most powerful entity on the planet, and possibly the entire galaxy. He's actually pretty bummed about it, because it's impossible for him to find anybody that can challenge him. So how did he get his impossibly-strong powers? [[https://i.imgur.com/jIi9hTV.jpg][Well...]] (read right to left)
