  Huh. I guess so. Either that or the aging process continues even when people are in VR (mostly so I don't have to deal with "older than I look" characters), so the minion would have to have been trapped within the last eighty years or so.

If the aging process continues to affect their physical body, then Minion might well be in a situation where he'll crumble to dust the moment he leaves VR. But is it possible to die of old age while /in/ VR?

...actually, if you die in VR, you reappear on the mat, right? What if your Mat has been unplugged? Do you then reappear the moment it's plugged in again?

So, our key-hiding Villain can take things a step further by killing Minion in VR to make his key even more inaccessible... and the instant the Mat is plugged in again, Minion appears on it, key and all.

Also, if I fear that I will soon die of old age, can I seek immortality via permanent VR upload?

  No. Summoned matter is pulled from all over the world, a few molecules at a place.

Oh, this is /absolutely/ dangerous, unless there are safety limits about where these molecules can come from. (Think about it - if I cast Summon Germanium and pull a few molecules from a computer chip - any computer chip - the thing could stop working or start functioning erratically; this would make anything requiring integrated circuits unreliable. And if I summon a few molecules from someone's brain...).

  It's a combination of the login time /and/ the mat's location on the network /and/ a checksum of the player's digitized body.

[[/twiwink][]] So, it requires logging in at the same time (probably going to need clock resetting), /and/ using the same Mat, /and/ the two people being genetically identical twins?

The 'genetically identical twins' thing also avoids a lot of the wrong-brain-wrong-body problems by having the bodies being, after all, genetically identical (and thus far easier to handwave).
