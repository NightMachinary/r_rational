...right, I somehow thought you were forced to log out (which is only a problem if your internet connection has been sabotaged).

But if it's respawn /OR/ log out, and especially if the 'log out' button is grayed out when your Mat doesn't have an internet connection, then all of that of course goes out the window.

  In theory, yes, but you'd need to know enough about both the human body and the software to fix it. There's no "fix cancer" button.

Naturally, yes. This isn't something one does casually.

  Also, here's what I have written so far, in case you're curious.

...you realise your protagonist is a clear Mary Sue, right?

I mean, not to the /extremes/ that some authors take it, but in the first handful of chapters he has, as a student in a world that he was accidentally bought to, shown up the teacher of a subject that doesn't exist in his own world in said teacher's own classroom, had some very personal time with a girl he'd met not an hour before, and easily defeated the school bully with a technique noted as too powerful for anyone to know about. (A school bully who both saw the trick in question and has no reason not to tell other people enough to figure out what it was, too).
