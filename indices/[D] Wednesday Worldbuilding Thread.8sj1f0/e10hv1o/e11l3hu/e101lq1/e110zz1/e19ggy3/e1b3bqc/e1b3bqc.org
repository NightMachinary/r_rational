Excellent questions.

  What happens to your clothes when entering/leaving VR?
#+end_quote

While in VR your body is held in digital stasis while your consciousness inhabits an avatar. The face, hair, skin color and proportions of the avatar are all the same as your physical body, but you're given generic clothing to start with. If you want to wear a different outfit you either have to craft it or buy it.

  What sort of magic is taught in this world?
#+end_quote

Primarily the ability to create matter and energy ex nihilo. Sadly, a lot of knowledge has been lost and very, very few people can cast any spells outside of the 7 primary elements (fire, air, water, light, plant, earth, and darkness). Additionally, nobody knows how to customize their spells, so a spell will always have the exact same properties (strength, speed, size, etc.) each time it is cast. The protagonist is the exception to both of these rules.

  Can you leave VR through a different virtualisation mat than the one you entered through?

I've struggled with that exact question myself. Honestly I'm not sure, but I'm leaning towards "no".
