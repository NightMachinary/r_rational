  death in VR
#+end_quote

Sorry, I should have mentioned this earlier. Death is a slap on the wrist in VR. If your avatar loses all their health, you're just given the option to either respawn at the nearest spawn point or logout. You also drop anything you had equipped when you die, but you keep anything in your inventory that wasn't equipped. Better hope nobody else picks up your dropped loot before you can get back to it.

  ...if I have access to the underlying software (which no-one knows how to interface with) then I can also edit a body, right? Thus (for example) curing a friend's cancer?

In theory, yes, but you'd need to know enough about both the human body and the software to fix it. There's no "fix cancer" button.
