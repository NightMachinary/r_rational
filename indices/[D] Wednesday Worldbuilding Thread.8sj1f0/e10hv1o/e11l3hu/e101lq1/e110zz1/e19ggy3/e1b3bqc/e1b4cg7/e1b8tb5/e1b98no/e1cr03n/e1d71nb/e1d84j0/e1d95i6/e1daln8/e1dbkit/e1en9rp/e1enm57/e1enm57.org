Huh. I was originally considering changing molecules to atoms, just because I thought it would have less of an effect. Apparently that's not the case. Good to know. :)

  This has the interesting consequence that you cannot summon materials that don't already exist somewhere in the world I think?

Well, that depends on if the spell can break down molecules into their constituent atoms and recombine them into new molecules, or if it just places the summoned molecules together. Even if it can't break the molecules down to the atoms, the spell still has a lot of leeway in how the molecules are put together.
