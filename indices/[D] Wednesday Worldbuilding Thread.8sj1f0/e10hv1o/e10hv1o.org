I have a question to see if anyone can reconcile this form of magic. In this world, astrology and constellations are important for magic. However the worlds wider universe functions pretty much exactly as ours does. Can anyone think of anyway to have both of these at the same time. I just kind of want to see if anyone has any ideas.
