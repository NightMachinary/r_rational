I had an idea for a campaign where there's an alignment system that if you don't pay super close attention to looks alright, but if you start actually investigating what causes alignment shifts it soon becomes apparent that good and evil are pretty divorced from what most people consider right and wrong.

I thought it might be interesting to explore a world where Objective Morality is definitely real and observable, but doesn't really correspond to our own sense of morality. I'm not sure if that idea is interesting to you.
