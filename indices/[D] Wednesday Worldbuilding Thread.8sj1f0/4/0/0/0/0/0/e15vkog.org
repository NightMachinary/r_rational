The Sword of Good has the titular sword there though, which seems to follow what our sense of morality would be and provide a non-arbitrary benchmark.

With the alignment system, the only extra parts would be in how your alignment interacts with various spells and objects. Detect Evil and Detect Good detect your game alignment, I was also intending to have it be important for what spells clerics could cast (cure wounds is good, cause wounds is evil, neutral clerics can use both), and it's important for the Paladins to stay Paladins. But the main weirdness comes in because nothing else can cause an alignment shift, and the morality only looks locally, so it only counts the person who actually did the deed. The alignment system doesn't consider anything else we'd consider wrong- theft, torture, etc.

Yeah, I think I got the idea from MMO PVP rules. In my conception, there would be two types of NPCs, standard-type NPCs and PC-type NPCs, who who follow the same rules PCs do and 'act' like a PC might. There would be a meta-alignment in the sense of how different PC-types reacted to and interacted with the game alignment, which would hopefully encourage exploration by the PCs. Some PC-types might hold to the artificial alignment system. Others might treat it as just another game mechanic to work around, keeping their cleric Good to get better access to healing.

Another aspect of the meta-alignment would be how PC-types interacted with and thought about the NPC types and each other. For instance, it'd be pretty common for a PC-type to be Good and "play" the hero, but to ultimately not really think of anyone outside their party members as people with moral worth. In contrast they'd also be PC-types who consider all other PC-types people, and always act extremely morally toward them, sometimes risking life and magic items to save fellows, but don't consider standard-type NPCs to be anything more than a bag of loot and XP, and their alignment would usually vary with class. And they'd be a few PC-types who consider NPCs people and genuinely try to defend them, but sometimes have had to throw out the game-alignment to do so, for instance having had to kill the Good cleric of an NPC-disregarding party.
