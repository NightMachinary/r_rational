  The average cell has roughly 100,000,000,000,000 atoms in it, so I don't think it would be a big deal if a small handful of them went missing.

I don't know much about biology either, but if I understand right, proteins and cell walls and etc. are largely composed of carbon chains with various functional groups, and, well...

/The average ship's anchor chain has roughly 10 000 chain links/ (I pulled that number out of my ass) /in it, so I don't think it would be a big deal if a small handful of them went missing./

See the problem? God knows what biochemical properties you'll create if you randomly remove a carbon atom from a protein. And depending on the mechanism of atom removal, you might end up with unstable charged ions or reactive free radicals in places they really should't be.

EDIT: *never mind*. abcd_z said that individual /molecules/ were teleported, not atoms. So things aren't so horrible. (This has the interesting consequence that you cannot summon materials that don't already exist somewhere in the world I think?)
