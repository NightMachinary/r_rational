  So, if I really want to deny someone access to a key (and I'm evil), then I get a mook to carry it, send him into VR, and then unplug his mat - until it's plugged in again, no-one gets the key.

  If I'm more concerned about preventing access to the key than about using it myself, I can optionally disassemble or even smash the Mat my minion used (trapping him eternally in VR, but if I'm evil I won't much care).

  It that has ever happened then the minion in question is presumably still wandering around somewhere in VR, very high-level and more than a little bit miffed.

Huh. I guess so. Either that or the aging process continues even when people are in VR (mostly so I don't have to deal with "older than I look" characters), so the minion would have to have been trapped within the last eighty years or so.

  Hmmmm. Question - can summoned matter be unsummoned?

  If no - then summoned water, over the centuries, must have significantly raised the sea level. If yes - there's a potentially lethal attack against anyone who eats mainly summoned matter.
#+end_quote

No. Summoned matter is pulled from all over the world, a few molecules at a place. The overall water level on the planet doesn't change, but the local water tables /might/ change over time if several generations of city-dwellers have a habit of summoning water indiscriminately.

  Hmmm... unless someone (i.e. the protagonist) finds a way to duplicate someone else's UID.

  Idea - perhaps the UIDs are generated using the exact time (to the nanosecond) that the person logged in as a seed to a pseudorandom number generator. With a long enough generator, you could easily have a situation where the same UID won't turn up for two different logins for ten thousand years... unless the two people log in at the exact same time. A Protagonist who inspects someone else's log files and is willing to manually re-set the clock on his own Mat can take advantage of this, should he so desire.

It's a combination of the login time /and/ the mat's location on the network /and/ a checksum of the player's digitized body. Like I said, there are a lot of safeguards on this thing. The current residents of the planet don't know how to access the demiplane where the digital souls are stored, nor do they realize that such a thing even exists.

The reason I'm so particular about "no body swaps" is because it feels to me like it would very easy for something to go catastrophically wrong if you tried placing the wrong brain in the wrong body. It would be like swapping out a code library with a completely unrelated one and then expecting the program to compile properly.

Of course, this is ultimately a fantasy setting, and I could /easily/ hand-wave that particular sticking point, but... I don't wanna. :P
