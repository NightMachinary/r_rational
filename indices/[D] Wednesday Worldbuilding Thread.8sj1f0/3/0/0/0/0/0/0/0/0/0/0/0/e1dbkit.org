  When your body dies in VR without any mat, your body just doesn't reappear IRL. So yes, this is something that could be done to make something permanently inaccessible

Hmmm... so this is one way to commit a perfect murder. Wait for your victim to enter VR, then cut off his internet access, then arrange to have him killed in VR (then, just to make things harder for any investigators, re-enable his internet line).

No dead body for anyone to ask inconvenient questions about...

  Ooh, that's another good reason to have aging in VR.
#+end_quote

To be fair, it's not true immortality - even in the non-aging case, it's only immortality until killed in VR (which, if the VR environment is dangerous enough, might very easily only be a few years).

  Not really. The average cell has roughly 100,000,000,000,000 atoms in it, so I don't think it would be a big deal if a small handful of them went missing.

Hmmm. Well, I don't know enough biology to be certain, but from the little I do know I think I agree with you in general - though I'm really not sure how well the brain would handle this. (I wouldn't expect 'lethal', though).

But pulling germanium molecules out of high-density doped-silicon computer chips /is/ going to mess them up.

  Once you've done all of that, then yes, it is possible to swap bodies. Far more effort than it's worth, though.
#+end_quote

Fair point.

...if I have access to the underlying software (which no-one knows how to interface with) then I can also edit a body, right? Thus (for example) curing a friend's cancer?
