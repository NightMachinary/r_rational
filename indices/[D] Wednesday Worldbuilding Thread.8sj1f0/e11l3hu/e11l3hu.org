This might be the wrong weekly thread, but because it deals explicitly with Delphic, I thought I'd put it here. Spoilers for the most recent chapter (2.6 Painful Questions).

So, certain supers are using "enhanced interrogation" to extract information from criminals (ask a question, detect if the person is lying, inflict pain if so, rinse and repeat). When I introduced this, I took for granted that most people (and presumably the readers) would find this deeply disturbing and immoral.

That's not the feedback I received. One particular beta reader indicated that this "solves the problems" of interrogation by not physically harming the person, and that if this technique were possible in the real world, we should use it regularly.

Other comments I've received were primarily worried about danger in reputation or legal prosecution of the supers, presuming they must have some way of covering it up. The voices I heard from either indicated no immediate qualms with the practice, or minor concerns that could be overcome if the resulting intel was good.

So, have I just entirely misunderstood where people stand on these issues? Is inflicting temporary pain, in a situation where it isn't coupled to injury and can reliably produce information, as tilted on the balance of benefit versus harm that the controversy primarily boils down to controlling (ignorant) public backlash?
