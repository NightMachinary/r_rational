I think the problem is the simplicity of the frame. Not your fault so much as the fault of fictional stories in general.

What is a lie? If it's fact vs. falsehood then just ask the question to anyone (yourself, even!) and learn the truth from their guesses. No torture required. More probably the power is detecting the physiological process of deception.

How is this willful deception being detected? There has to be enough subtlety to distinguish between a lie by omission and genuine lack of knowledge, so by the time someone has been thoroughly tortured, their goal may so strongly be to end the pain rather than to answer the question that every answer might read as deceptive.

Even if the read is flawless, introduce (for example) an "innocent" who is protecting a criminal by pretending to be one. Everything they say will be deceptive.

Alternately a mercenary employed by a criminal may truthfully have no knowledge of the particulars the heroes want, but may believe truly terrible things will happen if the heroes realize this. "I don't know," will remain deceptive to some degree, even as it is also the truth.

All sorts of more subtle examples exist inside the minds of real torture victims. Knowledge is complex and deception is complex.

Your readers are reacting to a set of simple facts: The criminal is definitely guilty. He knows what the heroes want to know. They know exactly when he has told them everything he knows. This information is safe, and it saves lives at little cost to anyone. Very few real world situations match this frame, yet most fictional torture scenarios do.

And waterboarding, done properly, is almost exactly as "safe" and "temporary" as the paralysis/pain trick.
