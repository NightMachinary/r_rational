So, if I /really/ want to deny someone access to a key (and I'm evil), then I get a mook to carry it, send him into VR, and then unplug his mat - until it's plugged in again, no-one gets the key.

If I'm more concerned about preventing access to the key than about using it myself, I can optionally disassemble or even smash the Mat my minion used (trapping him eternally in VR, but if I'm evil I won't much care).

It that has /ever/ happened then the minion in question is presumably still wandering around somewhere in VR, very high-level and more than a little bit miffed.

  this does open the way for a very interesting plot point, "Only the protagonist and some savages eat meat. Everybody else eats summoned plant matter."

Hmmmm. Question - can summoned matter be unsummoned?

If no - then summoned water, over the centuries, must have significantly raised the sea level. If yes - there's a potentially lethal attack against anyone who eats mainly summoned matter.

  Doesn't matter; they get different UIDs, which are created and assigned anew each time they enter VR, so there's no chance of them exiting into the wrong bodies.

Hmmm... unless someone (i.e. the protagonist) finds a way to duplicate someone else's UID.

Idea - perhaps the UIDs are generated using the exact time (to the nanosecond) that the person logged in as a seed to a pseudorandom number generator. With a long enough generator, you could easily have a situation where the same UID won't turn up for two different logins for ten thousand years... /unless/ the two people log in at the exact same time. A Protagonist who inspects someone else's log files and is willing to manually re-set the clock on his own Mat can take advantage of this, should he so desire.
