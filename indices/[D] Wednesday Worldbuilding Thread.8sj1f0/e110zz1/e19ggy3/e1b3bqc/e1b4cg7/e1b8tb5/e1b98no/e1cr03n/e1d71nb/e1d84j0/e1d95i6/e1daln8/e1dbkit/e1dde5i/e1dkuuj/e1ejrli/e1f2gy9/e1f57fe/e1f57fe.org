More like a parody of xianxia novels. Just like in xianxia novels, the protagonist is constantly underestimated by his opponents, so everybody is shocked and stunned by him beating said opponent.

The main difference is that xianxia stories take themselves seriously, while this story pointedly does not.

EDIT: or One-Punch Man, if you're familiar with that. He's OP, sure, but that's not the point of the story.
