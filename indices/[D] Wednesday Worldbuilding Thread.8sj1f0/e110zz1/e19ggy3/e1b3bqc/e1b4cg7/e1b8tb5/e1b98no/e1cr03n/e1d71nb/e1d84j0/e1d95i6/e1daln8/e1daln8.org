  If the aging process continues to affect their physical body, then Minion might well be in a situation where he'll crumble to dust the moment he leaves VR. But is it possible to die of old age while in VR?
#+end_quote

/If/ aging occurs in VR, then it is possible to die in VR. When your body dies in VR without any mat, your body just doesn't reappear IRL. So yes, this is something that could be done to make something permanently inaccessible. Somebody with Admin access (which, as previously stated, pretty much requires you to be a deity) could fish the object out of the digital demiplane, but that's basically never going to happen.

  So, our key-hiding Villain can take things a step further by killing Minion in VR to make his key even more inaccessible... and the instant the Mat is plugged in again, Minion appears on it, key and all.

No, only the operator of the avatar can initiate the logout to RL. If the operator is dead there's no way for the body to reappear IRL short of divine intervention.

  Also, if I fear that I will soon die of old age, can I seek immortality via permanent VR upload?

Ooh, that's another good reason to have aging in VR.

  Oh, this is absolutely dangerous, unless there are safety limits about where these molecules can come from. (Think about it - if I cast Summon Germanium and pull a few molecules from a computer chip - any computer chip - the thing could stop working or start functioning erratically; this would make anything requiring integrated circuits unreliable. And if I summon a few molecules from someone's brain...).

Not really. The average cell has roughly 100,000,000,000,000 atoms in it, so I don't think it would be a big deal if a small handful of them went missing.

  So, it requires logging in at the same time (probably going to need clock resetting), and using the same Mat, and the two people being genetically identical twins?

  The 'genetically identical twins' thing also avoids a lot of the wrong-brain-wrong-body problems by having the bodies being, after all, genetically identical (and thus far easier to handwave).

Okay, if you're determined to spoof it, you'd need access to the underlying software, which nobody knows about and nobody knows how to access, and probably requires a very, very large amount of mana to interface with. Once there, you'd need to alter the UID in some way, either swapping the UIDs of two people or just copying one person's body over another person's. Then you'd need to add some sort of hand-wave program to the code to prevent catastrophic failure and allow the mind to properly interface with a completely foreign body.

Once you've done all of that, then yes, it is possible to swap bodies. Far more effort than it's worth, though.
