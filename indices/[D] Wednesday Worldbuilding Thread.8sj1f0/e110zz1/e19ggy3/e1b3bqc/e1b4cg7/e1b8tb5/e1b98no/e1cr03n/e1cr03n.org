  So, my clothing vanishes with me? Hmmm.

  Let us say I have some small object (a key or whatever) which I wish to store securely and prevent anyone else from ever finding. I put the object in my pocket and upload to VR; as long as I stay in there, I securely deny anyone else use of the key, right?

Yup.

  And not "Summon Crocodile"? That's certainly an offensive spell. (But not quite as offensive as "Summon Skunk").

What can I say? That's just not the magical paradigm. Like I mentioned before, the system was created by some sort of deity, so some of the decisions are a little arbitrary.

EDIT: although, now that you mention it, this does open the way for a very interesting plot point, "Only the protagonist and some savages eat meat. Everybody else eats summoned plant matter."

  So, I put the Mat on a cart and - what happens if the landline is unplugged while the Mat is in use? Is the user killed or merely unable to return until it's plugged in again?
#+end_quote

Just the second one. It's very unlikely to happen, but I'm sure at some point there was a situation where people were stranded in VR until the mat could get fixed.

  Hmmm. What about genetically identical twins who use the same Mat?
#+end_quote

Doesn't matter; they get different UIDs, which are created and assigned anew each time they enter VR, so there's no chance of them exiting into the wrong bodies.

In theory there's a chance of hash collision, where two UIDs coincidentally happen to be the same, but that's so unlikely it will basically never happen. Statistically speaking, the age of the universe wouldn't be enough time for a hash collision to happen even once.
