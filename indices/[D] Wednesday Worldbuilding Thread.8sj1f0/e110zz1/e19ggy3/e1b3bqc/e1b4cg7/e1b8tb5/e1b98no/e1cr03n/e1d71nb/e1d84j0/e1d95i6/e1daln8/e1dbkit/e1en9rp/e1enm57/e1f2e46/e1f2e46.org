Grabbing carbon or oxygen or even hydrogen atoms out of the middle of molecules will /definitely/ be worse than grabbing the individual molecules themselves.

Neither my biology nor my radiation physics are strong enough to be sure of this, but I imagine that snatching individual atoms out of people would have effects similar to hitting them with alpha particle radiation - not immediately lethal, but not exactly something you want to do, either.
