  Hmmmm. So, when I activate the Mat, my clothing collapses empty to the ground while my body is in digital stasis; and when I exit, I'm not wearing anything but my clothing is handily placed around my feet?

No, you disappear completely in a flash of light as both your body and mind are converted to ones and zeroes. The body is used as a template to create the avatar, but what you were wearing is not used to create the avatar's clothing. Instead, your avatar wears whatever clothing you have equipped in-game (or the default clothing if you're a new player). Your mind controls the avatar from a first-person perspective. When you're done in VR your body (and clothing) is reconstructed IRL from the digital representation.

I have no idea where the digital representation is stored, though. Presumably someplace that is effectively impossible to access, simply because I don't want to write a story where a person's mental integrity is anything less than one hundred percent sacrosanct.

  If this world has a nudity taboo, then VR mats are probably usually used in private rooms or small, opaque booths.

I was actually imagining something like [[https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/chronowiki/images/c/c3/Telepod.gif][the telepod from Chrono Trigger]].

  So there can be a spell to summon up a fern, but not to summon a chihuahua?
#+end_quote

Weird, huh? The spells in RL were essentially copied from VR, so there's a heavy focus on the sort of offensive spells you'd find in a JRPG. Ice Storm, Fire Bolt, that sort of thing. Off the top of my head, three possible plant spells are "Tangling Vines", "Vine Whip", and "Thorn Bush".

  Next question. Can I use a VR mat, then have a friend roll up the mat and carry it someplace else, then leave via the same mat but in a different location?
#+end_quote

Interesting question. In theory this might be possible, but the VR mat technology is currently large and bulky and essentially connected to a land line.

You do bring up an interesting question that I haven't yet explored: how do people IRL get around? I imagine the Academy to be at least somewhat secluded, so how do people arrive and leave? Car? Horse? Magical creature that acts as transportation?

...

Well, there you go. The Haderatch, a transport animal that can take its passengers from point A to point B without spending much time in the intervening space.

  If someone else is in VR, and I am in VR, then can I download my mind onto their body by exiting via their mat? (Do I need their permission to do this? Does it only work if we both entered using the same Mat but then left in the wrong order and got put in the wrong bodies?)
#+end_quote

No. There are all sorts of safeguards to prevent something like this from happening. The primary one is a Unique Identifier (UID) that connects each avatar with their digital soul, though there are plenty of other safeguards as well. There is no known way to hack the system (though there are plenty of minor glitches that don't actually detract from the fun), and to bypass the UID constraints you'd pretty much need to be at the power level of the deity who created the system in the first place.
