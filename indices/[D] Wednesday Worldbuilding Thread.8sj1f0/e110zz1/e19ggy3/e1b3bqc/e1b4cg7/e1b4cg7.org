  While in VR your body is held in digital stasis while your consciousness inhabits an avatar. The face, hair, skin color and proportions of the avatar are all the same as your physical body, but you're given generic clothing to start with. If you want to wear a different outfit you either have to craft it or buy it.

Hmmmm. So, when I activate the Mat, my clothing collapses empty to the ground while my body is in digital stasis; and when I exit, I'm not wearing anything but my clothing is handily placed around my feet?

If this world has a nudity taboo, then VR mats are probably usually used in private rooms or small, opaque booths.

So there can be a spell to summon up a fern, but not to summon a chihuahua?

  I've struggled with that exact question myself. Honestly I'm not sure, but I'm leaning towards "no".

Fair enough - had the answer been 'yes', then VR mats would have been usable as living-person-only teleportation pads.

Next question. Can I use a VR mat, then have a friend roll up the mat and carry it someplace else, then leave via the same mat but in a different location?

If someone else is in VR, and I am in VR, then can I download my mind onto their body by exiting via their mat? (Do I need their permission to do this? Does it only work if we both entered using the same Mat but then left in the wrong order and got put in the wrong bodies?)
