The first thing that comes to mind is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprinopsis_atramentaria][tippler's bane]], a mushroom that causes an acute reaction to alcohol. They're a super-easy mushroom to find, even in suburban environments, because they can often be found growing in lawns. Here's the relevant bit from Wikipedia:

  Consuming Coprinopsis atramentaria within a few hours of alcohol results in a "disulfiram syndrome". This interaction has only been known since the early part of the twentieth century. Symptoms include facial reddening, nausea, vomiting, malaise, agitation, palpitations and tingling in limbs, and arise five to ten minutes after consumption of alcohol. If no more alcohol is consumed, they will generally subside over two or three hours. Symptom severity is proportional to the amount of alcohol consumed, becoming evident when blood alcohol concentration reaches 5 mg/dL, and prominent at concentrations of 50--100 mg/dL. Disulfiram has, however, been known to cause myocardial infarction (heart attack). The symptoms can occur if even a small amount of alcohol is consumed up to three days after eating the mushrooms, although they are milder as more time passes. Rarely, a cardiac arrhythmia, such as atrial fibrillation on top of supraventricular tachycardia, may develop.

So, not the safest thing in the world, but you don't need a prescription and won't leave a paper trail that raises eyebrows, it's just some mushrooms and alcohol. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disulfiram][The page on disulfiram]] also gives some more information, if obtaining it from a pharmacy is feasible, and also provides some information on research into how it interacts with addictive behavior.
