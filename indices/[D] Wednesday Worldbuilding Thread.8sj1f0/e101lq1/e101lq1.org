[[https://www.reddit.com/r/Writeresearch/comments/8s83nc/ways_to_feel_miserable/][Crossposted]] with some rewrites from [[/r/writeresearch]]:

I'm looking for a way for a character to make themselves feel miserable on command. This character has a supernatural ability that is morally somewhat questionable, but using it feels really, really good so people with this power tend to find more and more justifications for using it.

The character in question is aware of this, so whenever she uses her powers she tries to counter this effect by deliberately inducing nausea, pain, depression or something similarly negative. Ideally I'm looking for some kind of mildly poisonous substance (like a pill or liquid) that makes you feel absolutely wrenched for a couple hours after ingesting it, but that is be at least moderately safe to take long term and acquirable for someone with a reasonable income and (if necessary) a cooperative doctor. Fast acting is better, but not a requirement.

A few of possibilities I have considered:

- Some kind of device that causes physical pain. The simplest form is just jamming a thumbtack into your skin, but there are all sorts of medieval torture devices to inflict physical pain on yourself. This is my current backup plan.
- Another option is to just have the character get stupid drunk the night before and only use magic with a severe hangover, but this is kinda impractical.
- A third option that I don't really like is to just handwave some (magical or biologic) feel-bad-juice and not specify the origin: "Oh this? It's just something that's going to make me feel like crap for a couple hours.", but even if I do something like that I'd rather that I, as the author, know the specifics.\\

I'd also be interested to know if there is any research into whether these kind of tactics are effective at preventing people from getting into (or helping them get out of) addictive behavior. My guess is "no" and the story works either way, I'd just be curious to know.
