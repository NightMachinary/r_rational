I'm not sure I understand what you mean when you say the premise of Sword of Good is that good/evil is essentially arbitrary. That seems pretty different from my read of the Sword of Good.

My own idea was for an idea for a campaign which is in a world that's determined by D&D rules, and as part of that a lot of stuff that would normally be left to DM discretion is formalized, but in a way that isn't quite right, in the same way that HP doesn't really reflect how actual people become injured / die. Basically one extra level of approximation, since instead of a rule system to simulate the popular conception of a fantasy world, it becomes a rule system for simulating a world designed to fit the rule system for simulate a fantasy world. So the morality system for my idea would be part of a broader thread of a lot of things being slightly off and how that can be exploited.

Specifically, the morality system I had in mind for my campaign was a weirdly simplified version. Most NPCs and monsters would start with an alignment that fits their role- corrupt cops are lawful evil, lovable rogues are chaotic good, etc.

But actual alignment shifts only happens if a not-Evil character kills a good character, or if a Good character kills a Neutral character. Shifts never happen on the Lawful vs. Chaotic axis. I think this would explore the extent to which objective morality is a meaningful concept, as distinct from just another non-moral aspect of the universe.

I think this would work less well as a story, but if I was writing a story with a similar concept I might have moral obligation be empirically confirmed to literally vary with inverse square of distance, or something else weird.

It doesn't sound like this is the sort of thing you're talking about, because it sounds like the Lawful/Chaotic axis is part of what you're interested in?
