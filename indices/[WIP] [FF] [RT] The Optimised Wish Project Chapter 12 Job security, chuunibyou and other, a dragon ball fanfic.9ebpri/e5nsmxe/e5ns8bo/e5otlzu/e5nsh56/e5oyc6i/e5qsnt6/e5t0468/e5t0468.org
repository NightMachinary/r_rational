Great chapter! I only vaguely remember these guys, but I do remember Son Gohan being at the end of that arc. Hope your Goku still gets to see him one last time.

Am I right in assuming that Bulma's heart skipping a beat was less due to the magic demonstration and more due to the fact that someone with superhuman strength just threw a baseball near her head?
