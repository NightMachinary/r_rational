Solid points on the zenkai boosts. It's perfectly consistent with canon for there to be occasional plateaus for their power- at some points in the story, the characters gain immense power very quickly through dedicated training, but other times grow at very slow rates.

Real life is (somewhat) similar- people have natural equilibrium points with fitness/diet that are subtly weird and different for everyone.

Vegeta tried spamming zenkai boosts on Namek, and got some result from it, but given that it seems to scale with how close to straight up death you get, it's an extremely dangerous thing to try to munchkin. He got lucky then, and on the asteroid where he became a Super Saiyan, but obviously stopped after that point due to not wanting to just get himself killed one day.
