I think the meta answer is that the chase for the next level of super Saiyan edged it out as a plot point.

I'd never really registered that though, huh. It does peter off doesn't it. That said, their time in the Hypeebola Mime Chamber showed that they could further increase in power without a full ssj1-ssj2 jump. So I think it's still there, just not as abusible and part of 'normal' intense training.

Also: the spoiler bit is hilarious. If handled properly I'd be totally behind that. 'yeah whoever set this up was kind of an asshole'. Something for Goku/Bulma to yell at God about later.
