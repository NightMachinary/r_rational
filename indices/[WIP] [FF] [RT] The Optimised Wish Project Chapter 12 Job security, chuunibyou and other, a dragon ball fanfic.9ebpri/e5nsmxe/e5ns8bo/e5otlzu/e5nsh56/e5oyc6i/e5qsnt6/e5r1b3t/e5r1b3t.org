  Since Put noted she and Oolong went to the same transformation school does that mean anyone that can use ki can learn to transform?
#+end_quote

I can't expound too much because this is plot relevant - but no. I mentioned it because this is how it was referred to in canon, but it will be further clarified. No, they're special, and magic and ki, while related things, are still separated. Most people use either one mainly, with possibly a few limited abilities with the other.

  I noticed it said base Goku, can you explain how that works? I've reread it twice and it is just not clicking in my brain.
#+end_quote

Sorry if that sounds confusing, it just meant she took a measurement for Goku and used it as base. He can't control ki but consider it as "peak power" the way she measured it with the others (so while exerting themselves by punching as hard as possible).

  Thirdly, will the shenanigans of Sayain biology come into play in this fic? I feel like that's an easy munchkin for Bulma and Goku to abuse.
#+end_quote

Yup! They already have after all - Zenkai power is why Goku is so smart. But one thing I have to warn of, I'm not too inclined to /excessive/ munchkining, and would rather nerf here and there some canon abilities. Otherwise the variables quickly become unmanageable.

  Lastly, I'm hoping we see more of Pilaf and co.
#+end_quote

We will! Probably in the next arc already.
