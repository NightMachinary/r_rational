Now I get all the other characters but...why is Puar and Yamcha in an abusive relationship? It's pretty obvious that she sabotaged Yamcha and the whole "everyone hates you, only I love you" stuff is pretty damn far from what the original character was.

I like it, but what made you decide to make such a huge change in the character when most things are either faithful or based on the original premises and made so they fit more logically?
