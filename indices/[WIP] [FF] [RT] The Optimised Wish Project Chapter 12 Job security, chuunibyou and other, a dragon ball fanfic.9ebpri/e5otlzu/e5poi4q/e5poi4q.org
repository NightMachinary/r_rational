A lot of things really aren't that faithful. Mai isn't this competent in the original, nor is she an ex Red Ribbon soldier in cahoots with a splinter faction with further motives (that I'm sure most have gotten already, but I won't spell out for anyone who hasn't). The four people seen in this chapter - Spike, Bandages, Fangs and See-Through - are genuinely supernatural creatures. Spike in particular is supposedly a demon. It's not necessarily contradictory to see them as humans with weird powers, but they're presented in a way that implies they aren't, and me reducing them as such is a way to make the setting more consistent. As I said at the beginning, I'm following HPMOR's approach to canon of using most of the times but bending it occasionally when it better suits the needs of the story and makes for a more engaging, surprising plot to those who are familiar with the original (such as seen with Rational!Voldemort, of course, who is obviously in contradiction of canon in many ways, but works best as an antagonist to Rational!Harry).

I'll admit that yandere Puar is a weird choice I made. I guess it's mostly me taking a jab at their weird relationship in canon, and going for a bit of a dark joke. They always seemed very attached, to the point of spending their life basically together all the time, which is a bit extreme even for friends and buddies. So I thought of Puar as being the one who's actually pulling the strings here. I also have further plot reasons that I can't disclose here yet.
