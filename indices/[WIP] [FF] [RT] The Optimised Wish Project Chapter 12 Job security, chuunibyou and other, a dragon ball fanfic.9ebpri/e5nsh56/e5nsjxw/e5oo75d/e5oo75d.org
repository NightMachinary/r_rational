In canon, Spike is literally from Hell, possibly retconned to be related to the Oni who live there in some way. I do like the mystery you set up with the whole quartette having nigh identical origin stories, though, since the only other directions that could have gone would have been deciding on the actual Hell connection (maybe he'd turn out to have come from Makai or something), or something connecting Fangs to Chaozu. While I always like things that make Chaozu more interesting, I like the mystery you set up here better.
