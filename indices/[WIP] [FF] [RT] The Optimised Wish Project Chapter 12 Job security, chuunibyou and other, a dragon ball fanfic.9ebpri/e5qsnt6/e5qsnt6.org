Excellent chapter as always. I am in love with the way you write the humorous sections of this story. It's just so much like real life yet also incredibly similar to the original Dragonball humor.

Some notes and questions. Since Put noted she and Oolong went to the same transformation school does that mean anyone that can use ki can learn to transform? Hopefully this will lead Bulma and Goku to learning all sorts of things, like flight and his mulitplicity trick.

Secondly, the characters were rated by Goku strengths. I noticed it said base Goku, can you explain how that works? I've reread it twice and it is just not clicking in my brain. Not the how she is measuring them, but exactly what a base Goku is. Is it his default without circulating ki?

Thirdly, will the shenanigans of Sayain biology come into play in this fic? I feel like that's an easy munchkin for Bulma and Goku to abuse.

Lastly, I'm hoping we see more of Pilaf and co.
