They're the four warriors that the sybil Baba, Muten Roshi's sister, keeps to challenge anyone who wants her services for free. She's the "previous employer". They're seen at the end of the Red Ribbon arc in the original show, Krillin beats the invisible guy, Puar and Upa the vampire, and Goku the other two. The last fighter in that occasion was Son Gohan, Goku's grandpa, brought back to life for one day (Baba has that ability, and used it again in DBZ to bring back Goku for the Tenkaichi in the Buu Saga, and then now Frieza in DB Super for the Tournament of Power).
