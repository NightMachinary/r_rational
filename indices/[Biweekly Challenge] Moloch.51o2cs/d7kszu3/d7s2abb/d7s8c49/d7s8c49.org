Unless, of course, said species had been aware of us for a while and had deliberately adapted technology for us...but it's an interesting point.

Still, with or without specific adaptations for us, there would surely be universally-useful (or at least broadly useful) techniques, like enhanced microscopy/scanning, minimally-invasive surgery techniques, etc.
