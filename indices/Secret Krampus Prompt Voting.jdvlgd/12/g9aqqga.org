[[/u/Kishoto]]: "You have died. You remember what felt like the inescapable pull of slumber; a much more final pull than a simple good night's sleep. You know that you are dead.

"Death, however, is not what you expected. It's not the empty void you'd always thought. It was a void that contained two things; you and something else. Something that you could practically feel smiling at you, as if it was in on a joke that it couldn't wait to let you in on.

"The thing tells you that you were wrong. That atheism is a crock, albeit a well thought out one, and that it is, in fact, a deity. THE deity. The one that made what you once called existence. And now it's time to figure out where you're ending up for the rest of yours."
