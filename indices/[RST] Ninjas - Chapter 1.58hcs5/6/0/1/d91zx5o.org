I realized that my other comment could appear criticizing, so I wanted to add how I felt excited too when I heard about a sequel.

2YE really represented a pivot point in my readings, and I am struggling to find other works with that level of munchkinry, humor, intelligent characters and an engineer like "let me fix this" attitude. This without any knowledge of d&d rules.

To be able to influence strangers across the globe, and keep them hooked for days, that's an almost magic power you are pursuing.

Thanks for your art!
