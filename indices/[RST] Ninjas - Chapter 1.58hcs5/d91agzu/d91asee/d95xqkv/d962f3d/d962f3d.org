He hasn't told me much about that world except that it's post-scarcity. Knowing Jake he probably just handed stuff out willy-nilly and everyone on earth, right down to the infants in the crib, is in possession of a Make-A-Wish-Scroll Gnome-Gnome-Gnome-Gnome. From there it's a short step to madness.
