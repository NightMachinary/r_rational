There are people who really don't like wearing earrings when showering/bathing since the water is tugging on it and can hurt. You could also just say that it got wrecked a few hours ago and he hadn't gotten around to replacing it yet. It's not like he's still surrounded by super-human bodyguards who could kill him in seconds if given reason .....oh wait....

PS What's wrong with /Ninjas!/ as a title? I think it's a really good, catchy title.
