  How is his name pronounced, here? Muhn-row or Moon-rlo-eh? Dj-ake or Jay~ku? Is Fred pronounced Fred or Fu-rleh-ddo?

He hasn't told me, actually. I'll need to ask him if the translation magic is good enough that everyone sounds like a native speaker or if it's leaving accents. If there are accents, I would imagine his name comes out as "Moon-roh Djayk"
