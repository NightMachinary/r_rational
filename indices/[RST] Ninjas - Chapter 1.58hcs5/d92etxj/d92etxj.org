Just realized an issue: the MC has been through the POPE's, and can casually bench-press boulders.

Here's an excerpt; "Still, this was why there was a granite boulder the size of a medicine ball sitting on the ground in front of the target, specifically so that people could test their newfound might. I hoisted it into the air with a grunt and a delighted smile; the thing weighed easily twice what I did, and before the enhancement I couldn't even do a chin up.

I dropped it and, with a faint tra-la-la, skipped off to the next POPE." - Chapter 68

That's the problem with re-using characters; they keep trying to keep their toys with them.
