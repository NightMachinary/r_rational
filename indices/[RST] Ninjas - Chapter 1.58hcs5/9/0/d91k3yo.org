Like I said below, it's not Naruto. It's a completely original world that happens to involve ninja.

As to RSS; one of these days I'll need to set up an actual website but no, right now there is not such a thing. You'll need to either watch this sub or sign up on [[http://Patreon.com/davidstorrs][my Patreon]].

Aside: Wow, Naruto has totally dominated the rational fiction noosphere. Ninja are an actual historical thing that existed before anime was ever conceived of.
