Glad you like the idea. :>

It's not even the Naruto setting, actually. I started off thinking of doing another Naruto fanfic, then I decided that I like the whole "ninja + ninja magic" thing, but I'm not all that excited about the Naruto story itself. I already put a lot of effort into rationalizing it when I wrote Team Anko; I've been to that well and wanted to do something new.

In $YET_UNNAMED_STORY there are ninja and they punch through walls, teleport-substitute with other objects, conjure fire and rocks, etc. There's no hidden villages, no large organized nations, no tech much above a feudal level (most especially no wireless headsets and satellite dishes), no bloodlines, no bijuu, and it's a deathworld full of vaguely supernatural monsters, spirits, and demigods.

One thing I did have trouble with was what magic to let Jake bring from Flobovia. I ended up deciding that the only thing to give him was the healing ring. I cheated a little and didn't even bring the Earring of Intellect, which he really should have had on him even in the bath. It just isn't a big enough plot element to be worth mentioning.
