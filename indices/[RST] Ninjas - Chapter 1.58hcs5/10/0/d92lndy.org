It's not quite all. When he was in Flobovia he got permanent magical enhancements to all 6 stats (strength, intelligence, wisdom, dexterity, constitution, charisma) -- enough to put him at professional athlete levels. That makes him impressive for a baseline but woefully inadequate compared to even a child ninja. (Also, the wisdom and charisma boosts didn't really take.) The ring lets him heal anything and means that he never gets tired or needs to sleep -- as long as he's wearing it he can literally run for weeks without stopping.

Oh, and I've been reminded that he has an intelligence-boosting earring that he really should have. I'm going to put it on him and then forget about it, at least for now.

As to him losing the ring...I have no plans for it, but it seems likely it will happen eventually.
