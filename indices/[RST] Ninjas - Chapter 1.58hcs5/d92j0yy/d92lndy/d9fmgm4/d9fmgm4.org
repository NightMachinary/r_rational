So, with the statement 'the wisdom and charisma boosts didn't really take', that implies that the Constitution boost did do -something- for our hero....but since it was an 'unmeasurable' (or at least not easily measurable) effect in TYE, I'm left wondering if consideration of this boost enters into your plotting for 'Ninjas!' at all. Excellently coordinated juggling level dexterity, and lifting double your weight with minor effort being described as 'impressive for a baseline' might cover it all, but it makes me wonder specifically about our hero getting punted through the tent wall with a collapsed chest. Without the constitution boost, would he have just completely been torn in two? Would that have been the -expected- result of a ninja waking up startled and healthy, as viewed from the perspective of the chief and healer? Is it at all odd from their perspective that he was -only- staved in and sent skidding?
