This is the new book; it's a sequel to The Two Year Emperor[1], although it's pretty much standalone -- there's backreferences for humor, but you don't need to know them.

I'm relaxing with this one and doing it just for fun, very much in the style of 2YE -- no planning ahead, just transcribe whatever the story tells me happens next. It's a fun way to write, although it tends to surprise me. Let me know what you think.

Also, I'm soliciting suggestions for a title.
