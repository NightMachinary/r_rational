I like it!

A part of me is a little upset that the MC is mostly starting from scratch, since that sort of behavior reminds me of those sitcom-type shows where at the end of every episode everything returns to normal. But I understand that a story where the MC still has all his old goodies would be rather short and boring. At least he kept his ring.

Looking forwards to the next update!
