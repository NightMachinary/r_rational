  Also, the most bang-for-your-buck fix would be to cut down your wordcount by at least 20 percent. Simplify the language, and you'll see how much easier it is to read. Clarity comes before entertainment.

I've cut down the wordcount several times on the earlier chapters since they're the most important, but-

a) I'm not sure wordcount is as much of a concern to the web serial market, since most of the biggest hits on royalroad are all absurdly indulgent with it, and,

b) Cutting it down takes time, and part of what I'm trying to do writing this serial is find a sustainable standard of quality that I can marry with a quick release schedule. A thing I run into a lot is when I want to have some exposition, or portray a complicated emotional response from a character, I can either spend about 5-10 minutes trying to think about how to do it very gracefully and quickly, or do it crudely in about 30 seconds. More often than not, the latter ends up winning just out of mercenary need. It's a bit different to writing a novel.

I appreciate your advice, though! I'll check that book out.
