Phew, this is tough.

So, after the last thread and a number of PM and discord conversations, I spent over a month trying to figure out the right way to further improve this story and drive reader retention. I did find a lot of superficial problems that absolutely warranted fixing, which I mostly recount at the top of the RR post (although not really how I've been trying to improve my writing style, I am currently at war with my awful impulse to use em dashes every five seconds), but the more I thought about what makes serials compelling and drives interest, the more I realized it was probably fundamentally untenable to capture that in this story without scrapping the entire thing and starting over.

I think the best way for a new serial to be entertaining to someone coming in with low-investment is to immediately place the protagonist in a situation of distress or tension,and focus the early arcs around the release of that tension. When a story isn't viewed with inherent charity, it needs to rely on being addictive, and the best way to cultivate addiction is to evoke a strong emotional response and drive the reader to seek catharsis for it. Worm, for instance, opens with Taylor being bullied, and the sense of anger that invokes in the reader pushes people to keep reading in pursuit of relief for that anger, and by the time that element is no longer important, they care for other reasons. You see this in most of the big stories, with the variations being giving that catharsis quickly and becoming more of a power fantasy, denying it to pull people forward, or some combination of the two.

Less important but still significant are having a story that has fast pacing and/or a lot of action, and the use of narrative signalling to invoke associations with things the reader already likes. Fanfic does the latter is an open way, while stuff like litrpgs are a little more subtle, tapping into the associations the reader has with video games and JRPGS specifically. (This is without going into the specifics of the appeal of gamelit, which is a whole thing in of itself.)

Unfortunately, because of the way I constructed the worldbuilding and mystery of this story, its impossible to really retroactively change it to tap into any of these points of appeal. Without saying too much, the scenario necessitates that the reader go in with their knowledge of the protagonist deliberately curtailed, which means the core "tension" afflicting her isn't revealed right off the bat. In addition, the setting - the 3 day trip to the conclave - is so structured and contained, with clues /needing/ to be dropped at specific points for the narrative to function dramatically, that it's very difficult to jump around or cut large sections to increase the pacing.

The only way to really do it would probably be to kill the whole story in its current incarnation, and then restart it in such a way that the first arc wouldn't attempt to be a solvable mystery, but rather just a set of action and intrigue setpieces, probably starting in media res. I considered that for a bit, but the drafts I did were much less satisfying to me, not to mention it felt shitty considering I've already got readers invested.

That leaves only fairly minor changes to the plot and structure, for which I got a whole bunch of conflicting feedback on what people liked and what they didn't, which I've tried to wrangle into something coherent. Lemme know what you think on that front, especially regarding changes to the exposition and pacing! I don't really know if it's possible to turn this into something popular, but I'm gonna keep trying anyway.

Anyway, re: this chapter specifically. This is probably the last exposition-dense chapter, and the point in which the setting, one element aside, will have pretty much finished coming into focus. Hopefully people enjoy it despite it not being very exciting.

edit: lmao put the thread tags in the wrong place, I'm dumb
