  If it helps at all, I see this story as an Umineko of sorts, if you know what that is, by which I mean the beginning is really well-written and interesting in its own right but by nature of the story not what piqued my interest since it's a time loop mystery and needs a lot of time to set up base.

That's an immensely flattering comparison, thank you!

  Aside from that, have you considered posting this to a writing forum like spacebattles or sufficientvelocity? Generally original works don't do as well as fanfiction, but as a mystery story you might find better luck since people will feel more willing to discuss plot and such with other forum members.

I didn't know they let you just cross-post stuff from elsewhere as original fiction. It could be a good idea, but I'm not really familiar enough with the culture of those sites to know how it might be received, since it doesn't really open with the mystery right out of the gate. I think the stereotype is that they prefer more action-y, snappier stuff?
