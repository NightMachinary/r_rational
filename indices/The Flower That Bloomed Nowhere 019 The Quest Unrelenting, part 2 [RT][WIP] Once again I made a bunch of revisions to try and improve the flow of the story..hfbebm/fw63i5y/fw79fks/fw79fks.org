I definitely understand finding the story less engaging from a mystery perspective from the start, which is one of the major flaws I think it has relative to the previous stuff I've tried to do. One of the most consistent pieces of negative feedback about that prior story was that it was too overwhelming or confusing - too much worldbuilding, character building, and meta-elements packed into too dense a space that it made it impossible to get into.

The structure of this story was definitely in part a reaction to that. I thought people would be more willing to tolerate something complicated if it was more slow and deliberate in constructing the scenario. The response to it has been much more positive broadly, but I do think I probably overcompensated. It would have been much better for the story if it were structured in such a way that gave people clear mysteries to sink their teeth into from the start, just without being as "busy" as Where Only Names Grow.

I also feel a bit sad about dropping the meta-presentational stuff in both stories, though it's hard to overstate how often people complained about them.

Anyway, I'm sorry to hear you're disappointed. I'm still trying to figure out what to do with this project in response to people's feedback, so we'll see what happens, I guess.
