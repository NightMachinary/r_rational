If it helps at all, I see this story as an Umineko of sorts, if you know what that is, by which I mean the beginning is really well-written and interesting in its own right but by nature of the story not what piqued my interest since it's a time loop mystery and needs a lot of time to set up base. I'm kinda floundering on how to explain this but essentially I've been really liking how the start has been going and hope you don't feel too discouraged by low reader retention. We've been given a lot of good insight into the characters and setting, so now it's just a matter of slowly dissecting the bits of mystery to come.

Aside from that, have you considered posting this to a writing forum like spacebattles or sufficientvelocity? Generally original works don't do as well as fanfiction, but as a mystery story you might find better luck since people will feel more willing to discuss plot and such with other forum members.
