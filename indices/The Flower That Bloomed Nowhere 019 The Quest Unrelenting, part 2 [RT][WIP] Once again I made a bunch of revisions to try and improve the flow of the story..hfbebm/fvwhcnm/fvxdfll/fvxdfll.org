Hi, Outspan Foster here. Glad to see someone actively working on their craft. I highly suggest you read Techniques of the Selling Writer by Dwight V. Swain.

Also, the most bang-for-your-buck fix would be to cut down your wordcount by at least 20 percent. Simplify the language, and you'll see how much easier it is to read. Clarity comes before entertainment.
