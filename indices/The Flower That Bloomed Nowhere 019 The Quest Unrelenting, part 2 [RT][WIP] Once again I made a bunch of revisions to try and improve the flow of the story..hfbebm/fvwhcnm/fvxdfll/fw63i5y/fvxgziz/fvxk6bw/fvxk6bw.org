I actually changed a conversation in what is now chapter 10 to one where the character discuss their presentations a bit, since I decided the one that was there before - where the characters discussed politics in the setting - could be better spent on establishing more immediate things, if you want to go back and look! If not, though, it should still seem organic when it comes up again later.
