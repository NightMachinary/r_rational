Can I push back a little against some of the changes, like I liked the biographies, and..this story feels way more, um..constructed, it's trying to grab the reader, but ultimately I find it much less compelling than the Garden Where only Names Grow.

And given how unpopular that was I guess my tastes are in the solid minority, but 6 chapters into that and there were 3 or 4 different plot threads I was desperate to just talk about someone with, and even more curious about what you were doing with the structure of the work. There were mysteries in the sense of things I could really wrestle with. Where with this story I want to read the next chapter, I want to find out what happens next, but there's nothing I ache to know about, its just a good story.

Sorry, I am probably being too harsh. I just miss Garden I guess.
