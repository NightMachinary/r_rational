Okay I have seriously come to live for these comments.

PS (pre-scriptum): thank you for all the orthographic debugging. I don't reply, but it /does/ help. Updates will appear only as new chapters post, however, because of the way my deploy script works.

Today's lesson to me is that if you're going to spend the better part of two years coming up with coherent magical, cultural, and linguistic systems and then actively undertake to use these in combination with slow revelation of worldbuilding to induce culture shock in your reader, you should take care that you don't start taking for granted that they know certain basics of how your magic system works, how slang gets used, etc.

Regarding comments about the Wrath: when in doubt about local customs, regulations, and norms, refer to the actions and attitudes of an experienced local resident (nb I can't help thinking there's a shorter way of putting this). Bonus round: why might our narratrix view the Wrath the way she does? As opposed to the captain's obviously different view?

Other than being a drama queen, which you've correctly noticed.

What else has she reported on that's colored by her viewpoint?

  Just Earth, huh? That's interesting.
#+end_quote

Very.

  Though from the sounds of it producing enough to actually fill glasses would be problematic.
#+end_quote

Funny you should mention this. Stay tuned.

  I find it kind of hard to believe that there isn't some sort of task force designed to help with extracting humans and their succubi from such areas.
#+end_quote

When I thought I had the least clue where this was going, I wrote a scene that was supposed to be the final epilogue wherein the protagonists develop magic that allows the founding of this exact thing and execute such a raid on people who definitely aren't expies of figures from my past. I'll post it if there's demand, but the prose is /terrifying/ and there are stacks of continuity and worldbuilding conflicts now.

- Indeed, and this is a very reasonable suggestion.
- Early abandonment of problem-solving indicating not-at-all-hidden desires.
- It will be a few chapters yet at least before this pays off, but: /evil grin/. (no she's not pregnant, sorry)

#+begin_quote
  Because just 'asking' is out of the question, clearly.
#+end_quote

What set of circumstances or behaviors might lead to direct questioning being unreliable at least in the short term?

#+begin_quote
  Wait what? "Lost planet"? Not everywhere on Earth is like Jack's neighborhood, surely?
#+end_quote

It's probably not spoilerrific if I reveal that out of Earth as a whole suburban Texas is probably the worst place short of an active battelfield to be a lost submissive succubus. This said, before reading this +tail+ +tail+ +dammit, subconscious, I'll write the next chapter as soon as I can!+ tale, were /you/ aware of succubi, demons, and the existence of Pandemonium as other than rumors and/or dogmas of a certain religion subgroup?

Now, if we were on [[/r/rational][r/rational]], everyone would pigpile in asking 'why THAT subgroup'?

Also I'm absolutely /loving/ that you've nicknamed him [[http://www.cbn.com/special/Narnia/excerpts/jack_IntoNarnia.aspx][Jack]] [1].

#+begin_quote
  Should be 'misses', not 'miss'.
#+end_quote

Aforementioned linguistics issue: 'Hench' can be, like 'Sade' and 'cum', a collective/plural noun without changing form. Infernal and irregular forms indeed...

#+begin_quote
  She's not even allowed to make suggestions anymore?
#+end_quote

Maybe? The interesting questions here, I would say, are:

- 1a. Whether she viewed what she'd been going to say as a suggestion.
- 1b. Whether anyone else would have.
- 2a. Who or what is disallowing said behavior class (via seemingly inane means).
- 2b. What said class includes.
- 3a. Toward what if any goal.
- 3b. Why she seems wholly unfazed by any aspect of this but the inconvenience and possible imprecation of her 'natural' submissiveness.
- 4. How she's come under this...force.

#+begin_quote
  perfekti as paperclippers
#+end_quote

Nope. Also I'm an idiot and the direct explanation comes /next/ chapter and my automated deploy script works too well for my own good so that I don't know what's in what chapter anymore until I proof the posted version. :P As for the Seraphim...maybe. This is kind of assholish on my part since there's no direct information given about the second paperclippe, and so: [[#s][future chapter spoiler]]
