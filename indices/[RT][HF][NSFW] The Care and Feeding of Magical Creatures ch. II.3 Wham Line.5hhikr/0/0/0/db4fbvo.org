1. Holy fuck Eliezer Yudowsky is reading my monster girl porn.

2. The intended Wham Line(s) was from the human narrator's point of view...which obviously didn't come across. I'm curious now if this is cultural difference (human narrator decreasingly-but-still convinced he can 'dual-wield faith and reason' (his own words) vs. anyone reading this subreddit) or just unclear writing on my part. I'd love thoughts on this, for those who have them and want to be opinionated at me. :)
