Possible sources of conflict include:

- We do not know what 'Hollow Heart' means. It could imply something dangerous about this universe.

- Seraphim. This one is obvious, but something made them, and they don't seem to care for collateral damage. Some kind of lawful good fascist deity?

- Perfekti have already created difficulty.

- Awful lot of talk about Sade Hall. Might have been totally obliterated.

- The existence of Infernal implies that stars are sapient. Which implies that stars might have /wars./

- They could stumble on feuds of immortals. Those are always fun.

Lots of room for conflict yet.
