#+begin_quote
  thank you for all the orthographic debugging.
#+end_quote

Yer welc'm.

#+begin_quote
  when in doubt about local customs, regulations, and norms, refer to the actions and attitudes of an experienced local resident
#+end_quote

We don't really know anything about the captain, though.

- The jewelry doesn't tell us anything, since even if it /is/ made of silver/gold (which we don't know), we don't know how expensive/hard to get such things are in Pandemonium.

- That she captains a ship doesn't tell us much since we don't know how hard that is to do here or how difficult attaining such a position is.

- Her attitude about getting spiked doesn't tell us much since we don't know how reckless or stringently lawful she is.

- In other words, we have no idea how well she represents the average Pandemite or how good of a role model she is.

In any case, this isn't exactly the first time the word's been used. Lyra's been using it as profanity the entire story, in much the same way as we use 'fuck' to express a marked desire of malicious intent towards something. Couple that with 'getting spiked' being a form of punishment for a rather serious crime (as well as a decidedly not-serious one), and how 'spiked' and 'the rocks are alive' are directly related, and you get my interpretation of the phrase: impaled by stone spears.

#+begin_quote
  why might our narratrix view the Wrath the way she does? As opposed to the captain's obviously different view?
#+end_quote

I suppose, considering what Lyra and Jack went through to get here, she'd probably be rather paranoid about Murphy's Law fucking them over on the home stretch.

#+begin_quote
  Indeed, and this is a very reasonable suggestion.
#+end_quote

/with over-inflated self-importance/ I know, that's why I made it.

#+begin_quote
  Early abandonment of problem-solving indicating not-at-all-hidden desires.
#+end_quote

Sure sure, he's still in fuck-my-family-and-everything-they-stood-for mode.

#+begin_quote
  It will be a few chapters yet at least before this pays off, but: evil grin. (no she's not pregnant, sorry)
#+end_quote

Mhmm. Do I sense incoming orphans?

#+begin_quote
  What set of circumstances or behaviors might lead to direct questioning being unreliable at least in the short term?
#+end_quote

Well, sure, short term they're both still coming down from oh-fuck-we're-gonna-die and Jack is in the middle of being culture-bombed. I /did/ recognize that Lyra is being melodramatic here.

#+begin_quote
  It's probably not spoilerrific if I reveal that out of Earth as a whole suburban Texas is probably the worst place short of an active battelfield to be a lost submissive succubus. This said, before reading this ... tale, were you aware of succubi, demons, and the existence of Pandemonium as other than rumors and/or dogmas of a certain religion subgroup?
#+end_quote

Ah. So, lost as in 'out of contact with the wider universe', not 'unsalvagable'.

#+begin_quote
  1a. Whether she viewed what she'd been going to say as a suggestion.
#+end_quote

The stuff that's been pinging this 'sense' of hers has been largely (possibly entirely, I don't remember well enough to say for sure) worded as, and upon prompting from the sense further revealed as, informative suggestions. So I'm gonna go with 'yes'.

#+begin_quote
  1b. Whether anyone else would have.
#+end_quote

There's a rather marked difference in English between orders and suggestions. Take, as an example:

- Careful, the animal bites.

vs

- Don't touch the animal, it bites.

#+begin_quote
  2a. Who or what is disallowing said behavior class (via seemingly inane means).
#+end_quote

My guess is a combination of the ritual they did and magical prompting from her house alignment.

#+begin_quote
  2b. What said class includes.
#+end_quote

So far it seems to be any imperative statement, though we haven't seen enough for me to say for sure.

#+begin_quote
  3a. Toward what if any goal.
#+end_quote

Don't know enough to say here, either.

#+begin_quote
  3b. Why she seems wholly unfazed by any aspect of this but the inconvenience and possible imprecation of her 'natural' submissiveness.
#+end_quote

Presumably, this was covered in school.

#+begin_quote

  1. How she's come under this...force.
#+end_quote

See 2a.

#+begin_quote
  future chapter spoiler
#+end_quote

Oh. Well alright then.

...wait.

#+begin_quote
  One's kind of incompetent and has only really been met in fully-grown form the one time so far, though.
#+end_quote

Only met fully grown once. They've only met angels /period/ once. A seemingly arbitrary distinction... unless one of the other things Lyra and Jack met during the escape was a nascent angel? But the only things they met were perfekti, which the seraphim killed, that rage demon, and...

My god. Was Jack right? /Do/ all good cars go to heaven? And then get turned into homogenizing intelligences?? /Is BAD WLF going to come back as a killer-zombie-angel car?!/
