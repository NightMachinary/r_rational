  I guess no kids ever ought to be kind of a thing or something, but all I can do is laugh internally and feel a little bit relieved. If I ever wanted that life, I don't now.
#+end_quote

You /can/ always adopt, you know.

#+begin_quote
  No more concerned strangers who think they have the slightest idea what it is to be Hollow Heart.
#+end_quote

So it /is/ a subset of succubi, and apparently uncommon enough that there aren't Hollow Heart therapists anywhere near where she lived. Either that or she was/is just being all "NO ONE UNDERSTANDS MY PAIN" emo.

#+begin_quote
  I need to understand.
#+end_quote

At last!

#+begin_quote
  Man, the word feels so weird, like it's changing how I talk or something. But I can't stop saying it! The fuck? Well, fuck it, feels weird, feels good. I wouldn't be much of a Sade if I was gonna be put off by ‘what the fuck this shouldn't feel good'.
#+end_quote

...yea, that's not concerning at all.

#+begin_quote
  You said you looked all over Earth trying to find me, this is why.
#+end_quote

/Just/ Earth, huh? That's interesting.

#+begin_quote
  I can't wonder if you want me near or not, I can't wonder if you like how we're fucking, I can't wonder if you're happy. I can't wonder if I please you. I can't wonder if I'm overwhelming or not enough. I need to just know.
#+end_quote

Because just 'asking' is out of the question, clearly.

Lyra's quite the drama queen, isn't she?

#+begin_quote
  Nobody on this raft deserves anything, and we're gonna be spiked if we start thinking that way. This is about what we both need.
#+end_quote

So Pandemonium has thought police. Fucking wonderful.

#+begin_quote
  Things like me, there's no place for us in heaven. Is this what we get instead?
#+end_quote

A drama king for the drama queen.

#+begin_quote
  Okay, so this isn't actually true about humans, but a lot of people think it so I think it'll help you get it. You're a body with a soul, right? Like, take away the body, no soul either. Mess up your brain and there's no more you, mess up your soul and you can put it back together as long as you've got a brain. Actually humans can reincarnate just fine but lots of people don't think so until it happens.
#+end_quote

Then, what, is the brain an interface between the soul and the body? Facilitates communication between them?

#+begin_quote
  So I'm a soul with a body. Kinda the main succubus superpower, we're the only embodied demons. Mess up my body, it'll grow back as long as I've got enough energy, mess up my soul, no more me. Remember my leg? Nectar is the thing my soul does to give itself a body...well, technically ichor is. Nectar's just distilled ichor.
#+end_quote

Distilled, huh. So what's getting removed, and where's it go after? Do succubi poop?

What happens if her body gets vaporized? Would she just 'grow back' from its last location?

#+begin_quote
  Nectar just makes a body reflect a soul. It like, turns you into yourself.
#+end_quote

Well, that's vague and unhelpful. "Turns you into yourself"? Yourself according to what? It can't just be based on self-image, that'd produce a lot of dissatisfaction; not everyone has a good self-image. It can't be just whatever you want at the time, either, it doesn't work fast enough. You'd constantly be partially transformed into all the things you wanted before and transforming into what you want now.

#+begin_quote
  Unh...yeah so dragging your whole fucking body over my cunt is a good move, hope I was *supposed aaaarch* into it like this.
#+end_quote

Missing a 'to' between 'supposed' and 'aaaarch'.

#+begin_quote
  It's as intoxicating as before, and her lips are softer even than her hand, warm and wet and almost kissing back I fancy *as suck* and lick at them, licking out every drop of nectar I can find, my eyes closing involuntarily with the pleasure when I swallow and the wave of lust and strength goes through me.
#+end_quote

Missing an 'I' between 'as' and 'suck'. Also, I think I know what you were going for with 'I fancy', but it doesn't quite fit as is with how you have the sentence constructed.

#+begin_quote
  It'd be plenty, even superhumanly much, for sex, but I'm thirsty.
#+end_quote

How long does nectar keep? I would guess not long since otherwise succubi could just be made from it directly instead of adding the extra step of ichor.

Say, does nectar from different succubi taste the same? If not, are there restaurants that sell different flavors? If it doesn't keep you'd have to have it 'fresh from the cow', as it were. Though from the sounds of it producing enough to actually fill glasses would be problematic.

#+begin_quote
  You'll...mmm...you'll turn into whatever age your soul is.
#+end_quote

You're only as old as you feel, eh? Literally.

#+begin_quote
  You'll, mm, always be tasty and fuckable, every human's kind of a sex fieeeend deep down.
#+end_quote

Do succubi not know what asexuality is? Actually... /do/ they not? Asexual doesn't necessarily mean aromantic, but if the actual nutritional part of the emotional cocktail they drink is the lust, they'd likely completely ignore any asexual people.

#+begin_quote
  “It gets rid of disease, too.” “It...mmmmm....right. Y. Yes. Being sick, isn't...mm...you. Oooh...boo!”
#+end_quote

/Definitely/ not just self-image based, then.

#+begin_quote
  Missionary, cowgirl, scissoring, grinding, bouncing my leg too much...how did Viktor put it? “You haff a zertain advantageous geometry.”
#+end_quote

Heh. This Viktor sounds like fun. I look forward to Jack meeting him.

#+begin_quote
  my mom's actually survived going toe-to-toe with a seraphim
#+end_quote

I might as well bring this up now: why the /hell/ did Lyra go rescue Jack on her own? Why didn't she bring some backup with her? Like, say, her apparently badass mother? Considering how dangerous parts of Earth (let alone other planets) must be in limbo, judging by what the American Deep South looked like, I find it kind of hard to believe that there isn't some sort of task force designed to help with extracting humans and their succubi from such areas.

Or was she not supposed to go alone and is in for a chewing out when she gets home?

#+begin_quote
  Scritchy pubes but fuck it I'd make do with a piece of shoggoth hide at this point just actually let me fucking CUUUUUM...
#+end_quote

Wut? Shoggoth? As in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoggoth][shoggoth]]?! That's uh... that's not good.

#+begin_quote
  Takes a few weeks and a lot of nectar, but yeah. I mean it just turns you into yourself, there's not really a limit on what that means if that's what you're asking. I've met a couple people who gender-flipped - relax, they were pretty psyched about it so I wouldn't worry unless you've got a whole world of fantasies I somehow missed - and once in a blue Eye somebody gets elf ears or fur or whatever, but that's kinda rare. It's all about what's really you.
#+end_quote

This... doesn't really clear up anything.

#+begin_quote
  The hell? That was supposed to be “Honey”. How'd I Freudian ‘honey' into ‘Master'? It's not like I'm exactly repressing the idea.
#+end_quote

Just pile on the alarm bells, why doncha.

#+begin_quote
  Okay, there's gonna be a chain, with handles, going fast. You need to grab the handles, because if you grab the chain it'll just rip your arm off. Then squeeze the handles to slow down before you hit the end of the chain, and then you can take one of the ones that's piled up on you to help you climb up the chain.
#+end_quote

Well. It's a good thing we've already established that nectar can grow back arms.

Out of curiosity, how many people have been dismembered by this incredibly dangerous form of hitchhiking?

#+begin_quote
  Wait, fuck! People! Pandora's Wrath! Make sure you don't ignore a safeword or do anything else nonconsensual. The rocks are alive and they'll spike you if they feel rapey energy.
#+end_quote

So offenders are just... murdered on the spot? No attempt at rehabilitation?

#+begin_quote
  The Wrath doesn't consent to being gamed or used as a weapon and it's perfect at knowing what's real to the people involved. Don't worry.
#+end_quote

I suppose it'd have to be if no-one in a population of several trillion has been able to trick it. Then again, if someone was smart enough to trick it they'd probably be smart enough to avoid getting caught any other way, so how would you even know?

#+begin_quote
  «Quietly, we seem to be overrun with aftercare. Welcome aboard Charon's Changepurse.»
#+end_quote

Hmm. How appropriate.

#+begin_quote
  A soft purple light the same color as the markings that light up the airlock glows from behind new girl, giving *a* her skin a lurid tinge that ironically softens the shock by making her look more alien.
#+end_quote

The second 'a' is unnecessary.

#+begin_quote
  Anyway, that was...you can get spiked doing stuff like that, what if she'd played that situation for just a tiny bit more pressure? WTF?
#+end_quote

The fuck? Are you serious?? All she did was look and /ask/, and that's nearly enough for the security system to kill her?

#+begin_quote
  «You two chose a very naughty place to play, tonight. How are you not spiked?»
#+end_quote

/Trespassing/ on a /raft/ has the same penalty as /rape/? What the hell is wrong with this place?

#+begin_quote
  «A lost planet. I thought your human looked newly abducted. And likes femmes? And by the way he's looking at me I'm the first native he's seen?»
#+end_quote

Wait what? "Lost planet"? Not everywhere on Earth is like Jack's neighborhood, surely?

#+begin_quote
  «Welcome to Pandemonium, fellow prey.» “Fellow prey?”
#+end_quote

Wait what? Don't the less than/greater thans mean the speaker is speaking Infernal? That's what it's meant up till now. How did Jack understand that?

#+begin_quote
  «Thanks. Anyway, I'm sure my Hench *miss* me and I should go get us moving again. Enjoy the ride!»
#+end_quote

Should be 'misses', not 'miss'.

#+begin_quote
  “Make s...” Blech. MRF. Really? Umum. “The sea-salt is purifying, but now it's going to be full of crap from Earth it drew out of you and it tastes gross to me. I'll like it if you wipe off as much as you can." So awkward. This had better not be becoming a thing.
#+end_quote

She's not even allowed to make /suggestions/ anymore?

#+begin_quote
  This shouldn't really be surprising: the deck is level under my feet, meaning we must not be diving anymore, and the only time the ship could have rotated *with* my noticing is while we made out in the airlock.
#+end_quote

Should be 'without', not 'with'.

#+begin_quote
  “Did I...did I make you?” “Hi Daddy!”
#+end_quote

Aaaand here comes the mental breakdown.
