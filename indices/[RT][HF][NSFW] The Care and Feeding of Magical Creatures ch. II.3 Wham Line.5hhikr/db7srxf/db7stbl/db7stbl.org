(seperate post, because apparently the first was too long)

I didn't see anything in this chapter about the mystery paperclippers. All of my still-viable guesses were mentioned again, but none in a relevant context. Did I miss it?

This comment from the last thread:

  One's kind of incompetent and has only really been met in fully-grown form the one time so far, though.

strongly suggests that one of them is the perfekti, and, ok I guess? They don't seem to have the capability to be an existential threat yet, considering how well Jack and Lyra, who have no combat training, did against them. I'd imagine any actual combat unit equipped to fight them would win a curb stomp victory, baring an obscenely overwhelming local numbers disadvantage. That's not even mentioning the seraphim, who are apparently anti-perfekti as well.
