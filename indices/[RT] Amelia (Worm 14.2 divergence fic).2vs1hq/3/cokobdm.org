Horrible fic. I couldn't continue once they played Starcraft for new ideas.

There's actually a saying about Worm fanfics "They either die young or get long enough to see themselves become Amelia." Referencing of course the tendency of fics to just start fixing everything, munchkin powers just for its own sake and just avoid all serious conflicts and challenges for the protagonists.
