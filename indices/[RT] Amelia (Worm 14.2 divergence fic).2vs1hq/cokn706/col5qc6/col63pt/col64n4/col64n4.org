Thank you for that insightful response! I now understand why I was wrong to use that term in this context. Clearly, I should have spoken more generally about the absurdity of being bothered by teenagers having a sexuality in a work of fiction, instead of resorting to the use of a buzzword that didn't fit the context.

Truly, I cannot thank you enough for that constructive and useful reply, which was absolutely not a useless shitpost that served no purpose whatsoever.
