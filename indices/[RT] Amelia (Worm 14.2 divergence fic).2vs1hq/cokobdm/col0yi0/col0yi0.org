Before I say anything else, I do agree that [[#s][General spoilers]] Some of it might be plausible, e.g. [[#s][Chapter 96]], others might be considered too convenient.

That being said:

First of all, you can't /possibly/ be objecting to serious uses of power. This is [[/r/rational]], not [[/r/perpetuatingdrama]]. If the serious use happens to outclass most of the enemies from canon!Worm, that's simply how it is.

That being said, aside from the weakness I've identified (and possibly others I haven't noticed), your characterization is counterfactual. Yes, some of the earlier canon!challenges get curbstomped... and the threats later on continue to scale up. Very often, the characters don't emerge from their encounters unscathed (despite, as a very sensible precaution, keeping [[#s][Chapter 141]]).

Yes, some of the issues they face are naturally different from canon!Worm (both in-combat, social, and eventually, [[#s][Chapter 222]]), but that's not a bad thing.

I'd hate to say this, but given that you've only read up to an early chapter (and stopped for as dubious a reason as a character showing off game units, most of which are quickly dismissed as unrealistic), I'm simply not sure you know what you're talking about.
