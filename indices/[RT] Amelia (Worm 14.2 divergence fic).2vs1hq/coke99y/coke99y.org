Amy Dallon is pushed by the S9, hard enough to actually fight back. Diverges from Worm 14.2 onwards.

This fic shows some promise at treating Weaver Nine withdrawal.

Notes:

- You may notice confusion in the first few chapters.

- You should use the index, rather than scrolling down to [[http://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/amelia-worm-au.916/#post-186582][Chapter 1]]; some of the first-page posts contain spoilers.
