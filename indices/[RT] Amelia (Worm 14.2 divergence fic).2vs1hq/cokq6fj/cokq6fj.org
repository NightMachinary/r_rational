While I like some aspects of this fic, it's not at all rational except insofar as Amelia decides to ignore her previous rules about morality. But even the rationality of that decision is questionable, given how bad she ultimately could turn out to be. I haven't looked at it for a couple weeks, but last I read her sanity was kinda shaky given the nature of her relationship with Taylor.
