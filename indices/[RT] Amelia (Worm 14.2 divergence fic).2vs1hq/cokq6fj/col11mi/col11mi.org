I think you might be confusing "rational" with "smart". Amelia and Taylor both made decisions that, while in-character considering their hangups, were really, really dumb. Dumb enough that the team's village idiot called them out on it. Characters are allowed to be dumb, however, as long as they're that way by characterization rather than plot (i.e. not temporarily holding idiot balls). This was something I pondered during that arc, and eventually came to the conclusion that, yeah, it would probably actually happen that way, so I can't complain.

Similarly, I think most of us would disagree with [[#s][Chapter 141]], but it still ultimately makes sense. The characters probably would not have been exposed to the knowledge we have, so there's no reason they would think the same way.

I remember thinking that Miss Militia seemed oddly weak in one chapter, but can't think of much else. Feel free to tell me about any examples I've missed, however.
