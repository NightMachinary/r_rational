I'd be inclined to assume that the ritual process isn't random, so much as it is a matter of skill and preparation. Some degree of mummification COULD, after all, happen naturally under desert conditions, but the state of the art involved chemical preparations, inside and out (decomposition was averted by the removal of internal organs, particularly those related to digestion).

As such, there's a definite hierarchy of mummies (as reflects the historical process). Anyone can be mummified on the cheap with a crude, simple ankh and some basic preparation of the body, but that gets you a stupid and relatively fragile mummy. More elaborate (read: expensive!) preparations, including a higher-quality ankh, the storage and preservation of the original organs in canopic jars, and the treatment of the body with herbs and spices gets you much better continuity of consciousness/identity, and a tougher, 'healthier' body that can handle more stresses.

Accordingly, you get sort of a mix of B and D; the rich have huge dynasties of mummy ancients, and there are plenty of dumb slaves available for simple or dangerous tasks.
