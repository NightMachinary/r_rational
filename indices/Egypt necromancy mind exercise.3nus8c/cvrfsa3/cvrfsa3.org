Lets channel the Hanson! Robin Hanson answered this already for some scenarios in his EM city treatises.

It all depends on chance of success and cost of ritual. What are chances and factors for getting lobotomized zombies?

Does the ritual only cost labour or are scarce materials involved?

A) */If there is high chance of success for full restoration and its cheap to do/*, well population density is a lot higher and no longer restrained by arable land. Also labour is really really fucking cheap since the mummies dont need to eat and thus can work for nearly free; their only limit is that probable the whole dynasty needs to help feeding the meatlings; maybe the whole point of the meatlings will be to produce new meatlings. The economy is big and comparatively rich.

B)*/If success is highly likely and its expensive/*, well the rich have huge dynasties full of mummie ancients, we see huge trade to get the rare material component into the country and if the ressurected dont produce value of some kind Egypt is going to get bankrupt at some point. I have no clue how ancient state bancruptcies look like; probable they cannot afford an army and get invaded.

C) */If chance is low and its expensive,/* the rich will try less and get even less back; thus there is some kind of trade, but not enough to ruin the country. */Its kinda what historically happened!/* The ultrarich built giant monuments, but never successfully revived someone, and as far as I know that did not play a role in the downfall of Egypt. (whereas there are a number of cultures where wasteful but unproductive pastimes were directly involved in the untimely doom of that society.)

D) */If chance is low and its cheap/*- well everyone has lobotomized slaves working for them, thus standard of living is high, but lower than A) - since fully trained humans make infinitely better slaves than lobotomized ones.
