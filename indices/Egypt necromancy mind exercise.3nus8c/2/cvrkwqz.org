This is an important issue, how hard is it to re-kill a mummy? Because if it is significantly difficult, then you have an Immortal God-Emperor who never dies and also never passes on power, protected by equally difficult to kill guards. They also might be at least slightly crazy from the revivification process.

Cane they be resurrected multiple times? If the mummy dies again, can it be fixed?

Basically, we're a [[http://1d4chan.org/wiki/Necron_Dynasty][Necron Dynasty]] now.
