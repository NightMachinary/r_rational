  An *elder brain* is the final stage of the mind flayer life cycle. The elder brain lives in a brine filled pool in the centre of a mind flayer city, where it guides its community by filling them with dark dreams of illithid domination. Although its intellect is of godlike proportions, its only physical attack is by using its tendrils to lash out or grapple an opponent. Therefore mind flayers protect their elder brain by securing it in a well protected cave inside the city. Its strong mind-affecting powers stem from the brains of longdead mind flayers making up the viscious mass of the elder brain. Being composed of many brains as energy source for its intellect it can communicate telepathically with any creature within 350 ft (107.73 m) distance. ^{Interesting:} [[https://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Brain%20golem][^{Brain} ^{golem}]] ^{|} [[https://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Elder%20orb][^{Elder} ^{orb}]] ^{|} [[https://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Yshiggol][^{Yshiggol}]] ^{|} [[https://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Encephalithid][^{Encephalithid}]]
