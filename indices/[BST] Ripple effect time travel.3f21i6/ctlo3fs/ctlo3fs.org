We have hard rules for time travel within a single timeline. We have hard rules for time travel that causes a single timeline to branch out into multiple ones. Why can't we have time travel that merges several divergent timelines back into one?

Well, how would that work? As long as there aren't any differences between the timelines, they can merge flawlessly - actually, determining that they were ever different is an interesting exercise. And perhaps in some simple cases the sets of changes from two different time travellers can be combined seamlessly. But merging arbitrary timelines will probably result in some sort of mutant hybrid which only grudgingly abides by cause and effect, assuming one timeline doesn't overwrite the other entirely (which isn't much of a merge).

I think that's the best way of understanding Marty Mcfly's situation. The timeline as of the end of the movie leaves Marty with memories of events that "never happened", including some that are only possible if Marty doesn't exist. Bits and pieces of at least three timelines ended up in a single present, even when nobody was actually time-travelling. Things faded in and out of existence as different parts of their history came from different realities. If he'd failed at the climax, Lorraine might have remembered Calvin Klein's existence even though - in that version of history - no such person was ever born.

As for what the rules of timeline-merging are or why it happens at all, I couldn't possibly comment.
