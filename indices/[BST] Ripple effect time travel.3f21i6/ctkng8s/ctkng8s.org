We have two dimensions of time: Malleable Wimey-Time and San Dimas Time. At each pair of time coordinates, we have one universe state.

Observers move through both forms of time at once, time machines jump through Wimey-Time, but are San-Dimas-instant. (Or perhaps they take San Dimas Time - this would be a variable of the story.)

Here's what 5-dimensional spacetime, projected onto the two-dimensional time plane looks like:

The first ripple was the Big Bang. The curve coming out of it is the shape of the ripple. OP suggested a linear shape, but we can choose a shape of the ripple that is useful to the story. Along each horizontal, the universe evolves according to classical laws until a ripple is hit, at which point the universe is replaced with whatever there would have been San-Dimas-before the ripple. At some San-Dimas-point, the Big Bang ripple reaches modern-day humans. Conscious observers move diagonally through both forms of time, like our protagonist Bob. Some of our Bobs are produced by the ripple after they are born - of course, they can't tell.

At some point, Bob invents a time machine, and, like any munchkin worth his salt, prompty travels into the distant future to fetch some awesome technology. Of course, since time machines move horizontally, he comes out before the Big Bang ripple, where what he finds Author knows what.

Good thing too, for in the distant future after the Big Bang ripple, at some point someone releases Skyborgnet, which, like any UFAI worth its salt, promptly goes on to conquer all of Wimey-Time to implement Author-knows-what utility function. Lucky for us that San-Dimas-travel is impossible!

Bob and our story live in that sweet spot between the Big Bang ripple and Skyborgnets inception. How that big blank on the map I posted is to be filled out is the rest of the work. (Note that any rectangle in the map that doesn't cross a ripple line has the same horizontal Wimey-Timeline slice repeated across its vertical.) (Nothing says that all ripples must have the same shape, but I predict this target demographic will give the story bonus points if the rules are simple.)

Now build a rational story out of it! Since I provided the rules, you won't be accused of strawmanning when you exploit it. Though you can ask me to play GM in unclear cases.
