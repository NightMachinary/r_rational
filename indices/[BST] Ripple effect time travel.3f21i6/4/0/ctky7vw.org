Yup, I've checked those out (and that's my go-to when I have a thought about time travel). The analysis of BTTF unfortunately doesn't cover the actual mechanical issues involved with the ripple effect; it uses the same sort of vague wording that the movie itself uses. This isn't a bad way to analyze it, but ... it's not quite what I want.
