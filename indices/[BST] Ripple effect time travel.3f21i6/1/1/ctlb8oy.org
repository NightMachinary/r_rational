Sorry in advance for the wall of text.

If time travellers are affected by ripples, shit gets crazy fast. Divergence of history from the previous reality is exponential in time (since the world is a chaotic system).

This means that even a change as small as breaking a branch is probably going to invalidate the entire future if you travel back more than about 100 years, which will of course erase the time traveller from existence.

At 1,000 years, your mere presence for a second or so would be enough to fundamentally alter the future beyond recognition.

This basically means that a "one timeline model" means time travellers have to minimise at least one of two things: locality (i.e. how close in time/space your changes are to your jump - basically the "event distance" between source and destination) and divergence (i.e. how much you change things).

Any change big enough to cause a "shit, we have to worry about the ripples" problem is going to erase the time traveller from existence long before they notice, unless specific steps are taken to prevent that.

You could carry "canaries" with you (i.e. artefacts whose nature/existence forewarns you of dangerous ripples), like the photograph from Back to the Future only not idiotic.

A photo from your parents' wedding might you a few years of warning of a potential deletion event. Their birth certificates could give you longer. Memorabilia from the moon landing and other historical events could be useful as well.

A photo of you would be completely useless unless you were born after the photo was taken (since the ripple that erases the photo would arrive after the ripple that erases you).

In general, the closer the canary artefact to the crucial date, the lower the chance of a false negative (without the wedding photograph you might think you're fine because your parents were born as normal, except you accidentally made them never meet). The further back the more warning you'd get.

Could be a cool way of identifying characters and their approach to time travel (e.g. somebody with a photo album, somebody with a suitcase full of heirlooms, somebody with political almanacs from different decades), and also ties into their goals. The person with the political books would be focussed on world-spanning change, where the one with the photo album would be much more personal.

You could also make it so that ripples affect time travellers in waves, like foreshocks before an earthquake. These waves could potentially travel faster in meta-time, giving ample warning and gradually ramping up in intensity as the critical moment approaches.

How they would manifest is trickier. The phasing out of existence thing could work, but also makes absolutely no physical sense (Does the air pass both through and around you? Do you both heat and not heat your surroundings?).

You could just go with mental/physical pain, but how does that work for inanimate objects?

Achron (the game mentioned elsewhere) I believe alternates between the two realities with increasing frequency, but that would be less useful (you by definition can't be aware of not existing, though a companion could conceivably comment on it).

Oh, and the other problem is the grandfather paradox inherent to a one timeline model. The only way it really makes sense is if the actions of the traveller in the past are somehow fixed irrespective of whether they get erased, which is handwavy but just breaks things if you don't address it.

*TL;DR:* Characters carrying temporal totems could be cool. Recent totems for fine detail, distant totems for forewarning.
