There's a real-time strategy game called [[http://www.achrongame.com/][Achron]].

The player can give commands and chronoport units backwards and forwards in time, with a limit of about 8 minutes.

There are "timewaves", which move forwards through time at about 3:1 and propagate changes between timelines.

I can't quite explain it properly, but it's real and it works. Somehow.
