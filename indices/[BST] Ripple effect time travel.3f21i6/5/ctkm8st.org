I've thought a bunch about it; I'm using a similar system in my upcoming serial novel.

Timeless Physics posits that there is no time; rather all of spacetime already exists in a predetermined timeless sense, and our experience of consciousness is merely an illusion of how the various slices of the universe are causally related.

Applied to a time travel scenario, assuming the existence of a metatime, a change that propagates forward would forever be chasing the previous time wave (assuming they travel at the same speed) but if the time wave travels faster than the percieved speed of consciousness, you would be able to get a ripple effect time travel.

(Of course, the character will still exist unrippled in some parts of spacetime, but you don't have to write from their perception.)
