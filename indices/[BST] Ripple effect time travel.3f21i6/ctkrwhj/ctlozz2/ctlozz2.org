It's a pretty good way of playing around with these concepts, although the story is never quite clear on which time mechanics are just gaming abstractions due to the fact that a computer cannot simulate an arbitrary number of timewaves at the same time.

For example, you'd think that the ability to permanently duplicate units via a paradox would be used in-story, even though it requires a lot of attention and is easily interfered with (so it's almost always impractical in combat).
