For clarity, this is the method of time travel that the first Back to the Future movie /sort of/ used. Marty McFly went back in time from 1985 to 1955, messed things up, and had only a limited windows in which to set things right. He had a picture with him where his older brother disappeared (as the ripple passed ~1963 when Dave was born), then his older sister disappeared (as the ripple passed ~1966 when Linda was born), then Marty himself begins to disappear (born in ~1968). This makes */no goddamned sense/* when you think about it, because the photograph itself was taken somewhere around 1985. Are we supposed to believe that the ripple hit 1963, disappeared Dave, then erased him from all photographs (while keeping the photograph intact)? Why does Marty still remember his brother then? Why don't the positions of people in the photograph change? It's a huge cheat that you don't really notice the first time you see the movie, but is there a way of fixing the general model so you don't have to cheat?
