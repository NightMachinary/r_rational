I had the same experience when I switched keyboard layouts from QWERTY to colemak. Learning it wasn't that difficult, but then I realised I couldn't use a qwerty layout any more, it wasn't just slow or something, I couldn't type at all. Years and years of typing using QWERTY and it's just gone in a month.
