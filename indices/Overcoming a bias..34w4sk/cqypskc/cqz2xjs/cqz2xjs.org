So, I've used QWERTY, but I never touch typed with it (I wasn't particularly slow, though). I then, a year ago or so, taught myself to touch type on dvorak, and it basically didn't affect my ability to to use QWERTY at all (apart from the fact that I'm a little out of practice now because I usually use dvorak). I wonder if that's only because I didn't touch type with QWERTY or if it's simply different from person to person.
