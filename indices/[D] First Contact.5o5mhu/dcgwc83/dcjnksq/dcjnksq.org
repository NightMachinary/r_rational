I watched Stupid Aliens... a lot of good points, although mostly stuff I am familiar with or have thought about before. Then I went to the comments... and saw someone arguing that Earth was unique and valuable because of liquid water and ignoring all the corrections other comments gave them about gas giants and frozen comet ice... Just a friendly reminder to never read Youtube comments unless you have a morbid fascination with human idiocy.
