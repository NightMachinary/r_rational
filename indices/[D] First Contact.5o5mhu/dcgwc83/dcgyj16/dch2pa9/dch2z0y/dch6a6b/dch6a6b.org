To give the clearest summary of some of the best of the hater's complaints...

The story claims a pedagogical purpose, however:

- One of the main character (Quirrel) who often gives detailed lectures is in fact very evil. Keep in mind how many people on [[/r/HPMOR]] thought Quirrel was a good guy, or at least a well meaning extremist, I think all the way up until Hermione's death, some up until the centaur got AK'd and some up until the final reveal. Imagine how this might look to someone who realized Quirrel was evil when he first had Harry beaten up, and how they might perceive the rationalist community as a result (a bunch of edgy nerds or worse, as neoreactionaries or alt-righters).

- Another main character (Harry) who gives directly lectures about rationality and science is often mistaken (both in the plot intentionally when Harry makes his many mistakes, and there are some minor quibbles about how EY explains some of the science through Harry).

- Dumbledore, who was genuinely right about everything, is treated as stupid/wrong/crazy by all the other characters and the narrative up until the very last chapters.

The original premise of "study magic with science" is used once to manipulate someone, and once to set up a skill to be used in the final chapters, and then ignored throughout much of the rest of the story.

Many chapters are devoted to a fun, but not plot building, remix of Ender's game. Many plot hooks get dropped and not used or only partially used (Bacon's dairy, the Christmas wish, etc.).

Other sore points include:

- A 10 year old talking about rape (plausible for the character, but a sudden shift in tone). This tone shift might really throw off readers that were expecting some of the fun and whimsy of the canon Harry Potter series, or who might have been expecting the story to be whimsical and fun from the earlier chapters.

- Hermione dying right as she was finally starting to be relevant to the plot, only to come back as Harry's minion (a harsh interpretation yes, but not entirely unfair). Keep in mind the controversy when Hermione was originally killed off, and then how EY asked people not to judge the story until it was finished.

- Harry being the most important person in the entire world because prophesy says so.

So yeah, definitely controversial. Even as a fan I wish EY would find it in himself to do the painful task of trying to revise and restructure some of HPMOR to address some of these points.
