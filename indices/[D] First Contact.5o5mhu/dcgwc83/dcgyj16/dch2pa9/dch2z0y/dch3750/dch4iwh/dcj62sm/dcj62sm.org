Fair warning: He starts off by literally defining rational fiction to be bad fanfiction, then goes on from there to explain that all rational fiction is bad. There's a lot of strawmen thrown around and, in my opinion, very little honest debating for the first 13-15 pages. The quality seems to have markedly improved after that, though.

Full disclosure: I was in the thread and it infuriated me, so my above description is doubtless colored by those feelings.
