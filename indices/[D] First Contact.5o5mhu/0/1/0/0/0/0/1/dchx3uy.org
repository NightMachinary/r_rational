I didn't notice most of the flaws on my first or second partial read through (HPMOR wasn't finished yet) or as the chapters were released. However, I think towards the end, I noticed and got slightly annoyed at some of the hanging plot points. I also figured by the Azkaban arc that Quirrel was definitely evil and I got progressively more annoyed at the readers for not realizing it. Upon reconsidering the entire story as a whole, I decided that EY shares some of the blame for people taking so long to recognize Quirrel as evil. Likewise, I wasn't bothered too much by the shift in premise from science up magic to Ender's game remix, to plotting political action, although looking at the story at a whole I can see how it might bother other people. A few of the controversial points, I am actually mostly on EY's side with. Draco's rape line establishes his upbringing and what sort of people Death Eater's really are, and I think the sudden shift in mood it brings to the story is actually a good warning about how much of the rest of the story goes.
