In addition to [[/u/scruiser]]'s excellent list above, there's one more big one: Harry is an 11-year-old kid who talks like an extremely well-educated adult. Many people complain that Harry comes off as robotic and/or inhuman, or that he's obviously a Gary Stu self-insert, or etc.

It's not an unreasonable complaint -- Harry /is/ a self-insert and his personality and speech /are/ wildly inconsistent with his physical age. He's definitely not a Gary Stu, and there's an in-story reason for his behavior, but it's never explicitly shown (AFAICR) and the pieces necessary to put it together aren't really visible until well into the book.
