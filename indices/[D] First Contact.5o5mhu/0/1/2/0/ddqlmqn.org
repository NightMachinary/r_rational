My back up suggestion for those who are not familiar with Harry Potter is usually [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man][The Metropolitan Man]]

HPMOR is definitely not the easiest thing to get into without having the prerequisite Harry Potter information installed in the 'ol meat computer. I appreciate that you gave it a shot, most of my friends and family haven't even gotten that far!
