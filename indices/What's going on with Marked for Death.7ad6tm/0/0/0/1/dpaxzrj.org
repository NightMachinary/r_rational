    For instance, in case of Interstellar the crew had collaborated with an additional team of ~30 visual graphics specialists to create a simulation of the black hole featured in the film and make it more realistic.

    What I'm looking for is somewhat similar to this, only for works of literature, and of course where the primary focus would be on the mathematical \ statistical accuracy of the created model with less regards for the “IMAX-quality” graphics.

    Imagine, for instance, for J. K. Rowling to have requested the development of NPC AIs to see how would various scenarios involving magical duels play out and diverge from her own predictions. And how tinkering with various variables (e.g. spell travel speed, required time for complete Apparition, possible frequency of multiple Apparitions for an ”average” wizard, etc) would be changing the general outcomes in various scenarios (e.g. a group of NPCs fighting against another, a group fighting against a unit, a group chasing after another, etc).
