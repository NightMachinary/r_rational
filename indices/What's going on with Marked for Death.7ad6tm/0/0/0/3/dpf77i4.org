I already did write software to do the game's math, actually. That didn't help nearly enough. The problem isn't that raising things to an exponent is hard, it's that there are no rules for designing powers. Everything requires significant numbers of spoons from the QMs because everything is a judgement call. We're already spending 10-15 hours per week on QM discussion and 6-8 hours on writing, and all of us recently acquired extra spoon-consuming life elements. There isn't a lot of extra time for writing yet more software, or even running endless simulations if we had the software.

Aside from that, software wouldn't work. As I said, everything is ad hoc, so every new power would need to be added to the software, along with all its interactions with every other power, and then there would be endless edge cases to deal with. "Just write software" isn't a magic wand that makes complexity go away, it just makes time-consuming bits faster.

Besides that, moving to a commercial system means we can access tools intended for that system.
