We're having fun at least with the interludes, and we're getting a more fleshed out setting from them, but even some of the most patient among us are getting a bit stir-crazy.

If you're curious about what forms the new system might take, the three main contenders were HERO, Mutants & Masterminds, and Dresden Files RPG. M&M was the one they were going for until a little while ago where they shifted more towards DFRPG, and it's likely that in the next week or two they'll get a preliminary draft of the rules for the new system up so that the playerbase can figure out how to break it and in so doing inform the QMs what still needs to be fixed.
