  In my experience as a programmer, "just write software" is a magic wand to solve combinatoric explosion of requirements---because, with half-finished software in hand, the requirements-specifiers are forced to realize that to get the project done, the requirements have to be reformulated to stop being combinatoric. ;)

That's not the software eliminating complexity, though. That's the goal donor changing the requirements so that you're not dealing with the same problem. I see the smiley and get the joke, though.

Every system has a constant level of complexity. You can't get rid of it or actually reduce it, but you can move it around and [usually you can] divide it into manageable chunks that can be hidden behind a simple interface.
