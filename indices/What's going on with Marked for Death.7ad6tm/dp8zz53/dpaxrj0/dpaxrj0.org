  MfD was originally running on a custom-made RPG system (how dice are rolled, how skills work, etc). This system had a number of flaws and went through a rework a while back.

  The upcoming battle revealed that the system's cognitive load on the QMs was too high, so the quest is on hiatus while they figure out which system to switch to and what house rules are needed to make it fit MfD.
