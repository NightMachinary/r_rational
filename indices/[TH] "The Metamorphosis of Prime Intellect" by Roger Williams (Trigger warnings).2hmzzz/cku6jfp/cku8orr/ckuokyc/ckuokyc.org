What if it's "slow down my experience by a factor of two every real-time second"?

You'd experience half of the first second, a quarter of the next one, and eighth of the next one, a sixteenth of the next one, etc. Your total subjective experience would be 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 ... seconds. From your perspective, you'd cease to exist in one subjective second.
