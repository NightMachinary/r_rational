  Well - when things are at their best, doesn't that kinda sound like life?

No: games involve extra lives. A well-designed game has a space for blatantly reckless exploration of the possibilities. Real life is /great/ at being (often) nonlinear and having no set story you get forced through (freedom), but it's actually /complete shit/ at letting you explore the possibility-space without suffering catastrophic penalties (such as death, destitution, or mental illness). Worse: the tutorial levels (childhood) are deliberately constructed to shield you from the complexity of the real game (real life) instead of building you up to having the strength for it, so when you /do/ get thrown into the real levels (again: real-life adulthood), it's a basically sink-or-swim challenge that breaks a lot of people and dramatically cuts off possibilities for almost everyone.

The biggest barrier /stopping/ real life from being a great place to live is precisely that we are forced to spend most of our efforts on survival rather than on self-actualization or doing good for/with others.
