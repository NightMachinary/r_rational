That's neat! Mine don't :P My dreams are primarily narrative based, so unimportant details are things like the deep texture of a desk: totally unimportant to the narrative. Also, I rarely /hear/ words, although I know what people are saying, like I'm reading a book.

Maybe you have your unimportant details in a different medium?

I can totally believe a collage, and while that reduces the required processing capability, it doesn't eliminate it.
