  What would make the perfect game? Well, for starters, you'd be in it, and other people would be there, too. Then, there'd be challenges. But they'd be challenges you set yourself, and very importantly, they'd scale with your level: they'd get harder as you got better.

  Well - when things are at their best, doesn't that kinda sound like life?
