  Maybe you have your unimportant details in a different medium?

That's quite possible. My dreams usually tend to be visually detailed, but don't make much sense plot-wise. (I just woke up, so it's fresh in my mind :) Like, I could probably sketch you a detailed walkthrough of my current one, architecturally, but I don't think I can remember detail except for the precise things I was paying attention to. I think it's filled in on demand? Like, I want to know about a detail and it fills in. So I can recall exactly the marble texture of that stupidly giant staircase I just went down on my way out of the building that started out as a school? and for some reason bordered a shopping center? which was not visible from the outside? And which I escaped through the gardening section before jumping onto a helicopter? ... Dreams, man. Anyway, I can sketch the layout of the architecture in detail, but there's no global sense to it because my brain didn't have a plan going in.)
