No, but, say, if you dream of a spaceship, what's happening is based, in a sense, on your internal model of a spaceship. (And other parts.) It's like a collage.

(Also, what's an unimportant detail? My dreams have lots of details..)

Basically, the dream (or vision!) is a remixed reflection of your existing knowledge. Maybe people don't normally remember their dreams? I don't know. My dreams usually have a lot of detail to them. Occasionally, I can even recognize where it comes from. :)
