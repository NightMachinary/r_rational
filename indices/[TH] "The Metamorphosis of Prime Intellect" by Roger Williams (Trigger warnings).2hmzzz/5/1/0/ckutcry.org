I don't know. On those rare occasions I'm lucid enough in a dream, and on the much more frequent occasion I can inspect memories of a dream, I can tell I'm not in Reality because there are no unimportant details.

Your suggestion also posits that there's just one faculty in the brain being used for both; AFAIK, indications are that the brain is closer to many faculties that are blurred together. I'd be surprised if Imagination and Observation were the same software/hardware/wetware (or blurred together that much), and I wouldn't be surprised if the involved substances effected one but not the other.
