  in my eyes, the only acceptable use of a trigger warning is when there are depictions of violence that legitimately could cause a PTSD sufferer a flashback

This story revolves around detailed depictions of extreme violence. If we go by your definition, a trigger warning was appropriate here.

In any case, I don't think it much matters whether it's called a trigger warning or just a warning. It's courteous to warn people if they're about to view something disturbing. Yes, some people use trigger warnings inappropriately. OP did not, so I don't see a reason to bring up Tumblr at all.
