Yeah, that's clearer, and would probably work until external events changed things.

From a Doylist Point of View though, I doubt it would work if such an idea was expressed in the story, PI isn't a genie, and isn't an unchanging Rules As Written system, it explicitly adapts around attempts to commit suicide. One person might get away with it for a while, but once their simulation is so slow as to be indistinguishable from a person in stasis, PI would clarify the rules, and set a lower bound on your possible simulation speed.
