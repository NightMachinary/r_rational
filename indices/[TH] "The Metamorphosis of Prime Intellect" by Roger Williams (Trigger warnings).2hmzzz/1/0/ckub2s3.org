Subjective or objective seconds?

If subjective seconds, you'd experience the universe slowing down exponentially, and you'd probably hit the heat death of the universe in a matter of minutes... unless Prime Intellect finds a way around that, in which case you'd end up alive, but isolated from the rest of society.

If you're slowed down by a factor of two every objective second, you'd experience only two more subjective seconds, and then die.
