Yup, having now played through the first and part of the second chapters of this, it's *great*. Fantastic dialogue and interesting worldbuilding, and a main character that really makes sense to me. I'm super into it.

Caveats:

1) The thing where XP is a finite resource means that it's very, very easy to accidentally get into an unwinnable state, typically signaled by a mandatory boss that you clearly have no hope of fighting. I got around this via, ah, vigorous cheating with save editors. This made me realize that grinding in most JRPGs is actually an important usability feature allowing players to implicitly tune the difficulty of the game to desired levels (since more time spent grinding=lower difficulty).

2) There are a lot of places where extremely important mechanics are just straight-up not explained to the player. I kinda regret not starting to read the walkthrough prior to getting midway through chapter 2, since I've missed a couple of story arcs and investment opportunities already by not noticing these mechanics existed.
