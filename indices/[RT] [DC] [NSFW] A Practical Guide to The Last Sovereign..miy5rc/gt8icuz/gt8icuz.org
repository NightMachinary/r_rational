  Use them all and save often, there's no autosave in the game!

There is an autosave, the 100th slot is an autosave slot, saving at each new screen.

That having been said it won't be enough -- it'll suffice if you messed up a fight, but not for bigger strategic failures like misusing funds, failing to blackmail an official, or whatever.

It's a LONG game, and you'll sometimes feel like redoing an entire chapter if you got a suboptimal result, so what I recommend is using the 50 first slots or so at the beginning (or before the end) of each chapter/major story bit and *keeping* those saves indefinitely, and using the other 50 slots to save near constantly, or for alternate/experimental decision paths, etc
