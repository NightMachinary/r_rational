That advice is not sufficient, because it could just as easily be describing a game with checkpoints or autosaves but where it's also advisable to save immediately before important and/or risky decisions.

I am astounded the game doesn't do checkpoint saves when moving between... whatever the term is for the story scenes within a chapter.
