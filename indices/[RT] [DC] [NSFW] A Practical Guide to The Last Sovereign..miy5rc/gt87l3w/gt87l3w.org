EDIT: I sit corrected. There's an autosave slot that does exactly what I'd expect, it just happens to be at the /bottom/ of the list of 100 save slots. +If anyone decides to give this game a try, I would want to point out that all saving is manual. I was having some fun, at least as much as with Final Fantasy games, for a few hours before I died and decided I would rather given up than start over and replay all the intro stuff again.+
