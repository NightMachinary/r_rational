Glad you've been enjoying it! Yeah, more and more I've been thinking that the "finite amount of enemies" mechanic has its own set of problems. It's a better system in most cases than infinite enemies, I think, but for people /trained/ in an RPG environment where grinding is the norm, the ability to skip enemies is just too attractive, and people end up skipping too many enemies without realizing how underpowered they'll end up being. For cheating, I definitely think it's a good idea if combat is what's keeping people from enjoying the story; just be careful of these particular anti-cheat measures!

As for missing stuff... yeah, I went back and forth on advising people to use a walkthrough, and feel like I should have emphasized it even more. I think most people, myself included, would prefer to play through games blind first, but this game is /exceedingly/ complicated compared to most games, and my read of things is that there's no way to really "explain" some of the mechanics without breaking immersion... particularly thinking of the time where how many places you travel to influences how much time has passed. But doing that at the same time when two characters can be recruited, making them permanently missable if you go straight for the goal but also costing you a lot of benefits if you don't know exactly where to go to get them and then move on, feels like a bad design choice that makes it more likely people are going to regret actions they take without any way to feel informed ahead of time.
