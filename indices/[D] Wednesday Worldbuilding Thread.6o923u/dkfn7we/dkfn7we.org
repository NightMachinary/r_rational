I came up with an interesting story idea about the landlords of a black market shopping district in [[https://www.facebook.com/groups/1713530785583721/permalink/1911137659156365/][a cyberpunk setting inspired by Shadowrun and Red Markets]]. I like the idea of appealing to 80s and 90s nostalgia in a way that also exposes the blatant consumerism inherent in the franchises being referenced. I've reimagined the character archetypes of Shadowrun with this in mind: Street Samurai are trying to be edgy anti-heroes, Wizards are eccentric Harry Potter characters, Adepts are Martians arts heroes from shonen anime, Riggers build drones and mecha, Shamans catch and train spirits like Pokemon, and Deckers are magical weirdos obsessed with card and board games. There are a ton of adventurers all looking to stick it to the man and pay your illegal businesses lots of money to do so.

To further differentiate the setting from Shadowrun, I've decided to also reimagine the fantasy archetypes of elves and dwarves with enough internal diversity that they can fill in for the other races. Changelings are born with a telepathic link to a specific spirit, usually animal totems, and by fostering a relationship with their spirit gain thematically appropriate magic powers and appearances. They can change their bond to different spirits through pacts, though this takes effort. They are generally more powerful than humans in certain ways, but the effort to maintain and improve their boons can incentivize eccentric behavior. Bonding with spirits representing humans results in the traditional "high elf", which are known for being prideful because humans see themselves as superior to other animals.

Meanwhile, jotun can control one elemental force (fire, ice, storm, metal, stone, etc.) based on their bloodline. They can also transmute their flesh into their element and vice versa, so they will sculpt their bodies into a form of their choosing. Maintaining control over a lot of their element is difficult, so many build relatively short bodies to conserve power until their skill improves. There are plenty with inhuman faces or who even take the forms of giants, but that's less common since all "metahumans" started off as human until magic returned to the world a few generations ago. Personally, I think this could be a pretty cool world to play around in with enough potential for interesting and stylistic stories.
