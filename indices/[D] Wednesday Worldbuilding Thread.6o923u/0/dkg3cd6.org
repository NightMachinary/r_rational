There is a city of perpetual night.

Within city limits, no stars can be seen in the sky, there is never any hint of sun, and only the moon shines it's light.

The two biggest consequences of this are probably the death of all plants, and the enormous need for artificial light. The difficulties in timekeeping and scheduling are secondary consequences; the only reasons to keep a 24-hour day with 8 hour work period are convention and circadian rhythms. I'm less sure about what the psychological effects might be.

Any thoughts on Things Which Must Be True given a city without daylight? (My intended tech level is roughly 1940s, but I would be interested in takes on earlier or later periods.)
