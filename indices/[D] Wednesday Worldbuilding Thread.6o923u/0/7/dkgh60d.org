Well, if the city is on a planet which no stars ever shine on, even though the moon does, it should be frozen solid. So I conclude that it is not the planet that does not see the sun, but the city itself. Yet the moon shines on the city, so the city is exposed to the sky. How is this possible?

One possibility is that the planet that this city is on is tidally locked to the star it orbits, so the same side of the planet always faces the sun, and the city is on the other side. The lack of stars could just be that the atmosphere is too thick/cloudy for the tiny stars to be visible. In which case, the city certainly would be lacking in plant (and hence animal) life, but they can engage in trade with cities on the light side of the planet and thus avoid starving to death. But then why would anyone stay in a dark side city? And how would a dark side city have the profits needed to constantly import food?

So a thing which must be true is that this city has some kind of massive money maker. Maybe it's on top of a diamond mine. Or oil. Or coal. Or gold! Luring an influx of migrants from light side cities, all hoping to literally strike gold and become rich and successful. Trade booms, as traders go to dark side cities to sell food supplies and buy whatever the miners are digging up, and return to light side cities to do the opposite.

Alternatively, the dark side city could be a prison, on the very center of the planet's dark side. Security would be unparalleled because any criminal attempting to escape the city would simply starve to death before managing to reach the light side of the planet.
