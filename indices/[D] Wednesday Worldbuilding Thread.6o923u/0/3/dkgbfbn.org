The City of Ember did this fairly well, though they had structured nights and days built into their quasi-religious reverence for "The Builders."

That also came with a total loss of technical uplift information, however. They even forgot how to make candles, and could only repair things by replacing broken parts with stored ones. It probably isn't what you're going for, but it's the only example in literature that I know of which was delved into with any depth.
