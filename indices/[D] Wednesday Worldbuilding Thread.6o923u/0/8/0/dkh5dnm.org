I haven't quite decided yet, because I don't 100% have the project pinned down.

What I think would be cool, evocative, and ominous is to have the sun's apparent position in the sky start shifting as you approached the city. For a stretch of about a mile, the sun would appear to be setting to the north, until you were in the city proper and the sun was (apparently) entirely below the horizon. That would give a band of twilight.
