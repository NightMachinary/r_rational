  Either that, or ship collisions may be a real and common problem.

Uh, it just occurred to me - maybe we're overplaying the use of vision? I mean, people have been living there for 30 years now and given the whole "people rich enough to leave, leave", people won't necessarily have the money for lighting. If people /could/ get by without light, they /would/. In fact, people depending on how expensive lighting is, just about everyone might be used to either low light conditions or complete darkness.

At which point, [[/u/cthulhuraejepsen]] has practically recreated "Day of the Triffids" without the triffids! Some blind people have [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_echolocation][learned how to use echolocation]] to lead the people who can't, see.

Actually, reading that wikipedia page, /everyone/ can learn how to do it, and given that darkness is more-or-less a fact and seeing with your eyes costs money, chances are that everyone will learn to do it. People born in the 30-year period, sufficiently poor, might have never learned to see.

Ignoring the above for a sec, if the docks /are/ brightly lit up 24/7 (which might actually be a thing, since shipping to daylight land will necessarily involve people who are used to daylight) then light pollution may be a thing. This could be a huge boon - /free light/! Resulting in people clamouring to live near the docks, and taking advantage of the light as best they can.

If the dock is shallow enough, some people /might/ (if possible/feasible) want to replace the dock's waterbed with a transparent material in order to live below the water with a sunroof of sorts - again, free lighting. Would require dredging the dock to keep those roofs clean, but again, economic incentive.

--------------

Come to think of it, lack of light means lack of /heat/. Eternal night-time means /it's freaking cold/ (unless the bubble is on the equator or something, and the surrounding sunlight country is quite hot and heats it a bunch). Icebergs might be possible, in the docks. Hell, even the whole river could freeze, which would make the shipping route less useful when it happens (see: Russia's northern ports, and its desire to control warmwater ports). Warm clothing would be a must, then, and (imported!) fuel for warmth might be a requirement. If that's the case then light isn't /quite/ as expensive, since it basically comes free with the (required) heating.
