I've been thinking about this a bit, since it's what I see as the most serious issue. In the current iteration, it's an important port at the mouth of a major river, built prior to the Eternal Night. Basically, it exists for the same reason that New Orleans would be founded in an instant if it didn't already exist; geography is a really powerful factor in how and why cities form.

(I /think/ it's been about thirty years since Eternal Night fell, and there's been some migration out from the city to the land of daytime with huge, congested commutes involved for everyone who can afford it, a "night flight" syndrome that's left the city proper with high crime rates, low property values, low taxes, poor government, etc. And the city nevertheless exists, because economic incentives based on trade are far too important to ignore.)
