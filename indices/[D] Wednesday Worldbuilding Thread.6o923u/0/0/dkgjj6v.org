Assuming this city is the only area affected by the Eternal Night (and the planet would be pretty much dead if it wasn't), there must be some reason that people choose to live there.

What that reason is will almost certainly shape the city and the city's culture.

Is there some resource buried underground there? It must be a mining town.

A valuable plant or fungus that only grows in the eternal moonlight? There are gardens everywhere, or maybe the city is mostly underground with the surface made of farms.

Whatever mystical effect causes the darkness also causes people to age more slowly? People who appear as children may have knowledge and experience of someone several times their apparent age, along with many other potential effects.

Maybe the darkness descended recently, and the geopolitical situation keeps people from being able to leave. Maybe the Land of Sunlight is filled with terrifying monsters. Maybe people can't die in the Nightrealm.
