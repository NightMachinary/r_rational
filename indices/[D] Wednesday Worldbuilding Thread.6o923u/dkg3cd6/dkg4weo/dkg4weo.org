Highly prevalent seasonal affective disorder, for one thing. Parks wouldn't exist, exacerbating the mental stress faced by the residents as well. To help counteract that, malls and other buildings would have sunlamps and greenspaces to attract people, much like how our current buildings have air conditioning.

There would likely be 2-3 shifts for /everything/ (assuming that the city's self-contained enough to have its own economy), and those different shifts could diverge and segregate themselves socially and culturally when filter bubbles and "immigration" divide the people into tribes.

Tying into the previous point, noise bylaws and similar things that change based on "time of day" would need a radical rework. This could be either by not having any, or else neighborhood/apartment building specific times, which would further segregate people based on their work shift.
