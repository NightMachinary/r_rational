What happens when the city expands? Someone builds a new suburb out into the Sunlit Lands - does the Endless Night expand? What happens when the city grows to the point where it begins to merge with a neighbouring city?

Is there a great big lump of Endless Night that just happens to overlap the city (and if so, how far outside the bounds does it go), or does the Night expand with the city in some way?
