People would need a secondary source of vitamin D. We mostly get ours from UVB exposure, and the moon [[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1974Moon....9..295C][is a poor source of UV light]], reflecting only 0.7% of incident UVC (compared to 7.2% for visible light).

As far as I can tell our current dietary sources seem to all depend on UVB exposure. We can create D3 from lanolin (found in sheep wool) or fish liver + UVB, D2 from fungi + UVB (though the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergocalciferol][page for it]] doesn't specify that it's /only/ UVB, it could be; the minor levels of D2 in unirradiated mushrooms could be from sporadic sunlight exposure).

Fortunately, since the sun-free zone only extends to the city limits it means that livestock or plants grown outside the city can be imported for use. Apparently milk fortified with vitamin D was common by the 1930's, so a diet that's some combination of fish, mushrooms, and fortified milk (all sourced from outside the city) would be pretty likely.

On the other hand, the rich could probably afford to have large homes outside the city limits and commute in for work/social engagements, and wouldn't necessarily need such a diet (they might shun it, in fact, as a way of proving they're not "common").

Expect that anyone who can't afford a diet with enough vitamin D will develop rickets or osteomalacia. This could be a large percentage of the population, potentially. I imagine that the stratification of the city's society would have a lot to do with this.
