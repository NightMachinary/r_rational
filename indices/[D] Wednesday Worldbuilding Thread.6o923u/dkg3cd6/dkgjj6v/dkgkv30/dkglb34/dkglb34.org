In that case, it's probably a shipping city, which introduces complications that should be accounted for. Ships will be docking/undocking and moving past each other in almost complete darkness. I imagine the main dock areas would be extremely well lit for safety purposes, more of an eternal daytime than eternal night.

There might be regulations that require ships passing through to keep lit, and maybe buildings/buoys filled with lanterns to improve visibility on waterways. Either that, or ship collisions may be a real and common problem.

Keeping docks well lit may be expensive, which means there may be cheaper "dark docks" used by ships carrying cheap cargo and poorer passengers.

A city like this will probably have a lot of people passing through, especially by ship, who are still on "sunlight time." To cater to these people, there may be buildings or even whole areas near the docks where the lights shut off or become dim at "night."
