WHat happens on the edge of the zone? Is there a twilight band or a weird physics breaking line? Twilight band would make extra desirable housing area, as would the sunlit area just outside, unless the zone expands to cover it. I'd predict housing on the edge would be very expensive, but you could also have parks and schools out there so kids get enough UV (unless you want them running round in their underwear under UV lamps as they do in Siberia.) Day trips to outside would be super popular.

If the rest of the world is as normal people with sunlight sensitivity disorders would move to the city (and vampires if you have vampires)
