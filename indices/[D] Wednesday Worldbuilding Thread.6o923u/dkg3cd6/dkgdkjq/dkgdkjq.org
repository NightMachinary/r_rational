You may want to check out [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/70647-silo][Hugh Howey's Silo series]], dystopian novels in which the inhabitants live within underground, windowless silos. Time is measured by mandated shifts (similar to what [[/u/ulyssessword]] suggested), crops are grown within small-scale artificially-lit farms, etc.

For your world, I'd also imagine that people would generally be extremely pale. Being tan (now accomplished entirely through artificial means) might be a sign of wealth and elitism, in the same way that paleness was once a sign of wealth in many of our societies (as it implied you did not have to labor in the sun).
