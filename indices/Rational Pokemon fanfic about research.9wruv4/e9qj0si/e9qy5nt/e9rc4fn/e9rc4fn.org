Thanks for the reply! OoS is great! I'm on Ch. 60 now. I love the author's worldbuilding of the Pokemon universe, and there's some great information about Pokemon themselves, especially in the earlier chapters, but later on I felt that some of the focus on Pokemon shifted to other matters. Not at all a bad thing, and I enjoy the building narrative, but it doesn't quite satisfy my itch for learning more about Pokemon, the species.
