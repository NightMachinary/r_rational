[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9794740/1/][Pokémon: The Origin of Species]] is exactly what you are looking for.

Like the other comments have mentioned, it's mostly an adventure story following our protagonists on their Pokémon journey with an emphasis on teaching the reader rationality. But included is Red's goal is to become a Pokémon professor, and so we get to see him investigate Pokémon and even publish a paper. There is also new research that we see in the background that Red isn't directly involved with.

But all of that has been interrupted in the past few chapters because THINGS JUST GOT SERIOUS!

Seriously, go read it. The world feels very well built and consistent in the way it allows pre-teens to adventure without adult supervision while still addressing all the implications of having incredibly dangerous wild animals that can shoot lasers.
