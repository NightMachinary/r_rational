I too feel that the writer doesn't really want to a pokefic anymore as opposed to general sci-fi with pets. There's a lot more focus on the psychic powers, clones, stock market, research grants, politics, legal system, natural disasters, social media, journalism, real world maths etc as opposed to the actual Pokemon, which just get pulled out for the odd action scene.
