Yikes, that does sound like a daunting task! The one benefit, though, is that you don't need to explain all the nitty-gritty details to your readers. While it's interesting and certainly helps, I think if you write the information so it holds some validity so it's at least believable, then the rest is just how much effort you want to put into it. I wish you luck!

And thanks so much for recommending that tumblr page! It's really, really interesting, and makes the idea of writing some Pokemon fanfic about research far more plausible.
