OoS is definitely the go-to in terms of rational Pokémon.

Red's background is that he's been working at a research lab before the journey begins. While there are some research scenes involving him and other characters, the fic is mostly about teaching rational thinking within the "three friends travel the world" setting of Pokémon.

I'd recommend reading it. Without spoiling too much, you might especially enjoy the more recent chapters if you liked worm.
