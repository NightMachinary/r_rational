I've watched so many documentaries on large ships and construction and science fiction into science fact, and absolutely nothing comes close to the frankly flagrantly impossible airship there. It's really funny. And that would be relatively minor details in the story too, yet it takes so much study to just accurately bullshit them!

Good luck with your study as well! There's scientificpokedex on tumblr...if they're still there after the goddamn purge (my account got zapped despite me running mostly Pok√©mon blogs so I can't check, so I hope you can!).
