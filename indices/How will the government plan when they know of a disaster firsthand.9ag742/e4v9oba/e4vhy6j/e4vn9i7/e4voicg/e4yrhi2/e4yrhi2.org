Anime used to have a bit of a nuclear taboo (Japan being unique in having citizens whose families died in a nuclear attack).

Evangelion's N^{2} mines are one example. Others include Macross and its 'Reaction Weapons'; Gall Force and its SVE missiles and to a lesser extent Code Geass and its FLEIJA weapon. More recently, Zankyou no Terror (a show with terrorist protagonists threatening a nuclear attack on Tokyo) somehow managed to make it through the entire series without ever actually using the words 'nuke' or 'nuclear weapon', instead euphemistically referring only to 'stolen plutonium' and the like.

In Japan, only /villains/ use nukes. (See: Legend of the Galactic Heroes and its Westerland Massacre, or M'Quve's threat in Mobile Suit Gundam)

The latest generation of anime has more or less moved past it (see No Game No Life's shiritori game, for example), but its a noted writing quirk through to the early '10s.
