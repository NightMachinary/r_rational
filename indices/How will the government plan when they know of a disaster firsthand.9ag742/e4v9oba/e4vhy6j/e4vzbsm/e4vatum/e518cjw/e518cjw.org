I think an interesting way to get around this story-telling roadblock, is to simply amp up the severity of the disaster, and, more importantly, make government agents the protagonists.

A zombie outbreak story, only maybe the infection is already airborne and in the water and also has carriers in both animals, insects, and people; and the protagonists effectively are the government, so there are actual stakes. If they fail, then civilization as we know it falls.

Essentially, make the story about the government response to the apocalypse, and write some nice Competence Porn. Like how everybody is really good at their jobs and smart in The Martian, and yet it's still a gripping story. Imagine a story like that, only instead of NASA trying to rescue a guy on Mars, its the CDC trying to hold back the zombie apocalypse. It could be awesome!
