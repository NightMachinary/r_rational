  Basically, disaster stories always start with the government holding the idiot ball.

I wonder if this could be not-true, given a sufficiently large idiot ball somewhere else.

Like, say, if there was /first/ an environmental equivalent of /The Purge/: a 24-hour period where a randomly-distributed 1/3rd of the population just went crazy, reverting to [enraged] animal behaviour, and then just stopping without any memory of what they did 24 hours later.

...and then a zombie-virus outbreak occurred in the middle of it.

It'd take a fairly clever government to handle both.
