Or, let's use a different culturally relevant scenario:

We've had clear evidence and warning from the intelligence community for two years that Russia is actively influencing US (and other) elections, and has the ability to hack and tamper with electronic voting systems and voter data.

Have we seen any sweeping security overhauls? Perhaps a frantic adoption of paper-validated voting systems? Audits of voter registration data for tampering? How many states have changed their voting systems in response to this dramatic and well publicized cyber attack?

People, as a general rule, are stupid, and slow to respond to anything that doesn't directly impact their immediate comfort, social status, and employment.
