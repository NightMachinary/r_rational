The first thing I can think of is the opening of Evangelion (which is not, of course, a rational show by any measure, but anyways...). The military knows than an Angel is coming and are well prepared with armour, aircraft, and a nuke (? some kind of huge bomb at least). The reason these preparations don't trivialize the show is that they all turn out to be /insufficient/, as the Angel shakes off or regenerates from all the damage it takes from mundane weapons - to the surprise of the military.

We can take some inspiration from this scene in designing a disaster which is known ahead of time and prepared for. I think you only need one element to make a rational large-scale response to a disaster still have tension and stakes: information! If the preparation is made with certain incorrect information in mind - details about the disaster which are reasonably thought to be accurate turn out to be inaccurate, or the scale of the disaster turns out to be more focused or more broad than was reasonably expected - then an interesting story can be built out of both the discovery that the prepared resources aren't appropriate to solve the problem, and the reaction of the first responders needing to find a way to use said resources creatively to either solve the problem anyways or, if you want to be darker, just /mitigate/ the damage/loss of life.

So basically, plans made on incorrect or insufficient information plus competent and interesting characters figuring out where their information is wrong and then using available resources to do the best they can once they have better information. Which is... one of the main ways to make /anything/ go wrong in a rational story, isn't it?
