  blame dumb puerto ricans for living in puerto rico
#+end_quote

I'm totally willing to bite this bullet. Unlike most people in bad climactic environments in the world (where they're stuck with that environment because that's /their whole country/), Puerto Ricans are US citizens and can freely move and live anywhere else in the US---most of which /does not/ have natural disasters striking it every eight years. An entirely-rational Puerto Rican population (or, say, an entirely-rational population of New Orleans) would pack up and emigrate /en masse/ to any random safe part of the continental US.

If a population that was constantly being struck by natural disasters decided that it /wanted/ to migrate like that, I don't think that the government---whether through organizations like FEMA, or perhaps other departments---would be at-all against helping them to do so. For the government to reject the idea would be like an insurance company deciding not to pay for statins for a client with a heart condition! A prophylactic is /much/ cheaper than a rescue, and government agencies know that. People just don't want the help, usually.
