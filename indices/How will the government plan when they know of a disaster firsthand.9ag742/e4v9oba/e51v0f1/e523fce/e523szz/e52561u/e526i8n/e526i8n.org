I somehow doubt the problem is this simplistic.

you are also hand waving the costs of such a migration, both to an individual and as a society.

more to the point, none of this is excusing the original criticism: that the federal government isn't good at handling large-scale disasters. It's not at ALL implausible that a government would be slow to react and inefficient in its response even with foreknowledge of an impending event.
