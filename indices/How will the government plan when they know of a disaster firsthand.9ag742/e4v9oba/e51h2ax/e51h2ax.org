I think how the plague gets out in Stephen King's The Stand was rather plausible, as far as I remember. There were proper procedures in place, but one guy gets tunnel vision when his family is at risk and forces the gates with his car. Not exactly rational behavior but definitely plausible human behavior.

I do not remember what happened after that, perhaps the reason he got far enough to infect more people was because a lot of bad decisions.
