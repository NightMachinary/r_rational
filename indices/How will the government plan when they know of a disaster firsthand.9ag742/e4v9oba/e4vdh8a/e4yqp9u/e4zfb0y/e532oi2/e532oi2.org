  effort to make government look not-bad
#+end_quote

Sometimes this is accomplished by covering up the incident (or diminishing its extent), because a govt that doesn't let disasters happen in the first place is viewed as more competent than one where they do happen.

Nevermind that this impedes rescue and disaster relief, and when the truth inevitably gets out it's a much larger loss of face.
