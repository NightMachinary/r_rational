That comes down to loss aversion though, which is a different issue.

With classical disaster scenarios, people are taking (sometimes drastic) actions to prevent a large loss form occurring, but in the scenario you're talking about, it's essentially investing in a stock that there is significant reason to believe will rise in value.

Sure, both vaguely seek to have the situation in the future not get worse, but they're not really directly comparable.
