Third world countries also comes to mind - namely, AFAICT solving world poverty would boost the economy of first-world countries (as well as everyone else) in the long term, because having more R&D generally means more efficiency faster, and more economically-developed countries means more R&D. Plus, larger economies for first-world sorts of goods, which means better economies of scale which means cheaper.

Point is, this is a sort of inverse-disaster (losing out on potential $$$), yet the governments don't do shit about it. Although there are almost certainly major principal-agent problems and whatnot, so they're not necessarily acting "irrationally".
