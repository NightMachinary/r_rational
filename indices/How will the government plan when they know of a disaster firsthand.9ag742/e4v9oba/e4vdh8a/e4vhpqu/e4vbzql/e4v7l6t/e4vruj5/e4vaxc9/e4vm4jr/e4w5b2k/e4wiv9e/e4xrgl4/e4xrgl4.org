It lasts for 90 days at the maximum withdrawal capacity, meaning if you're going through the stockpile as fast as you can. I don't know how fast you'd go through rationing, but the stockpile is Î©(90 days). I'm not too familiar with the specifics, if they're even declassified, but I do know that there are plans in place to rebuild from everything up to a nuclear war (under the optimistic assumption there are even any people left alive). It might require adopting 1911 era weapons and giving up on vehicles for a while, but it's possible. The general idea, as I understand it, isn't to treat it as a military operation in the usual sense but to prevent the breakdown of social order at all costs while trying to rebuild the supply chains necessary to keep people alive.

From the perspective of what characters see, depending on how close you are to a military base I'd expect them to show up at most a few weeks after the event, institute martial law, and start handing out food rations.
