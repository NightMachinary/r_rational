The Nightmare Stacks by charles stross is how UK would deal with an ELF invasion.

He for once did a lot of reasearch and portrayed in what I believe a pretty realistic way (in universe, which features lovecraftian monsters).

Main point of that book is that military have contigency plans for EVERYTHING. alien invasion included.
