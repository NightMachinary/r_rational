Look at how the government plans for current disasters. What is publicly available of the disaster response to a nuclear war is a good place to start. Also look into first hand accounts from areas that have been hit with large hurricanes, that's how they would deal with rations and so on. The short version is martial law->food and water->temporary shelter->rebuilding, all of this until the last one being handled by the military. I believe people are given ration cards and rations are airlifted in if the roads are inaccessible, but don't quote me on that.

The plans for a nuclear war would probably be closer to what you're looking for, because they assume all other institutions have broken down. Hurricane and other real life examples of disaster response rely on having a large amount of industry and food to bring into the area, with the only limit being logistics.

There are a lot of smart people who are very good with logistics who have planned for major disasters, you would need to somehow render the military ineffective for this sort of collapse to work. In other words, the most believable thing that could cause a major collapse like this is a massive war, nothing else can really cripple every disaster relief option simultaneously. If you have a rational alien invasion or berserk AI you're screwed anyway, there won't be people around to relieve for very long.
