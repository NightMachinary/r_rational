Good questions all. I'd say that the answers are:

#+begin_quote
  Can existing democratic mechanisms impeach Trump? (i.e. blue midterms)
#+end_quote

No, Trump cannot be impeached. It is literally impossible (not enough seats coming open) for the Democrats to get a 2/3 majority in the Senate, which means they cannot impeach him without assistance from a sizable number of Republicans. That is not going to happen; the Republicans have clearly demonstrated that they will stand with Trump even if he beats a puppy to death with the corpse of a nun. The one /POSSIBLE/ exception to this is if Mueller comes back with clear evidence that Trump committed treason, but I wouldn't count on it; the definition of treason is very narrow, so it's unlikely that Trump committed that precise crime. Even then, I'm not sure it would be enough. He's done such a good job of poisoning the well that most Republican-leaning people would just assume that news coverage of such a crime was fake news.

  Assuming #1 succeeds, can the US make meaningful patches to the problems with democracy
#+end_quote

There is some hope on this front. The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Popular_Vote_Interstate_Compact][National Popular Vote Interstate Compact]] is a movement among the states to say "From now on, we're going to give all our electors to whomever wins the popular vote". It doesn't go into effect until enough states have signed up that they control 270 electoral votes, but they're halfway there already. It would be a way to effectively eliminate the electoral college and stop letting the Republicans scuttle into office when the populace didn't want them. (No, that is not my bias. There have been 5 EC-only presidents, and all of them were Republicans aside from JQA, who was a Democratic Republican because the modern Republican party didn't exist yet.) If the Compact goes into effect, the Republicans will have a very hard time getting another President into office: "As of October 2017, Gallup polling found that 31% of Americans identified as Democrat, 24% identified as Republican, and 42% as Independent."

Also, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting_in_the_United_States][Maine and a handful of cities]] are currently using instant-runoff voting, so there's a chance we can move away from the FPTP. There's no Constitutional mandate for it, so all that's necessary is to convince people at the local level.

#+begin_quote
  How much long-term damage will Trump do to the credibility of the USA?
#+end_quote

All of it. He will almost certainly make it to the end of his term -- Mueller still needs to finish the investigation and then the Republicans can probably slow-walk the trial long enough to stall until 2020.

As to him getting re-elected...it's not just possible, I think it's actually likely unless something changes. His [[https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/][approval ratings]] have been going up steadily this whole year and he's currently running in the >40% range -- shoot, the WSJ had him at 46% a couple weeks ago. (Ignore Rasmussen. They've been a significant outlier since Trump first announced his candidacy.)

Nearly everyone who is slightly conservative is probably going to vote for Trump if they get the chance, since:

- The stock market keeps going up. (Who cares that ~70% of Americans have no stake in the stock market and that it's looking like a bubble anyway?)
- Unemployment keeps going down. (Who cares that that's provably momentum from Obama, since Trump's policies have generally not helped?)
- He's "making NATO pay their fair share." (And also destroying our relations with our allies and giving power to Russia and China.)
- Most importantly: Trump's already put one conservative on the SCOTUS, and if Trump is in office for another 6 years then there's a decent chance that Ginsberg will retire and Trump will get to put another justice in. That would give the conservatives a 6-3 majority on the SCOTUS and reshape the country for a generation.
