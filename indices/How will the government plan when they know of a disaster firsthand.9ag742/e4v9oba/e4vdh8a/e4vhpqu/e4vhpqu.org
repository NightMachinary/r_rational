Ender's Game somewhat works with this premise. The first invasion that happened prior to the beginning of the story likely caught Earth off guard.

But the government restructures society and put several programs in place in order to be prepared for a second invasion if it ever were to come. Though the story only really focuses on one aspect of their planning, so it might not be what you're looking for.
