Unfortunately for storytelling, a rational response to a disaster often makes it... not a disaster. Take a zombie outbreak, for example. The rational response was best depicted in [[https://xkcd.com/734/][this xkcd]], which doesn't even get to the point of a government needing to do something.

In any such disaster, there will be many more intervention points, at which the crisis could have been averted. In order for you to have a story in which a disaster threatens to end civilization, people need to have made bad decisions over and over and over again, until things have finally gone so wrong that the problem is big enough, or has been ignored for long enough, that it's too late to respond effectively. Basically, disaster stories always start with the government holding the idiot ball.

Given all that, if you'd like to read stories about governmental responses to disasters, there are plenty of real-life examples. Of course, the most rational responses are the ones where there was no actual disaster, because of preparations made ahead of time. Unfortunately, it's a little harder to find information on that sort of scenario, because it's less newsworthy when nothing bad happens.
