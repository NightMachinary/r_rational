I think you are giving governments way too much credit.

Take a look at the handling of hurricanes in south eastern US.

This is an annual event -- these things happen ALL THE TIME. Yet these areas keep getting hit and the response is often dramatically insufficient, resulting in thousands of deaths and billions in property damage.

in terms of an outbreak, governments might step in once things get /really bad/ by closing airports or investing in vaccination research at the extreme, but mostly just put out advisory warnings and maybe do a bit of preventative sanitation or pest extermination controls.

I have a buddy who works in disaster simulation. He builds computer models of what might happen if terrorists poisoned the water supply, or shut down electricity in a metro area, or released a biohazard. It's not good. The incompetence of government response is mostly offset by the disorganization and incompetence of malicious agents. I mean, do you think the TSA is a rational and effective response to 9/11?

When the malicious agent is Nature, the gloves come off, and humanity usually gets clobbered.
