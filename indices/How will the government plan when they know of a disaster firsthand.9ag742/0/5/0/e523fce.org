I feel like that's less the fault of the government, and more the fault of the people who live in these regions for 1. living in these regions, and then 2. not voting in candidates who run on platforms about emergency-preparedness (i.e. increasing taxes to fund FEMA, the national guard, etc.) but rather voting in candidates who specifically /reduce/ the budgets of those organizations.

Also, things /have/ to get "really bad" before the government will be /supported/ in closing airports. People would riot if the government closed airports without a good (read: already far past good) reason.

  do you think the TSA is a rational and effective response to 9/11?

The TSA is good at catching spies. Terrorism is a cover-story. (If it was really about terrorism, the NEXUS program wouldn't exist.)
