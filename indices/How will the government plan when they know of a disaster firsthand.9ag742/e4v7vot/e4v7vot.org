This question is quite general. Governments have a wide variety of contingency plans, from battling epidemics to safeguarding VIPs to responding with military intervention to civil unrest or disasters. Not all of these plans have been, or can be, fully vetted. Most are not known to us. And, of course, disasters can happen that the government is utterly unprepared for. I'd come up with a more concrete scenario and then research that one specifically.
