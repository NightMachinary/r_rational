There are a couple kinds of pattern-match problems. One is 'sincere' where the generals write guides on how to fight the last war. This creates friction when the new war is different.

A more comedic problem comes when plans use fantastic names in a very non-literal way. The CDC 'Zombie Guide' wasn't really about Zombies. They're just using 'zombies' to introduce the general idea of disaster preparedness. Since the plan isn't actually intended to be about zombies (but about real-world threats) it omits stuff like 'motorcycle armor.'

I can see this coming up if the US wants to write plans about invading an allied or politically sensitive country.

You don't want to write "what if [Ally]'s religious minority grows in population, gets radicalized, and starts a low-grade insurgent warfare targeting major infrastructure projects?" because that document would be subject to FOIA, and is just not-impossible-enough that people would take real-world offense. At the same time, you want people thinking through real-world scenarios.

So, you'd do a find/replace, and put a fantasy gloss on the whole thing. Don't say "radicalized" we say "controlled by alien space bats." You don't say "internment camp" you say "space-bat decontamination facility." And then have a plan where people controlled by the alien-space-bats have exactly the combat capabilities, logistic and morale problems that would be faced by a partially-identifiable civilian insurgency in France.

This lets your staff think through a 'realistic' scenario, but means that you don't get hauled in front on congress to explain why you're invading an ally. And, the fantasy gloss -- insurgents have big space-bat hats, and not clothes identified with real-world culture -- means that whole operations would be less offensive to the participants.

The funny part comes when literal Space Bats invade. And then some Lt does the find, and gets reams of detailed counter-space-bat insurgency instructions, none of which are actually intended to be about Space Bats.
