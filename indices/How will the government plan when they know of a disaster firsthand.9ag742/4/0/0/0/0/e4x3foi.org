Only somewhat. The US's screwed-ness comes down to three factors:

1. Can existing democratic mechanisms impeach Trump? (i.e. blue midterms)
2. Assuming #1 succeeds, can the US make meaningful patches to the problems with democracy (e.g. FPTP), so that other countries can expect this problem to reasonably not happen in the future?
3. How much long-term damage will Trump do to the credibility of the USA? (note: this actually depends quite heavily on #1 - worst-case scenario would be if Trump was not only not impeached, but was /re-elected/ come 2020 - I basically expect the USA's overseas influence and mythos to basically die for good if that happens.)
