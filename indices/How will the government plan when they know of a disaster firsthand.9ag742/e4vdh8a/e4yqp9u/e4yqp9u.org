So Government response to disasters appears, historically, to be marred by efforts to make Government look not-bad, to the point where (Chernobyl, Fukushima) it hinders international coordination, and these efforts tend to engender conspirationism of all kinds. Efforts spent during or after the fact for evacuation, reestablishing control and rebuilding are diverted by widespread corruption fueled by the lessened scrutiny perceived by the actors (Katrina, Harvey, Haiti especially). This latter aspect would be the most narratively useful.
