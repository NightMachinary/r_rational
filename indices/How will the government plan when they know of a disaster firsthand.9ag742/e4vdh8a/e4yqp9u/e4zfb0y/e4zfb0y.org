#+end_quote

But what makes government look bad? Ineffective responses do. So they're incentivized to respond effectively.

(The Red Cross's [[https://www.propublica.org/series/red-cross][issues]] are a long story that are unique to non-government responders.)

Yes, corruption, confusion, and lack of established coordination are narratively useful for writing a disaster story. But don't forget the operators who have plans ahead of time, and are proceeding according to plan.
