The US federal agency called the Center for Disease Control regularly uses zombie outbreak scenarios for medical emergency disaster response drills. You should be able to find at least media coverage woth a quick Internet search. Because these drills are multi-agency, if you want the real nitty-gritty details you should be able to get a lot of paperwork from FOIA requests and from agency-published afteraction reports.

Beyond that specific example, you'd want to refer to published plans and historical records for hurricane, fire, earthquake, flood, and terrorism-driven evacuations of cities, suburbs, and rural areas. Particular places to start would include the graphic novel edition of the 9/11 Report, the one-year retrospectives of Hurricane Harvey, any historical study of Hurricane Katrina, of the Fukishima nuclear disaster, of the Haitian earthquake, of any Pacific tsunami in the last 20 years, of the refugee crisis in the Middle East and Europe, or of Puerto Rico after the 2017 hurricane season. That should cover a lot of the good and bad responses. Also read any of ProPublica's reporting on Red Cross failures.
