The place to start would be the [[https://www.gocivilairpatrol.com/programs/emergency-services/operations-support/national-incident-management-system-nims][National Incident Management System]].

This is how the US government organizes teams for response to wildland fires, military action, and natural disasters.

It's an excellent system. The basis is to get people who have an understanding of what resources are needed and how to get them on site as soon as possible and then get them ordering resources as smoothly as possible. It puts a lot of weight on logistics and operations in order to make sure everyone gets fed and has a place to sleep. On top of that things like daily briefings and after action reports keep things improving.

If there were any major crisis in the US, you can guarantee that is the system that ground teams would be working from.
