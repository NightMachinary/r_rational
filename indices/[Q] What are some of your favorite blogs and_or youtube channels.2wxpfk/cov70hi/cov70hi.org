[[https://www.youtube.com/user/everyframeapainting][Every Frame a Painting]] is one of my favorite Youtube channels, since it's a very in-depth look at storytelling, and since I love film.

[[https://www.youtube.com/user/WriteAboutDragons][Write About Dragons]] has all of Brandon Sanderson's Creative Writing classes, which I've found interesting (if a little 101) - doesn't update regularly though.

[[https://www.youtube.com/user/CGPGrey][CGP Grey]] has exceptionally well-produced videos about a variety of esoteric subjects.
