If you give Frodo a lightsaber you must give Sauron the Deathstar. So that wouldn't work. Like you said it would be boring.

Another alternative is that if you aren't connected to certain cards you won't be able to use them. Even if there's rules text on it, the rules text might be wrong or incomplete so the card won't work the way it says it will when you try to use it. Maybe the monster won't appear when you summon it, or it's effect is different than you thought.
