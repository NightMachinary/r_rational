I saw a movie by the guys who did The Gamers 2, which handled this pretty well (wish I could remember the title).

​

I would say, the first thing to do (rule 0 if you will) is make sure that YOU know all the rules. That is start with the rules and cards written out for your own reference, and any time you revise them go back and re-evaluate everything else you've written in light of the new revision.

​

Regarding the balance between telling the plan and suspense, the approach used in the movie and what I personally recommend is to have a widely recognized "best" deck archetype that your villains more or less all use because it's crazy OP (include some side characters with different stertegies for diversity), but your hero for reasons that are important to him refuses to just copy (it was because he was trying to get into the pants of a girl who wanted the OP decks taken down a peg in the movie, and would probably be related to it being his Grandfather's deck in YuGiOh). This gives you the uphill battle you want because the OP strategy beats everything, including with sufficiently good play and draws, the MC's deck.

​

Additionally, in the movie the hero's deck is composed of old cards that are now obscure/impractical to obtain, and no longer present in the meta. Because of that he is able to surprise the players who have the OP decks with moves and cards they didn't know about and thus weren't prepared for. As he advances that advantage naturally erodes as every trick he uses becomes well known and opponents modify their decks and play to deal with it eventually colluding and using the format of the tournament against him (a player loses but forces a permanent removal of a key card for the remainder of the tournament). The final showdown uses a strategy that was mentioned early on as impractical (in the movie it's activating the rarest of rare cards that requires you rip it up to activate, in YuGiOh I'm not sure but maybe Exodia) combined with a frequently used and fairly effective but a bit silly strategy (in the movie it's the "Largest Turnip" quest, no idea for YuGiOh). It's also good as his oponent (and presumably the audience) expect the card to return the force-removed card from earlier to play as that is what it's normal use is, which wouldn't have been sufficient to win, but instead it's used to buy one turn in which he accomplishes his win condition by choosing an unconventional target (it's a relic that has to power to raise the dead supposedly enough for 'an entire army', and he uses it on his opponents undead army wiping their side of the board).

​

Broadly speaking that should work Ok with Yugi using his grandfather's deck, which one would suppose being both an old guy and a game shop owner would have old and obscure cards.

​

Now, where the movie probably doesn't pass muster for rational is that the surprise ending involves a what sounds like applying the flavor text of the card rather than the rules of the card. But then again YuGiOg has "cannon turtle, target the stabilizer" so done right it could be an amusing homage to the canon... um turtle.
