Well, I was thinking more along the lines of using the rules to the /real/ game rather than the very creative way they're applied in the show's early seasons, so no cannon turtle trickery. Though your description made me think this is how it could play out in an hypothetical card game that has a heavier RPG component and is played with a GM who referees such decisions...

Anyway, thanks a lot for the suggestions! These sound like very good ideas, and now I'm interested in finding the movie as well...
