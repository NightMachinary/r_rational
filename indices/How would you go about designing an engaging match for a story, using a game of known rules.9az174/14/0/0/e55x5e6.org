Footnotes to the rescue!

Well, at least in ebook, or web series format. There you can link to an appendix or even the official card spoiler so the reader juts sees the card name which is a link they can use to see the whole card. In print it'd be harder to do well.

​

Though, it would probably also help to make heavy use of the "show the plan but the plan doesn't pan out" format of storytelling so the reader gets a refresher on what the highlights of the character's deck and how it's supposed to work before important matches. So they're trying to remember cards from the start of the chapter not 20 chapters ago for the main character's plays, and the oponent's plays can be explained in more detail as they're plot twists.
