I was kinda thinking about this with Pokemon. Conveniently, real world strategy guides very nicely tell you what the tiers are and how to use them (so you can even account for power / rarity ratios to some extent)

  On the other, the amount of possibilities for a YGO card game, considering that there's some leeway on how the contestants can build their deck, is immense.

Okay, but how many strategies does the real world Yu-Gi-Oh meta-game have? Winning strategies are all that really matter in a zero sum game.

Even very well designed games (e.g. Chess) which have an extreme diversity of play options generally coalesce into some well defined strategies.
