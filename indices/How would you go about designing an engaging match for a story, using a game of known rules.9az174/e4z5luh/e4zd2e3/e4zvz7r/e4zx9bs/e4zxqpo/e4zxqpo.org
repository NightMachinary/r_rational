Yeah, it's hard to justify stuff like Celtic Guardian. The only viable explanation is that at the start of the show Yugi just used his grandpa's deck and it was full of collectors items instead cards that were picked for usefulness. Later in the show Yugi still plays some questionable stuff but his deck gets far more synergistic and the basic low stat vanilla creatures are either gone or used for specific purposes.

One interesting option would be to have a magic system in the world in which cards literally evolved and got more powerful with use. That could explain starting with weak cards - you are working on leveling them up.
