I always wondered why the characters in the show would play blatantly suboptimal cards even despite their crazy draw skills. I'm not talking about the super specific tech cards that the protagonist draws at the perfect time. I'm referring to the cards like Celtic Guardian which can be easily switched out for cards with bigger stats or strictly better effects.

It would be interesting to see the odd card choices be rationalized as a means to magically stack their decks. Like decks with a consistent theme will draw better than decks that have 'stronger' off theme cards. So if the rational protagonist gets dropped into the Yugioh world and tries to game the system by playing meta decks, they brick every time and get bodied by incredibly unlikely combos.
