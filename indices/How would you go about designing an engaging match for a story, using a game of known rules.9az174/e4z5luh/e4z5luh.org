I've struggled with this too. Unfortunately it seems like the yugioh tcg is simply not rational. It's too much luck and relying on the heart of the cards and not enough skill. Furthermore there's no good reason why the game wouldn't be dominated by wealthy elites who can afford all the rare cards. I tried using a different game for an AU fanfic of yugioh, but I'm not sure how well it works.
