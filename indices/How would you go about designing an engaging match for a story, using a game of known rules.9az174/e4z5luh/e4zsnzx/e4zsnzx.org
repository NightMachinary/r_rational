While the anime is certaily not rational, there is no reason why the TCG couldn't be played in a rational and optimized manner. In fact, it is, and there are a lot of competitive and professional players that do it. It is, of course, vastly different than what is presented on the anime, because people actually build decks with plans in mind instead of just bunching together random monster cards and praying. The thing is that the rational thought that goes on a TGC game either are some pretty complex concepts, such as card advantage, tempo and value, or happens before the battle, at the moment you are building your deck.

Randomness doesn't precludes rationality. It is perfectly possible to play a random game rationally, because otherwise there wouldn't be poker tournments, and the top poker players wouldn't be able to consistently perform much better than the average player.
