I think an easier way of illustrating something like this might be some regular casino games, like Texas Hold'Em or Blackjack. Same concepts, with probabilities updated as the game advances and choices made based on these probabilities, but much simpler mechanics to follow (and you can in fact take the time to compute the probabilities exactly on your side, so you don't need to be a real life champion to get it perfect). And it avoids the problem someone else mentions, that writing about TCGs would be a pain (imagine having to describe someone's hand in detail...).

The fundamental problem with applying this to the YGO universe is that in that universe, games are magic. This means first that most of the times the stakes are /too/ ridiculously high to let the protagonist lose, and second, that the chance isn't really chance at all. Fate is at play at all times - in fact I think the best way to describe it would be something like placebomancy in "Unsong", with the Universe itself conspiring to help those who are most committed to the game ("believing in the Heart of the Cards" or such things). If one took this element in consideration, then the strategy of choice would be rather different - not necessarily the move that's most likely to succeed when drawing from an unbiased random deck, but the combination that's most spectacular and dramatic and thus likely to be aided by the cosmic forces that direct the game.
