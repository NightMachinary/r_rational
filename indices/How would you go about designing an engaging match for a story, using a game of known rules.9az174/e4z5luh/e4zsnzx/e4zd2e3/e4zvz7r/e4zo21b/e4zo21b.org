Lean into the perfect topdeck thing then? The main characters can all know that during important draw phases Yugi is going to topdeck what he needs. Yugi starts constructing decks to abuse that as much as possible, and everyone who plays against him tries to figure out ways to beat him that can't be stopped by a good top deck. I think those different approaches of how to best abuse heart of the cards, how to prevent that abuse, and what they start doing in response to each other would be interesting.

(Also, see [[http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Time_Seal][Time Seal]] or [[http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Yata-Garasu][Yata-Garasu]] for a couple of high value cards that completely shut down Yugi's blatant cheating.)
