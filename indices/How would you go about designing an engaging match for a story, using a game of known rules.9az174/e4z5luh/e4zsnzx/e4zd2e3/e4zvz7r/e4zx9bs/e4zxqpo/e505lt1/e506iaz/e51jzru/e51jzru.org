It'd probably make more sense if the standard format were some variation on Draft/Sealed where you had to play with a deck composed chiefly off cards you pulled from packs you juts bought. That's actually pretty common in TCG competitive scenes.

​

If you wanted to lean into the extreme rarity I'd recommend not juts changing the price but also the distribution model.

Real world TCGs guarantee you a rare card in every pack, for there to only be 4 Blue Eyes in print they have to have to either have a lot more distinct rare cards, have a lot of packs that ship without a rare card or have uneven distribution of cards among rarity tiers.

If Duel Monsters packs are just 15 cards completely at random from a set of ~400 or so distinct cards with twice as many copies of every common as any uncommon, and twice as many copies of every uncommon as the most common rare, and rare cards potentially having as few as 1 copy per print run, you'd get a very different distribution of cards.

​

edit:

Also further evidence for increased rarity of cards in the YuGiOh world is that nobody has multiple decks.
