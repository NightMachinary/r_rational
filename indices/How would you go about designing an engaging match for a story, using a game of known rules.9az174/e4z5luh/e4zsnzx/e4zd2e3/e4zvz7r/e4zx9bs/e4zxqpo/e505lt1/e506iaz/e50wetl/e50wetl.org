Well, Yugi won the Duelist Island tournament, there was bound to be some tournament prize money (beyond the restitution of one's loved ones trapped souls). Anyway, yeah, we wouldn't be here talking about this if YGO /was/ very rational... but that cards are generally rarer for them is indisputable. Beyond the case of the Blue Eyes, consider how much fuss is made during the Duel City tournament about winning ante cards that are relatively trivial (seriously, what's so great about Red Eyes Black Dragon? Or what /was/, before they included in the game an enormous bunch of synergies that made the Red Eyes deck viable?).
