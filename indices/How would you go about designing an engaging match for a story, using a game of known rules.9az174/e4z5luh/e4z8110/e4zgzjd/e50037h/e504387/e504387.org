Oh, I read Liar Game, I know it. But the (additional) difficulty with the card game is that it's well established, but the set of possible cards is really immense, which makes it a bit daunting to consider all interactions. In this case I'd also be interested in specific practical advice. I'm actually even wondering whether there are dedicated tools/software for this specific problem (CCG), maybe used by players to simulate different situations or re-examine past games.
