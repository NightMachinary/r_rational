I only have a passing knoledge of YGO, being a MTG player myself, but I would say that it's really hard to write rational fiction about them TCGs.

​I think Brandon Sanderson's First Law of Magic applies: *An author's ability to solve conflict with magic is DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL to how well the reader understands said magic.* So if you want a game in universe to feel engaging, you need to explain the rules of the game to the audience, because otherwise, they can't get why the genius play is supposed to be clever. The main problem being that It's very hard to completely teach a interesting game system without being monotonous. It can be done, Hikaru no Go did it with Go, and Akagi did it With Mahjong, but it's rare to see it well done.

For TCG I think it's even harder, because most of the decision made in a TCG game in real life are made days to weeks before the big championship. They are made when you are building your deck, and the gameplay changes completely depending on your deck. An aggro v Aggro matchup plays under strictly different rules than an Control x Combo matchup, and the viewer has to be educated in both.

Edit:

As for the story itself, you could simply write a story in which a RL person is transported to YGO world and wins everything by not being dumb and understanding basic deckbuilding and card advantage, but that would get boring fast. You could also rewrite the complete universe, and actually play through the matches, maybe rebuilding all decks in the show so they aren't, you know, horrible, and actually play matches using proxies to determine who wins, but that would require extraordinary deckbuilding skills from you, which I assume you don't have because otherwise you would be too busy being a pro player to be able to write this. But then, somebody is bound to get a tournment-level deck, and faceroll over the opposition. Or maybe you can rewrite the story so characters all use actual real life tournment-level decks of each era and update the decks accordingly as the expansions are released in universe.
