I'd look for plays by play of professional games. A non-expert player can explain the match but miss a certain part of the eventual winner's strategy. That might work for a few matches.

That said, the premise would likely work a lot better focusing on the preparation aspects of the game. The match isn't a good place to build and then release tension but to resolve the tension built previously. " Is this new strategy going to work against whatever the opponent came up with" and so on.
