Problem is, YGO is way more messy than Chess. Chess is complexity arising from simplicity. YGO is complexity arising from... even more complexity, if anything. The only way I see this being viable is excluding at least all the most recent additions (like Pendulum monsters, XYZ monsters, and so on) which makes sense since we're talking a Duel City setting, and focusing on the original card set. At which point, yeah, there's a number of fixed strategies in the meta I guess. I played Duel Links a lot - it's not exactly following the rules of the tabletop game so that changes the meta too - and there were a few prevalent decks. Cyber Angels was annoying as heck, but it includes mostly GX cards, so let's put that aside too. There was one deck that was played mostly with Weevil, but would fit any villain, including Marik, because it was just annoying as heck (it relied on preventing the opponent from attacking altogether and just draining their life points, with the cherry on top being Lava Golem). Bamboo Sword was so annoying they had to limit some of the cards involved.

I suppose one could pick the three core monsters for each player - Dark Magician for Yugi, Blue Eyes White Dragon for Seto, and Lava Golem for Marik - then build a deck and strategy around each of them, and see how they interact. That would restrict the space of possibilities significantly.
