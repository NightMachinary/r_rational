This is basically what I came here to say. OP especially watch that video please. I would love to see a rational rewrite of Yugioh that focuses way more on the deckbuilding and matchup analysis instead of on the "destiny draw" and scripted duels part. You could even foreshadow critical moments by having the protagonist consider "how would I beat an aggro opponent?" for example and put cards in their deck for certain situations then many chapters later have those cards get drawn at the right time.
