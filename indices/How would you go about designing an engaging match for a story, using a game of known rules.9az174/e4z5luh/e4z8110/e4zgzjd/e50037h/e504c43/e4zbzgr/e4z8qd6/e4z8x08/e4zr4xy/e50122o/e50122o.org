It would have to look more like a sports manga than a card-game manga. In the real world being good at a TCG means studying the metagame and practicing different matchups. Actual unexpected moments in play would be rare, like end-of-an-arc big deals, but that just makes it more rewarding when they happen. Look up some of the most iconic plays from real-life tournaments and put those in.
