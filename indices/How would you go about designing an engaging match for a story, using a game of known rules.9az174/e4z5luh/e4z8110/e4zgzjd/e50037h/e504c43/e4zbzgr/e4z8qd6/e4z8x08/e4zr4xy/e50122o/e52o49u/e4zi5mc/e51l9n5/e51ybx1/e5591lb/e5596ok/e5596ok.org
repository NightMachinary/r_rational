I was thinking I could actually write down cards and effects as they come up. Though that makes for a weird, janky kind of read... example:

--------------

Seto drew a card, then he declared "I'll play a spell card - Pot of Greed!"

*Pot of Greed*\\
/Allows the player to draw two cards/

--------------

...not great prose by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, quite terrible one.
