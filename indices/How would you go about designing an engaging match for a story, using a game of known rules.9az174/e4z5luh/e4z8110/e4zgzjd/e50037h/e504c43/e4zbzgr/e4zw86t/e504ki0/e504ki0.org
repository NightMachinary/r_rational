To be fair, what I had in mind for now was a more shorter and smaller in breath than this, with only two-three key duels, since I'm already involved in writing a rather long fanfiction (The Optimised Wish Project). I'm just speculating. I would really love to read something like you describe, I just doubt I could possibly have the strength to write it, because it would take a ton of thinking and planning, and I don't even own physical YGO cards (which would be a very useful thing to have to plan this stuff, just because they're easier to think with than description on the Wikia).
