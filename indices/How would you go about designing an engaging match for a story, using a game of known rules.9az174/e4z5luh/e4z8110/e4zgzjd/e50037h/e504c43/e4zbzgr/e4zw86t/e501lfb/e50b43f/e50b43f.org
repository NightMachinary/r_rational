It could work if the author wanted to descontruct the series and teach actual YGO to the readers. Think a Uplift story, except instead of tech, the guy would be upstrateging. I do agree that it would get repetitive early, that's why I made some more suggestions.

I reall don't like the idea of restricting card use. This heart of the cards stuff is stupid and should be done away with as fast as humanly possible. But then again I love playing TCS and I have a pet peeve with the infantilization done to them in the series.
