Look at Liar Game (find the manga somewhere). It's an example of /actually doing this,/ (though not in a TCG context) over and over.

The issue is that the audience has to intuitively understand the rules and their application before they can be used in the story. So either the rules have to be simple (Liar Game's games are all simpler than yugioh), the story has to educate the reader over the course of it (in Liar Game, the first thing the reader sees is always characters trying easy-to-understand strategies, complexity is only introduced gradually), or the readers have to be experts.
