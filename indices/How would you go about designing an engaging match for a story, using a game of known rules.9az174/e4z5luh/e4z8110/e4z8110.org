Hikaru no go uses real matches of go, so that is very possible.

Another option would be pretty role play heavy, in that you could have two people emulate the play styles and play with the decks, doing it a couple times until you got one you liked.

Hell, if you wanted to make it rational a big help would be having a spoiler/expanded post that lets you know what is in the MC's deck before hand, which would allow for there to be drama in what you are fighting, without there being a magical ex machina in what you top deck.

Having there be a subtle metaphysical force dictating what cards exist/don't exist (The maker of the cards would have a compulsion of some sort), and there rarity, plus adding in MC's like of a stable financial situation to just buy what he wants, means some additional plausibility. The publicly acknowledged values of the card keeps the market from being flooded.

Some times you should have the player make the less optimal move, because the optimal move requires top decking something and they can't count on that, just to have them top deck it anyway.
