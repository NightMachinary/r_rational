Oh, that would not be a problem for me - my idea would very much focus on the idea of 'destiny' and the fated Yugi-Seto-Marik trio. I think plot convenience re: card draws is /literally a force of nature/ in-universe, within a certain logic. So that's not an issue, but however predestined, these duels should still feel engaging and clever.
