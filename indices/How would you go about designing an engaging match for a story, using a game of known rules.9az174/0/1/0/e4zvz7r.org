If the characters know that they have the power to draw whatever card they need, you could have interesting rational set-ups. If I could always stack my deck, I would build it completely differently than for a random draw. You don't have to worry about consistency. You can play an oversized deck with 1 of each card and have weird overly specific answers to certain situations and "tech" cards built in. You as the author probably need to introduce a maximum deck size and have characters plan out their matchups and consider deck building constraints and what answer cards they can use in addition to their core strategy and win conditions. Plus, Yugioh with deck stacking would definitely be an all combo deck format. That's not necessarily uninteresting though when the opponents also have magic card draw powers and can draw things like D.D. Crow on command to answer the combos. Cards like Jar of Greed could be interesting and useful because they let you get the specific answer card you need at instant speed to be flexible in what you are countering.

The other thing I would heavily rely on is the collection aspect. Don't let characters just buy any cards they want. Make most win condition type cards be truly unique and one of a kind. Show the main characters buying and acquiring cards over time and changing their strategy based on their growing collection. Maybe Kaiba doesn't have magic fated card draw powers but his insane collection lets him compete anyway - that would be an interesting juxtaposition.

Another interesting way to build this would be an inversion. Run the universe as it works in the show with the same characters and decks and magic card drawing. Make the protagonist be a random guy who doesn't have magic card draw powers but actually knows how to build a powerful and consistent deck - basically a real pro from our world. Show the struggles he has to face to beat what are effectively cheaters and how he overcomes that with real world skill. This would be a little less of a rationalist fic and a little more of "rational protagonist breaks the world" fic but it would still be superfun for a short to medium story. Maybe do it as an isekai if you don't consider that genre too overwrought.
