The presence of those cards could also be justified if, simply, cards are much more scarce/expensive than they are in our world. If buying enough boosters to find one Gemini Elf or Vorse Raider is so expensive that only one Seto Kaiba could possibly afford it (after all, there were only four copies of Blue Eyes White Dragon in the YGO world - whereas there are thousands in ours), then someone might use Celtic Guardian simply because that's the best they have, and they need a passable LV4 frontliner. Even if it's just a plain old Normal Monster with 1400 ATK.
