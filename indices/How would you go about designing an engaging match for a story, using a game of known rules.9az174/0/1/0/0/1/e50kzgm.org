Maybe playing worse cards could be a form of karmic payment for getting better ones. If you always play the best card you are dealt, the heart of the cards gives you crappy ones when you really need it to count. If you trust in the heart of the cards, and play bad cards when you are dealt them, you balance the scales to get the good draws when they count. At the far end, when you flagrantly mock the heart of the cards, you start drawing shitty cards that you never even included in your deck.
