The random aspect of TCGs actually provides a lot of great opportunities to teach lessons in applied rationality, especially when it comes to identifying cognitive biases. For example, Magic players often talk about the importance of avoiding "results oriented thinking" (which is a common enough term in Magic for some players to abbreviate as "R.O.T."). The basic idea is that you shouldn't judge the correctness of a decision based on its results.

This seems like a counter-intuitive idea at first, but consider this example: I offer you a deal. I'm going to flip a coin three times. If any of the flips come up heads, I'll give you a dollar. If all three come up tails, you have to give me a dollar. Should you take the bet? Basic probability says you have a 87.5% chance of winning a dollar, and a 12.5% chance of losing a dollar. That's pretty good expected value! But, what if you take the bet, I flip the coin, and then all three flips come up tails? Are you going to say, "Agh, I made the wrong decision"? Well, no. Maybe you might /feel/ that way, but you were still right to take the bet, and the rightness of that decision is true /irrespective of the actual outcome of the coinflips./

This comes up in any game where you have variance, because what card you (or your opponent) is going to draw next is random in the same way that coin flips or dice rolls are. Sometimes, you can make all the right decisions and still lose to variance, and you need to realize that you shouldn't retroactively appraise all of your "correct" decisions as wrong just because you lost the game, and by the same token you can't say, "Well, I won the game, so that means my decision-making was correct." (The latter would be analogous to someone who says, "People say I was dumb for choosing to play Russian Roulette since I had a 1/6 chance of maiming myself, but the chamber was empty, so my choice to play Russian Roulette is thoroughly vindicated!")

Another example of a lesson on rationality that can be well illustrated with card games is aiming yourself at a probabilistically "bad" place when you're at an even worse place. For example, imagine the hypothetical example of a card with an ability that reads: "Flip two coins. If both are heads, you win the game. If either is tails, you lose the game." That seems like a pretty bad effect! If you use that effect at the start of the match, you've effectively reduced your win% from ~50% to 25%. But what if you find yourself in a losing game and you're in a situation where you're 10% favored to win? Suddenly, bumping your 10% chance to win up to 25% actually seems really appealing! The issue is, taking that line can sometimes be scary, because oftentimes taking action means accelerating yourself toward the outcome, which you presume is negative. Some people look at two options, one of which is a 90% of losing 5 turns in the future due to attrition (and a 10% chance to draw the card that they need before they slowly bleed out), and one of which has a 75% chance to lose instantly (but a 25% chance to win instantly), and they'll pick the "death by attrition" route because the idea of losing the game instantly is so scary that they'd rather slowly bleed out than make a decision that instantly results in them losing the game. A loss is a loss, but some losses can feel worse than others, and there are some people play to avoid the "feelbads" more than they play to actually minimize their chances of losing.

I've actually thought for awhile about using a TCG ratfic to teach about these kinds of cognitive biases, specifically using the approach of treating each match as an Aesop that presents a simplified view of events such that readers can reasonably calculate the odds of certain play patterns. (One of the things that can make card games kind of opaque is that the sheer number of variables in play rarely makes things as simple as "doing this play gives me a 55% chance to win, while this other play gives me a 60% chance to win, so I should choose the latter," and if you watch a lot of commentary by pro magic players, a lot of it comes down to explaining why one choice is marginally better than another. But in the context of fiction, you can reduce the number of variables and tailor events specifically to make important outcomes based on calculations that the characters -- and readers -- would be able to make.)

The challenge of writing a fic based around explaining these lessons comes from the fact that if you're trying to illustrate the Aesop "it's possible to make all the right decisions and still lose to variance" can be incredibly narratively unfulfilling if you illustrate it by having your protagonist constantly making all the right decisions and then losing the tournament. I think the solution is to give the story another set of stakes, so that the outcome is something like "Lost the tournament, but won the respect of their rival" or something like that. (Honestly this is a challenge that seems more difficult on paper than it probably is in practice, just based on my own experience: I lose Magic tournaments all the time but it doesn't significantly diminish my enjoyment of the game. I went 3-3 at an RPTQ last weekend but I didn't leave the venue feeling "defeated," on the contrary, I felt good about having managed to win 3 matches against people who were good enough to have qualified for a RPTQ.)
