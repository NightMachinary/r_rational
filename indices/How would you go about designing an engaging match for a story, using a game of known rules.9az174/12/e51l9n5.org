If you're writing in that universe, games are more-or-less decided before they start based upon the narrative weight and faith of the characters. It's not unlike Practical Guide in that evil can't win in the long run. You could use the games as a backdrop upon which a meta-conflict is fought, deciding who can win the binding magical games before and during them.
