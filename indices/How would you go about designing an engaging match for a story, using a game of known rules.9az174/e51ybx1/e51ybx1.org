For a rational yugioh fanfic, where /both/ parties are rational, I would suggest having the rationality expressed in the deckbuilding phaee (strategies and counterstrategies, trying to determine an opponent's card pool, espionage and false clues), via bluffing and interactive strategies during play (think goat control-- you know the opponent has a mirror force in their deck. But do they have it /now/?), and via side decking (carefully displaying a strategy that your opponent will counter, that you then turn around and turn into something completely different on match 2,eaving your opponent unsure what to do for match 3.)
