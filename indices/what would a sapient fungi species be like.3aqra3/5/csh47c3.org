Nervous systems evolve to react to things. (Apparently, there are jellyfish that independently evolved them, so we do know that much.) /Intelligence/, of the kind that eventually becomes what we call sapience, seems to evolve as a result of complicated intra-species social interaction and conflict.

So if sapient fungi evolved, it would probably be because they had spent billions of years in an environment with no animals, some species had expanded to fill that niche and developed nervous systems useful for moving around, and eventually some of those species developed complex social behaviors (like primates, elephants, dolphins, some birds...)

I'd guess they'd be recognisably /animal/, in some sense, probably even with vaguely-recognisable eyes, skin, and bony (woody?) limbs. Although for all I know they'd be small enough, or have a different enough environment, to have developed from exoskeletal creatures and ave their limbs work on entirely different principles to ours.

Certainly, their blood, bones, stomachs etc would be very different if you looked closely; but in practice, beyond the question of diet, probably functionally very similar.

However! The Flood from Halo suggest another possible path to fungal intelligence. Fungi often infect animals, even intelligent ones; and some of them are capable of altering their brains to pursue goals more useful to the fungus (often drastically so), or of coexisting with the host as long-term parasites. (Though I've never actually heard of both happening at same time, and definitely not in humans, it /is/ possible.)

If they existed /right now/, then a sapient fungal species would probably be vampires or werewolves.
