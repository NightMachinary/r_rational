No, no they definitely don't have central nervous systems. In some ways they're simpler than plants but they have a different set of behavior. I'd look at what's unique about fungi and move from there. The mycelium, the non-fruiting body of the fungi, can grow to be quite huge. In fact, [[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/strange-but-true-largest-organism-is-fungus/][the largest organism in the world is a fungus]]. There was an excellent X-Files episode with several mile large fungus luring people to their deaths and consuming them for nutrients.

Also interesting are the cordyceps species that hijack insect brains. An interesting take would be a similar parasitic species that actually parlays the intelligence of its host for its own purposes.
