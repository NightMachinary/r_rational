I had a theory a while back that Pandora, from Avatar, /was/ a sentient fungus. Essentially, the glowing bits in every single living thing on Pandora are part of a mycorrhizal network which acts as a massive neural structure regulating all life on the moon in order to rapidly react to sudden shifts in the radiation belts which inevitably exist around the blue gas giant Pandora orbits.
