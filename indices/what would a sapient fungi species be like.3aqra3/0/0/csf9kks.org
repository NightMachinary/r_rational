It might make sense for the spores themselves to have some sort of intelligence- if only a distributed, hive-mind kind of intelligence- in order to find somewhere to germinate more quickly than competitors.

You could imagine a desert setting where plants and animals were very large and rich in energy, but also few and far between- maybe even separated by dangerous weather- requiring spores to do more than drift on the wind to efficiently find the valuable dead matter.

Such a fungal intelligence would have vastly different motivations from those of animals. The primary motivation would be germination, not self-propagation and family. If the intelligence arose from a distributed processing of millions of spores, personal identity might be extremely fluid, and certain memories might be very old.

Maybe they could use tools and engage in agriculture by forming the spores into complicated structures, like swarms of nano-machines. A civilization built by such beings likely wouldn't have recognizable buildings or vehicles, though they'd build structures to protect the fungal growths from the weather and might construct machines of some sort for transporting spores (pipes and pumps?). With enough spore density, most of the planet might become one very intelligent mind, though with only a theoretical understanding of war and compromise.

Upon encountering humans, both sides would find the other very easy to lie to. Humans would have an initial large advantage both militarily and diplomatically due to past experience, though with greater intelligence, the fungal civilization might quickly catch up. Transhumans or post-humans could find more common ground.
