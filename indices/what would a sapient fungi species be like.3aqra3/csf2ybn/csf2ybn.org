The Flood exist in two basic forms. The first is basically just a fast-moving zombie in a few varieties, which is nothing new or interesting (and essentially mindless). The second is the Gravemind, their leader, which is more or less human in terms of thinking. Its goal is to consume all life in the galaxy, and it uses intelligence to do that. It also speaks in an odd meter to seem more "alien", but its way of thinking isn't actually that strange.

As for fungal species more generally ... I think the interesting mode of cognition would be having a diffuse locus of consciousness. Fungal colonies can stretch over several square miles, and might do its thinking in slow, iterative hops that incorporate a lot of multi-tasking. It observes something at one end of its being, and that stimulus propagates slowly by human standards as it travels miles across the organism.
