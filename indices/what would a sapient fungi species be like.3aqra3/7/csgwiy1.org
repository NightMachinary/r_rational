Well, if you killed off everything that wasn't fungi you could have fungi become the base lifeform on earth, basically a step above primordial soup. From there you'd need to give it a somewhere between a few hundred million years and a few billion and cross your fingers. After all that time you'd probably end up with something that looks a lot like life as we know it, but with a rather different internal cellular structure and that would probably count as fungi maybe.
