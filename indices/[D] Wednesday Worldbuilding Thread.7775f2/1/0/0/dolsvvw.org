The reason why the exhumans gave up on assimilation was because the humans they were fighting saw the uploading process as killing people to create more AIs. They were entirely willing to fight to the death in order to preserve biological humanity. So the exhumans decided that being more friendly to the humans and encouraging them to upload willingly would put fewer lives at risk.

The acolytes are humans who are gradually coming around to the idea of uploading as they integrate with technology more over their lives. Everyone else has the option of joining the acolytes whenever they want, similar to joining a religion, but don't trust the exhumans to have their interests at heart. Unless the exhumans want another war, they'll try to foster that trust however they can.

The insurgents do want another war and see the rest of the exhumans as fools for accommodating humans who reject their gifts. I thought about it some more and decided the inciting incident was a terror attack on a colony ship that would carry both humans and exhumans to the stars, since the insurgents see humans as a burden unworthy of sharing their empire.
