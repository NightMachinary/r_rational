To my understanding, J.R.R. Tolkien set the events of his legendarium in a â€˜mythological past', an imaginary period in our Earth's prehistory. I've been thinking about the historical constraints of this idea: Epic stories set in the prehistoric past of Our World, with the prehistoric setting being the reason why the events, no matter how stupendous, do not conflict with Our Historical Record.

Obviously, these stories need to take place before the invention or arrival of writing in the given region. However:

- A) There's the matter of how long the events would be preserved after the fact in the oral tradition before fading or becoming unrecognizable. If they are preserved too long, then the stupendous events could potentially become codified and thus conflict with Our Historical Record.

- B) The invention / arrival of writing in different regions at different times means that some of these stories could take place more recently than others, so long as they're set in illiterate areas. But how much separation would be needed so that knowledge of stupendous events was not carried by word-of-mouth from illiterate to literate areas?

- C) How much consideration should be given to the various forms of proto-writing (pictograms, petroglyphs, cave art) as constraints?

I realize this would depend on just how stupendous the events are. Personally, I'm thinking of some moderate shonen / superhero shenanigans -- cool fights with cool powers, but no catastrophic changes in landscape -- but it'd be cool to speculate on how it works for stories at different power scales too.
