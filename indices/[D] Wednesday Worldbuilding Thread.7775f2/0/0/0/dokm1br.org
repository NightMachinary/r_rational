Fascinating! Although, the article also conveys that the Australian Aboriginal system described appears to be exceptional amongst oral traditions. For oral traditions elsewhere, 10 kyr seems a bit extreme to me, currently. Dragons and mythological beasties would certainly be more robust, but the idea of them is already recorded in our world's mythology, alongside various gods and heroes. Thus, so long as enough time passes for an account of dragons to become believably diluted/distorted, and the event parallels a known myth in a broad stroke, I would not consider that as much of a conflict.

I think a better word choice for my original post might have been "diluted" or "distorted", instead of "unrecognizable"...

Also, the supposed cap of 800 years for oral tradition was also new information to me. Thank you!
