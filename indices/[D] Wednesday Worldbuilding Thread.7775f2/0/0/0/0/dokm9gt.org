The other thing is, I guess you could say, cultural egotism: when europeans first came to Australia they dismissed the stories of people living out in the barrier reef as mythological stuff rather than a "true" account.

And I mean, the Aboriginal mythology also includes the Dreamtime where the Wagul slithered on the earth and everything his belly touched turned into a river. (I wonder if they are "marked" differently? Like, are the stories of people hunting in what is now the ocean "my father's father all the way back did this" and the Dreamtime stories "this happened long before anyone we know was born"?)
