  A) There's the matter of how long the events would be preserved after the fact in the oral tradition before fading or becoming unrecognizable. If they are preserved too long, then the stupendous events could potentially become codified and thus conflict with Our Historical Record.

[[https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/sep/16/indigenous-australian-storytelling-records-sea-level-rises-over-millenia][Australian Aboriginal oral histories]] have preserved memory of sea level rises that happened 7-18,000 years ago, so you're looking at /at least/ 10,000 years as a lower bound since dragons and other mythological beasties will probably be even more robust in the oral tradition.
