Depending exactly /how/ epic your fights are, you can make catastrophic changes in the landscape if you want... as long as the /resultant/ landscape fits the modern one. (Put a mountain in prehistory where there isn't a mountain now, and it will end up getting blown up... perhaps a few large meteor impact craters can have different origins...)

Also, if you're making mythological-past fiction, then Atlantis might be an interesting place in which to set it...
