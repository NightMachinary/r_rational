If you're doing a supernatural story, then couldn't you have a pretty advanced society in the prehistoric past, complete with writing, but simply design your magic system in such a way that it could remove all traces of the society? Like if, say, the society runs entirely on magic instead of technology, and anything magical must be owned by a specific mage, and when a mage dies all magic they own dies with them? So we can presume that the society left no records behind because something drove them to extinction, and all of their records died with them.
