I've come up with a sci-fi setting inspired by the rpg actual play podcast [[https://soundcloud.com/greg-stolze/termination-shock-1-frasier-crane-and-the-spiders-from-marshttps://soundcloud.com/greg-stolze/termination-shock-1-frasier-crane-and-the-spiders-from-mars][TERMINATION SHOCK]], which I recommend as a fun and imaginative dramedy. If the first episode's title “Fraiser Crane and the Spiders from Mars” interests you at all, you'll probably have a good time.

When humans developed the technology to destructively upload consciousness into computers, people were understandably apprehensive about the implications. However, the uploads, calling themselves exhumans, decided that sharing the gift of immortality took priority over all else so they decided to forcibly upload everyone. Naturally, things did not go as well as they hoped.

Global war broke out and millions of humans fled to colonies on Mars, where they banned nearly all Information Age tech out of fear of subversion and assimilation. Eventually the exhumans concluded that more lives were being lost than saved, so they agreed to a peace deal where the rest of humanity would retain self determination and gain limited access to their advanced technology.

Mars soon decriminalized banned technology, though it remains illegal to jailbreak devices like 3-d printers or genome sequencers, and received aid in the form of spaceships from the exhumans to mine and patrol the asteroid belt. However, it maintained a reputation as the ghetto of the solar system due to high crime rates and low economic output.

A new colonization program began on Venus where people could establish independent city-states on floating artificial islands, which were quickly bought up by the wealthiest humans for themselves, their companies, or social experiments. Eventually, the exhumans couldn't stand for the exploitation any longer and began annexing islands, which led to many people turning to a life of piracy or mercenary work.

It has been 50 years since the First Posthuman War ended. The humans who remained on Earth to rebuild gradually became more like the exhumans, coming to be known as their acolytes who are encouraged to accept cybernetic implants. Many exhumans traveled to the gas giants to mine hydrogen fuel for interstellar exploration, but in their isolation a armed insurgency formed who refused to share the stars with mortals and a new war has begun.
