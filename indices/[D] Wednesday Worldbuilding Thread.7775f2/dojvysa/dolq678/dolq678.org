The exhumans seem short-sighted here. If they don't upload all the humans and don't prevent the humans from reproducing, then eventually more humans will die (of old age) than would have died in the war. They should throw rocks at the Martian refugees until the humans give up or, at the very least, use economic pressure (and /not/ help the Martians).

Also, what the heck did the exhumans get out of the peace deal? The way you described it the exhumans had the upper hand and then just...gave concessions to the losing side. Not only did they agree to let the humans be free, but they have their tech to the humans. Whaaaat?
