The very basics of it is probably:

Technology is a lot more interrelated than people think. Kishimoto wants radios and TVs but no guns, etc, even though it's pretty hard to have a scientific community that has figured out CRTs, EM radiation, and AC power but not gunpowder. This is in the same sense that it's hard to have a scientific community that has figured out microelectronics without understanding electricity. A lot of science, particularly chemistry, materials science, physics, and engineering, is really interrelated and builds on itself.

Naruto has cell phones, computers, TVs, and, hilariously, satellites. Gunpowder (and combustion engines, and transistors...) clearly must exist, if not because of the microelectronics, at least because of the satellites that were launched into orbit using technology which PROBABLY involved complex understanding of chemistry, combustion, aerodynamics, materials science... But, gunpowder doesn't exist in the anime somehow. This is just handwaved away by Kishimoto.

This is fine if your goal is to create some anime that's just about fighting and ninja techniques and not worry about that stuff. It's not the point of the anime. But if you explicitly decide to write a Naruto fanfic with coherent technological worldbuilding, you need to address this somehow. An AU with lower tech levels is one way to do it, and pretty simple. I would just go with that and not worry about it.
