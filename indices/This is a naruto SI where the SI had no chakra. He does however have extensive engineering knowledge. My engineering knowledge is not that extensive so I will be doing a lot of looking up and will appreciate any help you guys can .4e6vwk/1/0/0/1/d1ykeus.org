I think maybe they can explain it the same way Avatar: the Legend of Korra does and use chakra explanations for why they have that technology. Maybe there're summons or spirits taking care of the components in the satellites and transmitting signals, maybe they use some kind of magical connection to transmit data and the cellphones casing are just a convenient way to carry the seals.

Maybe the satellites were propelled to space using some jutsu to launch them and keep them there (although how they would understand gravity enough to know they'll remain in the atmosphere escapes me).

As you said there's plenty to criticize in Naruto and lots of things don't add up.
