Why would ninja ever use gunpowder when they can throw kunai faster than bullets? When they could probably get shot by bullets or hit by explosions (ninja survive fireballs, massive blunt force impact, getting hit into and through trees and walls, etc.) And survive.

Nuclear weapons, true, are a game changer and lethal for all ninja but some s-rank, but modern day bombs and bullets don't seem too valuable.
