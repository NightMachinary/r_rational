Samurai don't use ninjutsu (they just channel it into swords) but given that they can keep up with super humanly fast and strong and durable ninja, can obviously use chakra to reinforce themselves.

I agree Naruto is somewhat inconsistent, but its power levels are somewhat more consistent than Kishimoto is usually given credit for. Looked at carefully, for instance, Part 1 has some hilarious feats even for genin-- Naruto taking down the giant snake, Sasuke's fireballs, Lee's speed, Gaara's large scale attacks, etc.
