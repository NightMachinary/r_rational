I don't understand how you're using examples of genins having inconsistent power levels to justify that Kishimoto's power leveling is consistent.

I agree that he isn't nearly as bad as other series, he generally gives age/experience the credit it deserves, at least in Part 1. But the power creep after that was nothing short of erroneous at best

Naruto's power leveling made lots of sense to me in part 1. I think Kishi did a great job there. But Shippuden threw a lot of that straight out of the window, especially towards the latter parts. Training and experience was exchanged for crazy ass powers/bloodlines/bijuu transformations. And one thing in particular that sticks in my craw is Sasukes chakra capacity. It's made clear time and time again that mangekyo techniques are very expensive yet Sasuke will spam and spam them away without a care in the world. He'll match Naruto's chakra output time and again, a ninja with a built in nigh-infinite chakra battery. What the Hell +Hero+ Kishimoto!
