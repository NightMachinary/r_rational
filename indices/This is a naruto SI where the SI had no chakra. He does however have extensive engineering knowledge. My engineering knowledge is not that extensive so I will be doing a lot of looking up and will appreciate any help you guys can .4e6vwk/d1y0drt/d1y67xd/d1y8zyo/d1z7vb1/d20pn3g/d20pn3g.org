Ninja can't throw kunai faster than bullets. Most ninja anyway (I'm specifically thinking about the Raikage here, since he claims his speed is practically on par with lightning). The force required to throw a kunai like that would easily dislocate/break/tear off your arm. (The average bullet travels about 1700mph)

Modern day bullets are a game changer for the same reason real guns were. They allowed armies to form up much easier and much more reliably. It took someone of skill and proper build years to learn how to properly utilize a sword and a shield. It would take much less time for someone to get passably good with a gun. Which would give them range, meaning they had an advantage over non-gun wielding armies. The samurai don't utilize chakra in and of themselves, but are a potent neutral force in the Naruto world, showing that it's possible to stand back against the chakra wielders with proper innovation and preparation. Hence guns.

Modern day bombs, I can agree that most ninja seem fast enough to make them trivial. They'd detect the trap, or hear the trigger for it, or a thousand and one other things. They'd see the grenade and /move/. So, in battle, bombs probably aren't all that useful.

Gunpowder is also necessary for things like designing rockets and whatnot. It's a building block towards more advanced forms of combustion (?) technology.

But to be completely honest, this is all the most conjecture and bullshit. Since we see ninjas (properly powerful ones) survive things that should mean a knife is meaningless against them but oh well *ANIME MAGIC AHOY!*

TL;DR: Naruto =/= logically consistent. [[https://openclipart.org/image/2400px/svg_to_png/130795/Trollface.png][Problem?]]
