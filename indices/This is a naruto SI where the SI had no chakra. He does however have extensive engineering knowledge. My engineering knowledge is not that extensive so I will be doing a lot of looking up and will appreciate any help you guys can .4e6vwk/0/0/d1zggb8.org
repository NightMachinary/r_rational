Without chakra, though, the SI will never actually possess enough personal power to be a threat on there own.

Yes, if any of the ninja villages felt like it, they could kill the insert with a literal flick of a finger. But why would they want waste something as valuable as a skilled engineer, when they could steal the insert instead? The same lack of personal power that makes them easy to kill makes them easy (though admittedly not to the same degree) to hold captive, and while the OP has clarified in-thread that the insert's chakra-less nature makes them basically immune genjutsu, there are still plenty of other ways of getting the insert to be productive.
