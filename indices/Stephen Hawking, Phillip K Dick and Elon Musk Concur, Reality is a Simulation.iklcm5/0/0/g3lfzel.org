Not only are probabilistic arguments assuming some wild shit, there are literally no priors in ontology. Normal bayesian probability has broken down, you are through the looking glass.

It's like reaching into a bag, pulling out a marble, observing that of all the infinite colours a marble could be, it's probably not blue, then asserting that it musn't be. You don't have priors, the logic is fundamentally flawed.
