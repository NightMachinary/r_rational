  "Nargles are magical creatures associated with time," said Luna. "They're always making mischief in the future, which wreaks havoc on Seers trying to do their jobs, and they eat the past after it happens. They're why you can't turn time back more than six hours."

Now we know, don't we? We know what happens to today when it becomes yesterday. It waits for them. It waits for them, the timekeepers of eternity. Always following them behind, cleaning up the mess in the most efficient way possible: by eating it!

Interesting take, but I don't think it explains it. If nargles eat the past when it gets six hours old, then why wouldn't time turners be able to go back six hours indefinitely?

Or... No, it actually makes sense. Every time you time-turn, you get closer to the nargles, and eventually you can't turn anymore. But then how does the reset work?
