Gradually-expanding humanity encounters a substantially large and more advanced conquering civilization that's race-caste based and very reminiscent of the aliens from Halo.

In the ensuing conflict, humanity is all but exterminated, save for one accidental colony ("Rally") and the one super capital AI-controlled warship (Red One, aka, The Last Angel) whose crew perished to the man during the war.

This ship has waged a guerrilla war of retribution ever since.

There's lots of details I've left out so you can read about them (why did humanity warrant extermination over conquest? why does no one else use AIs? how did the conquering civilization go from idealists to tyrants? why was rally spared? why did humanity's tech base fall so far?)
