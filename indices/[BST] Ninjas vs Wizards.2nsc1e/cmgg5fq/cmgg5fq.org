A graduate of Hogwarts likely wouldn't be able to go up against any of the Naruto villains.

I'm gonna guess that even against a genin, the simple inability of Hogwarts' students to efficiently cast spells would be basically an insta-kill. Harry managed to defeat one of the most accomplished duelists simply by using Expelliarmus. There's not a lot of difference in skill between a fifty-year-old wizard and a fourteen-year-old in terms of ability, whereas in Naruto the difference between a thirty-year-old and a fourteen-year-old is so great as to be laughable. The wizard would probably get killed by a kunai or have their wamd switched out by a jutsu in the time it takes to just say an incantation.

Assuming that Avada Kedavra works like in the books, you really could just cast as many as you wanted in the direction of the people you want dead, because it only stops once it's killed someone. This would enable the insta-kill of Orochimaru's snake, as well as Gaara just due to the size of the monsters. Likewise, any super sized summon would be an easy kill, like Naruto's frogs. Every ninja settlement could be destroyed in an afternoon, because they could just apparate in, light up some fiendfyre, and then apparate out. Wizards could also be used to rapidly teleport high skill individuals into battle.

Legilimency and the imperius would be basically useless because of the high will of all ranking ninjas.

Transfiguration would be useless on a large scale because in Naruto, they have television. Any society that can handle that level of industry should be able to create more kunai or bombs or whatever faster than a bored seventeen-year-old could transfigure them.

All of this basically comes down to the fact that Harry Potter wizards are basically useless. I'm sure if you sent them to the equivalent of Brakebills(from the Magicians, which is a great book) they'd be a lot more combat effective, but almost every spell in the series is a one-use Chekov's gun. They had a spell that could destroy matter in the fourth book, but it was only used once to blast apart a hedge. They could have toppled Malfoy's manor after they'd gotten their wands back in the seventh book, but, instead, it's used once. Spells really aren't meant for war or killing in the books, and the wizards are definitely not fighters. Their best use would be as rapid destruction and redeployment forces.
