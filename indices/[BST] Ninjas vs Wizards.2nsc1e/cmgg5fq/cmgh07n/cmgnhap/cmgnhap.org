Large, rapidly castable are of effect attacks would be best. Most spells move at only moderately faster than a real human can run, as evidenced by the fact that at like 10 feet most people can dodge the spells cast by their opponents. If they had some ability to rapidly blow back everything, they would be safe from kunai amd a majority of wind, fire, and water techniques. The same spell could be used against Zabuza's mist, basically any type of gas, and, at close ranges, to turn high amounts of particulate (think sand, flour, or broken glass) into a whirlwind of doom. Most earth attacks(including the one where they go under the ground) could be stopped by the Chekov's gun from the fourth book. Realistically, it's reliant on the reflexes of the wizards in question, but, seeing as they'd be at a disadvantage for starting about two years after the ninja, they wouldn't even be able to see what was going on around them. They'd look almost to be chunin, especially because they'd probably be taller than their compatriots because of their Norman heritage, who were taller than normal back in the midle ages.

Some method of rapid divination would allow them to make up for the lack of neccessary reflexes. It could be an almost blatant ape of the sharingan.

Also potions won't work. Almost everything they learn in potions was based on milennia of randomly combining things together to find useful combinations of already magical ingredients. Having one student able to research and recreate entirely new potions would be absolutely unbelievable. That would break immersion as fast as a bad plothole.May e one workable potion after literally months of research would be credible . You could even have a character testing potions in combat situations as a main plot hook. Rapid progress feels like no progress, so make sure there's a lot of wrong hypotheses if you're gonna include potions.

You mentioned invisibility cloaks and obliviate, but those would be functionally useless. An invisibiloty cloak wouldn't stop the other aspects of a person under a cloak walking around the place, like their smell and the sound of their footsteps. Chunin would easily be able to detect those signs. Obliviate could be useful in an ANBU or Interrogation situation, but it wouldn't have practical applications in the middle of a battle. Maybe in an inflitration situation, obliviate could be used to erase the minds of anyone who suspected the wizard, or it could be used to absolutely destroy the combat effectiveness of enemy ninja once they've been captured. Can't fight if they can't remember how.

But yeah, Harry Potter characters couldn't survive on their own in Naruto's world.
