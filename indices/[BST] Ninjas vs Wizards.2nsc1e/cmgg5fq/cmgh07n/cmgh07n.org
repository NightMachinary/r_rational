Young wizards are pretty weak, but I like that. It challenges them and makes them think. I'd prefer a weak pseudo-munchkin to a strong guy who just blasts through everything.

The speed thing is a problem, and one I'm not sure what to do about. Even genin should be able to move so quickly the best wizards can't keep up. Maybe I could say they have potions to improve their reflexes.

You're right about the HP series really lacking a system of magic. It's more like whatever spell they need to solve the problem in a dramatically satisfying way. Which means I'll need to do some inventing. So what kind of imbalances would a wizard need to address--not necessarily to become as strong as a ninja, but to be able to survive with smarts and a bit of luck--and how best to maintain the feel of HP while inventing new spells and potions?

I think wizards would have to rely on certain informational advantages like obliviate and invisibility cloaks to stand a chance, especially because as you say they aren't soldiers. But it's more fun that way.
