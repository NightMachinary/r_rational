Naruto is largely made of ass pulls to make the fight come out the way the writer wants. Huge plot device combat abilities show up once to get the author out of a corner they wrote themselves into and then are never ever revisited. Consider for example [[http://sractheninja.deviantart.com/art/Naruto-Deidara-Lives-63271750][The Great Snake Escape]]. It is quite possible that in /complete accord with Naruto canon/, a ninja's response to being /out of chakra/ and about to be massively exploded by an explosion that has already started to propagate a few feet away is to /conjure a giant snake from nothing, use a sharingan genjutsu to hypnotize the snake, get inside the snake, then teleport the snake away in a manner that is never referred to or used again, in the few milliseconds of time before the explosion reaches them/. Yes, seriously. Yes, the first two steps required lots of chakra every other time in the story they were seen. Yes, the second two steps are basically absurd on the face of them.

On the other hand, Rowling can't imagine a fight scene interestingly to save her life, and the only thing she ever has Harry do is disarm people; she tries to pass it off as a signature move or something, but I am pretty sure it's mostly just bad writing. Also, all the fights' various victories and defeats mostly seem like ass-pulls to a similar extent to HP's, see e.g. how badly Harry would have lost multiple times if Voldemort had been willing as a villain to fight unfairly and let his army of masked evil followers who call /themselves/ Death Eaters help him in a confrontation with HP or even just allow them to kill HP.

Basically, both series come down to being answered best by [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4_zFYnnn2Y][Stan Lee's Who Would Win?]] - in both series the author has pretty clearly decided the outcome they want to each fight and, logic or reason be damned, that's what's going to happen by the end of the fight. Molly Weasley will kill Belatrix in a fight because no reason, and Deidara won't kill Sasuke because no reason.

That all said: Naruto is supersaturated with ways to instantly incapacitate or kill people from hiding (e.g. - hiding underground and instantly pulling people under with you, hiding in puddles [which would be much better in England], transforming into friendlies or civilians/muggles with henge, numerous psuedoteleportation skills, numerous clone skills, etc). On the other hand, Harry Potter can do a lot of that sort of thing too - starting a fight by whispering Avada Kedavra or whatever the petrifying one is from beneath a cloak of invisibility, or via polyjuice, or from above via broomsticks, or pretending to be animal via animagery, etc. Basilisk straight-up kill or petrify, there are those lethal plants if you can hear them, etc. Bearing all this in mind, if your plot wants to have Naruto characters win, have them be the ambushers; if you want HP characters to win instead, have them be the ambushers. Both series are supersaturated with ways to instantly ambush people and win (fatally or taking-prisoners-ways, for both) if that's what you want to do for your plot to make one side win or the other.

If both sides see each other and know of the other's presence, you can have basically anything you want to happen happen because a lot of both sides' powers are made of bullshit asspulls and are insufficiently explained to be even fully defined in their own continuities, and their interactions are of course explained even less than that because neither series has ever considered the existence of the other in canon. You could have the basic dispel magic spell interfere with chakra constructs and disrupt genjutsu and ninjutsu techniques like clones or whatever, followed by a incapacitating with jinxes that are homing or whatever. You could have the sunshin or replacement techniques allow a ninja to close to close quarters and disarm everyone with taijutsu in a half second before their wands are even drawn. You could have wizards' spells shatter helplessly on Rasengans or Rasenshurikens or even generic ninja attacks like Sasuke's start of series fireballs, or you could have ninjas attempt to close to melee range only to find that their opponents can fly around unsupported at fairly high speeds unsupported by anything because Snape wrote down the technique somewhere (he and Volde both did it in canon). You could have Harry's mysterious imperio-resistance trump card work on the Nara shadow thingy has or on Ino's soul-switchy thingy or basically any genjutsu or sharingan bullshit or not basically as the plot demands. Cloaks of invisibility, including The Cloak of Invisibility, can beat Hyuuga bullshit eyes or Uchiha bullshit eyes or Madara bullshit eyes, or not, 100% as your plot requires.

Naruto is supersaturated with cool-visual-ideas and neat combat options, and Harry Potter really isn't for the most part - the coolest thing anyone ever summons in combat is a snake once and that was in book 2 and had no effect. If you need good ideas in this vein for HP cool dueling spells to use in a standup fight that might give them cooler sounding and more tactical options to make the fights more interesting, the fanfic which did this best that I know of is Jim Bernheimer's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][The Lie I've Lived]]. This fic has an entire host of other issues, but the dueling and training for dueling and actual combat segments are extremely well done for a more 'interesting' wizarding combat that is nonetheless not too far out of line with other stuff J K Rowling came up with.

If you want a writing challenge, have all involved characters duplicate themselves and experience the fight in multiple non-chronoligcally-linear perspectives simultaneously (HP - time turners for Temporal Fugue Attack, Naruto - Shadow or other styles of Clones).
