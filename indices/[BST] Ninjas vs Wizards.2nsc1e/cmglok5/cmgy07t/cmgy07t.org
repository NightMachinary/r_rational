Can you Accio part of an object? Does it work on living things? I don't know if either of those were addressed in canon. Also, I don't think Fidelius can protect a person -- it has to be a place, and the times it was used in canon were static locations. Using it on a mobile location is fine if the author says, but isn't canon.

I agree with you that both sides are glass cannon to the others.
