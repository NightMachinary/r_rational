disclaimer: i know nothing about naruto. i'm just assuming it's typical shonen.

i've got to say, wizards seem pretty clearly superior. i suppose it depends a /lot/ on whether you mean "average firsty" or "average firsty with the ability to use spells in ways they were not originally designed for". on first glance, it looks like ninjas will win in literally every situation, regardless of initiative.

consider: basically all combat spells in hp are easily-dodgable projectiles. even ak, which is pretty much constantly hailed as The Ultimate Attack, has a good quarter-second of lag as it makes its bright, easily distinguishable path across the battlefield. the reflexes of ninjas are /far/ more than enough to dodge it (hell, iirc even in hp there were descriptions of dodged aks). conversely, ninjas have the capacity to kill a wizard before they draw their wand, let alone say the name of a spell and make the requisite wand motions.

... of course, all this depends on everything being comfortably within the stations of canon. if we allow even a little bit outside of that, both parties are on the fairly even platform of "whoever gets initiative wins". however great your reflexes, without wards there's not an awful lot one can do against the untargetted, instantaneous, and loe-less "/accio enemy's upper cervical vertebrae/", which has a range of several miles. hp is pretty heavily geared towards domestic spells, and as anyone who's ever looked at d&d's cantrip description knows, those are the most breakable.

and then if we go a little farther, ninjas are left pretty far out of their league. this is because of wizards' access to warding and so forth -- provided that there's a non-zero period of time in which both parties are opposed to one another but not in active combat, the wizard is pretty much guaranteed a win. warding isn't really explored much in hp canon, but even what little we know can completely nullify anything a ninja can throw at it. consider casting fidelius on one's current location and wiping the memory of the secret-keeper (or better yet, making yourself the secret-keeper); combat prowess is almost entirely irrelevant when the enemy can imp themselves close and put a round of lead through your cranium.
