I think ninjas are overall more powerful, as well as being more physically capable and creative than most wizards. They seem to have access to larger attacks / effects than comparable wizards (e.g. the amount of fire that Sasuke can create as a genin would look impressive coming even from Dumbledore*). In the end it would come down to how wizard shielding spells hold up against elemental effects. Immortality / resurrection also seems easier for ninjas than for wizards.

Death-eaters might be a different story. AK is pretty OP. Do ninjas have any unblockable insta-kills?

*Actually, there is fiendfyre, a dark spell which an average seventh year was able to cast. I'm not sure how much fire it made, but it was ~special fire~, maybe comparable to Amaterasu.
