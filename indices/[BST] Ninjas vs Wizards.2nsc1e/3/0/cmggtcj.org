Well, it seems to me that moving quickly plus a knife should equate to AK for most purposes. I suppose it depends on whether Protego blocks that sort of thing. On the other hand, ninjas can substitution jutsu out of an AK as long as there's a log nearby.

One question to consider is whether ninjas are treated as Muggles or not for the sake of wizard spells. I would say yes since I've already decided genjutsu doesn't work on wizards, which means that e.g. a ninja wouldn't be able to even see Hogwarts. Ironically, it seems that wizards have the advantage in information and ninjas the advantage in power.

Fiendfyre vs Amaterasu would be neat.
