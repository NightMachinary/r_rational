  I decided wizards are immune to genjutsu because they don't have any chakra to be manipulated.

Actually, thinking about this, I'm not sure it's the right choice. Naruto canon says "if it's alive it has chakra, if it has no chakra it's dead." Chakra exhaustion can actually kill you, IIRC. You can absolutely decide that HP wizards have no chakra, but then you're not being evenhanded between the universes -- you might as well say "ninja are immune to Avada Kedavra because they don't have souls".
