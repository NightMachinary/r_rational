But I didn't know that every living thing should have chakra. I thought it was only ninjas. So from my perspective it's not a nerf at all but just logic, and I don't want to change it after learning what chakra is supposed to be because laziness, so you can't deduce anything about my desire to see wizards win over ninjas from that fact.

My fix, without spoiling anything, will not leave the sorts of techniques you list so useless as it may seem.
