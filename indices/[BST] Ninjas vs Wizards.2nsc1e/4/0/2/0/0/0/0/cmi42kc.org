  No, I just mean that I've thought of a way to keep that new fact consistent with what I've already written so that I don't have to go back and change things.

Right, but if you started from a point where the ninja had been nerfed (no genjutsu allowed) and now you're trying to keep new facts consistent with that view, then you've still made your decision -- you're supporting it, not reevaluating based on new evidence.

It goes beyond genjutsu, too. If you're disallowing chakra manipulations to work on wizards and then allowing all magic to work on wizards, you are tilting the odds in favor of the HP wizards quite a bit. If you say that HP wizards have no chakra, then here's a partial list of things you've just taken away from the ninja:

- Sharingan (the Mangekyō is a genjutsu, and I believe the prediction abilities are based on reading chakra)
- The Hyūgas' Gentle Fist style -- it relies on sealing tenketsu to prevent use of chakra / disable someone by disrupting their chakra. They now have little to no taijutsu (martial arts) ability.
- The Hyūgas' [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Byakugan][Byakugan]] can no longer see through illusions and transformations such as Polyjuice
- Shino is now useless -- his signature move is to have his bugs eat your chakra until you fall over

That's just off the top of my head. Of course, the 'no chakra' decision enables other things -- for example, if the wizards have no chakra, then the replacement technique will treat them like an inanimate object. That allows assassination techniques such as: Ninja A swings a sword at his partner's neck. At the very last millisecond, his partner substitutes himself for a wizard standing a hundred yards away. The wizard is now dead.

Also, something else I thought of: the replacement technique appears to be causality-breaking: there are multiple times in the anime where a ninja is /explicitly shown/ to have been cut in half -- you clearly see the body being divided -- and then it's just a log that was cut apart. The only way I can reconcile that is that the replacement can actually be made to happen a fraction of a second before the technique is actually activated, even if the ninja has died in the meantime.

To be clear: I'm fine with the idea that you want to nerf all this, and that HP wizards should win. If that's the story you want to write, cool. I am very much looking forward to it and if the basic writing mechanics are good then I'm sure I'll enjoy it a lot. I just want to point out the full implications of the decision.
