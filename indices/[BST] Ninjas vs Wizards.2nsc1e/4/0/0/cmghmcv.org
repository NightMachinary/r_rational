[genjutsu]

That actually makes a lot of sense. I hadn't realized that genjutsu were chakra manipulations.

[chakra reserves]

Sasuke is a genin, so his reserves are small. Kakashi is a jōnin; his reserves are pretty darn big. As I remember it, the fight against Zabuza at the bridge in Wave went on for a goodly while and trashed a lot of the landscape. He's got more than enough to get through a battle.

Naruto is the jinchūriki of the Kyuubi, the Nine Tailed Demon Beast, the most powerful of the Tailed Beasts. (Think big-ass demon.) Jinchūriki means "living container for a mega-demon"; it was sealed into him when he was a baby.

Naruto's own chakra reserves are enormous because plot, but when he draws on the Kyuubi's chakra they are effectively infinite. As such, he can make hundreds / a thousand shadow clones and can do it all day long. To see some of the implications, read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9311012/1/Lighting-Up-the-Dark][Lighting Up The Dark]]. Kage Bunshin is just *ludicrously* broken when you are Naruto.

[prep time] Yep, a prepared wizard with battle training and appropriate gear is scary and would be very effective. He'd have to remain unnoticed and one-shot the ninja though. If not, the ninja is out of there and either the battle is over or it becomes cat-and-mouse as they each try to figure out where the other is.

One thing the wizards could do if they were smart: hire ninja from a different Hidden Village. If they're attached by Sound, hire Hidden Leaf (Naruto's village) or vice-versa. Ninja are mercenaries, after all.
