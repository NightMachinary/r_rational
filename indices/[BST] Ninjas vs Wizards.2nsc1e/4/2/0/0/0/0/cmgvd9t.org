A "normal" henge is a pure illusion (ie genjutsu), and the greater the change the harder it gets - so looking like someone with a similar build is easy, different build harder, and a tree very difficult.

Naruto... doesn't seem to follow these rules, even in canon. The best (fanon) explanation I've seen is that due to having a nine-tailed kitsune sealed into him, he has a unique shapeshifting ability and never realises.
