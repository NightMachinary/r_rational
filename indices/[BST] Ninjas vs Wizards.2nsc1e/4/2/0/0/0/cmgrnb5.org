Remember that I've only seen a double handful of the episodes and haven't read the manga, so most of what I'm saying is from fanfic.

I don't remember ever seeing a depiction of Naruto messing up a henge. I've seen him mess up a /bunshin/ (the standard, immaterial clone) because his chakra control bites and he can't manage to put in a /small enough/ amount of chakra. (The poor control I'm pretty sure is actually canon.) Kage bunshin, the shadow clone, is actually harder for most people because it sucks up a lot more chakra, so he can do those perfectly every time.

As an aside: Naruto actually has two adaptations on the kage bunshin: Sexy No Jutsu, where he generates a shadow clone who looks like an 18-year-old female version of himself wearing nothing but clouds, and Harem No Jutsu, where he creates a whole swarm of such. Given that it's a Japanese anime these are ridiculously effective techniques: he uses SNJ to make ridiculously powerful old male ninja start spontaneously bleeding from the nose and passing out, and uses HNJ to utterly discombobulate adult male ninja so that Naruto can get a shot in.
