What Chekov's gun from the fourth book?

Divination is an interesting possibility.

Why not create new potions? Didn't HJPEV? And suppose the potions already exist but weren't well known because they're not much use aside from fighting ninjas. I'm just thinking of a handful of buffs a student could bring to the ninja world to give themselves a chance at a key moment.
