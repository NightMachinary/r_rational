Do I get a time turner? Do I get an invisibility cloak? Do I get a house elf? Do I get a pet basilisk or any other magical creature? Do they know my powers? Do I get a teleport? Do I get a broom stick? Mind reading? Muggle tech?

I won't watch Naruto so I wouldn't actually know, but these are the sorts of questions I'd want to know if I was against super-fast opponents who had supernaturally good senses and could not be hit with projectiles and I had time to prepare. If I had the time turner, I'd /always/ have time to prepare,

Basilisks force opponents to close eyes, and besides there is a painful mental attack if they look at your eyes. Earplugs + adult Mandrakes /might/ just kill them all immediately, but if not at least they can't hear you. A lot of patronuses flying around /right/ in front of opponent's vision, blinding them if they look anywhere but at the basilisks. Also, you should fling stink pellets and perhaps poisonous gas everywhere, so they can't smell you under the cloaks. Now that hearing, seeing, smelling, or touching anything is deadly, you can be invisible in peace (also, the /outside/ of your invisibility cloak is a portkey that apparates anyone who touches it to a hell somewhere) and maybe you can land a hit or two in the confusion. Hopefully you're at least safe from whatever poorly aimed projectiles manage to be thrown in this din, because /you/ have magic force shield...whereas avada kedavra can go through enemy shields. You can even try Imperio if things go well.

House elves seem a lot more agile than wizards and can use lots of wandless magic, so are less easily disabled, and don't question orders or fear death. A house-elf touch kills instantly, since apparation is easily hacked into an insta-kill. Time turners provide intel, but they /also/ double the size of your army with each use (10 /invisible/ copies of house eleves riding basilisks! The first house elf in the time turner chain drank felix! The basilisks are randomly teleporting and disappearing-reappearing everywhere!). Teleporting stuff directly inside of them. How frequently can you apparate around? Oh, wait, it doesn't matter - your time turner-ed selves and/or magical creatures who can apparate can help you out while your apparation skill recharges, so you really hop around if you trust them to not splinch you. Also as long as we've got critters, dementors are indestructable, sooo...

Come to think of it, you can probably transfigure some of these creatures even if you can't bring them with. There's also at least a few Area of Effect spells. Hermione has a freezing charm which freezes all the pixies. Fiendfire. Disembodied horcruxes possessing them without them knowing.

Having at least one ninja ally really powers things up. Off the top of my head, you can hand them long sticks with portkey'd tips or a gun with portkey bullets which send whatever they touch to the bottom of the ocean, or something more insta-killingly lethal, and then use the time turner to make /more/ ninjas.

Basically, the Wizard end of things is to just take all stack-able powers, and /stack as many of them as possible/. In a /real/ Wizarding War, there would be so much flashing of light and sound and color and things would be going /so/ fast and everyone on both sides would probably just die immediately.
