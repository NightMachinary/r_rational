I decided wizards are immune to genjutsu because they don't have any chakra to be manipulated. But ninjas still have brains. I'm thinking they should be considered Muggles in terms of magic affecting them, which means Imperio and the like should still work.

ninjas are broken =(

Actually, on the subject of chakra, how strict is it? Sasuke and Kakashi have very limited use of their eye powers and the chidori, but Naruto can make about a thousand clones? Is he supposed to be just that special?

I suppose what wizards would need is time to prepare. Disillusioned and with shields up and buffed with potions they would be pretty formidable. A wizard who just happens to stumble across a ninja is toast unless he can Apparate away in time.

Items would be a factor, again given preparation. Invisibility cloaks, brooms, and hats with shield charms would go a long way to giving wizards equal footing.
