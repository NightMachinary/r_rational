  So if the demon fox is actually some kind of disease monster and not a big chakra beast, then how many shadow clones could Naruto make?

As many as you say he can. Naruto's chakra reserves are canonically stated to be huge, but there's no clear delineation between how much is him directly and how much is the Kyuubi.

As I understand it, the technique uses a lot of chakra; it was a forbidden jutsu because of that. I don't know from canon, but in 'fic it seems like either no one else uses it at all, or they can only make 1d4 shadow clones.
