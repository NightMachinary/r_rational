If you're making "fixes" against particular points, then it sounds like you've already made your choice. If so, there's no point in making fixes -- just rule by authorial fiat that it is the case. If you've made up your mind, though, you've pretty clearly decided that the Wizards should win -- otherwise you wouldn't feel the need to nerf the ninja -- so there's not a lot of point in discussion.
