(Spoilers ahead)

The mythology of chakra in the Narutoverse suggests that chakra is present in all living beings, and ninjas have a higher concentration of it and have ways of training to enhance their chakra reserves and control. Even civilians, who generally have low chakra reserves and control, can eventually become ninjas, as in the case of Sakura. The God Tree is mentioned to have grown in the blood of the fallen warriors, which I take to mean that it refined and concentrated their chakra in it's Fruit (the consumption of which lead to the advent of ninjas).

As for Naruto's insane chakra reserves, the explanation is a combination of the Uzumaki clan's resiliency, the incredible amount of toxic chakra that Kurama has been pumping through his chakra pathway system, such that Neji's attack on his chakra system was much less effective it would be on a average ninja. Naruto has enough chakra that he brute-forces most of his techniques, and learning better control has been a major feature of his development.

With the ability to manipulate sage, tailed beast and six paths chakra in addition to his own, Naruto can draw on incredibly large amounts of chakra by the end of the series. In addition, many of the major clans of Konoha could claim that they directly descended from the Rabbit Goddess (Uchiha, Senju, Uzumaki and likely Hyuga), and Naruto is a reincarnation of one of the Rabbit Goddess's grandchildren.

Outside of Naruto direct family, the Namikaze in general aren't really discussed, but Minato was skilled enough to be a major factor in the Third Ninja World War, and become the Hokage. Naruto is also part of the chain of teams that included all of the Hokages. Despite living for a decade in terrible conditions that made seriously compromised his early development, Naruto has a great deal of support to make him a extremely powerful shinobi.

Regarding how wizards and ninjas would interact, magic does seem to have a spiritual component, so magic and chakra manipulation may be somewhat related. I would draw on the similarities between wandless magic and hand seals, as well as wizard blood and kekkai genkai to smooth out the differences in a crossover setting.

For example, perhaps wizards are naturally gifted at chakra manipulation, and wands are made of chakra resonant materials ("9 inches, Hashirama wood, Nine-Tailed Fox fur"), but with military-class training, even Muggles can shape chakra/cast spells, if somewhat limited by their chakra system.

In this version, a chunin would be closer to an auror team leader. To a ninja, wizards would look like ninjutsu specialists, with some genjutsu ability and virtually no taijutsu skill. A wizard can have a wide array of spells would and Apparition behaves similar to the Flying Thunder God Technique which Minato used to devastating effect in the Third Ninja World War. A skilled wizard would look like a cross between Minato and Kakashi, and yet oddly ignores hand to hand combat skill. On the other hand, a wizard would probably think a ninja regretfully neglect their magical abilities, and worryingly make large use of child soldiers.

I think the biggest factor that would give ninjas on the whole the upper hand is that the culture is very much combat orientated. Those who fought in the Wizarding Wars would probably be competent combatants, but the ninja focus on speed and physical combat would incredibly dangerous to wizards, who largely stand around flinging spells/ninjutsu.

After first contact in the hypothetical crossover setting, taijutsu and wands would probably be the biggest exchanges. High quality ninja tools would incorporate wand cores to allow better chakra manipulation. Wizarding Schools would convert Flying Lessons to Magical Physical Education incorporating taijutsu, kawarmi and other "magical body enhancement charms." Kawarmi and Shunshin could form the basis of learning Apparition, with the Flying Thunder God Technique being a chakra tag assisted version. Wizards also have a great deal of tools (potions, brooms, portkeys, etc) that could be very interesting when weaponized (portkey to a deathtrap on a kunai).
