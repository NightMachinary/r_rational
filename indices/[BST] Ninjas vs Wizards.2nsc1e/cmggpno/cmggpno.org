Why are the wizards immune to genjutsu? If they are, shouldn't the ninja be immune to Imperio, Confundus, Obliviate and all the other mind-effecting HP magic?

Regardless of what's allowed though, I think there's two scenarios:

1. The wizard is still a student: they possess only basic nonlethal jinxes (Jelly Legs, Expeliarmus, etc) and cannot apparate.\\
2. Alternatively, both participants are mature, experienced representatives of their type. (e.g. chunin vs a typical Auror, or a jounin vs someone like Dumbledore, Voldemort, Bellatrix, Moody, etc)\\

In the first case, the ninja wins regardless of the level of the ninja, unless the wizard has a handy Floo or Portkey and can escape.

In the second case, it's a "who-goes-first" question, as both are glass cannon against the other's attacks. If the wizard lands an Avada Kedavar, the ninja dies. If the ninja lands a Rasengan, Chudori, etc, then the wizard dies.

The wizard's defenses would consist of Protego, Apparate, and Dumbledore's trick of putting physical objects in the way. The ninja's defenses would consist of a wide variety of movement abilities, elemental control techniques to create barriers, and lots of distraction techniques such as clones.

Overall, I suspect ninja would win much more often than wizards.

Important factors / techniques on the ninja side:

- Trained to kill
- Enormously superior physical abilities (martial arts, etc)
- Stealth and infiltration training
- Limited chakra: cannot spam their biggest attacks continually. For a jonin this is not such a factor.
- Kawarimi (replacement technique): Ninja switches for an object such as a log. Can be done fast enough to avoid a sword that is about to hit them.
- Shunshin (body flicker): Ninja moves faster than the eye can see across relatively short distances -- AIUI, anywhere up to across-my-small-town. It's effectively teleportation but it travels through the intervening space.
- Bunshin (clone): creates an illusionary copy of you that can act independently as a distraction. Dispels on light contact.
- Kage bunshin (shadow clone): creates a physical copy of you /and all your non-magical gear/ which knows everything you do and can act independently. Dispels on medium contact but when it does you get all of its memories. Great for scouting. Also allows you to attack from multiple directions simultaneously. If you're Naruto or any other jinchuuriki and can create an effectively unlimited number of them it means that you never need to physically encounter the wizard at all.
- Elemental clones (water, earth, etc) For this purpose, same as kage bunshin.
- [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Earth_Release:_Hiding_Like_a_Mole_Technique][Earth Release]] Move around underground for surprise attacks.
- Exploding tags and trapmaking
- EDIT: Forgot to mention the Henge (transformation technique). A ninja can turn himself into another person or into /any physical object, even one of a different size/. I'm not familiar with canon, but I've seen 'fics where people turn themselves into kunai (throwing knives), buckets, etc. This is a basic Academy skill that even genin can do.

Important HP factors:

- Can spam spells infinitely
- Helpless without their wands
- Avada Kedavra
- Imperio
- Teleportation (Apparate, floo, portkey)
