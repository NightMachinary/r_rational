The time turner thing is problematic: Beyond the theorem that your body can only experience the same moment 7 times, precommiting your future selves to do something and observing it means that you are going to have to do it whether you regret it in the meantime or not; the whole scheme can only work in the first place if you don't die; and by invoking time turners and observing freely, you leave the turn of events up to whatever process decides between all possible stable time loops.
