Nobody in the book is even vaguely rational, even the ones who are presented as being so. The artificial society they set up isn't rational. The plot isn't rational, with people forgetting about major plot points and remembering them again as convenient for KSR. The science is wrong all over the place.

Read Wil McCarthy's Queendom series instead of you want a credible description of a failed interstellar colony. Lots of people are irrational in it, but they're consistent about it, and there are ratiional people in the background keeping things running up to the collapse.
