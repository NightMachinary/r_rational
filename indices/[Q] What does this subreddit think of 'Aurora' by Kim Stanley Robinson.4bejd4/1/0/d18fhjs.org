If I was doing a "Rational Aurora", I'd have them avoid both planets as obvious deathtraps, and get started on building more rings of habitats. They've demonstrated they can survive long-term in the habitats without resupply, and now they have a whole system full of rock and ice to work with. They'd be working towards a society distributed through the small bodies of the system. Eventually you'd send probes in to try and figure out the source of the anomalous oxygen, but that would be low priority.
