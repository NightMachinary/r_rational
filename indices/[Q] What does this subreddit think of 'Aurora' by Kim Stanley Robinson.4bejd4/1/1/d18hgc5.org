  Nobody in the book is even vaguely rational, even the ones who are presented as being so. The artificial society they set up isn't rational. The plot isn't rational, with people forgetting about major plot points and remembering them again as convenient for KSR. The science is wrong all over the place.

One could say as much about the Harry Potter series or the world of Naruto as well, yet they make for entertaining rational(ist) fan-fiction fodder, which was more of my thinking.

Thanks for the recommendation!
