Siberian doesn't talk though. So she can't do much "mouthing off". And I mean, bro, think of some of the stuff they've thrown at Siberian, and some of the places the S9 would've ended up facing off against the heroes, and some of the AOE shit that had to have been attempted on the Siberian in all her years fighting the Protectorate. It just seems really unlikely that one pedestrian van could plunk along around all that shit without being noticed.
