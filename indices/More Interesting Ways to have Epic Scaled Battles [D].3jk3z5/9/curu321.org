The problem is that in most fiction superpowered attacks massively outnumber super-powered defences. Because super attacks are big and flashy while defences just tend to make things a bit boring if too many characters have them. Skitter herself is a good example: massive and deadly offence capable of depopulating a city block almost instantly (or most of a city before she's noticed and stopped), pretty weak defence compared to any real brute. It's a time honoured recipe that allows protagonists to take out overpowered enemies while at the same time being supremely vulnerable every step of the way, which makes for better nailbiters.

You can give a boss outrageous speed, but then you need a reason that he doesn't just use it to poke his enemy full of holes. One way could be the missing Traveler from worm, who can go back in time 3 seconds when he fucks up. Not technically regeneration but it does the same thing in that it allows you to demonstrate the deadliness of the attacks while still continuing the combat. Kakuzu is another good example with his ridiculously strong skin and 4 hearts to destroy before he goes down.
