To be honest, I was always kind of skeptical of Siberian and its effects. Like, the range limit thing always seemed kind of wonky. How did Manton stay within the proper range so often? I'm almost certain at least a few of the S9's fights weren't car-friendly. And no one ever noticed Siberian carry this van around, so it's not as if she was protecting it.
