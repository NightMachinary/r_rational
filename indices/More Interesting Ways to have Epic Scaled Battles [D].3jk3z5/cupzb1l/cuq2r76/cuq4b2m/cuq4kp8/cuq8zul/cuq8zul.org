It was suggested by Tattletale that Manton getting so close really more of a psychological compulsion, some sort of voyeurism. Or there could be some sort of scaling control.

It depends on how wide the range is. If it's wide enough...the PRT will quickly come to the conclusion that AoE blasts aren't particularly effective on the Nine -Shatterbird might sense something and Siberian will protect group members- and that'd deter some really crazy shit from happening within cities since there's very little chance it'd work.

The weird thing is Jack not knowing, since he'd likely be the one you rely on to paper over this weakness by countering enemy parahumans.
