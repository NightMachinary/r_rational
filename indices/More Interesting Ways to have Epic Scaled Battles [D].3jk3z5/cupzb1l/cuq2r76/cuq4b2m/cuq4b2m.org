It is a bit wonky, but considering Manton/Siberian can easily force a confrontation and move it wherever they want, it's not that problematic. She's an immovable object, and no hero's gonna complain if she just stands still and mouths off at them, since they don't know that's when Manton finds his way into a building that's closer to the fight.
