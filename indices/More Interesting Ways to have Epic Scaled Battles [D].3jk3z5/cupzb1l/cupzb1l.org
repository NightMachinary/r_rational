Gargantuan size, thick armor, lightning speed, monstrous strength...

Invulnerability, epic regeneration, clones, time-stopping...

None of these tricks matter compared to the power of Mystery.

There's always going to be a proverbial missing scale in the dragon's hide. What makes it interesting is that the story sets up a rule and then seemingly breaks it when it comes to the villain.

For example, the first season of Heroes was basically about stopping Sylar from getting regeneration from Claire ("Save the Cheerleader, Save the World.") However, regeneration didn't make Sylar an epic villain -- it was the uncertainty of what abilities he had at his disposal as well as the intelligent application (for the most part) of said abilities when compared to his peer, in the form of Peter.

If you don't like "OP powerz," derive the underlying rules for why it seemingly works, and then have the hero nerf it.

I think that's what makes Siberian interesting. She starts off as OP until Taylor realizes that she's just a fat old guy in a van.
