Ive read that Ryuugi story up to like last Friday's update. I've stopped reading for a while so I can binge read them later, once some of them have built up. And yea, the Grimm tend to all have regeneration once u get past a certain point.

As far as speedsters, I hadn't seriously considered the implications of speedster movement (accepting that whatever made them fast hand waved physics enough that they didn't damage anything) until I started reading the Doc Future series. The speedster in that was done really well and I found it refreshing how rationally it treated her powers. Rocks = orbital cannon :)
