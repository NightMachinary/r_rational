Well, I'll grant that for Sakura, if grudgingly. I'd rather say that her body became disposable; being able to just pull a fresh body out of her mindscape and drop an aspect into it is a bit beyond mere regeneration.

Naruto definitely used regeneration a lot, though I'm sure transforming into a dragon makes that less necessary.

I absolutely have to disagree for Hinata. She didn't even /have/ a body for much of the fighting; instead, she sat in Naruto's mindscape and threw out shadow clones. Her evasive fighting style made the fragility of said clones not so much of an issue.
