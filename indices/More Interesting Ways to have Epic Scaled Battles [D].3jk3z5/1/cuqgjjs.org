For a good "epic fight where regen isn't a factor" see the end of Fine Structure.

Basically, it's two gods throwing hits at each other of such magnitude that the killing blow involves compressing the vast majority of the mass of the Earth into a baseball and using the near-black-hole dense sphere as a projectile.

Among other things done in said fight: traveling so quickly through the universe (i.e. a hair's breadth away from the speed of light) that every star the traveler passes goes nova; turning the continent of Antartica from mass energy into an equivalent amount of free energy; spawning an army of force-construct space battleships in a picosecond; etc.

If you want to push up the EPICness of an encounter then make it QUICK. When an immovable object meets an unstoppable force, one of the yields and it is over in an instant (and a giant explosion.) Have the whole battle be reduced to dodges and feints that level buildings. Have the two warriors work on a level of superspeed which makes everything else irrelevant.

There's lots of ways not to rely on regeneration. You mention Worm, think of Contessa.
