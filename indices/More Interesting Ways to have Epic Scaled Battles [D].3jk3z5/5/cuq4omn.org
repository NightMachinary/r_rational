The enemy's superpower is that they can copy themselves (and they have the mental discipline necessary for their copies to cooperate with each other). This does not serve as a form of regeneration because all injuries carry over to subsequent branches. (For example, if there are two of them, and one of them had their arm blown off, then they would need to use the one with the intact arm if they wanted a new copy with an intact arm. If both of them are missing an arm, they're shit out of luck.)
