The Wheel of Time duodecalogy had very powerful characters (some of them, assisted by best and one-of-a-kind magic artifact, could destroy the world), but nobody (besides some monsters) actually had any regeneration. Close-combat Battles mostly consisted of destroying enemy's magical attacks before they affected physical world. In case of power mismatch less powerful mages tend to run and hide, trying to ambush or use some of the less-known mechanics like Dream World.

In general, god-level battles (assuming gods have human-like bodies) tend to invoke such extremely powerful attacks that even slight lapse of defence is enough to kill average human several times over. Thus, they need either close to perfect defence/counters, or some sort of survivability. And regeneration in neat in the way it shows attack's power while still allowing the fight to continue.
