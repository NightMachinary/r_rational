Well if you read "The Games We Play" by Ryuugi, an epic fanfiction crossover, there's some interesting stuff in that series. A ton of regeneration but some other stuff:

1. With an extremely costly technique that involves time-travel handwave and probability manipulation, Jaune manages to not die when he (Jaune) launches a hilarious amount of AoE attacks at close-range at an opponent. He describes it as a trippy sensation of feeling like you were existing in different spots at different times, of existing and not existing at the same time, etc.

2. If you have speedsters in your work, take their effect on the surroundings seriously. A man running at Mach 5 will be extremely obvious and epic.
