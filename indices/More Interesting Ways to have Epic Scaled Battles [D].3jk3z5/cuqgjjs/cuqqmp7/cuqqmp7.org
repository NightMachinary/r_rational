Fuck yes make it quick. Fine Structure has a chapter/section titled "fight scene". Basically a group of mini-Superman doing it out at "catch a bullet like it's a baseball" speeds, with kill-Superman grade sniper rifles and explosives and using cars as improvised weapons while taking apart the one the other guy is using. (I'm probably exaggerating a little.) Maybe the awesomest fight scene I've ever read. And the whole thing took like a minute in-universe real time.
