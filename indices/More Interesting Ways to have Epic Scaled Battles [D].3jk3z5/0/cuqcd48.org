You can think of attacks as having one of the six properties in the table below:

| _        | No damage | Some damage | Lethal |
|----------+-----------+-------------+--------|
| *Hits*   | Ignore    | Regenerate! | Die    |
| *Misses* | Ignore    | Beware      | Dodge  |

Most epic combat involves foes facing each other in the middle column: for most blows, being hit is bad but survivable. Heroes tend to get this with teamwork, villians with regeneration (thematically; there are ofc exceptions).

You can however dip into the lethal column, and then it can get really interesting again:

- Sniper duel - hours of boredom and terror, then someone dies
- Poisons - in food or on blades (see /The Princess Bride/ and /Dune/, respectively)
- Super-skill - eg Mistborn duelling on Atium
- Misdirection - the Fae are only vulnerable to iron. Will you work it out in time to grab some?

At this point, the metagame becomes a lot more important - you have to win every time, or you die. Everyone balances a line between keeping strength in reserve, and being publicly dangerous enough to avoid as many fights as possible...
