This is interesting. I feel like (there's a belief that) to have a good fight scene, you need to spray a lot of damage. But this means you need to not kill the opponents. So you need for the attack to not kill you when it hits, or you need for the attack to /never/ hit. And if you "never hit" but screw up even once, you die. And wizard-style no-sell defenses are boring.

TL;DR find a way to make not getting hit epic-scale interesting. I really like the sniper idea.
