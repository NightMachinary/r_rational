My money's on Zorian becoming a Lich. It was foreshadowed with the Simulcrums, and his beginner lessons in Necromancy, and I suspect that it will turn out to be the solution to escaping the loop (ie, you may not be able to smuggle out a living person, but a phylactery could be a different matter). If that happens, then there's no telling what it will do to his combat effectiveness.
