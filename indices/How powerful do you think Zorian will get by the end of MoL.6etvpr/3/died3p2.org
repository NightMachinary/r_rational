Honestly?

Literally zero more powerful.

We have had chapter after chapter of time travel, powerleveling.

At this point in time in the story, we are no longer worried about the powerleveling part. We are spending the vast majority of time focusing on the plot of the story.

Which is a good thing! There is only a year or so left in story, For them to complete their goal. The future chapters will hopefully focus mostly on the story, vs spending on powerleveling.
