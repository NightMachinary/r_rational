We didn't have a benchmark chapter or learning/defining chapter in a while so we can't say how powerful Zorian has become.

The last chapter when Zorian learned a new skill was when Xvim taught him about dimensional magic. After that we had a benchmark chapter when Zorian 'teleport locked' the lich.

Zorian doesn't have much mana to become a battle mage and I think if he uses blood magic to extend his mana capacity then may be he could fight a dragon. If you read the world building blog then you know Dragons are sentient beings with butt load of Mana which makes it extremely tough to be defeated by a human mage.
