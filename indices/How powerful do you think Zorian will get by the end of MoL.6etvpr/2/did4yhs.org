I hypothesize that Zorian is either going to obtain a single, specific, and huge power from a source other than education (such as a powerful artifact or time loop specific magic)

-- or there will be a tonal shift, probably characterized by an immense loss, Darker and Edgier, raised stakes, and a long period of time passing in the duration of a few chapters, in which Zorian acquires and consumes with utter focus a source of education that no one else has access to, likely in the form of a mentor such as a bound primordial or the ghost serpent, and this period of learning may include time acceleration effected by the mentor.
