There has been speculation before that RR resulted from a rogue simulacrum of Zach taking over someone else (Veyers Boranova?), turning them into a copy of itself, and then finding a way to give them a Controller marker. Though it seems to me like "how did he place a Controller marker?" is complex enough without adding further layers of complexity.
