I believe to remember the following from text:

- Soul bonds exist and a stronger personality can dominate a weaker personality via one.
- Sharing mana between mages is possible and gets easier with repetition.
- Zorian can turn mana into additional copies of himself.

This lead me to the way to specific hypothesis that Zorian might end up creating a Simulacrum spell variant that creates a copy of him soul bound to a target. The copy then dominates the target (I'm assuming being a trained psychic means you have an overwhelmingly powerful personality) and then learns to use the targets mana to sustain his existence/fuel his spells.

The net effect of this combination of spells is an exponentially growing number of Zorians, at least until he runs out of morally acceptable targets.

This would run into problems when the Simlulacra start diverging, but maybe Zorian can solve this problem ahead of time by using the aranea's secret cache to place appropriate compulsions on himself.
