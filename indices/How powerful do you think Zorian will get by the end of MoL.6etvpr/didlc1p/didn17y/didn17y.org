There were 4 years worth of loops left when they found out about the time limit and I believe almost a year has passed since then, which would leave at most 40 30 day loops (3.3 years) assuming they never die, maybe less. They do get a full extra 30 days in Cyoria's black room, 17 in another, and 5 in the last one per loop if they use them all, but each time he uses one Zorian's simulacrums get dismissed so who knows if he will use all of them each loop. I would say if they never die in a loop and max out black room use each time, Zorian has a little under 9 years left in the loop. Seeing as he already has been there for just under 6 years, that would mean he would have a total linear time in the loop of nearly 15 years. Let's say 14 because I don't think they will risk cutting it that close to the loop running out of energy. So he would be roughly 35 years old in linear time by the time he exits the loop. I'm agreeing with you, just trying to figure out the exact times.

EDIT: Also I guess being able to create simulacrums counts as a force multiplier for what he can get done each loop, although he can't use them for training tasks, he can use them for knowledge and busywork tasks.
