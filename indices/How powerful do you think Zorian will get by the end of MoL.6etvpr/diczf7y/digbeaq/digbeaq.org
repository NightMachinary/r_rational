You're gravely mistaken. MoL was always going to be 3 arcs. We knew that ages ago. In fact, the author planned it all out in advance, and from what he's said, he's actually trimmed parts (that weren't plot-critical).

Reaching the Gate and then being told it's locked, RR has already reached the real world, you survived due to undefined programming behavior in unexpected conditions, is not that much different to the end of arc 1, where their attempt to catch RR, find out everything he knows about the loop, and get ZZ working together instead blew up with the aranea getting erased from the loop, Zorian going on the run, and RR escaping the loop.

No doubt arc 3, which currently is cruising with overpowered ZZ, will again build up tension as they approach the real world and challenges too big for even their skills.
