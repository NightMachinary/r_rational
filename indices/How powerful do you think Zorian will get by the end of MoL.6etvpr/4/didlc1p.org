We don't have that many chapters left, but we do have plenty of /time/. I'm pretty sure Z&Z have about 50 loops left, maybe 40 given recent chapters, and each loop is a month of real time, a month in Cyoria's Black Room, and something like a month in other Black Rooms.

So with 3 months per loop, we're talking 120-150 months left in the time loop overall. That's 10-13 years of time, and Zorian's only spent like 5 years in the time loop by now. With the extraordinary resources and opportunities time loops provide (such as coaxing powerful mages out of their prized spells and such) Zorian's still got plenty of time to grow.
