  It wouldn't surprise me if Red Robe ends up with Zach's body

Yeah, that is a possibility. I don't know how well it would work, though, transplanting a soul into a different body. Necromancers can do it, sure, but it affects the quality of their work. I suspect that RR would have to adapt to Zach's body; he wouldn't be in top form. And he wouldn't get Zach's mana reserves, at least.
