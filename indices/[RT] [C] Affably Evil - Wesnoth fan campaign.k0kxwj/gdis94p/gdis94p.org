This is a bit of an unusual submission. But the main characters and their noble family, though evil, has over centuries used "rational" techniques - subterfuge, diplomacy, and economic warfare - to gain advantages over the other, more warlike and honorable noble houses. It's quite entertaining to read the discussions of their house's history and the tactics employed by the main character, which are strongly in his house's tradition.

The campaign is a third-party add-on for the game Battle For Wesnoth. It can be downloaded from inside the game in the "Add-ons" section.
