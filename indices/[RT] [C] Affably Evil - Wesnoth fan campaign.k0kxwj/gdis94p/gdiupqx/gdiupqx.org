Wild, was not expecting to see something like this here. For people who don't know Battle for Wesnoth is a free open source turn based strategy game. If I had to compare it to a more popular series I'd say its kind of like Fire Emblem on a hex map. It doesn't emphasize the characters as much though as there are less levels and most units aren't unique characters. Lots of small gameplay differences as well, but its a great time with a ton of content including coop/competitive multiplayer.
