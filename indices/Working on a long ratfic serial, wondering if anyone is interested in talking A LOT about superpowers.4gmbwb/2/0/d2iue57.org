The most likely way to structure a story like this is that you focus on two or three primary characters, who get the bulk of the word count, and then have another five or six antagonists, who also get more fleshed out. Then everyone else is relegated to the back burner, mentioned in passing or as part of a larger group, or killed because they're early cannon fodder.
