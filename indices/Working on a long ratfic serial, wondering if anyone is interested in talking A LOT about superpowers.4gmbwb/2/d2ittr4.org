A /hundred/ power sets? Even if your story eventually gets to 300,000 words, that's only 1,000 words per power set, which is barely anything. You'll be spreading yourself too thin, and won't be able to fully develop these power sets. And then your readers will think you're just rambling all over the place. And /then/ your readers will stop reading.

You can also run into a situation where readers get upset because any difficulty in the storyline is overcome by someone with a different power showing up (deus ex machina). I strongly recommend you start with just 1 or 2 power sets, that way it'd be easier for readers to understand all the limitations involved and thus understand your story better. And if you really want to make rational fic, it's imperative that the limitations are well known by the reader. Code Geass and Death Note do very well in this regard: well-developed, singular powers that drive multi-season story arcs.
