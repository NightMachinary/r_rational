Ah, true. I had forgotten that. Well, just create your own sub; a few people will join and that solves the problem neatly. Or, if you'd like; you can use [[/r/changestorms]]. Given as I'm not playing in the Change Storms universe right now it would be good if there were something to help keep that sub alive. If you want to let me know and I'll make a topic post saying that it's cool.
