Slatestarcodex suffers from a problem the owner of the blog himself has discussed. It is a gathering of witches.

To unpack: Certain viewpoints - Racism, sexism, reactionary politics ect, tend to get excluded from most online discussion forums. Forums that are /not/ exclusionary towards any or all of these viewpoints run an ongoing risk of being mobbed by large numbers of adherents of these viewpoints because they are not so welcome elsewhere. Scott is a very light touch moderator when it comes to politics. Which, while probably good epistemology - Shutting up everyone you disagree with is a good way to get an echo-chamber -- is in fact a hazardous practice on the internet, because once you hit a critical mass of right wing nutters, your forum degenerates into an outpost of 4-chan. So, basically a case of "Never read the comment section".
