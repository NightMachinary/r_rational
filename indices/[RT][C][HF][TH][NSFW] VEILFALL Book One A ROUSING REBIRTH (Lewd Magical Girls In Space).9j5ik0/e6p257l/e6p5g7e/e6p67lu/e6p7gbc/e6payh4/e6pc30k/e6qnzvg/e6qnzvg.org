I suggest rereading [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6hfGNLf4Hg5DXqJCF/a-fable-of-science-and-politics][A Fable of Science and Politics]]

If for a thousand years everyone who said "the sky is color X" used such a idea to excuse and justify politics that were downright *evil*, and used it for the horrific abuse of other people -- then one naturally worries that declaring the sky to be X will enable these bad people again, or make other people think you're as evil as the horrible X-skyists who committed all those atrocities in the past. One might even feel it a moral obligation to declare the sky to be Y, just to combat the X-skyists even if you don't really know one way or another what is true.

And yet the sky may nonetheless still be X, and that fact still does NOT justify the evils that were committed (or still being committed) in the name of the X-colored sky in the slightest bit -- the X-colored sky (whether blue or green) is not a /moral/ truth, it's just a meaningless thing. There's no God that made it as it should be, neither nature nor physics is gifting us with *moral* truths. Observation can only tell us what is, not what should be.

And those people who claim the sky to be X -- they may indeed perhaps be seeking to justify said evils -- or they may alternately just be truth-seekers who honestly believe it *in spite* of all the horrible evils committed in its name.

They may even be against the evil X-sky *politics*, but be feeling it's counterproductive to battle the X-skiers via using a false claim that the sky is Y -- they may feel that the evil X-sky politics must be combatted on the basis of ethics, justice, and morality, not by using false claims on regards to what is or isn't true.

So basically... I would suggest charity towards people with scientific opinions you don't share, and even ideas that lots of evil people spew. A belief regarding a scientific fact can be true or false, ignorant or not -- but the belief itself is not good or evil, even though many of the people who hold it may be.
