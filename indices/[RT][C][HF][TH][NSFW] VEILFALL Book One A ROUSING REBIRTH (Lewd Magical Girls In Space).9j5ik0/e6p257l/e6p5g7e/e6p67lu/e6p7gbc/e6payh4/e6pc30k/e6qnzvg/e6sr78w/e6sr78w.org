  If for a thousand years everyone who said "the sky is color X" used such a idea to excuse and justify politics that were downright /evil/, and used it for the horrific abuse of other people -- then one naturally worries that declaring the sky to be X will enable these bad people again, or make other people think you're as evil as the horrible X-skyists who committed all those atrocities in the past. One might even feel it a moral obligation to declare the sky to be Y, just to combat the X-skyists even if you don't really know one way or another what is true.

The issue with ideas of biological determinism is that they're not completely unrelated to the treatment itself. It's not like saying "you know who else thought Pi = 3.1415...? Nazi engineers!". We /do/ accept that some humans, who are for example mentally disabled, may have reduced rights and be placed in foster care due to this biologically determined fact that they have no control over. If you went down the same road for human /races/, that would actually make a potential moral case even for colonialism. Which is how colonialism was justified in the first place, in fact.

I haven't seen or read anything from Scott Alexander to this effect, and given how quickly people can jump to conclusions from only tenuous logical connections sometimes I'd need some hard proof to believe he's actually a racist. Simply believing that there are genetic differences between races isn't in itself very shocking - of course there are, or they wouldn't look different to begin with. Though apparently none of these differences are obvious enough to really draw a sharp boundary between human "races" in term of genome (which actually scientifically speaking makes them basically a non-category). Believing that these differences bleed into matters of the mind - be it IQ or attitudes - has potentially far more dangerous consequences. Does not mean that if it were true it would necessarily be a great strategy to try and deny or hide it, but it would definitely be more difficult to handle. Though I know of no actual solid data suggesting anything like it either. In the worst case scenario, aka: /if/ there actually /were/ such differences, then you'd have to face an actual moral choice that's quite tricky. Though I'd still argue that, seeing the practical effects of racism in the past, and considering that whatever differences there may be between population averages obviously must be small compared to the standard deviation (or we'd have noticed already), a combination of practicality and respect for individual rights still warrants an egalitarian viewpoint, regardless of any outcomes.

If Scott Alexander either believes in such differences without any solid basis of data, or believes in non-egalitarian moral systems as a consequence of them... then that would actually make him a racist, yeah.
