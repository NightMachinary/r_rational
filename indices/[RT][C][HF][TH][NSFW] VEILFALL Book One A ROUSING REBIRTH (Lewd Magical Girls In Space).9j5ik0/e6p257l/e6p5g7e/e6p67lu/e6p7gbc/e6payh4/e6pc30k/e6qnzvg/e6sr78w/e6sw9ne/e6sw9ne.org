  Believing that these differences bleed into matters of the mind - be it IQ or attitudes - has potentially far more dangerous consequences.

Unfortunately it's the fact that it has 'potentially far more dangerous consequences' that means we're biased into wanting to believe the thing that would make us 'safer', and would help the egalitarian politics we want.

  If Scott Alexander either believes in such differences without any solid basis of data,
#+end_quote

Almost every person is born with one head, one heart, two lungs, one stomach, two five-fingered hands, etc. In those case there's no variation. But the thing is that any case where there's any genetic variation *within* a group, inevitably leads to variation between the *averages* of different groups, even if there's significant overlap between the sets as a whole.

If some people are short, and some people are tall, and that's partly because of genetics (as it indeed is) -- then inevitably an ethnic group X, will be taller or shorter on *average* than an ethnic group Y. There'll be at least some *slight* variation on what the average height of the group is. It'll be very hard for those average heights to completely coincide. I have no clue whether people of e.g. Indian descent are taller or shorter *on average* than people of Greek descent, but I am pretty certain there'll be at least *some* difference in the average height of those two groups.

And unfortunately the same principle works for e.g. average weight, average penis or breast size, and yeah, almost definitely average potential intelligence as well. The mind's hardware is the brain which is definitely affected by genetics...

So I believe there's probably a difference on average intelligence between different groups, based on the seeming fact that there's a difference on average ANYTHING of ANY two groups.

That probably makes me a racist in your eyes (no 'solid data' here, just reasoning), but I can't emphasize enough how much I loathe racist politics. Eventually, as a transhumanist, I look forward to the time where with gene therapy or brain-enhancement or whatever, the average intelligence of all ethnic groups will be increased and equalized.
