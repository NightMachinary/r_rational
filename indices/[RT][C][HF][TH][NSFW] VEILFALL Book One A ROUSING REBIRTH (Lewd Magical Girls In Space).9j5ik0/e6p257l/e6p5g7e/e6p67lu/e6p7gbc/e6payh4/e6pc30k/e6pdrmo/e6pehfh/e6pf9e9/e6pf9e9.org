I don't reject your membership to this community. You don't have to believe in "racial science" or agree with Scott to be here. I do think that we're at least a loosely associated community and I wanted to make sure you were aware of the connection because of how wary you were of it, but there's no list of beliefs you have to endorse to enjoy the fiction here. Happy to have you.
