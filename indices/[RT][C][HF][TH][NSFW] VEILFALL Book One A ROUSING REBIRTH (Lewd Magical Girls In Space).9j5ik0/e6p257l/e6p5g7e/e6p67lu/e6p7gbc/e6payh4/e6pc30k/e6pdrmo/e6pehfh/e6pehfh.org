I'm well aware. The difference is that politically most works here aren't garbage. I also don't have nearly as much of a problem with yudkowsky, or LessWrong. I may not be so regular a commenter, but I read (present-tense) MoL, WTC, Practical Guide, and Worm, and have finished the waves arisen, HPMOR, Time Braid, Luminosity and its sequel, and probably some others that I've forgotten. I consider myself a member of this community, and I object to the notion that we're in the same group as these people who literally believe in racial science. If I'm wrong, then I've severely misjudged this community.
