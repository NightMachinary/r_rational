A moment ago you said the police weren't "blamed or portrayed badly for arresting him".

But to answer your question, if the other crime were dealt with with the same amount of tact used here, then yes, I would be quite bothered. Usually the bad cop functions as a commentary on the failings of the justice system. Here, they act as a strawman for the idea that you shouldn't have sex with your sixteen year old daughter.
