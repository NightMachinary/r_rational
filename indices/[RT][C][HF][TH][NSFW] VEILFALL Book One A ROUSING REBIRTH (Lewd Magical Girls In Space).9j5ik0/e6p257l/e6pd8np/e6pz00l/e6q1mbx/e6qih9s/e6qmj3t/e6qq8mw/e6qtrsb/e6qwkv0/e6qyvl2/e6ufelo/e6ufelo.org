I just read it, up to the end of that whole section. Definitely did not come off as "both sides in the wrong" by the text. I actually see her as on the path to villainy after she murdered the other magical girl, who was just being used by Beacon and thought she was helping. (Her coming back in a year doesn't actually help much, if someone killed you for just a year you would probably consider it an act akin to kidnapping and imprisonment at the very least)

I don't know if [[/u/Ephemeralen]] /intended/ that result, but that's how Eelesia comes off, and if the rest of the story treats her as a heroine, it's going to be hard for me to stay invested. It doesn't even really matter how oppressively rule-following Beacon is, if the character's response to people doing what's 99.99% of the time the right thing to do, particularly when they have no reason to think it's an exception, is to treat them like enemies, that character is just as much a danger to sane people everywhere, if not moreso.
