I understand that's the intention, but I'm letting you know that it's not how it came off to me. The fact that the cops are such assholes, so much so that she can telepathically tell, makes it feel like the story is /stacking the deck/ against any moral ambiguity. Like, it's the sort of thing that happens all the time in stories where the author is on a tract. That's what I meant by this being a "sense" that was tripped.

If I read Ayn Rand and the somehow every antagonist's facial features and stance and demeanor pseudo-magically communicates to the characters or readers that they're totally immoral and selfish creatures, then I feel like I'm reading a parable, not a story. The author is constructing strawmen in the place of antagonists to eliminate any chance of moral ambiguity.

If I read Terry Goodkind and a protagonist acts brazenly and with total confidence in situations where there should be some clear hesitation and uncertainty, then they're signalling irrationality. If they make moral decisions with that attitude, they are signalling immorality. When the story rewards these behaviors, it comes off as the author endorsing them.

There's a lot of subtle things that make something feel like an author tract, and it's very subjective, but to me, those chapters lit up the warning signs. I'm going to keep reading, but I wanted to communicate that, on initial read-through, this is the impression the story gave. Her being psychic doesn't matter, because /you/ wrote the cops to be the kind of cops where her being psychic would further eliminate moral ambiguity. It's not the character's perspective that matters, it's the choices of the author in framing situations and characters.

Does that make sense? It may not be what you intended, but it's how it comes off.

  I am curious which of the rationalfic rules you think the novel fails to follow. "it has a highly improbable premise / inciting incident" (which is what I take your use of "porn-logic" here to actually mean) is emphatically not on the list last I checked.

I meant that in porn/smut/etc, situations will usually resolve themselves in ways that eliminate moral ambiguity and allow the protagonists to continue enjoying consequence-free sex to continue the sexual fantasy (in the Erogamer this is explicitly an effect of her Ero stat), in a way that rationalfiction should try to avoid, the same way the results of living out a power fantasy should be realistically explored and have moral ambiguity and consequences.

Obviously you're not trying to make this situation "consequence free" since they presumably will have to deal with the whole police and Beacon thing moving forward, but that just sets up a conflict for a plot, it doesn't introduce consequences into the sexual relationship (unless the dad becomes traumatized by all this and runs away from his daughter or something. I'll amend my view on it if that happens, but as of current read-through I'm just letting you know how it comes off to me).

(Also I want to stress that a single "infraction" against rational fiction ideals doesn't automatically make the story not a rational fic, but it's still worth pointing out if that's the goal)
