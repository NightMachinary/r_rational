So I just read up to that part of the story, and I think I agree with [[/u/TempAccountIgnorePls]]. It definitely trips my "this is presented as okay but objectively shouldn't be" sense.

#+begin_quote
  a) The daughter is (functionally) an independent adult.
#+end_quote

In what way? She's 16, so still a minor dependent on him for housing, food, etc.

#+begin_quote
  b) The daughter is a superpowered magical girl, reversing the typical power structures.
#+end_quote

She was not yet a magical girl when the relationship formed.

#+begin_quote
  c) The daughter is an empath, who coaxes her father into the relationship because she can feel how much it actually means to him despite trying to repress those feelings.
#+end_quote

Same as above. She didn't get her powers until after.

As for the cops, it doesn't really matter /why/ they were there, they still had evidence that a father was having sex with his 16 year old daughter and were written as villains. There's no /actual/ misleading information they were given, other than that she consented, which is not relevant to the law anyway. If a ~35 year old man has sex with a 16 year old girl, it doesn't matter if she consented, it's still statutory rape. That he's her father makes things worse, but it's still a crime that they had evidence was being committed.

Writing them as cruel thugs adds nothing to moral argument and doesn't actually justify the response of the "heroine." Any other cop would have involved child protective services regardless of what the daughter said, and they would have been right to do so. Grooming is a thing that happens in real life to real people.

Don't get me wrong, if I'm viewing the whole thing through porn-logic it totally works. But as rationalfiction, not so much.
