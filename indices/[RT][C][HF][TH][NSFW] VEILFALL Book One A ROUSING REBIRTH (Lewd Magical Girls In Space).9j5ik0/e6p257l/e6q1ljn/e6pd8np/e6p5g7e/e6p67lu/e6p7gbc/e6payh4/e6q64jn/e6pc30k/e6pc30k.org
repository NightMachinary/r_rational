That's a much better use of the phrase, but I don't think that's how it was meant in this case. Regardless, regarding Slatestar: It's basically a fan forum for Scott Alexander, Right? That's what it says in the sidebar anyway, more or less.

[[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Scott_Alexander][This]] is his rational wiki page. He's arguably an anti-feminist. He's also a proponent of "human biodiversity" which is common code for Racialism: the idea that the races of humanity are different enough that they have different abilities, which is pseudo-scientific bull pushed by racists since the 1700s to dehumanize non-white people, and has been actively debunked since the 30s. If the section on his views on communism is correct, then he's also terribly misinformed on that, as he's criticizing a ridiculous strawman.

Altogether, seems like not the sort of person I'd like the fans of. More like a youtube "rationalist" than an actual rationalist.
