So I feel the need to chime in here, because after reading the rational wiki page, it strikes me as shining a significantly biased light on him - I am not an active commenter on SSC, but I find the articles are well-written and aimed at finding the truth of the matter at hand. Certainly without shying away from uncomfortable subjects, and there is a general spirit of "taking even the craziest worldview seriously for the sake of debate, as long as everyone remains respectful". This obviously doesn't always work, since this is the internet and all, but I find it still more productive than two sides of an argument not communicating at all and/or screaming obscenities at each other, which seems to be the default when it comes to politics.

Personally, while I don't agree with Scott Alexander on numerous issues, I find his arguments are usually well-reasoned and the articles rather thought-provoking. For me, reading the blog has been educational, both for understanding political views that differ significantly from my own, as well as odd but interesting topics of medical science, statistics and so on. While your mileage may vary, I would recommend you take an actual look at some of the articles to form an opinion on the blog, the wiki page does not seem like a great basis for that.
