  But the thing is that any case where there's any genetic variation within a group, inevitably leads to variation between the averages of different groups, even if there's significant overlap between the sets as a whole.

Sure, but there's such a thing as statistical fluctuations. We can calculate their likelihoods too, and they would not be constant - just an accident of who's alive at a given moment. Any significant measurement would need to be more consistent than that.

To expect that, if I took all black people existing right now, and all white people existing right now, I'd get /exactly the same average IQ/ would be ridiculous. But if I took any number of completely random subsets of these two groups I expect the differences between the two averages to be random themselves. I'm not enough of an expert to remember all the formulas by heart but I know methods to compensate for this effect exist. If someone were to publish a paper arguing that one race has an IQ higher than another they would have to show that their result is /statistically significant/ - namely, that it exceeds these sort of random fluctuations. Otherwise it tells us nothing but an historical accident. Racism is grounded in thinking there is a /consistent/ difference rooted in genetics.
