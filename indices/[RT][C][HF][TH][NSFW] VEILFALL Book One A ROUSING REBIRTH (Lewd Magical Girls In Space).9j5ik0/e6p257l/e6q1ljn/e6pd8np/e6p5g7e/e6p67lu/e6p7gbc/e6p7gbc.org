I'm not sure how close the association is, honestly, but if you follow the link to the previous rational thread on this topic, which is in OP's comment, then you find quick links to SlateStar. I might still read it and give it a chance, but I'm wary of even tenuous connections. Plus, the author used the phrase "Politics is the mind-killer" to partially dismiss concerns someone had over a part of the story, which is, frankly, the most privileged position one can take. The people that can afford to dismiss politics so completely are not the ones that the status quo hurts.
