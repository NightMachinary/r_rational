Maybe you just misjudged scott instead ?. Like if you think that p(people here are racist |people here read slate star codex)is high .

And that p(a lot of people here are racist ) Is really low .

If someone tell you there is a lot of overlap between the communities maybe you should be udapting in the thing you have less evidence of , aka Scott being horrible , since your only source is a rationalwiki article (which isn't always the most reliable thing )
