I don't think the story ever suggests that the police were bad for /arresting him/. I guess I look at their after-arrest treatment of her and the father as a separate thing - there they are portrayed badly, but it's a common and grounded in reality trope that the police really aren't doing there job to help you, they have their own goals.

  Here, they act as a strawman for the idea that you shouldn't have sex with your sixteen year old daughter.

I guess I never got that impression. It feels like a very false dillema. Of course you shouldn't have sex with your sixteen year old daughter (though if you're being mind-whammied into it, I'm not sure where moral responsibility lies). At the same time the sex offender system is insane, and will happily destroy lives of the 'offenders' even when the relation was fully consensual and moral (remember when teenagers exchanging selfies were charged with child porn possession?).
