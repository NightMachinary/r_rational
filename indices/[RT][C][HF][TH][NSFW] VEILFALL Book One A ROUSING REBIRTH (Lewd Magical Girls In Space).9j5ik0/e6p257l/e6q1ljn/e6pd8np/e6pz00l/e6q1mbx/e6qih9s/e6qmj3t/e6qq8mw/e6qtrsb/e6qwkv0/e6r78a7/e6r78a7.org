It's been a while since I read it but I think the story acknowledges at some point that in the vast majority of incest cases, the police would have been right to act and would have been preventing abuse.

If the author is choosing a 'hill to die on', I think it's not about incest, but um, against the rigidity of rule-systems? I'm actually a rule-utilitarian, so I'd probably oppose him on this - rigid rules can seem more tyrannical, but they can also protect against corruption or self-justifications for the sake of personal convenience.

But I'd guess I see Ephemeral as more a pure consequentialist, where he wants each individual case treated on its own merits, not any hard-set rules.
