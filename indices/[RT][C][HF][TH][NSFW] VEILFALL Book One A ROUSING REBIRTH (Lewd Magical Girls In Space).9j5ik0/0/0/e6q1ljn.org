Edit: I mixed up part of the timeline of events. See posts below.

--------------

Since the author didn't deign to actually address it, here is a spoilery summary of how I recall that happening, and how it slots into the larger story.

tl;dr: It can be considered a consensual relationship between two adults without one having power over the other.

1. A large part of the story is about sexual moral edge cases. This is one of the cases where it was intentionally constructed to appear superficially repulsive and clear cut to "normal" morality, with the particulars shifting into moral ambiguity. Note: /Ambiguity/, not moral rightness.

2. The protagonist in particular can be considered a hardcore pro-sex fanatic and missionary. In effect, the sexual aspects of every situation, no matter how horrifying, are automatically contextualized into something positive.

3. The incident itself pretty heavily started off with porn logic. This /lessens/ its impact quite a bit, at least to me. Specifically, The father sleepwalks into the daughter's bed, mistakes her for his dead wife and then has sex with her while remaining unconscious. Also, the typical father-daughter relationship paradigma don't apply here, since a) The daughter is (functionally) an independent adult. b) The daughter is a superpowered magical girl, reversing the typical power structures. c) The daughter is an empath, who coaxes her father into the relationship because she can feel how much it actually means to him despite trying to repress those feelings.

4. The cops were there because The magical girl's mascot society decided to mess with the girl. The cops that came were chosen for seeing themselves as puritanical moral guardians, not as law enforcers. They were also given misleading information.

My personal judgement:

I dislike the porn logic that starts it off, since it lessens how seriously I take it. The whole thing feels kind of fake to me as a result. I also felt uncomfortable when the daughter tried to sort-of seduce her father. (I don't recall the details.) It felt like she was talking him into something that he didn't really want, even if it obviously turned out alright for them. Lastly, the cops being effectively parodies didn't help make it feel more real. It did fit the theme of how the magical girl mascot society impacts the world. Kind of similar to how the witches in PMMM are comical exaggerations of real life things
