It is /presented/ from the deuteragonist's /point of view/. Nothing more. Nothing less.

I could say more, but I really don't think there would be any point.

I /am/ curious which of the rationalfic rules you think the novel fails to follow. "it has a highly improbable premise / inciting incident" (which is what I take your use of "porn-logic" here to actually mean) is emphatically /not/ on the list last I checked.
