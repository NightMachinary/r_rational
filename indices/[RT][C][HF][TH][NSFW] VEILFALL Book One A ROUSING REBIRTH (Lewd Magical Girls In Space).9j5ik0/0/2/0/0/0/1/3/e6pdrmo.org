  Regarding Slatestar: It's basically a fan forum for Scott Alexander, Right?
#+end_quote

Well, slatestarcodex.com is Scott's blog. The subreddit [[/r/slatestarcodex][r/slatestarcodex]] is a forum that discusses topics related to things Scott has mentioned on his blog so that's kind of close to a fan forum, I suppose. At any rate, while I disagree with much of what rational wiki has to say about Scott, I'd prefer not to engage in an argument on those points at the moment.

However, I do think that you should be made aware that Scott-style "rational" is more representative of the kind of "rational" this subreddit tends to endorse.

+We're all part of the same cult.+ Both this subreddit and Scott's blog trace back to LessWrong. Eliezer Yudkowsky wrote the core texts of "LessWrong" and "Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality." Scott, known as Yvain on LessWrong, started SlateStarCodex as a sort of spin-off from the articles he wrote there. This "rational" subreddit is a spin-off from HPMOR. So we share the same roots of LessWrong-style rationality. This subreddit is a fiction branch, and SlateStarCodex is a (mostly) nonfiction branch, but we're all part of the same "rationalist" group (none of us like the name) which is often opposed to the "rational" views presented by rational wiki. So... beware of the not-so-tenuous connection, I guess.
