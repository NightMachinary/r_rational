I don't know the context in which the phrase "politics is the mind-killer" was used that you're referring to, but if it was used dismissively, it was likely misused. [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9weLK2AJ9JEt2Tt8f/politics-is-the-mind-killer][The article where the phrase was popularized]] never said you shouldn't think about politics, only that political opinions are especially prone to biased thinking and that, as such, you shouldn't use political opinions as examples when trying to teach/learn how to think rationally. As the article says,

#+begin_quote
  Politics is an important domain to which we should individually apply our rationality---but it's a terrible domain in which to learn rationality, or discuss rationality, unless all the discussants are already rational.

Out of curiosity, is there anything in particular that makes you wary of SlateStarCodex? I'm a little surprised to see someone who presumably likes rational fiction that thinks SlateStarCodex ought to be avoided. In particular, "I'm wary of even tenuous connections" seems odd. This whole subreddit is at least a /tenuous/ connection.
