A lot of us are really interested in tracking brain science, and speculating about brain uploads/emulations/artificial intelligence. I've always felt that the predictions people made about how this stuff would progress was naive, though. [[https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/01/brain-cells-can-share-information-using-a-gene-that-came-from-viruses/550403/][Recent news]] seems to validate that opinion, as it turns out that there's an entire rna capsule based messaging system that's independently evolved in everything from mammals to fish to insects, and seems to be critical for long term memory formation.

What's everyone's take on this? Does anyone think we'll be seeing advances in AI from investigating this? What does everyone hunk about how this pushes the feasibility of uploading, considering his is probably one of dozens of similar black box process necessary for brain emulations?
