That's actually slightly explicable, it turns out that a lot of neurotransmitters are manufactured by our microbiome, such as 90% of our bodies serotonin [[http://www.caltech.edu/news/microbes-help-produce-serotonin-gut-46495][(link)]]. Of course, considering that some scientists have called the gut a second brain, and the interdependence of the cns and peripheral nervous system, the gut probably plays a large part in helping to regulate the brain.

I do think that consciousness entirely resides in the brain, and everything else is just a support system for that, important as it is to healthiness and happiness.
