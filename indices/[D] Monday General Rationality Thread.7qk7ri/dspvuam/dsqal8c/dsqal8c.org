If I plan to make a post, I typically write it up in Google Docs beforehand (on my computer, at home) and then copy-and-paste it into a Reddit comment on Friday (from my phone, before eating lunch at work). I also use [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.keep&hl=en][Google Keep]] to remind myself to add a topic to the Google Doc in the evening.
