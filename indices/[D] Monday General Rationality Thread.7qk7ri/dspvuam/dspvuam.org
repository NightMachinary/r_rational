When I think of something to post, I often forget it, or forget to post, when the appropriate thread comes along, so nowadays I write the post up ahead of time and email it to myself (I have three chains, one each for Rationality, Worldbuilding, and Off-Topic).

Do you all write your posts the day that the thread appears, or do some of you write your posts out ahead of time or at least mark down that there's something that you want to mention?
