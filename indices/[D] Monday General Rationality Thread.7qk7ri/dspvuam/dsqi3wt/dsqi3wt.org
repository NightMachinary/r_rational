it's funny you post this because I was thinking last night "oo I have some writing advice i want to ask for, I'll post it in the general rationality thread i guess because it's rational writing so i can get away with it", and I came on here to post it because I remembered I had something to post but I forgot what I actually wanted to post.

So I think I'm going to have to start trying your strategy.

Sometimes if it's a day late I'll post it in the thread anyway; this reddit is small enough that my posts in that category do seem to get seen.
