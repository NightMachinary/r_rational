I actually think it's an interesting idea that could potentially teach AI how to create art, or at least RPG campaigns. I don't see it as any more risky than any other optimization AI project, which I'm plenty concerned about for the near future economic and sociological impact, but side with Robin Hanson on which singularity scenario is more likely.
