What do ya'll think about shorting Bitcoin?

Let's say it's a huge bubble; would short selling have an unusually large expected return, or would efficient market hypothesis and a lot of big investors also expecting a bubble counterbalance all of the cryptocurrency mania and leave the investment no better (and much riskier) than an index fund for an average investor?

If not, how would an average person actually go about shorting a cryptocurrency?
