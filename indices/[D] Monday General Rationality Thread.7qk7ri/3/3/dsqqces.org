The only time you should short something is if...

1) You know something bad about the investment that no one else does.

2) You have the credibility/evidence to prove it to people who have a ton of money.

Otherwise, it makes much more sense to just sell what you have, and put your money somewhere else.

Right now, if you want to get into cryptocurrencies, but think Bitcoin isn't going to be the "currency of the future" then I'd suggest buying some Litecoin, Monero, and Ether.

Never buy with money that you can't afford to lose, especially with cryptocurrencies.
