You could buy the right to sell a bitcoin at or before a specified date at a specified price, also called a put option. Seems you can, for instance, buy a 6000$ put option for the 30th of march for about 300$, which would net you about 2700$ if the bitcoin price drops to 3000$ by then, and lose you 300$ if it stays above 6000$.
