Here's [[/u/alexanderwales]] 's book recommendation for the week:

This week I'm recommending the [[http://amzn.to/2kC4YGt][Merchant Princes]] series by Charles Stross. The story starts as a fairly standard portal fantasy, but it's a heavily deconstructionist take on the genre. For one, Miriam Beckstein is a thirty-something tech journalist rather than a teenager or author stand-in. For another, there's a heavy focus on socio-cultural matters rather than raw exploitation of technology. The ending, which I'll leave unspoiled, was my favorite part of the book, but one of the thigns I really appreciated was that in terms of exploitation, this was a lived-in world, where the clan of world-walkers had already tried all the obvious stuff, and where strategies and counter-strategies had been deployed back and forth for years by the time the protagonist finally shows up. Stross, as always, shows a heavy attention to detail in the way he writes, which sometimes verges on being detrimental to the work, but for me, strikes just the right balance.

There are six books in the series, or three if you're reading the condensed versions; the Merchant Princes series has the benefit of being complete, so you can race straight through it if you'd like.
