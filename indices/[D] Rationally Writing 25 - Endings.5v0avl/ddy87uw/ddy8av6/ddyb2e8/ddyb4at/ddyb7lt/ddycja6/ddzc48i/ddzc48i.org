Hah! You could try practicing a radio voice instead. Perhaps try inviting a third person into podcasts occasionally for additional discussion?

It's actually a thing that radio personalities will do during their show. While they're having a conversation, they'll say a joke, making fun of so and so

"Ha, then Taylor spilled her drink all over the guy she was trying to woo at the bar"

And then she'll say something like "HEY, I tripped, and he was with a girl already, serves him right!" That way you as a listener can always know who is who. I don't know if it's deliberate or not but it happens frequently enough that I'm pretty sure it is deliberate.
