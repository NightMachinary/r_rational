There's several examples of physical zeerust in the book, like how there was still physical film in their cameras and their pocket computers were unusually slow searching ship records. Edit: And how did I forget that the messages used telegraph style punctuation?!

But honestly, the gender roles depicted in the book didn't feel that dated alongside how the second human empire was a multi-planet heuristical monarchy with some form of Christian church support. The gender roles were there, but they weren't cripplingly rigid, just look at the heiress who decided to go into anthropology, and then onwards to successfully getting a place on the Mote Expedition.
