I agree that there's missing women (Among robots too! Feminine Intuition is fun and gets in some good satire, but doesn't make the leap that maybe some people will just want to buy ordinary robots with contralto voices), but that's par for the course. At the time Asimov was writing interesting stories with Susan Calvin, Ursula LeGuin was still writing entirely-male Earthsea novels (Left Hand of Darkness was 1969, same year as the latter Calvinist story Feminine Intuition). The main thing I appreciate is that the ones there were written as interesting people (or at least at the same rate as the men, they can't all be winners :P), and the relationships they had with other people seem, well, plausibly modern.

And I'd add Selene and Dua (sort of? Maybe Tritt would fit also/instead, but they are gender nonbinary and also boring, while Dua seems to be written as a woman) from The Gods Themselves. (Which was published in 1972, while Mote is from 1974)
