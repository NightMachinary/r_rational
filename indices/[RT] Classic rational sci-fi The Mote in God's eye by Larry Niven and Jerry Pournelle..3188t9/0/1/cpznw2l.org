A movie based on this book would be incredible - if done well. It would have to be carefully done though, because if done true to the book, the warrior Moties would be very, very frightening, Close to 'Alien' frightening, and might easily overpower the rest of the movie.

In fact I'm rather surprised I've never seen a Motie warrior vs Alien or Predator fiction. /wanders off to google/
