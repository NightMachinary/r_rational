*ROOM OUTSIDE OF TIME*

I was tinkering with this plot device/scenario:

You find an old doorknob. Whenever you press the doorknob against any surface, and turn it, it opens a door of the size and shape that you want. The door leads to a room outside of time.

- only you, or inanimate objects can enter the room. No other people or live animals

- when you are inside the room, the time does not pass outside

- when you are outside the room, no time passes inside

- the room is 100x100x100m, with walls floor and ceiling made of infinitely thick concrete

- the room has all the amenities (sewer, water, gas, electric) that seem to come and go towards infinity (there is no known end to the pipes and cables, and they never run out).

- the room is otherwise empty

- you do not age in the room, cannot die within it, and are healed within seconds from any injury (healed to perfect state not previous state)

- there can be only one door leading in or out.

- while the door is opened, the time in and out is unified. It only disconnects while the door is closed.
