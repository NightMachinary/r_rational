If the sewers and cables go on forever that seems to be an infinite source of material, even if you don't strip the fixtures one could farm arbitrary quantities of food effectively immediately, this along with the endless water could allow you to support a moderate community with stuff you take out. It could also be used to supply an interplanetary voyage, even without using it for supplies it seems to violate conservation of momentum, by opening the door at the end of a rotating tether and moving a large weight out of the room for half the rotation and back in for the other half one could get free energy and thrust. There's an incredible amount one can do with a nigh endless source of time, one can learn new skills, work on things without the stress of deadlines, take time to become at peace with things, of course one does need to socialize but having the door would help on that front by giving more opportunities.

The healing aspect might be the most valuable, you'd be able to perform experimentation otherwise banned on safety grounds.

And of course performing arbitarily large amounts of computing in moments is valuable.
