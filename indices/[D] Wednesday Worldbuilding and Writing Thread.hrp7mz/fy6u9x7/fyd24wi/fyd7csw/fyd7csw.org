I think there's definitely a way to write a rational version of the movie's premise, but the twist wouldn't be preserved if the characters tried to contact each other directly. Using experiments to get a handle on the limits of the phenomenon, reduce its impact and figure out the source is a ready-made structure for a ratfic.

The twist also creates a window of opportunity for exploitation of the bodyswap mechanic, sending information backwards through time. Paradoxes seem to be allowed.
