I thought I replied to this but it seems not, anyway. The infinite propultion idea comes from this: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lnvh08GBOII]], It couldn't be exactly the same but the same principle could be used to violate both conservation of motion and conservation of energy by pulling out a large weight while the door in a room on the end of a tether is going the right direction and put it back in and closing the door when it's going the other direction. Even without this an infinite source of water as reaction mass would be incredibly useful. A nuclear reactor could provide heat and the coolant being launched out would make cooling it easier.

It would make getting stuff into orbit much easier as the ship would just need to carry you and the doorknob regardless of how much is in the room.

It'd also be possible to use it to grow food, I'm not sure but it might be possible to grow more than enough food for one person and that means that having you act as a farmer could support any number of people although the time spent literally watching plants grow might lead to psychological issues over long term.
