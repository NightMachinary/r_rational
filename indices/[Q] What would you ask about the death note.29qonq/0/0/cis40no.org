  Can the Death Note ensure that the past (from before the command was written) is in conformance with the required result? What if I write that in 30 seconds someone will die from atherosclerosis or an advanced brain cancer? This doesn't distinguish well between the atherosclerosis having been retroactively added, or just magically materalized, but there may be other ways to check.
#+end_quote

It cannot.

    The conditions for death will not be realized unless it is physically possible for that human or it is reasonably assumed to be carried out by that human.

      If you write die of disease with a specific disease's name and the person's time of death, there must be a sufficient amount of time for the disease to progress. If the set time is too tight, the victim will die of a heart attack after 6 minutes and 40 seconds after completing the Death Note.

In the second episode of the anime Light tests this; he tries to kill a Japanese prisoner "one hour later in Paris". Since it's physically impossible for him to be transported to Paris in that time by current technology, and the Death Note has a limited span of action, he just dies of a heart attack.

  Can the Death Note reveal facts via its operation? What are the limits of what it can reveal? E.g, "Bob dies of a heart attack if the Goldbach Conjecture is true, or Bob dies of a stroke if the Goldbach Conjecture is false." "Bob dies after jotting down a critical insight into proving the Riemann Hypothesis."

It is not established. However, the same episode, along with the previously mentioned rules, suggest that it wouldn't be possible unless the person can think of it. There is also this rule:

  #+begin_quote
    Suicide is a valid cause of death. Basically, all humans are thought to possess the possibility to commit suicide. It is, therefore, not something unbelievable to think of.

which suggests that your second example might be plausible, if Bob is a trained scientis who can reasonably reach that conclusion by his own means; but since the first example works on hypothesis instead of factual knowledge, the Death Note would simply kill him with a heart attack.

  How much optimization can the Death Note do to achieve the desired outcome? "Bob is killed by Device X functioning as intended." Device X uses a thermodynamic random noise generator to try to solve an NP-hard problem and fires a bullet if it succeeds. (If that works, try it on a protein folding problem and get nanotechnology.)

This one might actually work, but the device would have to fit the limits of reasonable thought. Since you cannot make a human murder another one intentionally, you would need science geniuses willing to give their lives for science. The most plausible scenario that I can think of (that could succeed) is this:

1. Make a scientist (Dave) build a prototype. If it doesn't work, go to step 2.

2. Organise the lab in a way that success starts a chain reaction that kills the guy.

3. Write on the Note: "Dave. [time of death]. Goes to work and analyses his prototype. Figures out the problem with it and fixes it. He tests it and the device works as intended. The device starts a chain reaction [describe reaction in detail within the limits of reasonable thought]. The last step kills him without suffering."

4. If it doesn't work, Dave will die of a heart attack, which means he wasn't able to fix the device. Kill a few more scientists until you a) find one who can do it or b) the utilitarian value of the device is outweighed by the utilitarian value of the scientists' lives (which, depending on the device and the scientists, is totally subjective).

By the way, big fan, waiting for chapter 102.
