The critical questions about the Death Note are what it can achieve in terms of optimization, fact-revealing, the limits of the channels by which it can alter reality, and what the Death Note's existence reveals about the rest of reality. The fact that the Death Note kills people is a distraction, the critical point is that it's MAGIC. So, sample questions:

- Can the Death Note ensure that the past (from before the command was written) is in conformance with the required result? What if I write that in 30 seconds someone will die from atherosclerosis or an advanced brain cancer? This doesn't distinguish well between the atherosclerosis having been retroactively added, or just magically materalized, but there may be other ways to check.

- Can the Death Note reveal facts via its operation? What are the limits of what it can reveal? E.g, "Bob dies of a heart attack if the Goldbach Conjecture is true, or Bob dies of a stroke if the Goldbach Conjecture is false." "Bob dies after jotting down a critical insight into proving the Riemann Hypothesis."

- How much optimization can the Death Note do to achieve the desired outcome? "Bob is killed by Device X functioning as intended." Device X uses a thermodynamic random noise generator to try to solve an NP-hard problem and fires a bullet if it succeeds. (If that works, try it on a protein folding problem and get nanotechnology.)

If there's a Shinigami who might answer you, there are all sorts of questions which are worth at least trying to ask, like:

- What the hell is going on
- Why do Shinigami exist
- Do Shinigami have brains and how do the brains work
- What is the nature of magic and how does it fit into a universe that sure looked like it ran on mathematically simple laws up until this point
- What is the earliest event that Shinigami remember
- How did Shinigami come into existence
- Are there other realms like those of the Shinigami
- Are there other interesting artifacts in the world besides Death Notes
- What determines whether or not you can answer one of my questions
- Are there beings (or nonbeings) who can answer more of my questions
- Are there any books I should read about this stuff
- If some rule prevents you from answering me directly, are you allowed to do hints
- Are there any behaviors you can exhibit which can correlate to the answers of my questions
- What would potentially motivate you to give me hints, is there anything I have that you might want, can we trade utility function fulfillments

I finally remark that it seems to me that if the canon rules are not artificially hacked to forbid it, the canon Death Note has demonstrated enough power to fulfill the command, "Bob dies of a quiet stroke in a bathroom stall of the following club, brought on by the excitement of seeing on his cellphone that his lottery ticket has the winning numbers." Then take the ticket and go.
