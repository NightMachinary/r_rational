Seems to me that if you're trying to test "can it provide facts", the first question to try to answer is "how do I resurrect someone using not more than X amount of resources (energy / equipment / time / information)?"

If you can get the answer to that, then you have an engine -- kill and then resurrect people in order to gain more information, more lottery wins, etc.
