I think that in canon, you can take out as many pages as you want, there will always be some left. Knowing this, I would wonder if it's possible to destroy the death note. E.g. What happens if I burn it, or make it wet or put it in acid?

Is it important who writes in it? If it's in my possession, will it still work for someone who accidentally finds it?

And knowing that loosing possesion of the death note will remove it from my memories, what happens to my memories if I destroy the death note?

A silly question, but what if a blind person had found a death note? Would it be useless, because he/she can't picture the face (I assume he/she could still write on it in some form)?

Can I use the death note via printer (instead of writing by hand), if I think about the relevant face when I click 'print'?
