- What are its limits?
- Can it be exhausted besides filling it?
- Do names have to be one per line, or can I squeeze names in any size and orientation?
- Do I have to write in it, or I could I print microdots?
- Wow, how violent and death-hungry do I sound right now?
- What evidence does it leave?
- Are there more, and in whose hands?
- Who knows I have this?
- How long does it take to work?
- Can I give any of the person's names? Many people have nicknames they are known by to the exclusion of their birth names, or their legal names. ([[http://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/][more]])
- If I can only write their legal name, what is the connection between the government and the death note?
- Can I change my name in a way that makes it impossible to write in a death note?
- Are all deaths written in death notes?
- - lots of questions exploring shinigami, other deities and supernatural entities, the physics behind them, dualism, the afterlife, cosmology, etc.

I think the "you can write their method of death (and be quite elaborate and mind-controlling)" rule is a big topic from the series that doesn't come up automatically from the prompt you've given. Same with time of death.
