I always wondered about loopholes to escape the Death Note. What if you could use someone's birth name if they had a legal name change. Do you use the new name? What if they're finalizing their name change while you're writing their name down?

What if you write someone's name and the default heart attack can't kill them because they're currently on bypass? Related, what if you're technically dead during an intense brain surgery while your name is written down?

How do you use the death note to kill someone who's native language is one that doesn't use letters, like the click/pop language of some isolated tribes?

What if someone literally was never given a name, possibly for intentionally avoiding being killed by the Note? Like, an orphanage similar to the one Near and Mello were raised in, but none of the children ever had birth certificates and were never called a name ("you, in the red shirt...").

Is the death necessarily permanent? What if you're set up for ideal crionic preservation at the time of death?

Lastly, since the notebook never runs out of pages, I always liked to imagine sitting by a fire place, throwing one page in after another for hours. Could this be harnessed to create lots of (very dirty) energy?
