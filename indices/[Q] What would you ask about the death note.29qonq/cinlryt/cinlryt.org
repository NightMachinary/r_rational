Well, I would try and coax the Shinigami into telling me about stuff other than death gods and death notes that exist but which humans don't seem to know about. Basically, I would want to make absolutely sure there is no way I could extend my life or get additional powers before I started using the death note. Because if one very supernatural thing exists, there may be more.

More specifically about the death note, I would definitely make sure I found out all I could about the following: Do scraps of paper removed still work? Can I write on the same page several times, writing over text I have already written to kill someone else? Because if so, I could have a relatively small scrap of paper, filled with so much ink that no one would be able to easily read the text on it, and then just reuse it at will. Smaller = better.

Will the death note ever run out? (Seemingly no) - excellent. If I rip out page after page after page, can I generate an arbitrarily high number of pages, each of which still works? Because if so, I can write someone's name in the book, and instruct them to write down the names of [category of people to murder] and send them a few pages, which they are instructed to destroy after use. Makes it that much harder to identify me.

I suppose I would also ask if it were possible for me, while alive, to get into the Shinigami realm (and then return to the human realm), because I'm sure that would make it easier to gather information. Downside: The king might not like it, and he might have a book that can kill me even though I have a note book.
