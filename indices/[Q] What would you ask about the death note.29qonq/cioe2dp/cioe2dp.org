What if your handwriting really sucks? What if you spell the name wrong, or if the name doesn't have a spelling? Can I kill a person who doesn't have a face? If I change my name to contain syllables un-writable in any language, and/or i remove my face or wear a permanent mask, am I immune to death notes?

Can I kill animals? If I can /see/ them, can I kill stuff like single celled organisms and cancers?

Can I use my foreknowledge of what will happen in the future to reverse entropy, Maxwell's demon style? Because I'm /pretty/ sure that magic knowledge of the future would allow one to reverse entropy.

If I write a time of death which exceeds the time at which they otherwise would have died, does it prolong the person's life? Does the rule against extending people's lives apply to me? (I guess not, since Light probably extended a few lives by killing murderers)

Can I write things like "so and so lives as he would and dies at the normal time, except now he can't commit murders due to spontaneous compulsions to turn around and go home"?

The Shinigami Eyes can see how long you're "supposed" to live naturally, and Shinigami must structure deaths so as not to /lengthen/ anyone's time (That seems /really/ hard, one might easily do it by accident without lots of foreknowledge. Shinigami live precarious lives). Anyway, presumably, the "supposed to live" time does not factor in Death Notes used by Shinigami. Does the calculation of how long people are /supposed/ to live factor in death notes used by Humans on Earth?

Can I use the Death Note to make other humans write on Death Notes?
