I am fairly certain he's writing Misa's questions to Rem, and Misa seems to be a rational person in the sense of Less Wrong. So the attempt is to figure out how someone with a similar mindset but who was ignorant of all the rules of the Death Note would go about figuring them out, without testing it, as sane people might have a moral opposition to killing people to test the limits.

Here are a few from me, specifically about how to break it like a handheld time machine given to children. These assume I am Misa and know what she knows:

Is there a time limit on the Death Note? Can I write my own name for example and write 'Dies peacefully in her sleep in 1 billion AD'?

Is someone whose name and type of death is written immune to dying in any other manner and at any other time before?

I already know it is possible to extend life with the Death Note, from experience. Do humans suffer the same fate that shinigami do if they do it?

What are the physical limits of controlling people before death with the Death Note? Will they teleport across the world if you write it?

What are the ancillary limits? If you kill someone who theoretically was in DC, and you wrote 'dies with the original copy of the Declaration of Independence in his hands', would the note arrange for that to happen?

How does the Death Note kill people? Is it possible to reverse it?

As the above, is it physical death, instant brain death, or some kind of dualism soul rip?

Actually, while we are at it. Souls? Afterlife? Get as much as possible. I just found out most of my axioms about reality aren't. I need more information.

Does the Death Note have to target people? I know shinigami are immune, but what about animals? Concepts? Physical objects?

Can the Death Note create information? What limits? If I try to get a physicist to solve an equation, an then get a high school dropout to do the same, will either or both get an answer? What if it is an unanswered major problem (GUT?)

Basically thinking in this vein. The incidental powers of the note are much, much more interesting to an extropian than the death effect.
