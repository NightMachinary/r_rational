When a shinagami kills someone with the deathnote they get their life added on to their own. So is lifeforce tangible via some sort of liquid assets system? And if so, where does the life go when a mortal uses it to kill (or perhaps the life extension for shinigami is just an arbitrary incentive to do their jobs occasionally.)?

If a shinagami using it to extend lives is lethal to them, what happens if a mortal uses it to extend lives?

Whats so special about humans to the death note? Could it be used to kill an uploaded consciousness? A strong AI? Any other sapient being with a cultural tenancy to choose a name? Can a human ever have no Name?

Also the death note constitutes a bit of supernatural mind control. But the limits of this aren't really clear... I'm pretty sure the original limit was anything they could reasonably be expected to do. Which was vague. Can I make a tech official change his password to something I know and open a firewall hole to a specified IP? These are the sorts of things I'd expect to have to test myself rather than ask rules for though.

Also: You're picking our minds for ideas aren't you! You sneaky fanfic author you.
