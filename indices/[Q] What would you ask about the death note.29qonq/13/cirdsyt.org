1a) Is karma real? 1b) Can I gain karma by using the death note to end heinous individuals?

2a) Are there any direct costs, immediate or delayed, that I will be responsible for if I using the death note, other than the psychological ones associated with a choice to kill another person? 2b) If there are costs, can I consult with the shinigami to learn what those costs would be for any specific person?

3a) Are my contributions to the deaths that I cause traceable? 3b) If so, what are the names of the people who can trace it?

4) How many death notes are there?

5) Does the death note seek to avoid collateral damage? For example: If I write an airline pilot's name in the note, does the note care about if the pilot is flying a plane with passengers at the time of their death?
