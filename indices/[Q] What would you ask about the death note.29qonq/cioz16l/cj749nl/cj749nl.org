How would that work? Does it create new people? Does it resurrect dead people? If so? Does it reanimate (what's left of) their corpse or create them as they were right before dying? Both would suck. Imagine writing someone's name in the Life Note who died while on fire. If it brought them back to where there were right before dying, they'd be ruined, pain-wracked bodies.
