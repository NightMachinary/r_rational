Is a death note death compatible with cryonics? May a person who has died of a heart attack due to the death note be resuscitated with a defibrillator and live a normal life? Can the death note be used to arrange for a form of death that increases the effectiveness of cryonics (and if so, what are the limits)? May eventual reanimation via future science be specified as an aspect of the death?

How about undeath? Can a person be killed in a way that makes them reanimate as a magical being? Without loss of personality?

Could conditional descriptions of death be used on terminally ill people undergoing a clinical trial to capture better data, e.g. making them die of one cause if the drug is ineffective and of a different cause (or not at all) if the drug is effective?

What are the limits on the definition of "human" -- is it possible to name a human tumor, draw a smiley face on it, and write its death via the host's immune system?
