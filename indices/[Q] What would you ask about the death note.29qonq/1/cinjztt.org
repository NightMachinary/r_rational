Do torn-out pages remain effective?

- If yes:\\
  If I burn a page, will anyone exposed to the smoke become able to see shinigami?

- If no:\\
  If I tear out a page after writing a name but before the named person dies, does this cancel the killing?

What happens if I specify a time/date of death later than the named person would have died otherwise?

- If this would extend their lifespan: Can I use this on myself to cheat out of the cost of the Eyes of the Shinigami?

If I write new rules on the part of the note that explains some of the rules, do my new rules take effect?
