If a person relinquishes his or her Death Note, does that allow another person with the Eyes of the Shinigami to see his or her lifespan?

(If allowed, then there's suddenly a solution to not knowing your own lifespan. If the blindness effect is permanent however, then suddenly we have a way of telling conclusively whether a person has used a Death Note before.)
