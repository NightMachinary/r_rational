I would want to know what name the death note uses to kill people: Legal name, name the victim cinsiders themselves to be, name the victim was given at birth, name the most people think the victim's name is, some sort of True Name. Once I know the rules I would want to know how to subvert them. One thing I am intrested in finding out is if the Egyptian practice of using a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartouche][cartouche]] could actually protect a name.

IIRC the death note regenerates torn out pages. What are the mechanics of that? Does this create mass?
