Assuming that the only things I'm certain of are that I have access to a shinigami and that the notebook kills people whose names are written in it, and none of the other rules I know are certain (and some of these are predicated on the answers to the initial questions having answers that are reasonably similar to canon), and assuming I am completely immoral:

1.  To what extent can I control the method of death?
2.  To what extent can I control the time of death?
3.  How many pages does the Death Note have, and can I get more?
4.  What information do I need to kill someone using the death note?
5.  To what extent do "I" need to be the one writing in the death note? Could I feed pages of the death note into a printer, for example?
6.  Do the pages of the death note retain their properties when ripped out?
7.  Can a death be cancelled in some way once written? (burning the page it's written on, crossing it out, etc.)
8.  What happens when I write the same person's name in the death note twice with different times/methods of death?
9.  Can I specify between two people with the same name?
10. Is it ever possible to kill two people with the same name? (in death note canon for example, two people who share a name and have similar enough faces?)
11. Can I extend a person's life through the death note? (by putting a date in the far future)
12. Can I kill shinigami with the death note?
13. Can I kill another death note user through the use of a death note?
14. If I can control the method of death with some amount of detail and force actions, can I control people other than the person whose name was written in the death note?
15. Can I use this method of control to kill someone whose name I haven't written in the death note?
16. What happens if I write some impossible method of death?
17. What happens if I write two possible but contradictory methods of death? Three? More?
18. Can I kill non-humans? (such as named animals?)
19. Can I kill humans with atypical genetics which make them more genetically distant from humans than other primates are? (missing chromosomes, etc.)
20. If I can use the death note on non-humans, can I also control non-humans by writing in a method of death?
21. What defines ownership of the death note?
22. If I give someone a page of the death note, will they be able to see/control the shinigami?
23. If I lose control of the death note, will I be able to continue seeing the shinigami?
24. What happens to pages of the death note that are destroyed? (pulped, burnt, etc.)
