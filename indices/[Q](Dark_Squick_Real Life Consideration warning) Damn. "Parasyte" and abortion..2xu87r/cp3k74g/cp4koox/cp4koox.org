  Well, pro choice people generally support abortion before the +baby+fetus has a brain.

And while it has a brain. It's just that later term abortions are appreciably rarer than early abortions.

My personhood predicate requires sufficient wherewithal to pass the mirror test. (I eat bacon, and pigs pass the mirror test, so that's a generous lower bound.) I would support abortions up to twelve months after birth, since humans tend not to pass the mirror test before 18 months. However, there is enough demand for infants that adoption is often more efficient.
