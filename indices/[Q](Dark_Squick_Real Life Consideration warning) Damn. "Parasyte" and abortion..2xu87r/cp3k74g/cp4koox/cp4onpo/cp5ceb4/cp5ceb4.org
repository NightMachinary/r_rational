My system 1 doesn't support the killing of any animals in my general vicinity. It balks at roasted chicken because it sufficiently resembles a living chicken. It balks at whole prawns. It's totally fine with bacon.

When it comes to infants, I want them away from me, and I want to handle them as little as possible. System-1-wise, I'm about as comfortable with someone talking about slaughtering a pig as I would be with someone humanely killing a newborn human.

Now, eating infants intersects this killing of non-sentient humans with cannibalism. I have a strong (System 1) taboo against eating humans which leads me to be squicky about eating one's infants. However, since in this case we're not taking the flesh from people, I don't have much problem with it (in System 2, and to a lesser degree in System 1).
