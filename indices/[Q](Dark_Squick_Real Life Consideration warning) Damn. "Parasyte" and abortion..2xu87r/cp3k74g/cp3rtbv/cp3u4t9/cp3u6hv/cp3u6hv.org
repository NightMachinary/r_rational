See Vanishing Twin syndrome:

#+begin_quote
  Vanishing twin syndrome is when one of a set of twin/multiple fetuses disappears in the uterus during pregnancy. This is the result of a miscarriage of one twin/multiple. The fetal tissue is absorbed by the other twin/multiple, placenta or the mother. This gives the appearance of a “vanishing twin”.

Plus, you can just eat the stuff that you abort out of your womb. I think your own placenta would count as "human" for these extremely dubious purposes. You could also eat your own period even without pregnancy.
