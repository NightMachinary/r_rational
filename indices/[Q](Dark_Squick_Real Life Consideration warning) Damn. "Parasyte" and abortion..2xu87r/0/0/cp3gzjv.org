Haha in hindsight I should have realized that I was assuming she would be eating normal food to create the baby, catch-22 there. Hypothetically though, if eating the babies satisfied her in built desire to eat living humans and she ate regular food to create them would you be ok with this? Edit: Could it be that they need some sort of human brain biomolecule? This makes their drive to eat heads counterintuitive but could be a reasonable explanation?
