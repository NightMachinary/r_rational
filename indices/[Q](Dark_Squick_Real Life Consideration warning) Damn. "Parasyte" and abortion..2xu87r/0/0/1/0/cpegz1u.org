Let's play [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/2k/the_least_convenient_possible_world/][Least Convenient Possible World]] then.

Humans who are alive (as in biologically functioning) have some particular value that dead humans do not.

This could be in just being a delicacy, or in some "life energy"/otherwise epiphenomenal biological need, which cannot be synthesized or extracted from a human; To get it, a human must be eaten alive.

What would your answer be now?
