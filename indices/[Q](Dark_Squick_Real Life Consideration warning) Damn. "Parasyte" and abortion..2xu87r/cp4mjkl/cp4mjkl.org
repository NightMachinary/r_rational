there is a lot of ethics being explored LATER in that anime and I was actually rather pleased by the way it's been going.

I'd posit that parasyte borders on being rational fiction, and ultimately as far as I've seen it is quite tragic really.

I haven't read the manga so I don't know if it diverges heavily or not.
