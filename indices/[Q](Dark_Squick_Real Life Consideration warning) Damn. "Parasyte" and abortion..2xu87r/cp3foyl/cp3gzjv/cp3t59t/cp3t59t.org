It's a question based on a false assumption, and thus invalid. If biology produces it, then it's a molecule or group of molecules, and you can synthesize it or program bacteria to produce it.

If, as humans, we are judging this by human value then eating human is only acceptable when you have no choice, and only until you have an alternative. Morgues would be a good start, and keep you near the lab for synthesizing an alternate solution.
