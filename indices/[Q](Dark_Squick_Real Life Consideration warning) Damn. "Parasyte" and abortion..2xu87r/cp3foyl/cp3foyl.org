wow so much is wrong with that question! first thought was "but that's Matrix-movie termodimamicaly imposible!!" then "that's a mighty small predator niche!" and third "is it wrong I thought all of that before considering the ethics of baby eating?" :P anyway after that train of thought i remembered the protagonist and his infected sidekick's parasites don't need to eat humans as they (as parasites are wont to do) receive nutrients from the snatched body with one exception in the manga. even if it was the case of some nutrient or whatevs unique from the human body, morgues, cemeteries, and hospital waste bins are more ethical and easier sources. problem is they are alien intelligences with a different morality and are heavily implied to be earth's biocontrol response to human polluting.
