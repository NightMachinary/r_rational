Hm... The novel I'm writing, "S.I.", could be Peggy Sued if I were to pull an "and it was all a VR-like simulation" cliche. Even if the reset back to the story's start kept the rest of the universe the same, my protagonist wouldn't necessarily assume that... and given that her story has been something of a piqaresque travelogue, it's hard to say that she's going to have "solved" anything the first time around; so in her second go, she would probably still be something of a wanderer, looking for useful data, gear, and power-ups. Only now she has some Big Thing other than an impending Second Singularity to motivate her, she gets to try to puzzle out the Reset... and she's probably a little wiser, and a little less willing to jump into situations without preparation.

I could probably make a go of it, if I tried... Though I expect that by the time I finish the first go-round, I'd rather start a brand-new story instead. :)
