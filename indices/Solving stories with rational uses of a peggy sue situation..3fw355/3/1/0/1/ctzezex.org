Thanks both for the recommendation and the warning! I would probably read it, if I haven't read a lot of formulaic fix-it fics already. Formulaic isn't always bad if you're not yet sick of the formula. :)

EDIT: I'm 1.5 chapters into it. I'm finding myself quite entertained at present, though I don't know if I'll finish it. Her interaction with her parents and actions at Ollivander's is frankly heartwarming. If "2 year old Hermione being adorable with her parents" sounds good to you, check it out.

EDIT2: Okay this was /entirely/ different from the Peggy Sue formula I'm used to. For one, it's complete at 31K words. It's more a story of her interaction with her parents, the staff, and how she makes a new life for herself. The actual "curbstomp the Dark Lord" phase of the story was pretty average, but only one sixth of the story. The "what do I do now" phase was entirely novel to me, and makes me want to write an entire story with that as a premise.
