Every detective novel in existence.

Harry Potter could tell Dumbledore where everything is. Of course at the start he is a baby so maybe not.

Lord of the Rings notably would be pretty much just as hard, maybe be easier on war side since Gandalf won't die. Seems like things that require information or mystery.
