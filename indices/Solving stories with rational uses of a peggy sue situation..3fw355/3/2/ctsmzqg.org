Gandalf's fall in Moria was fated, or at least foreseen given that they passed through Moria. In addition to this, the sacrifice he made by dying was necessary to prove to Eru Iluvatar that he was worthy of being returned from death, stronger, as Gandalf the White. This moral test was planned by Eru Iluvatar so that the mission of the Istari would not fail, as Saruman, originally the White, had betrayed them. Without the sacrifice, everything would have been significantly more difficult, if not impossible, and the Istari would have completely failed. Changing things in Lord of the Rings is significantly harder than other stories, simply because its world is so vast and intricately designed.
