What about unbreakable prophecies? How do they interact with Peggy Sue mechanics? Will the same prophecies necessarily come to fruition again, but potentially with a different interpretation? Will they be completely invalidated, because it's a different universe from the one they originally foretold? Will some prophecies apply to the original universe and some to the new one, because when there are multiple futures a prophecy doesn't apply to more than one of them?
