I don't actually have anything written on that one. I've got a bunch of disorganized snippets from a tale of Harry on a single-day groundhog loop for months to years, during which he figures out that Luna will a) believe him, and b) continue to be novel and interesting if he provides a different "seed number" to her every reset. The story's a farce, and they make mayhem.
