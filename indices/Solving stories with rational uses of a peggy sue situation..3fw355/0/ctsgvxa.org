Also interesting: Which ones wouldn't?

Solvable stories will typically involve specific bits of knowledge which render previous investigations unnecessary. The majority of murder mysteries, for example.

Unsolvable ones will involve either disastrously ignorant main characters, heavy slogs of unskippable work, or unlikely coincidences which become difficult to replicate.

To an extent Vonnegut's Timequake explores the ugliest aspects of a powerless Peggy Sue. Which other stories would involve the largest amount of semi-Sisyphean repetition?
