Hard Reset 2 had some really rather complicated time physics that it spent several pages explaining and still left me with important unanswered questions. But it handled it well otherwise, it definitely demonstrates how the story stays interesting when the villain is looping.

There were a couple of clever scenes where Twilight made a plan and then saw that Chrysalis had already pre-empted it because it had worked in an earlier loop.
