Didn't Gandalf test Frodo? He wouldn't be the ringbearer if his ring-lust came with him.

If it was discovered he had traveled back, he would also probably be brought along for future information, at least to Rivendell, and some of the conflict could come from Frodo attempting to retake the ring. Sam as ringbearer would be pretty interesting.
