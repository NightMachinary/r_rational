He had a mere suspicion that the ring was a Great Ring, due to Bilbo's well-preservedness and tendency to, ah, forget that he had not yet given the ring away, and other such oddities. There are many magic rings in Middle-Earth, and the One Ring had been lost for 2500 years. Saruman had told Gandalf that it had rolled down the Anduin River into the sea. Those seventeen years were to confirm the locations of the other Great Rings, the Rings of Power that Sauron had created, because only they could grant such longevity. Gandalf was no idiot. Before all of that, it was a cheap party trick, just as Bilbo used it.
