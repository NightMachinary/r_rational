I forgot entirely about the seventeen year gap. That would vanish, since I think it was for research and counsel with Saruman to determine that it was the One Ring. Their chances would be significantly raised by the time gained, but it would also be much harder to obtain a fellowship, since leaders of the various races wouldn't know that Sauron had returned.

However, the gap could still be present. Frodo would probably avoid confirming it as the One Ring due to his ring-lust, and when Gandalf left he might even fall to it as Gollum did in the intervening years. Then they would be in an even worse situation.
