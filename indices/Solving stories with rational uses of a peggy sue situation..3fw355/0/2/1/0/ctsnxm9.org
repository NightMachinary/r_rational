Things would change drastically assuming that the Long-Awaited Party was the Peggy Sue point. Gandalf left the ring with Frodo for *seventeen years* before returning to set off to Rivendell. Assuming that they get a head start this time around, the whole state of the world is going to be drastically different. Gollum would still be in his cave, Theoden would be in his early 50s and his son would be an infant. Denethor wouldn't be as crazy and Boromir would by in his prime.

They wouldn't run into Aragorn by chance at the Prancing Pony, and being called into the Fellowship specifically for his bloodline would drastically affect his relationship with the Hobbits at the start. Moria had already fallen by this point, so a quick note to Gandalf about the Balrog would probably convince them to get through the mountains by a different road - especially if Saruman could somehow be kept in the dark about the Ring's rediscovery.
