If you took Frodo's memories back to the day Gandalf told him he'd need to take the One Ring to Rivendell, that wouldn't change much. In fact, you might be bringing back his addiction and desire to keep the Ring, which would thwart the plan entirely. And as you suggest, the unlikely coincidence of Smeagol stealing Frodo's finger and falling into the lava at Mt Doom wouldn't be repeated. Frodo would ensure that Smeagol couldn't follow them.

More generally, if you have a story that is about /doing/ and not about /knowing/, it doesn't become any easier. If the character suffers effects of trauma by the end of the original story, it becomes harder.
