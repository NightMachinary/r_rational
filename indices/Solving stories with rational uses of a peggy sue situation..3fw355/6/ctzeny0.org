Running through some webcomics:

Girl Genius: many parts solved. Probably.

Order of the Stick: nope, folks gotta level.

Homestuck: oh god I have no freaking clue. I'm shocked I haven't seen a fanfic of it, though. Come to think, does anyone have one they can link?

Erfworld: This one would be interesting. Would Parson take the same approach in Book 1? There are many reasons to do so, many reasons not to. The moral dilemmas alone, plus deciding on what his objective even is, would make a great read.

Sluggy Freelance: pfff where would you start?

And just to mix it up, Chrono Trigger: not at all solved, unless they keep their levels. Most of that work still needs to be done, and you can fight Lavos at almost any time allready.
