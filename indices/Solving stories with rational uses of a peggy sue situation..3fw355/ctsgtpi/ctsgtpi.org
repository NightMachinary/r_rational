The first Matrix movie would be solved almost instantly, since the single big thing that happened was entirely internal to the protagonist's mind. All of the conflicts are almost instantly eliminated, until the next two movies roll around.

Almost all detective stories are about finding the evidence, so almost all of the conflicts just get solved through sheer foreknowledge. This includes pretty much every episode of Scooby-Doo.

Death Note, no matter which of the main two you consider the protagonist.

Works of fiction with second act betrayals are also a wide field ripe for instantly solved problems; if the bad guy is your traveling companion and not ridiculously overpowered, it should be easy to kill him (assuming the main character doesn't have ethical qualms with that).

Almost every Groundhog Day type situation (including the original Groundhog Day) because most of the changes are internal to the character's mind in the first place.
