"Blanket agency" is a great way of summarizing that particular concept. It's bothered me in stories for years and I haven't had a good label for what was wrong. Protagonists with too much freedom are infuriating in all but the most risky, explosive narratives... and risk escalation gets exhausting rather fast for me.
