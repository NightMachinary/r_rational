Sometimes it's Harry plus someone else. To some extent it makes sense to bring the rich kid along -- that lets you worry less about getting money.

Also, I think authors see Harry as a blank slate. In canon he just goes along with what others want a lot, doesn't show much personality, and obviously could do so much more than he did. Plus the series says he's the main character.
