Sometimes Dumbledore wondered if he was doing the right thing.

It had taken, by his very rough estimate, approximately 37 attempts, 37 wild and dangerous and reckless and /unpredictable/ repetitions to find a reliable path that led to a certain room in the Department of Mysteries without Voldemort immediately concluding that he'd broken the Compact of Fate, and abandoning all restraint. One memorable time, he had had to wait for nearly a century for Voldemort to let down his guard and deploy his Inferi elsewhere.

37 times a decade of warfare had left his mind deeply scarred. Once he had found the stable path, it had taken him nearly another three loops to regain some amount of internal composure, and another five to fully research the rituals that would stabilize his mind and outward behavior for the millenia to come.

When all you have is a time loop...

Dumbledore had in fact heard of the chaos effect, and in the countless years behind him, he had seen ample evidence of it. The slightest permutation, the most minimal of touches sufficed to alter history. And one of these days... one of these decades, he'd find the words to say that made everything work, the words that would, if not avoid, then at the least minimize the casualties.

Dumbledore rose from his seat, and behind the kindly spectacles and gentle eyes, a counter that had been set in motion a long time ago ticked forward another step.

“Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! /Spring/!”
