I don't really understand how you say a person can only use one specific spell and then go onto say that they can invent or cast spells related to it.

Here's what I would do in such a world: compile a list of all known magic users and what spell(s) they knew. This sheds light on the relationship between different spells (fire spells go together, etc.). The goal is to speed up the search for people's affinity and their search for additional spells they can cast. The result would be a monastic order of scholar-mages who, over the centuries, help people realize their potential.
