I'd have to know how the spells work to know how to munchkin them.

I don't get how the flight is supposed to work. Is he just creating the thread moving forward, moving it backward, and then making it vanish? It seems like it would have to be insanely powerful to do something like that.

I'm also kind of confused as to how he's using it to move. You'd think if he supports his weight through a thread that small, it would just cut through stuff. He could probably do well as a miner. Or at least a logger.

How long does it take to find your affinity? If you can go through the list of affinities in a year, and then it takes several years of practice to be useful, then finding the affinity isn't the hard part.

The logical way to find your affinity would be to take a list of them ordered from most valuable to least valuable, and go through them one by one. Their values would change, so it might be more efficient to have books that group similar affinities together, and you go through the books in order of what's most valuable.

I'm not sure how much that would happen. There's probably be a lot of people who don't understand statistics thinking they'd be better off picking them at random because there's no way they'll happen to have the first affinity in the list. And just because you don't get any hints doesn't mean you'll know you don't get any hints. People will come up with all sorts of superstitions for helping them find their affinity. And there's no way to be sure everyone even has an affinity. I would also imagine there's some unlisted affinities that nobody found yet.
