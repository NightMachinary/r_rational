My own interpretation to make sense of it is that the fire affinity that will let you shoot lava is not the same affinity that will let you emit heat waves. So the base spells look very similar (flame at your fingertip after snapping fingers) but the detailed instructions are different (what you need to picture in your mind, for instance)
