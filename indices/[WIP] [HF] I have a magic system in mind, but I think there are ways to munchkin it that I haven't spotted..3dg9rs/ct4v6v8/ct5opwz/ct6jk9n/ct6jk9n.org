Yeaaaa... they weren't always recorded? How were they found, if everyone has to find a certain exact spell to find theirs out?

Thousands of people had to do original research to try to create spells to find the one for them? If a spell failed, they had no feedback, so they couldn't know if the spell was wrong or if it was just not the spell for them.

We actually got no evidence that our world doesn't have a magic system like this. Nobody has just found their spell, and wouldn't really try to, because they think magic doesn't exist for a good reason.
