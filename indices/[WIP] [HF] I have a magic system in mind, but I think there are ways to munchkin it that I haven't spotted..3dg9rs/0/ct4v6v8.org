Well, you system can't really be munchkined, because it isn't really a system. Normally, munchkining is about exploiting asymmetric rules to produce effects that the designer didn't intend. Your system has no actual rules, so it can't be munchkined.

Also, it seems weird that you're relying on the sheer number of different combinations and affinitied that exist to restrict the number of extant mages. How did they even figure out that there were those affinities if there isn't any consistency from person to person? Why is it that if they had the ability to catalog every single one of those affinities, they lack the infrastructure to have a full education system where every individual could be tested and taught? If they didn't have the ability to catalog it, where did the information come from? What exists that makes it so that every discovered power is useful (if anything is possible, anything from spontaneous matter generation a light-year away to the ability to switch the polarity of every molecule within 100 light years should be abilities, both of which are useless and would have no immediately noticeable effect. It seems like there has to be some kind of entity making sure that the powers selected for are useful, which seems incredibly unlikely elsewise)? How does your magical system interact with non-classical physics? It just seems like your system has so many unanswered questions that it seems to be completely word-of-author instead of like an actual physical system.
