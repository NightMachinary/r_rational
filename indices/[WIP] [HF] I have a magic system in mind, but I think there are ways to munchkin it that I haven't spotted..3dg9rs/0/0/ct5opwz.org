There is some consistency. Say there's a million affinities. You'll only need on the order of a thousand mages to get a million pairs of mages, which means around one pair that has a shared affinity. So people will realize that two mages can have the same affinity fairly quickly. After that, they'll start recording all of the affinities so people can learn theirs faster.
