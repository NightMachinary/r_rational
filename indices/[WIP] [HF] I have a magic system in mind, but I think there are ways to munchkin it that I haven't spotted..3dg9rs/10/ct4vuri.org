From your description, I'm assuming: a) the strength that spells can attain is enough for Badass Combat, or produces results that technology cannot, b) that population is large enough that, while everyone is unique, groups can still be organized around similar spells.

You haven't written any description of political situation or government, so here's some thoughts on that:

Even if there are thousands of spells listed, there are likely to be many spells which it is in the public interest to develop; violations of physics can produce some seriously impressive / powerful* results, doubly so if these can be used to manipulate, heal, or control people. Any government worth it's salt would test for spells that are useful to it, and (likely) restrict many of the rest to prevent crime. I would expect the (many) spells that they test for to be a part of the general curriculum, so they would test for these in school. If the government has any sort of ethnic or class divide, it would preferentially test those loyal to the established regime. Those who develop magic would likely be rewarded at least somewhat well, as motivation for people to do this, recognition to their utility, and to ensure their loyalty.

This is just one example of a society I'm sure would spring up due to these spells; others (black market? medical schools?) would also likely exist, but government wouldn't just leave people with these abilities alone.
