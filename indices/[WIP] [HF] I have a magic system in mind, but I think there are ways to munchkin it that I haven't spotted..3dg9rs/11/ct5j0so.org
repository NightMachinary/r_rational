1) You need a better description of affinity. What you seem to be saying is that everyone has the ability to cast a certain /type/ of spells, based around a single magical ability. So if you have the ability to cast "fire" spells, you start with producing small flames and eventually, with enough practice, can nuance that in various ways. Maybe you can create the heat without the actual flame, or take a non-flammable object and ignite it, or just make a bigger flame. I don't like the gasoline and lava examples, because they appear to break this system. They don't match the scope of the initial ability, to produce fire (they both involve creating other matter from nothing).

2) In a society like this, everything would be structured around people's affinity. At an early age, it would be paramount to find a child's affinity, so that they can be trained in its use as they grow. When entering the workforce, a person's affinity will determine their job options. People with fire affinity would work in forges or in power generation, people with thread affinity, like your protagonist, would work in construction.

3) With widespread magical abilities available to everyone, you're living in a scarcity-free world. As people learn new uses for their affinities, technological growth increases incredibly fast. When writing this story, you may want to indicate when people first learned of these affinities. You can then write a short history of how the world arrived in its current state. For instance, say this started in the Victorian era. You can show how your timeline differs from the real timeline, which gives some indication of how technology developed much more rapidly and the consequences of that. This isn't strictly necessary, but it would give your story better grounding.
