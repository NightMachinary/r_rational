  So he can't use it to grab someone

But he can use a very long, very twisted thread to grab 50 broomsticks with soft pads on the other end, and grab/move a person with the pads. Or wrap tightly around several twenty-foot lengths of rope, tunnel them underground underneath a person criss-crossing in multiple directions and knotting around each other while underground, and then manipulating the ends of the rope lengths to weave a net which comes up out of the ground around the person and ties together at the top above their aura - he now has a person in a net that he can carry around (or smack into a building if that's the way he rolls).

I'm assuming here that the auras cannot be blocked by any form of conventional matter, or else it would be a simple method to coat/wrap the thread in it.

Other things the protagonist could do: Storm of 1000 Arrows. He wouldn't need bows - from what you say, the threads seem perfectly able to impart kinetic energy. An earlier version could be Storm of 1000 Pebbles. If the thread is thin enough, long enough, and controllable enough, he could generate and utterly control a whirlwind of sand - and sand, thrown hard enough, can scour, gouge, and cut like a bandsaw. It'd go straight through anything nonmagical with the possible exception of extremely dense ceramics.

Heck, he could drop rocks of at /least/ personweight on people/targets. He could wear armor and weaponry 100 pounds (or more!) heavier than his actual muscles could lift and/or walk in.

Thought: How tightly can he bunch the thread up (or alternatively can he make the thread wide/flat/bowed)? Could be make a net that could hold small pebbles? A bag that could hold sand? A bowl that could hold water? Could he send the thread underground deep enough to avoid a person's aura, then levitate the chunk of ground they were standing on?

 

Anyway, the only weaknesses in this system that I can see are narrative. The source of the magic isn't explained, and the types of magic which are handed out don't have any coherence, so there is no type of magic which /must/ fall into the hands of a character. You can retcon anything which would be munchkinnable, such as an affinity for mind control or super-charisma or stackable metamagic or even simply life extension, and prevent any affinity from being maxxed to a munchkin level simply by saying "The character who got that affinity never got around to maxing it out," or "No characters with the personality or training to grind their levels to gamebreaker status appear in this story."
