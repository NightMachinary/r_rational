I'm not yet ready to start writing the novel itself for multiple reasons, not least of which being that my mockup of the magic system is woefully incomplete. This post helped me work on it considerably, so I intend to post the next draft of the system once I think I've worked out all the flaws I can see. That should be at some point over the next couple of days.
