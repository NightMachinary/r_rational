I'm currently rereading the whole story since I need to remember everything that happened so I haven't left a review on the latest chapters. I forgot how good this shit is since it's been quite a long time.

Thanks for continuing to update the story, I was actually hoping the other day you'd continue the story then out of nowhere you updated literally within day or two lol.

I just finished rereading the Wave arc (on chapter 19) and something about the way you convey fights is just awesome. You do it in a manner that isn't drawn out, fast and quick actions while still showing the character's on the fly thoughts and reasoning for what they're doing in that moment. It really seems like how an actual ninja fight will go down.
