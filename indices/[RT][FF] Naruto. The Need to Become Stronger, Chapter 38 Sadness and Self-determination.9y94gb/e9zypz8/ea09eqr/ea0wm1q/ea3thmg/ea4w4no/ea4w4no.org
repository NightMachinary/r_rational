You're rightfully proud of your combat scenes. You put so much thought and work into them and it shows. I like your philosophy on being hit and taking damage. You ever noticed some stories will have characters being thrown through fully healthy trees and yet somehow the character takes it as if they just bursted through a thin wooden plank? Even though characters can achieve amazing "supernatural" feats, I've always felt like despite that I'd take a more grounded approach to damage if I wrote a story. Trees are infinitely more sturdy than fiction as a whole gives them credit for. While they can breathe fire and do all sorts of crazy stuff they're still humans. I view ninjas as glass cannons (besides the few exceptions who can seriously tank damage).

Naruto absolutely has my favorite power system of any media. I'm always fascinated by the interworking of chakra and the dynamics of fights as a whole. I enjoy seeing the jutsu's writers come up with just as much as the actual story itself. Chakra is just so intricate and layered in what it can do. You can achieve endless creativity when it comes to creating techniques because of all the systems. Nature manipulation and how chakra natures interact with each other, shape manipulation, the actual chakra system and itself and the way it flows through the body with chakra points, how it's molded, the way Yin and Yang work, how you have Ninjutsu, Genjutsu and Taijutsu and how they can be used in conjunction with one another, etc. It's one of the reasons I think Naruto is such a popular series to write fanfiction for.

I always ask myself when I see magic in a form of media: what dictates that this particular maguc spell is a flaming dragon head that shoots fire? You never know, it just /is/. Which is fine, but with Naruto you actually have systems at play which you can use to explain why. Yin is the spiritual side in which you gave the shape of the dragon, Yang breathes life into the form and so on.

I've always used DBZ's ki as a comparison. I'll love DBZ until I die but ki is just so one dimensional in how it works. DBZ's fighting system basically devolves into who has the strongest power output. With chakra there's SO many other factors at play which lends itself to far more strategy. One characters abilities may counter another characters abilities. Just because A beats B and B beats C doesn't mean A beats C you know? I've always felt like even though Sasuke and Naruto can go toe to toe with each other, I don't think that Sasuke would have faired as well against Pain as Naruto did. Sasuke at the time is more of a finesse technical fighter that shines with one on one combat and I don't think he could handle the Six Paths as well as Naruto's could with Sage Mode and just his sheer power output when it comes to techniques that is needed against Pain in particular.
