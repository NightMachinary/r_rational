I would characterize the story as not feeling very dark. Its a story about ninjas, trained killers, there is a lot of death but it's not there with the intent to make life terrible and dark for it's main characters. Its just trying to represent it's setting accurately. Overall the characters take the deaths in stride, and it never breaks the reality of an arc by being ridiculously grimdark, nor does it dwell on the deaths for too long, having the characters bounce back, and ending up with a strong emotional range.
