Having binge read the story, I think I got why the perpetrator of the Nine tails attack did what did. Let me lay down the logic:

| The one upside that Ao had figured out, the one reason they were able to muster any defence

| at all, was the fact that the enemy was seemingly unable to teleport into a place they had not

| already visited. Ao had only once seen such a powerful teleportation technique before, and

| that had been far away in a distant land, and in a different era. The Fourth Hokage Namikaze

| Minato's Flying Thunder God technique... Could it be? Are we fighting Konoha once more?

â€‹

First, I posit that Ao, correctly figured out the teleportation technique being used, which is Flying Thunder God. If the perpetrator of the Nine tails attack is Obito (likely), he does not have Kamui.

Now, if you want to put Flying Thunder God in all your secret hideouts, you cannot have another hostile user who can sense and then teleport at will to all those markings. Minato had to go.

Obito not having Kamui also explains why he avoided a direct confrontation with Minato, and did this elaborate assassination instead. His victory would be unlikely at best.
