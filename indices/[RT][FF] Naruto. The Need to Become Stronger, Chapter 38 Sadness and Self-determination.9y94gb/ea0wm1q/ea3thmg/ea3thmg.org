Cheers, I'm glad you like it.

I actually think the fights in Naruto are one of the best aspects of the manga. Sure, some of it is just boring power-up nonsense, but what sets it apart from other shonen like Bleach is that there's a whole established combat system. This makes it amazing for fanfiction since you can have characters pull off clever tricks using already established rules without it feeling like an asspull.

Almost all Naruto fanfiction completely wastes this opportunity. Even the stories that are liked around here have combat scenes where you just have two characters punching each other and then the writer decides that one of them gets a hit in and they win. It's completely devoid of tension because the outcome is so arbitrary. Besides, there is simply no reason why two ninjas would ever fight hand-to-hand for more than 2 seconds, because one of them always has a comparative advantage to doing something else instead. Why fight on your opponent's terms if you can fight on your own?

The way I write combat scenes in NTBS, I start by writing down each of the character's abilities (where things like "superior weapon skill" counts as just one ability), and then see how these abilities match up against each other. I ask myself "What would be my opening move if I were this character? What would I expect my opponent to do? How would I counter that?" I go through countless iterations before I finally settle on a script that makes sense.

The other driving philosophy behind my combat scenes is the idea that one hit is lethal. In regular Naruto fanfiction, people always get little cuts from knives and such to try and drive up the tension, but this actually achieves the opposite effect: The reader doesn't worry if their characters get hit because they always survive it. In NTBS, all characters are trained to assume that all weapons are poisoned. This also means that ninjas don't just randomly taunt each other during fights - they're fucking terrified of getting hit even once. And the reader feels that terror in them, I think, and it adds to the tension.

All of that is just a long way of saying that I'm really proud of my combat scenes, so I'm glad you like them. :)
