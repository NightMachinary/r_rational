I don't think it's grimdark at all. I hate depressing stories and have never been able to finish them (I could barely sit through grave of the fireflies), so in NTBS I've made it so that characters tend to quickly move on from any trauma they've experienced. There's also plenty of lighthearted stuff in between. For example, this is an actual quote from this very same chapter:

#+begin_quote
  The illusory Naruto turned and thrust an angry finger at Sasuke. “You! I knew you were behind this somehow, you jerk. How dare you make a fully-sentient simulation of me against my will, you bastard!”

  Sasuke plugged his ear with one finger as if to block Naruto out, even though that made no sense in this context. “I figured Naruto might be better able to motivate you since the two of you got along so well at the academy,” he said. “It's only an illusion, but he keeps saying stuff like that without being prompted and it's really quite unnerving.”

I dare you to try and fit those paragraphs into a grimdark story. I double-dog dare you.
