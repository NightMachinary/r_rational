Hmmmm... just thinking of graph formats, I think this could be done as a bar chart (slightly variant). On the X-axis, you have three categories - Mental, Social, Action. Each category has three bars - Minor, Moderate, and Major. Green bar above the line for successes, red bar below the line for failures.

...I'm not nearly as familiar as I should be with the minutiae of Gnuplot, but I imagine it could be used to show this?
