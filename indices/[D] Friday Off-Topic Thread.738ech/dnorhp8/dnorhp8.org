Still looking for a good data compiling/analysis tool that I can use for my [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/73a5k0/hjpev_successfailure_reread_chapters_713/][HPMOR Success/Failure Reread]] to plug all these numbers into as I go. I'm not really hip to what new tools are available for this sort of thing, but any kind of spreadsheet or graph format that will allow me to easily observe totals of Success/Failure, Minor/Moderate/Major, and Mental/Social/Action, would be appreciated, as I'm already having to triple check my tallies to avoid mistakes.

Any help finding one would be appreciated!

Edit:

Two people have already made one for me, no more needed, thank you!
