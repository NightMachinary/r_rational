I liked parasyte. It was kinda miraculous it even got an adaptation since its an old manga. But seeing it revitalised in a modern setting was awesome. I was just slightly feeling blueballed that it was so short and havent discussed the subjects fully.

In terms of anime oh boy oh boy today there was ton of annoucments like Index 3rd season and SAO 3rd season + offspin of season 2...

i kinda like index even tho it has plenty of flaws i really like the characters, character designs and worldbuilding while SAO....oh man......
