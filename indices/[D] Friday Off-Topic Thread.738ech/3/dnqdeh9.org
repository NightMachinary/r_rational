Parasyte Maxim - Anime Recommendation!

So I know most anime aren't rational, and I'm not going to say that Parasyte has overarching rational themes (though it sort of does) but I think anime lovers that enjoy the content of this sub would find Parasyte a good watch (though it's quite gory, so it won't fit everyone's appeal)

To put it simply and with only slight spoilers for episode 1: Our protagonist wakes up one day with a titular "Parasite" where his right hand and forearm used to be. The parasite is cold, logical, curious, intelligent and most importantly selfish. He prioritizes his own life above all else and (as his life is tied to the protagonist's) prioritizes the protagonist's life as well. We quickly learn that the parasite is not alone and others of his kind start cropping up and causing trouble.

The parasite and our protagonist often have arguments about topic such as the sanctity of human life vs all life and altruism vs selfishness. Our protagonist is your fairly standard human anime lead, though I will say he's notably more realistic and level headed. While he's still sometimes prone to charging in blindly for emotional reasons, those moments aren't nearly as frequent as they are with other leads.

We also get to see the parasite (both the lead's and the others of his kind) evolve as organisms and characters as the series progresses and time passes. As parasites all have identical beginnings, you would think that they would be stock, cookie cutter characters of each other. And they both are and aren't. It's done in a fairly impressive way that feels somewhat realistic.

People die, a lot. And plot armor isn't really a thing for anyone, even the most important characters.

Overall, it's a very good watch. And a fairly short one, as it's only 24 ~22 minute episodes. And the themes it tackles (such as nature vs nurture, is /life/ intrinsically valuable) are very much up the [[/r/rational][r/rational]] alley in my opinion. I think it's worth a watch :)
