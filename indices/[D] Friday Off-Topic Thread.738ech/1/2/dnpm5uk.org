  Also, if our life was a story, and ~5 (or ~1.5) hours of healthy daily sleep were a thing in it, woulnd't you criticise that story if these techniques weren't a munchkining solution so obvious that pretty much everybody knew about it and practiced it?

This might be very obvious to you, but what works in stories and tabletop RPGs doesn't work in real life.

Most stories emphasize ideas and uniqueness over logistics and comparative advantage. The protagonist doesn't train 10% harder or dabble in a few different skills, he trains 3000% harder and learns The Ultimate Technique of Doing [the goal] Right. I'd argue that in real life, success is way less about good ideas than about good habits.

And personally, when I don't sleep enough I lose all my motivation and I have a way harder time concentrating.
