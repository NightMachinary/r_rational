Sleep is still poorly understood. I wouldn't try it. It's better to get more sleep. Sleep apnea patients wake up every few minutes during their sleep because they stop breathing (but aren't aware of it since they go back to sleep almost immediately). The result is that they are tired all the time and their memory and IQ aren't as good as it is after they start getting treatment for their sleep apnea. Polyphasic sleep wouldn't be as bad as that, but I still don't think it's natural. Even if you're getting full REM cycles, it might mess with your body's hormone levels and stuff (i.e. your body releases growth hormones during the night, and starts releasing cortisol (stress hormone) right before you wake up close to around 8 hours of sleep, and the levels slowly go down again throughout the day).
