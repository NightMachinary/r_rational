What's the latest word on the long-term health effects of different sleep schedules? e.g. something more recent than [[https://www.supermemo.com/en/articles/polyphasic2010][this]]? What's the risk of eventually suffering from the effects of chronic sleep deprivaton, or actually dozing off periodically untracked, or whatever? I haven't really looked into polyphasic sleep stuff since highschool but I recall concluding then that it was a "too risky to try" sort of thing.
