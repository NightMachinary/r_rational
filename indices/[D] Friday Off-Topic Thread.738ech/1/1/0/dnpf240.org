More like teach them to find and understand such information, and to use it for checking how accurate are those of their perceptions --- about themselves and others --- that drop their quality of life, in one way or another.

E.g. “there's no way I can have a happy life” → define "happy life" + investigate what part of the population lives in a way that more or less meets the definition + compare the average skills and abilities of such people with the client's own relatively objective assessments (e.g. various qualification tests, etc).

May also work for people who have paranoia, androphobia, etc.
