Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) works something like this. Its primary goal is to identify the connection between our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and then identify irrational thoughts and learn to counter them.

How deep into things it goes will depend on the particular therapist and client. On one end of the spectrum are those who might offer broad counters (like, "Are you actually doomed to failure just because you don't get into this college? Does everyone who doesn't go to their top choice of college have a horrible life?"), while on the other end are those who might look up statistics and data, or instruct their client to do so.
