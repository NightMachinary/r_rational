First, figure out whether they're actually introverted.

When I say "I'm introverted" I mean that I've got a little "social energy" meter, which gets drained whenever I talk to people. This meter is not very big, so I don't tend to enjoy random conversations with strangers, because they drain an important resource I might need for other things, like talking to a friend. After social interactions, I need some time to be by myself in order to let that meter charge back up. I'm happiest having two to four close friends that I see once or twice a week, because close friends take less social energy and I don't really need that many of them (or that much of them) to meet my small social needs. (My understanding of extroverts is that they're the opposite, where they have an empty "social interaction" meter that they regularly need to fill, and they get distressed when they don't have enough social interaction, a feeling that I get only rarely.)

There are two related concepts:

- Some people don't have friends, or have trouble making friends. This /is/ the case for a lot of introverts, because a lot of introverts don't pick up the skills and habits needed to make friends, but not everyone who doesn't have any friends is an introvert. I've met clear extroverts with no friends, people who talk a lot at work or in class in order to get their required dose of social interaction in, and then go home to no friends, or maybe a house full of children and a romantic partner (and introverts tend not to like extroverts like this). So if you see someone who's alone or doesn't speak much, it might be that they're an extrovert in disguise.
- Some people don't have social skills. Being awkward is a typical introvert trait, because having less social interactions means that we don't tend to develop social skills, especially those which involve being socially proactive (like starting conversations with strangers, flirting, or making introductions). But just because someone sucks at social skills doesn't mean that they're introverted; maybe they just never learned, because social skills are typically one of those things that aren't properly taught. (I have, again, met extroverts who were socially inept. Learn to read a room, Brenda!)

(I suspect that your particular introvert is an introvert with poor social skills in addition to introversion.)

So once you have found an /actual/ introvert, the first thing you need to be aware of is that a lot of introverts won't want to be your friend. Personally, I've found that with a once-weekly D&D group and an extroverted wife, I only need about one social interaction thing on top of that a week, which I almost invariably get. If someone tried to get me to sign up for something or to be friends, I would internally grimace and then try to be polite about not doing that.

If an introvert /does/ want to be your friend, then you will probably have to be the one who makes the first move, and the second move, and most of the moves after that. Introverts will often get accused of making the other party "do all the work", which can be true, but usually because there's unequal needs in the relationship. (Me not wanting to see a friend more than once a week when he wants to see me three times a week has been the cause of a few friendships ending. They interpret that as me not liking them, or not putting in effort, rather than me just getting socially drained too quickly with no time to recover. For me, seeing them /is/ the work, and I might enjoy our time, but it's still a draining effort on my part.)

If you want casual conversation with an introvert, I personally think it's best to be as gentle and non-committal as possible, so they can choose their own level of engagement. "Tell me about X" obligates the introvert to talk about X, while saying something that allows them to relate their own story or thing /if they want to/ will tend to work a lot better (and again, lack of social skills, which is somewhat common in introverts, complicates this, because the socially unskilled won't always pick up on an open-ended invitation to speak). Similarly, if you're in a group setting, asking the introvert to speak about something seems, to me, like not the right way to go; you want to give them openings, and offer them ways into the conversation, but not directly tax their social batteries. If you do try to make them talk about something, make sure that it's a topic they actually have something for, otherwise it's like trying to give a book report on a book they haven't read. (I've had extroverts try to include me in conversation like this, asking me "what was it like to grow up Mennonite" in a way that was clearly meant to be an olive branch but which I found really taxing.)
