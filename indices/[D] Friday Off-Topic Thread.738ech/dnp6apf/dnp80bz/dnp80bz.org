Random recs in approximate order by your list:

Check out Godspeed You! Black Emperor (I like Lift your skinny fists like antennas to heaven). They're something else.

For bluesy-poppy stuff, Lake St Dive is pretty popular.

My top pun-based song is Wet Dream, by Kip Adotta.

Peal Jam's album Ten is a classic.

You've already listened to a Best of Queen album, right? Good.
