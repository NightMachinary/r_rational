Yes, absolutely. If I were sent to a desert island and could pick only one artist's collection to take with me, I'd pick Weird Al, hands down.

  If there's specific genres within that list that you'd like, I could try to make recommendations

Most of the list above is comprised of subgenres of rock music, so I suppose that anything beneath the umbrella of rock music has a decent chance of working out.

Or did you mean "specific artists" rather than "specific genres"?
