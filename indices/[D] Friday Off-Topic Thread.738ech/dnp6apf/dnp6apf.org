I'm in the middle of exploring my tastes in music, in a project that I'll eventually describe in full here for the benefit of the two or maybe even three people whose idea of "exploring the world of music" involves a spreadsheet and charts.

Right now, I'm interested in song/album/band recommendations for any of the following:

- Art rock
- Baroque pop
- Blues rock
- Comedy songs
- Electronic rock
- Folk pop
- Garage rock
- Glam rock
- Pop rock
- Trip Hop

I've mostly been going by Top 10 lists and such that I've found online, but I've found that the process is more enjoyable (and a tiny bit more successful too) when I'm going off of personal recommendations.
