ughhh i didnt mean the "oh man" in a good way....but you do you. I found SAO really BS in terms of narrative, BS power of jesus-kun and BS deus ex machina and also the VR didnt make a lot of sense also the implications and themes of VR wasnt explored + we got cockblocked on the 70th floor and also ...yeah i am one of the haters of SAO. Personally i think SAO started or atleast popularized the whole VR and isekai wave of Harem LNs(even tho it technically isnt a harem but come on the club of girls the MC has around him even tho he is OTP with asuna is ridiciolous)

edit. ALso i will probably enjoy all the yt content that will be made from the next season of SAO shitting on it or something. It will be glorious.
