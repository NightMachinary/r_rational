Haha, that's funny.

SAO is definitely not rational and I can see why a ton of people don't like it. It definitely jumped through more than enough hoops to deserve a few cliche trope labels. But I think I like it because it delivers on a fantasy that's fairly stereotypical but still satisfying: The bad ass nerd who's good at video games gets to be actually badass and land the girl. Unlike in a lot of other animes, Kirito and Asuna's relationship is established in the middle of it, as opposed to in the end like most other series.

I understand that's just my personal bias though and don't ever try to defend SAO as gamebreaking or deep or any of that stuff. It's just fun. And cool. And kinda sappy.

Also I completely agree that the harem-ish thing is completely unnecessary. 100 percent.
