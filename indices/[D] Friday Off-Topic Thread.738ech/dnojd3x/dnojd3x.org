1. Shouldn't the investigation and practice of 2 or less daily hours of sleep be considered as an example of real-life munchkining? 1.2. Also, if our life was a story, and [[http://www.businessinsider.com/this-guy-has-only-slept-45-hours-per-day-for-two-years-2013-11][~5]] (or [[https://www.polyphasicsociety.com/polyphasic-sleep/overviews/uberman-2/][~1.5)]] hours of healthy daily sleep were a thing in it, woulnd't you criticise that story if these techniques weren't a munchkining solution so obvious that pretty much everybody knew about it and practiced it?

2. Are there types of therapy that use (alternatively, “Which types of therapy use ... ?”) statistics, demographic data, etc as tools for fighting\curing low self esteem, depression, anxiety, prejudice, etc?
