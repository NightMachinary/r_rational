I'm really not. I know the arguments for subs, and I find them unpersuasive. Mostly because I don't enjoy watching shows like that. /Made in Abyss/ has been hyped enough that I was willing to give it a shot, but I still found it to be intolerable. (Mind, I don't put up with crappy dubs, either.)

So, why does Anime Strike having the rights preclude a dubbed version? Do they have something against voice actors? I'm just hoping it happens eventually. (Like, within a couple years, maybe?)
