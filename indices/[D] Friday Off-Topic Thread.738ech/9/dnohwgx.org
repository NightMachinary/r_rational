I assembled a new computer recently! Well, two, actually, to help me with some projects I've currently in the works. Took a few hours and still have a few things left to do, but they seem to work well enough (been running @ 100% load for a week+ now with no issues). Some [[https://imgur.com/a/dfqvr][pictures]] and an [[https://gfycat.com/pitifulthoroughgalah][animation]] to look on, and a more [[https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/72e8p5/build_complete_ryzen_1700_work_builds/][detailed thread]]* regarding the builds.

I also wrote [[https://nikvetr.wordpress.com/2017/09/26/wrinkled-lips-and-cold-sneers/][another poem]] this week. My level of travel pretentiousness is the maximum allowable level of travel pretentiousness!

*(incidentally, I seem to be having trouble on this account -- and also my previous one -- to get people to engage with OC. That [[/r/buildapc][r/buildapc]] thread got effectively 0 comments or views in the first day before I started linking to it from other places, a lengthy [[/r/fitness][r/fitness]] progress [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/6qzpy6/fudgearounditis_progress_maintenance_23y61190/][post]] I wrote a while back was downvoted super heavily before being deleted, none of my earthporn [[https://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/comments/6y23ia/a_cloudy_day_at_the_ever_popular_horseshoe_bend/][posts]] seem to be terribly successful, etc. I'm not sure what it is, since 3 or 4 accounts ago -- maybe c. 2008-2011, when I first started using reddit -- I could pretty reliably get e.g. a few hundred comments on pretty similar stuff. It might be that reddit's overall quality has gone up, leaving me in the dust, or my postings have gotten worse, but it doesn't feel like it. I feel kinda silly and whiny for griping about this, but, like, I want attention! Maybe just a bit. Especially when I put time into something. Anyone else experienced similar?)
