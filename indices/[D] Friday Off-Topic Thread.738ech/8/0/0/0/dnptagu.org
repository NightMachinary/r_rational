Friday only. I think that's the only thread that gets enough traffic for it to make much of a difference, and what analysis we've done on the change shows lukewarm results for Friday anyway. (Monday does, sometimes, I guess, but it mostly doesn't affect the top level comments where it would be doing the most good. We had never changed the sort there though, I think because it was something of a control.)
