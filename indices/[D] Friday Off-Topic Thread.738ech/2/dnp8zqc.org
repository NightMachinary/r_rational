Any advice on how to broach conversation with extremely introverted people? I am in the process of reforming my school's Science Olympiad team and I came across someone who would be a perfect candidate, if only he ever talked to anyone. 1. We had an oral test in my Chinese class, and as he is a native speaker he has no reasonable chance of failing. I jokingly asked him how he fancies his chance of passing, and he proceeded to explain in great detail the recent immigration of his parents and how he was raised on the tongue, etc. 2. I was joking around with a classmate about the age of the Earth being 6000 years, and he turns around and quietly gives not only the correct approximate values for the age of the universe and the earth, and also how they were calculated. I explained that I was being sarcastic, and he responded in a professorial tone that this was not the case, as sarcastic people change their affect to indicate sarcasm. "Meta-sarcasm" was apparently not a sufficient response on my part. When I excitedly brought up him becoming my partner for the Astronomy Science Olympiad event, he thought for a moment and replied equivocally (and very quietly) that, "we shall see." I personally find him very compelling when he deigns to speak, and he does not seem to find social interaction unpleasant, he just lacks the apparent desire to ever really /begin/ a conversation.
