So, I took a glance at the first episode. And... I don't understand what I just saw. Yes, it's Star Trek... mostly. But completely lacking in taste. I get that it's being played for laughs, but juxtaposing the mundane with the wondrous... it's a cheap trick that adds nothing. I'd rather the time were used on actual world-building that adds to the narrative and sense of wonder of the rest of the show.

I don't know what this show is trying to do yet, but the production values don't seem match mine. Contrast this with /Rick and Morty/, where the crass humor of the show adds to what the narrative is doing (or is it the other way around?) and makes it a better show.
