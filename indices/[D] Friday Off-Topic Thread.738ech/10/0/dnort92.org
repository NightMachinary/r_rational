I enjoyed the first three episodes and will keep watching, but I think the quality of the show has ranged from decent to just okay. I found the first episode boring, the second had /just enough/ drama to keep me from pulling out my phone, and the third successful pulled off serious social satire so I'm very interested in what they do next. However, I haven't laughed at most of the jokes, I find none of the characters interesting, and I don't think it's rational at all.

As much as I like the third episode, a lot of that is just based on the ideas it tackles rather than the execution. I liked the conflicting values and rationalizations, but the arcs the characters went through were underwhelming. I also thought they made a significant misstep in the debate by never calling out the conservative argument as "do this to her or we will discriminate against her because of the way she was born".

Instead, they just tried to find counterexamples to the opposition's stereotypes as if to prove the /value/ of the child rather than focusing on her /rights/. The fact that they never even mentioned trans and intersex people causes it to come across as "people who aren't minorities talking about the experience of minorities". Their heart is in the right place, but their understanding is unfortunately limited.

I only have these nitpicks because I care so much about the message the show has and completely agree with it, but have spent so long addressing my own failings at comprehending the lives of people who've suffered in ways I never have and never will because of how they were born. I still /really/ like the episode as sci-fi political satire and can't wait to see what topics the show tackles next, but I won't call it "the modern Star Trek" just yet.
