I don't really care one way or the other about MacFarlane's previous stuff, except insofar as it might give him more leverage with the previously mentioned bastards in charge of Fox.

  Wouldn't it be funny to see a Office-style workplace comedy on a spaceship where the crew are crazy/incompetent misfits that have to overcome petty issues between them in order to get anything done?

No, that would be the worst possible thing. Making it like the Office would kill it harder for purposes of my enjoyment than almost any other possible choice, with the possible exception of making it like BSG. I find the Office just about unwatchable from all the deliberate awkwardness played as if it were humor.

And we've already seen the show, "take a well-loved SF franchise, fill it with incompetent assholes, and make it about their petty bullshit." It was called SG-U.
