As notorious as Fox is for cancelling sci-fi shows, they seem to have thrown an awful lot of money behind this one. I almost think the budget is too big at times, since there are so much CGI effects and cool-looking aliens that I worry they're shoehorning in aesthetic elements of Trek without bothering to integrate them into the story.

I'm actually worried MacFarlane is behind the creative decisions I don't like since the show is basically his brainchild, for which he casted himself as the central character. Not necessarily because I don't like his work, it's possible he may just be out of his element since he's trying to launch a franchise that isn't a crude and rude comedy.

The captain is probably my least favorite character because he's so generic. What was the point of the backstory about his divorce and the admiralty's reservations about promoting him if he's going to be a perfectly capable, responsible, and rational leader who gets along with everyone? Whenever he acts petty, it feels so forced.

Part of me wishes that everyone would be bigger jerks to each other just so there'd be more comedy and personal conflict. I like that the show is trying to be a spiritual successor to Star Trek, but I was also hoping that it would parody elements of it. Wouldn't it be funny to see a Office-style workplace comedy on a spaceship where the crew are crazy/incompetent misfits that have to overcome petty issues between them in order to get anything done?
