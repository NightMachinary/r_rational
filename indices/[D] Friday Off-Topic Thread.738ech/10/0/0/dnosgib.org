Well, "most TV shows" is not a very high bar. More intelligent than the old Star Treks IMO. A lot of the arguments were terrible, but at least they tried with things like using a 3 legged person as an analogy. Them actually losing the debate is also another plus.

I agree with you on the first and second, but the fourth gets better!
