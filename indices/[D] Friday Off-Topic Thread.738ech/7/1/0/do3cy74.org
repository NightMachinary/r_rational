Sorry about taking so long to get back to you, and thank you for your recommendations.

Godspeed was interesting, and I've added the album to a collection that I listen to while I'm writing.

Lake St. Dive was hard to figure out at times. I listened to one of their songs on repeat for at least an hour, trying to figure out whether I liked it enough to download it. I'm definitely checking out their other albums.

I listened to a couple of Pearl Jam albums, including Ten, but there was something about the music that didn't quite sit right with me. I'm going to take a look at some bands that are similar to Pearl Jam to see if I can figure out what's going on there.

Queen is good, yes.

Thank you again for your recommendations!
