SlateStarCodex has been talking a lot about Predictive Processing lately (the idea that you brain mostly runs a hierarchy of modules, where each modules receives predictions/guesses/orders from above, data from below, and tries to 'connect' the two with Bayesian-like computations).

Does anyone know if there is a plausible framework / theory out there that uses PP to explain and predict Ego Depletion?

My personal gut feeling is that the two are probably strongly connected (assuming they're both real). I'm guessing that whatever mechanisms we use to take non-obvious decisions is heavily dependent on the Top-Down part of PP, and Ego Depletion happens either when some sort of limited resource powering Top-Down PP runs out, or when the Top-Down part of our brains "overheat".

Obviously, I don't have a strong background in neurology, and I have no idea if what I said even made sense. Has research been done in that direction before?
