Where can I find actual info on how often armed citizens successfully stop a would-be active-shooter? I've been interested in this topic for a while but not only is it tough to find non-politicized sources (that either only focus on failures or only focus on an anecdotal story of a success) but what little there is tends to not delineate in how the situation ended.
