Again, anecdotal/other cops may have different preferences, but immediately point the gun at the ceiling or ground, then slowly separate your hands. Basically, the first part of getting disarming as if you were being arrested except don't get down on your knees or place the gun on the ground until asked. This is when you try to explain that you have a concealed carry license and are not the shooter. You'll probably be shouted at until you get on the ground anyway, and if you are, you should completely disarm and comply. This is a terrible position to be in with an active shooter around, so you'll probably end up being arrested or at least disarmed and asked to kneel, so you should try to avoid moving around with your gun out. Also, while this may sound terrible, it really is good advice, if you're black or visibly middle eastern, don't risk being in weaver stance in an active shooter situation, because all it takes is one jumpy officer to ruin your month and/or end your life. It's just not worth the risk.
