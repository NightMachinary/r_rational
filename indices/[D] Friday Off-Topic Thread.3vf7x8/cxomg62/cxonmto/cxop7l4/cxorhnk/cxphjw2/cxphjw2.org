Discworld is a collection of small stories in a big setting. HP and Naruto are big stories in small settings. In Discworld (and HHG2G), it feels like there's so much more world left to build, while in HP and Naruto you feel like you have the entire setting once you're done. Not to mention the difficulty of approaching canon flavor for things like Discworld and HHG2G, which are at least partially famous /for/ their flavor.
