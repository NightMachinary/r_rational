I'm working on a CCG (like Magic and Pokemon), just for fun (not planning on selling it).

Looking for theme ideas that'll fit the mechanic I'm planning on using. Both players will build their decks beforehand, trying to do something clever but not obvious. You hand your deck to the other player and they hand you theirs, you look through it for a minute or two (timed), then you start playing. You play through, then you switch decks and play with the one you built in the first place, and whichever deck won the first time, has to win better when it's creator is playing with it.

So, what theme makes sense to have you play twice, the first time with your opponents deck. I've got some ideas which I'll hold off on posting them for a while, so as to keep the idea space open.
