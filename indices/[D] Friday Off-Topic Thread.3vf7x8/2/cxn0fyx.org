I wrote a novella, [[http://www.amazon.com/dp/B018WXZ1T6]["The Case of the Sleeping Beauties"]] which is available on Amazon as of yesterday for $0.99, or through Patreon if you're one of my backers (and it will eventually be available as pay-what-you-want through my website, once I get that working). It's a murder mystery with necromancers and prostitutes, but not particularly rational.
