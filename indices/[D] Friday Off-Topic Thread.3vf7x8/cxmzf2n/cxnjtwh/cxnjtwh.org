I learnt to solve one in high school. It impressed my friends for a few weeks. Then I forgot how, but relearned how in college. Now, I'm pretty sure I'd have to wait a decade to forget how to do one.

Also, the method I learned was the most basic of algorithms where you just need to get the white cross, and then you solve it piece by piece practically. Unless you get lucky, it's hard to get a sub 1:30 time using this method.
