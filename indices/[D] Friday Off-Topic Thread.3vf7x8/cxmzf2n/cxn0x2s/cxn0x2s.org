I learned this a while back, and I'm glad I did. It was a fun few days.

Anecdote time!

I actually started learning on a bus on the way out to a summer camp I worked as a counsellor for. I had the algorithm beside me for the bus ride, but was distracted and would keep losing my rhythm or make a minor mistake and have to start over, once I got the the camp, I had less time, but I would still practice with it during my downtime (the kids loved watching it and hearing what I was doing and why). It should be mentioned here that they were third to sixth graders.

About thirty-six hours after I started, I finally solved the cube! I felt enormously proud, and all the kids were ecstatic. They all begged to see it (to check that I had, indeed, solved it completely). As they passed it around, it came to this one kid.

And this kid....he weighed the cube in his hand, that cube I had spent hours on. He looked right into my eyes, saw my pride and joy. And, without hesitation, chucked the cube as hard as he could at the wall.

It shattered into a dozen pieces.

Why?

I have no idea.

Kids.
