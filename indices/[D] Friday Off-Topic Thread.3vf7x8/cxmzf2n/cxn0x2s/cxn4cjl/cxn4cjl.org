Not particularly relevant since it was years ago, but did the center frame or any the cubes actually break? Rubik's cubes are surprisingly easy to take apart and put back together again, assuming all the pieces are intact.

It's an excellent way to cheat, actually. Usually much quicker to just solve it normally if you already know how, but all the anecdotes about people taking the stickers off and putting them back on again are rather amusing, since that's literally the most effort-intensive method of cheating possible.
