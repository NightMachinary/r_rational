Anecdotal, I'm just an EMT who's asked a few policemen about their perspectives, but the most important thing from an LEO perspective is they need to be able to identify who's a shooter and who's a civilian immediately. Some pointers they gave were along the lines of: Only draw your weapon if you expect to be shooting it immediately, immediately disarm if you encounter LEOs and explain why you are armed, and don't pull your weapons around LEO's unless you've already gotten permission. As far as actually stopping a shooter, that's really hard to do unless you get the drop on them from very short range with a concealed weapon, and unless you're both lucky and above average with your aim and tactics, you're as likely to be a hindrance as a help. The takeaway was, basically pretend to be unarmed unless you get an opportunity to take out someone you're absolutely sure is a shooter from very close distance.
