For ensemble casts I like to do a spin around the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holland_Codes][Holland Codes]]. Setting up a variety of problem-solving strengths (and weaknesses) forces cooperation, inspires arguments, and helps establish conflicting goals and passions.

All sorts of excellent fodder to inspire productive dialogue with multiple believable answers, and generally keep the story moving.
