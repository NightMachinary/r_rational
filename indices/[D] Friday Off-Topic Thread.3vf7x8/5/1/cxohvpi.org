I'm reading The Games We Play by Ryuugi, a fanfiction which crosses RWBY/The Gamer but has its own extremely in-depth world-building, and a lot of the mythos draws from Jewish mysticism. So a lot of the story draws from the metaphysical ideas in Kabbalah, whch focus heavily on the 10 'emanations' of God, the Sephirot.

Looking into the Sephirot has yielded some interesting creative ideas for me regarding what kind of ideas characters can typify. So a character could typify Gevurah, divine judgement without mercy. Or Chesed, which is divine compassion and mercy.

Or a character could typify Keter, which is "Being desire to bring the world into being" and " although it contains all the potential for content, it contains no content itself". So this character could b someone who has no intrinsic direction to his/her life but rather has a lot of potential-- their very identity is based around being potential itself.

This is all getting rather abstract and unintelligible, but basically, I think mystical mythos/tradition have a lot of archetypes that are useful for creative work.
