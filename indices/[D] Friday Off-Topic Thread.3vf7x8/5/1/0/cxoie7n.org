I'm reading that as well and /just/ got to the section where the Sepheriot is laid out. The name "Keter" prompted me to go look up the reference, because I'd seen that before (as an SPC classification).

Interestingly, RWBY itself uses a very classical four humors ensemble, down to the color coding (red humor = sanguine, yellow humor = choleric, etc.). And though I haven't gotten to the reveal of the Riders, if there is one at this point, I thought that was drawing on some kind of Four Horsemen thing.
