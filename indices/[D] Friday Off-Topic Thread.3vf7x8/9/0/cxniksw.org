Overly sensitive moderators seem to be abundant in sustainable, big online communities (Teamliquid is an example of a webforum with very aggressive moderation but a very loyal and active community). This is not a coincidence.

Small communities don't need serious moderation since they self-moderate quite a bit. Outside of very occasional off-topicness, for example, [[/r/rational][r/rational]] is pretty much self-policing. We all know each other and post things we like.

Big communities are toughter. Communities that have upvotes/downvotes like reddit can be, to an extent, self-moderating and allow a light moderation touch, even when they get big. That's really great. That being said, upvote/downvote tree commenting (compared to a traditional bulletin board reply age sort system) isn't used everywhere since it has its own drawbacks. Part of what draws people to places like 40kO, TeamLiquid or SpaceBattles is the format. However, bulletin board format has its own problems too! And really big bulletin boards are hard to moderate.

You'll notice there aren't a lot of big traditional forum communities that are both 1) good and 2) lightly moderated. This is because your moderation options for a big community like these are limited! If you are too light on moderation, things go downhill really fast because individual users don't have the power to "downvote" a thread, and replying to a bad thread bumps it, so telling off a bad poster actually makes things worse, etc.

So basically your options are "Wretched Hive of Scum and Villainy" or "Police State", and if you want people to actually post fanfics, it has to be the latter, or you have to use a different format. [[http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/tl-community/17883-tlnet-ten-commandments][Team Liquid]], for example, has a set of rules that begins with "This is our house" and is broad and empowering to the moderators.

In general, I would like a fanfiction community that was 1) big, 2) BBS style, 3) lightly moderated, and 4) not a wretched hive of scum and villainy. I'm pretty sure it's not possible to have all 4 of these at once, though.
