The idea of figuring out how a deck works as you play reminds me of Sentinels of the Multiverse, which does that in a cooperative setting. I think part of the key is the many moving parts with which to interact with and thus be useful to the team (deck, discard, allies, enemy boss, enemy minions, environment).

As for a theme, I'm imagining a competitive game with multiple win conditions, scorekeeping that allows for the comparison, and cards which can pursue multiple different conditions either simultaneously or exclusively to obfuscate which your deck is built towards achieving.

To that end, perhaps a theme of Civilization, with cultural, military, economic, political, and scientific victories to pursue. Perhaps every Civ has the cards to build towards 3 of the 5, and you and your opponent have to figure out which of those 3 this deck is best for.

Another idea that just came into my head was mad scientists. You and another classic mad scientist have broken enough each other's respective lairs simultaneously and are both seeking to take over the world. Similar to the above idea, you could win the world by controlling the political system, extorting the world's economy, military subjugation, cultural control, or sabotaging your opponent. That has the right feel of you trying to figure out how your opponent's mad science and gadgets work while he does the same with yours.
