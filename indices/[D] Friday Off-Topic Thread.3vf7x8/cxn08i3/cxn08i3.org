Christmas shopping time! What gifts are giving, or looking to receive? I have to shop for ten people this year, which is creating some interesting budget problems because of travel plans next year.

I have to pick between [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_(manga][/Emma/]] (no, not [[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/158/158-h/158-h.htm][that /Emma/]]) and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Bride%27s_Story][/A Bride's Story/]], both by Kaoru Mori. My SO would love either, but I only have the space for one. /Emma/ also has an anime adaption, but the buying the discs for that incurs other logistical problems since I'd have to include a portable DVD drive.

[[http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/12/03/product-recommendations-2015/][Scott Alexander put up some ideas too]].
