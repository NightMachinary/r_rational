I've been thinking about what I want to write next, once I've finished all my deliverables for current projects, which has led me down the rabbit hole of looking into [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Personality_typologies][personality typologies]]. There are a ton of these out there and lots of them just read like straight-up character personality descriptions, so I think it would be pretty neat to use one of them as a template for a group of characters. I could just pick a random typology like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram_of_Personality][Enneagrams]] and say, "Alright, there are going to be nine principle characters that more or less hew to these types, which is going to define their conflicts and friendships.

There are just /so many ways/ to type people, which I think plays to my natural love of ordered systems. I have a lot of questions about how accurate any of them are (whether these typologies have undergone any sort of blind testing and whether they can make accurate predictions) but there's something comforting about the idea of saying "there are nine sorts of people" or "there are four sorts of people", which feels better than saying "there are between three and sixteen types of people" or just "there are people and we're really crap at figuring them out in any ordered way".

There was a post on the frontpage of TIL today about Japanese blood type personality theory, which would be really interesting if true, which is why people treat it as though it were true; if you could know someone's personality from a simple blood test, it would simplify your interpersonal dealings enormously. The same goes for Western Zodiac signs.

Any personality type systems that you particularly like? Any you think would adapt well to fiction?
