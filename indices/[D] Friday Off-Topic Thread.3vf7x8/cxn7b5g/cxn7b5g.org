Since I /have/ been stumbling upon several good story recommendations that're hosted on spacebattles.com, I've been thinking that it should be like darklordpotter.net, more or less. Turns out they have overly sensitive moderators, and stories hosted there can actually suffer from it. Not happy with this, but whatever.
