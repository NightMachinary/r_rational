  Miller said that law enforcement contacted him on Thursday night to say their investigation was complete and he could enter the property. He arrived on Friday morning to assess the damage caused by officers when they searched the home, fearing that it was booby-trapped. “I opened the door,” Miller said. “Once you open the door ... they kind of forced their way in.”

  At a later press conference, FBI assistant director David Bowdich said the agency had returned authority to the apartment back to the owners after the search. “Last night we turned that over back to the residents,” he said. “Once we're out, we don't have control of it.”

It's still abhorrent behavior and proof of how terrible news reporters are when they smell blood, but it's not disruption of a crime scene because the crime scene had already been handed back to the owner of the property by law enforcement, at which point he would have been perfectly within his rights to strip the place bare [edit: depending on renter's rights in California]. (He also would have been perfectly within his rights to call the cops on the reporters for trespassing, but doesn't appear to have done so.)
