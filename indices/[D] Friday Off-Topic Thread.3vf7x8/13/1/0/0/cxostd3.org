Generally I swing over to ff.net, pick a fandom and sort by most favourites and >100,000 words then click through until I find one that looks interesting and had a solid start. Once that method started to dry up working I started clicking on the favourite stories tab of authors whose stories I enjoyed, working on the theory that if I like their stuff then I'll probably like the stuff they like. After that I sorted SB and SV creative writing forums by most views and went down the list reading anything that seemed interesting.

As for why? I've been churning through books at a ridiculous rate since primary school. When I was 12 I'd have bought a new book on monday and be finished by wednesday and I've sped up a lot since then. Put simply, I'm going to read things. It's just going to happen given who I am, so I might as well read good stuff if that what's going to happen.

Edit: I suppose I feel like I can count on fanfiction? If I'm reading a book and it turns out to be terrible then I've already bought the thing, but if I'm reading a fic I can just close the story and move on with nothing lost. That, and I'd have to buy maybe 1-4 books a week to keep up with the amount of reading I do.
