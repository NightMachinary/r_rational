This is exactly why (and how) I read fanfics, as well. Though lately I've been sorting by >60K words instead, as I've run out of fics in my preferred fandoms.

As well, sometimes I get in the mood for reading an extension of some story -- What'd happen if things turned out differently, or whatnot. Fanfics are good for that.
