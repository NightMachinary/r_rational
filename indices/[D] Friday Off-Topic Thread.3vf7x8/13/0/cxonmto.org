What do you mean by recommendation? Story by author one likes, personal recommendation, community endorsement, sorting ff.net by favorites/reviews, ... ?

If you mean what I do when I want to read a fanfiction without knowing which in advance is to go on ff.net and filter/sort a fandom down until I find a description/length/characters I like and start reading.

As for why I guess that if I find the canon story fun then a good fanfiction should be able to do that at least as good and provide new perspectives/ideas. Also many fanfics which actually get recommended one way or another often do reference the fandom at large.
