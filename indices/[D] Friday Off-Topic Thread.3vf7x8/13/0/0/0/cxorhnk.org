Most actual real books I read these days are non-fiction. And some sf/fantasy.

I can't really put in words the difference between media which has a lot of fanfiction: Harry Potter (729K), Naruto (394K) and something like Discworld (2K).

I have read about 7-8 Discworld novels and they were kinda ... neat I guess but I would never get the idea to recommend them to somebody else.

Imagining my own adventures in the world of Harry Potter and Naruto is easy and I have done so many times but in Discworld it seems to me that somehow there is one story in a book which just ends when I am done reading.

And I guess I mostly read fanfiction to improve and extend my favorite fictional worlds by the views of many people to be able to better play with these worlds.
