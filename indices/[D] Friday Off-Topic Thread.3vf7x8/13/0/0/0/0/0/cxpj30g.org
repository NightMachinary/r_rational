Thanks that makes sense. And I think what you have said [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3vo31u/q_examples_of_realistic_rational_fiction/cxpe1c2][elsewhere]] also applies. Discworld seems to be much closer to reality. HP and Naruto are simpler in limited locations, organisations, people etc. One Piece for example also has fewer fan fiction maybe in part because of that.

And then is also the matter of influence. Ninjas and Magic Users can simple do more to influence their environment. Sort of defined magic systems help too.
