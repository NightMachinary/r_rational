I think Amazon must just stick the actual data into a sample format and calculate the pages from there, since they don't do it by total "locations" (equivalent to 128 bytes of data). So if you have two pieces of text with the same number of words, or the same amount of data, the number of pages just reflects how it actually exists on the screen.
