You probably have an additional step where I don't. With the method I learnt, the most you ever needed to memorize were four different statesfor each step. Other, faster methods would have you merging some of these steps, meaning you'd need to memorize an increasing number of set ups, so you could solve it with less information (aka less of the cube being solved)
