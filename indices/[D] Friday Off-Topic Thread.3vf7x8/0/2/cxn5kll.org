Just earlier this week, I spent an hour with a website trying to solve my cube. I messed up once -- never could keep my clockwise straight from counterclockwise -- and ended when I'd solved the bottom face and the bottom two rows of each side. But none of the algorithms for the top face are making any sense; can you share a source for solving it?
