Solving it the first time by figuring it out myself was an experience I'd have lost if I'd looked up the algorithm. Solving a Rubik's cube again now that I know how is more of a fun thing to occupy your hands with. (It gives a little mental "ding!" of achievement every time, which may or may not be a thing for other people.) So if I couldn't figure it out the first time myself, that's what looking up a method would get me.

But there's also really complicated algorithms with lots of subcases to solve a Rubik's cube very quickly. It's not currently a priority, but it would be interesting to try to learn one of those: a very hard challenge that's very different from things I've done before and produces tangible impressive results.
