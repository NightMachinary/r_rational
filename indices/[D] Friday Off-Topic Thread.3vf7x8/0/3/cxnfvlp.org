It's easier to learn than most people expect.

I was once on a loooong bus-across-the-US volunteer trip that I found out very early on I didn't want to be a part of, much too late to back out. I managed to stay sane by buying a Rubik's cube at the first stop and then teaching a person or two how to solve it on the 6-8 hour bus rides between destinations. They usually picked it up in about an hour, and I'd have them spend the next hour trying it on their own and answering questions along the way. One of them came up to me a month later to show me that they still remembered how to do it.

It's a unique way to make friends if you happen to be stuck with a lot of time.
