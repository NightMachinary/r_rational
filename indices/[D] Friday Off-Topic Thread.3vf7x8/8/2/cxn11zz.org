My side of the family has done a pretty good job of reducing Christmas down to being very low budget and with little fanfare, for which I am grateful. My wife also handles much of our joint gift-giving duties, for which I am also grateful.

My only real obligation for Christmas is figuring out something to get for my wife, which is difficult because we already have all the things that we want (we're having a baby in February, so we need baby stuff, but I don't think that's appropriate for our mutual gift-giving). I'll probably just end up getting her something off her Amazon wishlist, which takes some of the guesswork out of gift-giving.
