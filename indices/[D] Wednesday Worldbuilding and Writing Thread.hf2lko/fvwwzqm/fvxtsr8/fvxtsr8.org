World of Darkness itself explores this very topic extensively, both explaining several dozen alternative ways vampires can govern themselves, and also in very, very extensive detail, why the "feudal" system works best.

Before we explore it, lets agree on several "vampire facts":

- vampires need human blood, and human blood is a scarce resource

- in general, vampires become more powerful with age, and in most cases, parent vampire is always stronger than their child

- unless killed, vampires can "live" forever, or nearly so.

- vampiric blood has strange, magical or addictive properties

- vampires prefer not to have mortals know too much about them

â€‹

Now, if you cross that facts with one another, you soon see a pattern emerge. Older, more powerful vampires will amass more and more power, in order to control their supply of human blood, which in most cases means population control or land control. Older vampires will thus be able to fend off younger upstarts, unless said upstarts massively organise against them, because frankly, one millennium old vampire can tear 10 century old vampires to shreds, and proly eat them too.

What emerges, is a structure similar to a social pyramid: Ancient vampire(s) at the top, controlling entire continents. Elder vampires subservient to them, but somewhat independent. Average vampires below Elders, and fresh vamps at the bottom of the ladder.But the system also requires a sort of "trickle down economics" of blood. The Elders want the youngsters under them to be relatively content, non-rebellious and not making trouble, so they keep them fed and organised, preside over disputes, and lay down the law, so that the unlife would not descent into chaos and anarchy.

Any youngster who goes against that system gets eaten. Any Ancient/Elder who goes against the system gets rebelled against and eaten.

In the end, most of vampires organise along the lines of either a feudal system, or a Guild, or a kind of corporation, with a clear pyramid of power, and the responsibility that goes with that power. Its not that they want to, it is simply the only system that reliably works.

(It does help a bit that a lot of older vamps were literally feudal lords in their mortal life, and the Ancients remember the age of God Kings and Emperors - so the system feels natural to them).

Having said that, there are systems of governance in WoD Vampire, that are different:

- Sabbat: is a lose coalition of anti-feudal vampires, who do not care about being in balance with humanity or obedience to their elders. They maintain the coherence of their structure by the ritual of Vaulderie - they mix and drink each other's blood to create bonds of kinship and loyalty, without which they would tear one another.

- Setites, Baali, Samedi, etc - some vampires worship dark gods and demons, and thus their structure is not based on power and age, but rather on religious rites, and dogma.

- Oradea - basically vampire libertarians: old, powerful vamps who just want to be left alone, and only interact with one another to fend off the encroaching vampire sects.

- Anarchs - what it says on the tin: a mixture of communism and might-makes-right oneupmanship, unified only by their opposition to power and control.

- The Black Hand - a sect within a sect that is organised like a military group mixed with a research facility, and organised along strict lines of meritocracy, order and pragmatism.

In conclusion: nearly all vampiric systems of governance and society are based on one realisation: vampires are unequal, and the system must reflect and utilise their inequality. There can be no democracy between vamps if one is barely a human with fangs, and the other is a 1000 year old blood necromancer who can bench-press a bus and bite an anvil in half.
