So, urban fantasy vampire tropes usually have kingdoms (True Blood, WoD for example). It's a kind of feudal system which I kind of accepted uncritically as being "the way vampires are".

But in real life, we have everything from the uncontacted mysterious sentinelese people to North Korea's oppressive government to the soviets to China's... whatever they have going there to the Nordic countries pro-socialist stance while the American libertarians want to stop you taking their guns away while the king of Bhutan wants people to plant trees for his birthday instead of having a big state event and I know nothing about the no doubt super varied traditional tribal systems in Africa, South America, Australia, and the Pacific that suffer under the yoke of colonialism to this day.

So... the idea that vampires, who have much more self-determination (by virtue of living longer), decided that the 1600s England (or whatever) was the peak of society is kind of.... lol. Sure, maybe the English, American, Australian vampires decided that because they're influenced by their human culture substrate (but also... maybe not? if a man from the dark ages believes in the divine rights of kings, then he won't necessarily change his mind after 500 years of living as a god-king).

So, for aesthetic reasons I like the idea of My Vampires having a good-sized contingent with the traditional "Kingdoms", but it would be fun to have passing references to "Suriname has a Queen, of course, for diplomatic business with other vampire nations, but she's randomly selected from all the vampires who live in the country because they operate under a communist style of government." etc.

So... does anyone know any cool articles about systems of government / rule that are/were actually used in the world? Any cool ideas they've been thinking of for how an enterprising vampire might create her own equivalent of Sealand to govern using something like one of SSC's "political systems not much different from our own"? Any ways I can twist the feudal system to be a bit more interesting / innovative?

*tl;dr does anyone know a good article, which if written in Cracked style would be titled "7 weird systems of government that you won't believe are running countries right now"*
