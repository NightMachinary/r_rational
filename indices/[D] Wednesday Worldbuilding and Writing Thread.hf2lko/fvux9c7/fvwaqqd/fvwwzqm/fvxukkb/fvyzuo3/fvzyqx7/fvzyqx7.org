20:00 in East Australia is high noon here (South Africa). There's a lot of interesting nature around here, in the sense of attracting tourists (at least before Coronavirus kind of put the whole tourist thing in trouble). If you're interested in mountains, you have the pick of the Drakensberg range or Table Mountain; a baseline human child is unlikely to get worse than chilly. If you're looking for animals, there's a number of national parks of which the Kruger National Park is the most famous - survivability there might be a bit iffy if a baseline human child teleports in, because the animals might take offence if surprised (and an elephant taking offence can easily squash a baseline human child) but is quite survivable if that doesn't happen.
