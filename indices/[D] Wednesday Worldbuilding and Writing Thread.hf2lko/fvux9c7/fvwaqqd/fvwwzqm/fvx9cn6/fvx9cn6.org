[[http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Course_Pages/legal_systems_very_different_12/LegalSystemsDraft.html][Legal Systems Very Different From Ours]] is an in-depth look at... well, exactly what it says on the tin. Several of the systems covered (Roma, Amish, Orthodox Jewish) are from societies that are embedded in a larger one, which means they have to deal with some problems that your vampires will have to as well. Though these are also all underprivileged and marginalized societies - and human - so there's a limit to how applicable their systems are to immortal power-hoarding vampires. (Also don't do a Jewish-coded vampire conspiracy, that's tapping into a long and shitty history :-P.)
