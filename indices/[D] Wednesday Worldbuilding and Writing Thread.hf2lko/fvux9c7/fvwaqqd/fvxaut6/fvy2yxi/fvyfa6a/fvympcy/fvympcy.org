Thats the general idea, with benders being able to control a wide variety of materials. Pure forms of different materials would be extracted and used as tools/weapons/heirlooms. As with modern society specialization would arise within the different states of matter and roles in society.

For example in the military defensive-focused mages would emphasize working with solids like lead or liquids with high viscosity to absorb impact, while offensive specialists would focus in more rigid materials like steel.

Additionally, the workplace would contain similar specializations. A mage employed at a power plant might work exclusively with liquids that have a high heat transfer rate, etc.

Finally yes, there would definitely be various perception tricks like a tremor sense, reading air currents, or motion through water. I dont have any hard numbers for ranges, but in theory a beginner could sense/control a few meters, a professional dozens of meters and the extremely rare archmage hundreds.
