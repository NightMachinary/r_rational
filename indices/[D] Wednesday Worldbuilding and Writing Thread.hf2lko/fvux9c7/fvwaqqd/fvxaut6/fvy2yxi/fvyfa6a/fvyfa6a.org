Interesting, so can a solid bender use all solid material but only so long as it's a solid? If not, how are different state benders differentiated?

I suppose you could have it so that, for example, a liquid bender can only stick their magic into matter that is currently in a liquid state, but once the magic is in the matter they can change its state and maintain control of it.

Also, what sort of range and sensory control do these magic users have? On the latter subject, could a gas user controlling all the air in a room feel how it's displaced by objects/people? If this is the case then all benders with enough precision should essentially have a sixth sense from filling the air with small particulates.
