A couple of days ago, I finished writing the first draft of a novel...

... What do you think I should do with it?

I already plan on the standard 'take some time off, then revisit the draft with fresh eyes' to improve it; but once I've made the best draft I can, what next? Post it to my personal site, or to free writing gallery sites like RoyalRoad, or look into epublishing, or...? (I don't expect I'm going to make a single dime from this story; at best, it might provide some advertising for things I write in the future.)

(In case it makes a difference, it's [HSF][TH] with one background detail that's somewhere around One Small Fib on the [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MohsScaleOfScienceFictionHardness][Hardness Scale]], depending on how out-there you consider a particular physics theory to be.)
