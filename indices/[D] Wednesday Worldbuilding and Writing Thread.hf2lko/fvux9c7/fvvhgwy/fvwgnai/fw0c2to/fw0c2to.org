I've been trying to focus my attention on other things the last few days: manga, podcasts, news, and other such distractions. But I'll put it this way; I just spent the last two hours with a sleep-mask over my eyes and a desktop fan as a white-noise generator, and ended up thinking up about one and a half chapters of a sequel to this novel. (The first line: "The secret to telling a story with a happy ending is knowing when to stop talking.") I seem to be the opposite of burnt-out from pulling off a NaNoWriMo. So... this is a thing that could be happening.
