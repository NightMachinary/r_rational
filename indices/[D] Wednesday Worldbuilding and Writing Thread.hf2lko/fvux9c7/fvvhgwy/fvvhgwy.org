Depends what you want out of it. If you just want as many people reading your work as possible, royal road. If you want some chance of making money, try to submit to traditional publishers or just go the amazon kindle unlimited route (get some guidance of what it takes to self promote on amazon). If you want it to serve as advertisement, hold onto the book until you have another one ready, post it for free but put the other one up for sale.
