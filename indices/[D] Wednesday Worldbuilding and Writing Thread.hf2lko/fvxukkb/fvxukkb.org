*IMMORTALITY VS OVERPOPULATION.*

Can we discuss this old hat in detail?

Assuming the story contains biological "immortality" (which is simply a form of very good life extension technology). What would be the social and population ramifications, and how could overpopulation be avoided?

I know about some proposed ideas like enforced birth control or space colonisation, but these seem even harder to implement than a worldwide immortality serum, not to mention that even their best implementation would be to slow.
