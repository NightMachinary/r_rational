My first question would be how are you going to define these 'types' of material that can be used? Will people be able to control specific molecular structures, like H20, or only elements, like hydrogen and oxygen? If the latter, would someone with control over hydrogen/oxygen still be able to move water?

The power side of this seems to not only get you raw strength but also the heating and cooling and therefore the ability to change the matter's state. So what does the precision side have going for it? Atomically sharp projectiles? Generating sound?

Which brings me to a similar magic system I was thinking about not too long ago. Eventually, I started thinking that most of the "elements" could probably replicate interesting exploits from other elements. For example, if you can control small particles of 'earth' or water/liquid in the air with enough precision, could you technically oscillate them to make sounds (something I originally thought would be specific to wind/gas elementalists)?
