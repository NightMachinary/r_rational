So I've gone back to iron out the material definitions, and decided on doing it based off the states of matter: solid, liquid, and gas, which in-univeree be commonly associated with earth, water and air respectively. Fire, instead of being its own category, becomes the high end of a secondary "thermal affinity" that applies to all three categories. With this, you can have "fire mages" using any source materials, from gunpoweder to gasoline to hydrogen gas, depending on their personal material affinity.

As for the precision side, it would be a necessity for most mages in order to use thier own abilities to the fullest extent. Higher precision would allow for faster, more precise control over all of the states of matter, so unless you're Mr. "I didn't ask how big the room was, I said I cast fireball" it'll be essential for everyday use.
