I've been vaguely worldbuilding a hard magic system meant to work alongside modern physics, with the fundamental idea being telekinetic manipulation of matter. Magic users would at a basic level be able to control a fistful of material, with a natural affinity towards different types. Similar to ATLA, essentially, but with a scientific background. Instead of nebulous concepts like "earth" or "fire" it would be based off physical properties, but I haven't figured out any specifics.

Magic ability would be defined by "power" and "precision." Training to increase power would increase the maximum amount of matter you could directly control, like throwing larger boulders or heating something by a greater degree, whereas increasing precision would decrease the minimum size, for example launching a nail versus a brick, as well as allowing for finer control. Size would be directly linked to requirements for control, to prevent any easy mountain-throwing or atonic fuckery.

Magic capacity would probably be similar to muscular ability, without any inherent hard numbers and measured off tests of maximum amount or greatest precision. Like lifting weights, even an average magic user could wiggle a rock around all day, but tossing them hard might tire them out after a few hours and one or two large feats could put them out for a while.

These are all just rough ideas at this point, but if you have any thoughts about how it would work or noticed any glaring issues I'd love to hear them.
