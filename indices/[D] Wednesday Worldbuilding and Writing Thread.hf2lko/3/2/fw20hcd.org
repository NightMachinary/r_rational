Presumably, immortality will be a gradual development. Even though life expectancy in the US is in decline, average worldwide life expectancy is continuing to grow every year, with an average rate of about 0.7% increase in life expectancy at birth per year since 1900. Something close to this trend is likely to continue. There are a huge number of illnesses that cause people to die, some easier to treat than others, but all need to be solved for immortality. We'll keep addressing the low-hanging fruit in every decade, setting the stage for the medical advancements of the decade to follow. By 2100, a life expectancy at birth of about 128 years would not be unreasonable. By 2200, that would likely rise to 300 years at birth, although, when we're talking about numbers that far out, odds are good that medical science would develop fast enough to more or less provide immortality.

Of course, we're already seeing the social, ecological, and population ramifactions of growing lifespans and the consequent explosion in global population. Birth rates have been declining sharply in the developed world. Increasing pollution is causing increasing global temperatures which is changing weather patterns, resulting in a wide range of ecological challenges. Higher population density and increasingly frequent international travel is making it easier for infectious diseases to spread rampantly unless strict measures are taken to control the spread.

Overpopulation, at least to some extent, is probably unavoidable. It tends to make families less willing or able to have more children, so overpopulation itself is the one guaranteed way to slow population growth. Some countries, like China, may manage to enforce regulations which maintain a reasonable population, but most countries probably will not, or at least not until the problem is extremely severe, and the point where action has to be taken will likely set the status quo for future population density in that country.

Space colonization to avoid overpopulation is probably possible, but highly unlikely. We can't even convince oligarchs around the world to avoid polluting the planet with greenhouse gases, so unless there's some kind of global revolution which results in a new technocratic, liquid democracy which is very forward-thinking, I'd say there's probably no chance of overpopulation being solved in a comfortable way.
