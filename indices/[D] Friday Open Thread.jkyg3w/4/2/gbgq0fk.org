Or just take a few hints from the dozens of countries around the world where voting is NOT an ordeal that demands the best part of a person's day. Seriously, I lived in two countries (Italy and the UK) and voting has never been harder for me than going out of the front door, walking for 50/100 meters tops, entering some place, getting a ballot, putting a cross on it, putting it into a box and going home. Total time spent, ten minutes tops.
