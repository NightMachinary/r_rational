I have a huge kombucha habit, I really enjoy it - hits the sweet spot of low sugar / low caffiene readily available beverage for me.

It's very expensive so I considered making it myself but I realised there'd be issues with flavouring it (I like lemon and ginger flavour, and I'd need to work out how to add that), and also apparently if you make it at home it can end up being alcoholic? Which is not something I want to play with, ha.
