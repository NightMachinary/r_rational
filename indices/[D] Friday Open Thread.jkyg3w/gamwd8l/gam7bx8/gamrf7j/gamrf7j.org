I've been reading the Breath of the Wild fanfic '[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/again-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild.883292/#post-70489646][Again]]' lately.\\
It has some cool scenes so soft recommend for Legend of Zelda fans.

However, it's Friday not Monday and what I really wanted to discuss is its first chapter. The author's own pre-story summary basicly goes: Link beats BotW, credits roll, story begins. Then the first chapter is 9k words of 'Link beats BotW', when we could have just started at credits. This chapter's writing feels very sparse on descriptions, rushing through the plot points. It appears clear to me that the writer knew we didn't really needed/wanted to read most of it. I started skimming pretty early on, mostly collecting names; since even not having played the game I knew the general plot already.

Now here is my point.\\
I think that first chapter is very important.\\
There is a big difference between writing Link is tired and writing 9k words of Link running around. Even knowing the game, scrolling over the big wall of text is a visual reminder of Links heroics. Later chapters also give callbacks specifically using earlier layout. It felt like the author was not only using the words but also the space those words occupied.

Sometimes different story's do something similar generally leaving a bunch of space blank, mostly webfiction does this I think. I know Terry Pratchett had a single word on a page in one book. There are obviously more examples, but specifically this time I found it really interesting and enjoyable.
