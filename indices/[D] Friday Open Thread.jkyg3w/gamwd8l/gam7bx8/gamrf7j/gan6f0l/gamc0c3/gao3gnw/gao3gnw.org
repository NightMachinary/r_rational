Alternative solution:

- Pass a law requiring states to keep all polling places open for at least eight hours per day for at least one week immediately prior to any federal election deadline, thus changing "election day" to an election week.

- Add a legal requirement for employers to give each employee at least one day of paid vacation as a federal holiday during election week.

- Require states to provide enough polling stations such that no voter must travel more than 30 minutes by car to vote. Furthermore, each polling station must be staffed and equipped, including parking spaces and road capacity, such that it could accommodate all of the voters closest to it within a four-hour period.

- Violations of any of these criteria are cause to extend the election deadline until all criteria have been met for the period of one week. Any public officials responsible for violations of these criteria may be charged with election tampering and fined up to $1 million and/or sentenced to up to five years in prison.

So, if the polling station closest to you also happens to be the closest one for 50,000 other people, and if it takes three minutes for the average person to vote, then the station would need to be able to handle 1,296 people voting at the same time. If it can't handle that, then your state just needs to add some more polling stations around that densely-populated area.
