Ginger is apparently hard to get "right". Apparently the ginger doesn't form a cohesive taste normally. But lemon I would think is as easy as adding lemon juice before the second fermentaiton.

As for the alcohol content, it's technically always alcoholic, but ones sold in stores are less than 0.5% alcohol, which means they can be sold without a license. Google suggest that home brewed kombucha can get up to 3% ABV, which is less than a typical beer, but on average, it is only at 1%. And, this can be controlled by the way you brew. More bacteria means less alcohol; more yeast means more alcohol.
