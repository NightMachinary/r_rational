#+begin_quote

  1.  “Is the Mythos real... or am I having a psychotic break?” is the worst plotline.

  2.  “The protagonist's best friend who doesn't believe in the Mythos” is the worst viewpoint character.

  3.  No more writer protagonists.

  4.  H. P. Lovecraft should not exist in universe as a character whose short stories are entirely accurate descriptions of what happened in the real world, unless you have a REALLY good explanation.

  5.  Christianity should be false.

  6.  Do not systematize the horrors beyond our comprehension.

  7.  No wars of good versus evil, DERLETH.

  8.  NO ELEMENTAL ASSOCIATIONS, DERLETH

  9.  Make your tomes in some way different from the Necronomicon.

  10. Before you describe something as an unknowably evil horror, check that it is actually an unknowably evil horror, and not instead a totally knowable horror.

  11. You should not write entire paragraphs in italics.

  12. No long racist screeds.

  13. No takes on the Mythos that are exclusively “Lovecraft is racist.”
