Re: Christianity. If you consider it God already has pretty much all of the hallmarks of a cosmic horror actually.

Vastly powerful and mysterious beyond human comprehension? Check.

Humans literally die if they see his true form? Check.

Has minions are obviously Lovecraftian (like a flaming wheel covered in eyes) to the extent that they are more Lovecraftian than most actual mythos monsters? Check.

Send his half-breed child to earth in an attempt to spread his influence? Check.

Has plans to cause/allow the Apocolypse when the signs are right? Check.

Steals souls for his own designs? Check.

Hell, even the cross is just a mystical symbol that has great power against other otherworldly beings, but this time it requires you to believe in a specific cosmic horror, which again, seems pretty lovecraftian.
