  Before you describe something as an unknowably evil horror, check that it is actually an unknowably evil horror, and not instead a totally knowable horror.

Objection: in the time it takes to come closer and check, the evil horror, being a evil horror, might as well decapitate you with a bite, turn your brain into a swarm of ants, or do other such horror-like things, regardless of its theoretical epistemological status. The wise man doesn't waste time better spent running the fuck away.
