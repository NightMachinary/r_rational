Welcome to the pandemic fermentation rabbit hole ;)

I haven't gotten to Kombucha yet. It is a multi-stage process, and aerobic fermentation means stuff can go wrong (worms, flies, ...) whereas anaerobic fermentation seems to be pretty much fool-proof (but you get alcohol).

My tips: Just buy a starter culture/SCOBY from e.g. a web shop and don't try to make your own. For example, I bought a Ginger Beer Plant SCOBY.

It is hard to beat active dry yeast. Mix tea and apple juice directly in a plastic bottle. Add a small amount of ale yeast (e.g. S-04), then fully close up after a certain amount of time (e.g. one day... depends on desired sweetness, content, yeast amount and temperature), then wait ~another day till the plastic bottle doesn't give when squeezed then put in fridge. You get something with ~2% alcohol but it works about the same every time.

The main issue I have is that most/all the commercial stuff is force carbonated and equipment for that is expensive. Using bottle fermentation for carbonization you get something that is either dry (or artificially sweetened), or that you have to store in the fridge (or you do an error-prone bottle pasteurization). Then depending on the nutrients in the ferment, yeast, bacteria, temperature etc. you might get a sulfur smell in the captured carbon (search for "rhino farts").
