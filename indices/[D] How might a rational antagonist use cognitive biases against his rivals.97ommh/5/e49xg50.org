This would be a pretty bad plan. Biases exert influence when someone has enough information to come to the right conclusion but then they go to the wrong one instead. But a good villain shouldn't be giving away possible clues without significant recompense. So biases would only ever be used incidentally as part of backup backup plans.

A detective novel of some kind might be a good place to look for this. My first thought was that Death Note might have some of what you're looking for. Alternatively, is there any genre of fiction in which people spend a lot of effort trying to manipulate public opinion? I guess Shadows of the Limelight would involve this, to an extent.

If you're looking for deceptive characters, and not ones who leverage named biases specifically, the Vorkosigan Saga by Bujold and the Going Postal series by Pratchett are both good.
