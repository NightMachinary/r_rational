"Rivalry" is a cognitive bias in and of itself.

It's something like 'target fixation'. People focus so intently on their immediate-next-step ("observe the motorcycle" / "beat this specific guy") that they lose sight of their long-term-goal ("don't crash" / "win large-scale victories").

When you realize your opponent is doing this, you look for the places where you could be "defeated" without losing much ground on the things you care about. Alternately, look for long-term gains that don't look like a "victory".

Say we find ourselves in a Highschool Tennis Anime. My true goal is "be the best tennis player when we graduate in 4 years." I realize I have a rival. My rival's goal is "defeat [[/u/best_cat]] at whatever formal contest is next." The first thing I notice is that I don't have to care about my rival. But maybe contests provide some resource, so I need to win some.

Next step is looking for resources that don't seem like overt prizes and get those before they're contested ("Hey, senior student / inexplicably talented janitor, are you up for games on weekends?"). Then, I'd look for contests that WILL become relevant in 4 months, and see if I can start laying groundwork now.

Then I'd invent stuff for my opponent to do. They want to defeat me. I want to build resources. So create contests where they spend a bunch of energy "winning" a morale-victory, but not getting resources. ("Hey! A week of snack-money says I'm a better player with my off hand!")
