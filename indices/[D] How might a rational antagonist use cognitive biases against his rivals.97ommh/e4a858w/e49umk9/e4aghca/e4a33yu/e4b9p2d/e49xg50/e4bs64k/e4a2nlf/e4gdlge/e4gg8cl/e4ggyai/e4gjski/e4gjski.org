I suppose you can narrow your concept of rival down to that if you want to. That feels one dimensional, limiting, to me. Heroes and villains can be rivals with each other.

Superman vs Lex Luthor were rivals for the public regard, each trying to prove the other one is the real bad guy.

Spiderman and Venom are rivals. Plenty of hero/villain rivals for a relationship.

How about a villain pretending to be a hero? Or a struggling hero cast as a villain?

There are so many examples and possibilities for the concept of "rival"... why stick to the simple version?
