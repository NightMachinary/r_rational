That's what I meant. The OP asked about how a rational antagonist could use biases against their rivals. If by rivals here we mean the heroes, and not other villains that they're struggling with over the same goals, then your suggestion would require the heroes to be the racist/sexist ones, and that wouldn't make them feel very heroic - unless being tricked by the villain on the basis of it was a starting point for a character arc of self-improvement.
