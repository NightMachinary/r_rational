In Le Carre's Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy the mastermind sets up Smiley by having the mole cuckold him. This becomes a source of negative emotions and aversion to considering the suspect. Smiley is so sure that the guy is an awful, vicious idiot that he is unable to see him objectively and notice clues about his involvement with things gone wrong.

This sort of thing happens all the time in stories where bias is a main character. We enter the scene with the subject, who is set up to look like the protagonist but has a cognitive bias, then we see the antagonist who looks stereotypical, and then the antagonist gets one over on the protagonist because of the latter's inability to recognize that the former's stereotype is actually a mask.

"Sorry to Bother You" has a lot of this going on, where people are all treating each other out of context. I couldn't swear to it, but I suspect that the more you look, the more cognitive bias you'll see in every character. Some are real villains, some are opportunists, some are just getting by, and some are heroes.
