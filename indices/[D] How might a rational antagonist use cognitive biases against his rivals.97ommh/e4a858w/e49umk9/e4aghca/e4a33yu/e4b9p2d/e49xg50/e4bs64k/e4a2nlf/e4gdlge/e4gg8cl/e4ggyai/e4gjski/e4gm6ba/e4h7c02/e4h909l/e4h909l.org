  3) you have this literally backwards

I think you do. The OP says "How might a rational antagonist use cognitive biases against his rivals?". The trick is used by the antagonist, the hero is thus the one who has the cognitive biases that are exploited. I don't think the genre has much to do with it.

I know it doesn't make much difference in practice as it can be done either way, and I didn't mean to make this a long discussion. I just made a joke about how applying your proposal to the scenario suggested by the OP might make the hero less than sympathetic.
