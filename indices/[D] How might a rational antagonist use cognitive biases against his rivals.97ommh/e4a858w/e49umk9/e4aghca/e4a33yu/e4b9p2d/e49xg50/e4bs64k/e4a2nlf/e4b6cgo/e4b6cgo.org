I think that can work if the antagonist (Ant) and his rival (Riv) are talking with each other.

For example Ant wants Riv to commit to a bet he is likely to win. So they both are on motor cycles (or horse golems or what ever) and Ant says to Riv: "The king/boss/authority figure said a great rider/driver could jump over the bolder if he is fast enough."

Riv believing he is a great rider, wants to prove that: "Yeah, I can do that. This should be easy for me."

Ant shouts: "No, you will kill yourself."

Riv jumps over the bolder with ease and also over the cliff behind it.

So Ant used (badly) authority bias, anchoring and probably some others, to get Riv to kill himself.

And afterwards he uses the hindsight bias to show how it was clear, Riv would die. And he was the only one trying to stop him.

But honestly that is a bad written example.
