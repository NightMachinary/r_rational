1) yes 2) no 3) you have this literally backwards. If the protagonist is a woman and their rival the antagonist is a mysoginist, then it fits as an answer just fine.

Why did you assume the main character of the story is even under discussion? Not necessary for purposes of an antagonist and their rivals? The protagonist can easily get caught up in the rivalries of others as part of the story. We generally have one protagonist in a story, but a protagonist wasnt mentioned. There can be many villains and many heroes and they can all be rivals with each other in a story...

I can see that you seem frustrated. I am not trying to annoy you. We just seem to have come at this from different directions. I am guessing you write in a different genre than I do, so villain/hero/rival have additional connotations to me.
