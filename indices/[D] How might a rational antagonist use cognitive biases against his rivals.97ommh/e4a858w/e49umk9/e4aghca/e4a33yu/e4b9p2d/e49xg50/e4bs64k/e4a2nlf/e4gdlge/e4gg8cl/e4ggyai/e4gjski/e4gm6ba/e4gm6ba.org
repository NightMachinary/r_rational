I did not say heroes and villains can't be rivals.

My point was:

1) the OP asks how might a rational /antagonist/ use cognitive biases against his rivals;\\
2) the /rival/ of an /antagonist/ must be, if not another villain, the /protagonist/, aka: the hero;\\
3) the trick you suggested only works if the victim (namely, in this case, the rival) is racist or sexist;

THEREFORE

for your trick to apply to the scenario the OP asked about, the hero would need to be racist or sexist. Or at least having some form of strong enough prejudice to be impairing. That's it.
