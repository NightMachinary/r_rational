If you know what bias this falls under, I'd be interested to know. This happened to me inadvertently.

tl;dr People have a tendency to assign blame for malicious events that negatively affect them to their most available competition or enemy.

I was acting as a merchant in an online game, as were guy A and guy B. We were all in different areas, they knew each other but had not 'met' me as I'd just come online that day. Basically guy A and guy B had been competing in the same item categories (and now had some overlap with me), but apparently still had enough moral scruples not to fuck with each other as badly as I was about to... By DDoSing guy A with fake customers using unrealistic item prices.

Given the nature of the game, I don't really know if this works until I check up. When I do, I see guy A in a tiff with guy B (who I had not spammed). Then I check the boards, and sure enough someone (who I must assume is guy A retaliating) posting fake offers under guy B's name.

Then guy B, who I can only assume has no fucking idea why guy A randomly started cursing him out and presumably spamming him, decides to escalate in the same fashion.

It was a nice surprise for me.

I learned that day, that if you start fucking with someone and they can't directly attribute it to you, they'll have a short list of people to blame.
