The easiest approach is to take a false belief they already have and exaggerate it, but only if such exaggeration can be made be useful to you. See [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nv3oLT3K4OQ][this]] for example. EY does this in HPMOR when Hermione's army pretends to be easily wiped out leaving Harry and Draco's armies to diminish each other's numbers before Hermione's army comes back and wipes them both out. Draco and Harry had the false belief that Hermione would be an inferior tactician, so she was able to plan around exaggerating that misconception and then exploiting the exaggeration.

Exaggerating misconceptions works well due to a variety of biases. Confirmation bias is one - the model you worked out or predictions you made seem to be even more on-point than you originally thought. Bandwagon effect is another when groups are involved, people don't want to run against the group consensus that X is true, so if you exaggerate X, they don't typically suggest that it's merely a ruse and X was actually wrong all along. Actor-observer bias also plays a role here since other people will be more likely to explain exaggerated X through your personality/characteristics than through external circumstances that could artificially encourage the appearance of X. The self-serving bias also plays a role when the trait you're exaggerating is a negative trait, like cowardliness, or ineptitude - the easy 'victory' must have been because of innate superiority!
