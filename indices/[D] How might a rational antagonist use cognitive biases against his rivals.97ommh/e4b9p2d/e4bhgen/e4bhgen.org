One example could be, in that situation, practice with your opponents and either subtly throw the matches or show behaviors you wouldn't normally (IE you intentionally bias one side of the court, if that's a thing in tennis- I don't play). Meanwhile, you practice with the better players who aren't your direct competition to actually improve.

Of course, this is one of those things that seems smart at first glance but looking deeper reveals it's not a great idea- so pretty much par for the course for plans in anime. If you get a reputation as being a poor player you may lose access to the resources you want since people won't see the point of spending them on you. Also you are betting a lot on being able to show false behaviors while covering up the actual weaknesses an opponent might be able to exploit in the real match, which wouldn't work on weaknesses you aren't aware of. This is the sort of plan you'd only want to do if you're already behind and want to cover up your progression.
