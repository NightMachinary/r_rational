Hmmm, I dunno, iiuc “availability heuristic” is usually used specifically to describe the related flaw in how people judge relative probability, and I very much doubt Person A ever stopped to think about /how likely/ the situation was to be B's fault.

Also, I notice that it would be just as easy in the counterfactual world to say “availability heuristic” was why Person A blamed the newcomer, on the grounds that we'd expect recent changes should be very available!

Is there a succinct phrase for “failing to check for third options”/“failing to check your assumptions”?
