It's a dangerous ploy, because any plan that depends on you successfully predicting your opponent usually runs afoul of [[https://needtobecomestronger.wordpress.com/2016/11/28/chapter-8/][Kakashi's second rule]]:

  “Then nothing,” Kakashi said as he leaped to the next roof. "It doesn't matter what level other people play at, because cleverness is still going to get you killed. Technically, the real second rule is that you should use the simplest possible strategy that can be made to work, so the worse the situation you're in the cleverer you're allowed to be. But you're not supposed to ever get in a situation like that in the first place, so it amounts to the same thing in practice.

As such, a rational antagonist should really only be trying something like this if he's in a desperate situation, or if failing doesn't cost him anything. In the second case, he could be on the lookout for any mistakes that the protagonist is /already/ making and then try to take advantage of that. If you really want to go crazy though, you can put your antagonist in an impossible situation that /requires/ him to completely play his opponent, like [[https://needtobecomestronger.wordpress.com/2017/05/06/chapter-15/][this scene in NTBS]]:

  “It's obvious if you take your beliefs seriously,” Haku said with just a touch of ice in his voice. He wasn't sure if his master was provoking him intentionally or if his remark really had been intended as a compliment, but he resolved not to let it get to him either way. “You've said many times that Leaf ninjas are too soft and that this makes them weak. However, if they really were weak they could never have won three shinobi world wars. So the correct conclusion is that they are hypocrites, motivated not to do good but by a desire to have others think of them as being good.”

  “Oh?” His master was looking at him with good humour. “What difference does that make?”

  Haku turned away from his crystal ice mirrors and gave Zabuza his full attention. “If we forced Hatake Kakashi to choose between his life and any number of civilians, he would simply turn away, since if he were truly that good a person he would be dead. But if the choice is between the certain death of a civilian he knows and a mere risk to his own life, then he will choose the latter in order to avoid having to think of himself as a bad person. To exploit this, all we need do is to confront him with variations of this same choice, over and over until finally the effect is the same as if he chose to sacrifice his life after all.”
