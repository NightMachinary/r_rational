A minor variation would be that even if an antagonist doesn't technically /need/ to do anything to win, they might also run some costless B-plots with higher potential profitability just on the chance that the A-plot doesn't work for some reason.

However, if they then try to deliberately sabotage the (simpler) A-plot in order to attempt to force the higher profit of one of the B-plots, they've fallen prey to one of their own biases. Probably something like the sunk-cost fallacy.
