Patreon spoiler as of chapter 118:

He hasn't so much as seen a blue, nor is there any reason to think that he'll find one in the next 2-3 chapters. They are in a lair but haven't actually run into anything to fight yet and at the pace Delve moves it's likely to be at least 2 chapters before they do. Also, the lair is level 11 or so, meaning unlikely to spawn a level 25 blue. Also also, if he does find one he's planning to capture it, drag it outside, and let the group decide what to do with it.

If you reply to this, please remember to use spoilers as appropriate.
