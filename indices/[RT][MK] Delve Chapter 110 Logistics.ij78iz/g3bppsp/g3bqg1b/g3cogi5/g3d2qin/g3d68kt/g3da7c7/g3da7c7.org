Especially when we already saw how scary the level 11? Razorspine was. Even an adventurer 7 levels higher and with some incredibly overpowered armor could barely do anything to it, and it took multiple adventurers to just barely take it down. Jesus Christ, how the hell are they gonna handle stronger blues?

Makes me feel like Carten is gonna be groomed for the purposes of tanking. He's already dual-wielding shields, you can't scream tank any louder than that set up, and he's an oddity in dual wielding shields, something I think nobody else does. Or is foolish enough to do. Also helps that he's quite a malleable and agreeable fellow.

With Carten the tank, Tallheart the smith(and mascot of The Tallheart Fanclub), Rain as the support, and Ameliah filling out any role necessary, along with Awakened of many other roles and merchants and potion makers, (and Dozer!) I'm pretty confident in their chances, they have the making of a great group and a potential to really do something great.

Now if the story would finally move along though, I don't know how many more dead weeks I can handle before they finally get to the good stuff. It's been 3,000 years...
