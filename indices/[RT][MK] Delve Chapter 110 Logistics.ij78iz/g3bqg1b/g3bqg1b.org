Nice to see the beginnings of The Tallheart Fanclub. Looks like it'll really have a lot of potential, with lots of people, and more importantly, lots of people each fulfilling different roles, and with Rain's Earth views and ideas(rpg party knowledge), I'm expecting a lot out of them. Perhaps we'll finally see some advancement and growth, Rain has literally been blueballed out of blues for so long.

Given how exponentially stronger Rain gets once he passes the level 25 threshold and gets the very important skills, I wonder if the plot will really start ramping up from here along with the group's strength. Delve is good, but I'm really just chomping at the bit for some real improvement.
