Violence would probably spike at first, but I imagine civilian groups would be created to revenge murder pretty fast. At that point given enough time the only major difference between this hypothetical society and our own would be the decentralized nature of this one aspect of law enforcement. (And the fact that murderers would always get the death penalty.) Also people just aren't terribly inclined to cold blooded murder in the first place and that's not just because of fear of societal punishment. I certainly don't think it would cause horror stories level of change.
