Depending on what exactly is going on, I imagine many murders would be prosecutable under other parts of the criminal code: assault and battery, harassment, terrorism, extortion, and others. Moreover, unless you somehow also got the legal system to acknowledge that murder (in addition to being legal) did not constitute 'harm' in any way, committing murders would leave you open to being sued and faced with civil penalties.

It would certainly disrupt a lot of the discussions around assisted suicide, since conspiring with somebody to have them murder you, or at least to hide all evidence of that conspiracy would be an available workaround.

The strategies surrounding legal defense of homicides would bifurcate and look really strange, since you could try to demonstrate that there's not enough evidence of the crime, but you could also try to meet some of the rather higher standards of proof for murder.

What would this do to society? Jeez, I don't even know. The actual execution of any effort to legalize actual murder (in the first degree?) while leaving other legal realities unchanged is complicated enough that it could look all kinds of different ways, depending on how exactly it's implemented and what the cultural response is like.

Assassinations would probably become more common, especially for groups that have the power to protect their operatives. They might also generally be less covert, since making it an obvious murder might in some ways make it harder to prosecute (though, again there are usually laws national and international against things like treason or undermining the sovereignty of recognized/allied powers).

Likewise, private security as an industry is likely to become more important, but it might also be hard to keep such groups from turning into professional hit squads.

Speaking of professional hit squads, many countries have laws against conspiracy to murder, or being an accomplice to a murder, incitement of violence, etc. Depending on how these are treated, professional hit squads may not actually be incentivized, or very carefully trained/organized to concentrate all the provable evidence of the murder on the person pulling the trigger. Still hard to avoid obstruction of justice/destruction of evidence charges that way, though. Like I said, waaaay too many details. Maybe you'd just get a lot of solo operators with legal protections around how they are contracted, both for security and assassination (maybe they'd actually be lawyers, nominally hired to help clients determine whether something is a murder or not, in addition to being enough of a physical threat to include "deterrence" in their services? This would make it possible to try to hide evidence of ancillary crimes under attorney-client privilege. Then again, there's already legal structures both for hiding stuff that way and getting at it, so those legal fights could get weird)

If you're imagining that the world cultures are actually receptive to this change (and how would it get enshrined in international law otherwise?), you'd probably see some people trying to rationalize this as morally correct. First argument that comes to mind is exalting the idea of honor and intentionality: anybody who takes a life should not do so carelessly, and so should demonstrate a "sufficient" degree of awareness of how to perform the act and all its attendant consequences in order to remain honorable, etc.

But realistically, this question still feels really underdetermined. A question of the form, "what happens to society if X?" wherein X only happens in a society that has to look very different from ours, just raises a lot of questions about which changes/differences/assumptions you want to include. Did an evil genie snap their fingers and now the world's legal codes are changed in some way that everybody accepts as legitimate for magical reasons? Or do each of the nations ratify their own (maybe slightly different) versions of the law over the course of a few years? Is there a tremendous global political movement in favor of this change? If so, where does the movement stand on issues related to murder? Or unrelated issues, for that matter? If there isn't a tremendous global movement, what political forces are trying to create these changes? Religious extremists of some kind? Corporations? Powerful alien sociologists with no scruples and a commitment to experimental methods? These all create very different results for our society.
