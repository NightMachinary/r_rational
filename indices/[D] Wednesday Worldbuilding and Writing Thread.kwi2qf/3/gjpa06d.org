Any suggestions for a magic system which realistically benefits strongly from a knowlage of physics/engineering/computing while also *not* improving knowlage-gain. (So an ideal rational Isekai magic system)

As an example, would be something like; you request something of the magic, and it tries to achieve this for you. HOW it does so needs to be computed by the system, which takes computing power (magic power) so the more specific you are the easier it is to cast.

But with something like that I can't see how realistically someone won't start casting diagnosis spells etc to pretty much do science and discover all the laws of physics in a day. Any ideas on similar systems which wouldn't have such an obvious loop-hole?
