All the member countries of the United Nations agree and ratify the following law:

Henceforth [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder][murder]] is fully legal and legal processes involve only the verification that it has indeed been murder and not another form of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide][homicide]]. Other forms of homicide have an unchanged legal status. Lets say the law stays at least for a few decades in place, globally.

I take the English Wikipedia articles as legal definition.

But if you don't want to check them out, see murder just as planned or cold-blooded killing of another human being. So e.g. accidental killing (manslaughter) doesn't count as murder.

How do societies change?

The thought just got into my head, because there a sometimes horror stories on different levels. And this would go into the direction of horror on a societal level - in my opinion.
