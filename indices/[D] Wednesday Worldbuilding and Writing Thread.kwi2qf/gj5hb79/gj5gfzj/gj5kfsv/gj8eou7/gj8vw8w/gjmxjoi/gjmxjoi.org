I generally agree. Your comment goes in the direction of my thoughts after I posted. Next time I will think beforehand. One thing though: I think the surveillance will increase massively. When politicians cry out for more surveillance after every terror act, then with murder made legal this will be far more intense. What also should be made legal for this concept to make more sense is the planning of murder and forcing murder as the general legal interpretation of all acts of planned or cold blooded killings. I don't want to write a lengthy text but I think the most dire consequences in the end - assuming the prior paragraph applies - is a surge of totalitarian surveillance states after a few decades.

I also don't think that 'making murder legal' is a interesting scenario as it is to unrealistic. Just popped up in my head and I was in the position to post it immediately. But I wanted to see what people make of it.
