You'd run into massive pollution issues before getting anywhere close to a utopian society. Using blood for fertilizer is going to drive the dissolved salt content and alkalinity of your soil up over time and do so in a way that is not normally found in nature. While it might be good fertilizer for the first few years, you're eventually going to start getting crop failures due to the fact that you're literally salting the earth with blood. No, blood fertilization isn't sustainable without regular periods of fallowing.

Moreover, there's about a liter of water for every gram of iron in human blood, meaning that even if you assume perfect efficiency, you're going to end up with a good sized barrel of dirty water every time you extract a single fork's worth of metal. Fat is even less efficient - blood lipids are measured in millimols, after all. While you can probably dodge most of the the fuel requirements there by using large evaporating pools to dehydrate the blood before using it, you're still going to end up rapidly humidifying the air and causing unseasonable storms, unnatural fogs and/or everything getting covered in mold.

Of course, the above assumes that you have some good way to prevent the giant standing pools of blood from fermenting in the sun. You'd need to periodically churn them at bare minimum, and probably add some sort of antibacterial chemical to keep it from turning into a giant vat of rotting blood. While you probably could feed said workers their own portions of blood meal out of the blood vat's yield, you're still devoting a good portion of your populace to mucking around in giant vats of blood, cleaning mold off of things and otherwise trying to manage the whole blood industry.

Overall, I expect the city's horrible reputation with the neighbors and said neighbors prejudices against a blood-based economy to look pretty justified from an in-universe POV. The whole city is going to stink of rotten blood and have awful weather, the food is going to taste terrible and their crops will keep having unfortunate failures. Plus, bratty little children literally run around squirting blood at one another for fun.
