I'm inclined to agree with you. As much as a utopian society with an industrial scale distilling facility is interesting, I don't think it is feasible to base every aspect of life around it, especially at the technology level I am setting this in.

Unless they are under siege or severe drought, they're not going to extract water, fat, or metal from blood, simply because the opportunity cost is so high. And blood fertilization would be used as a supplement to regular farming as opposed to the sole method (too much nitrogen in the soil is generally a bad thing).

I'm actually really trying to subvert expectations and make the blood city the good guys. Or at the least, undeserving of their reputation. That's why I thought of the horseshoe crab thing--a culture/religious belief based around the value of cleaning might help prevent the inevitable mold and disease vectors that would grow there. Of course, the smell is still a problem...

And lol, I've already written a scene with bratty little minion children running around, looking like they've just ganked someone with very high blood pressure. Maybe their horrible reputation is a little deserved.
