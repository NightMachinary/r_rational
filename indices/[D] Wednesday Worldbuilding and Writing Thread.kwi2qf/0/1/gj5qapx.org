Blood transfusions seem like a natural medical technique for them to develop, given they can produce fresh blood on demand. The main hurdle there would be figuring out the different blood types, but they might be able to get by if they can choose to create more of an individual's blood. That could help to reduce deaths from blood loss, and so perhaps a culture of duels and knife-fights would develop because of that reduced lethality.

Once blood transfusion is developed, a natural next step would be a kind of parabiosis, transfusing blood that is specifically young and healthy as well as being of the right type. The science of how well it works for humans is far from settled, but for the sake of the story it could increase longevity with all the attendant social effects that would bring.

Some animals have poisonous blood, so perhaps that could be used for warfare or murder?

With red, blue, green, yellow, and violet/purple blood available in animals and insects, I imagine these would be used as pigments for decorating if the colours can be made to last well enough. Perhaps these would become the national colours, too?
