Hm, I didn't realize that there were animals with poisonous blood, but apparently you are right. I googled it, and eels have blood that can kill if injected, but is safe when eaten or taken orally.

I'm half and half between using unusual coloured blood as pigments, or using it as part of the city's religion. The national colours thing is a good idea.
