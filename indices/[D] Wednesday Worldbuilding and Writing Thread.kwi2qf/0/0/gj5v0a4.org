Humans can suffer from iron overload, which could potentially be fatal. This city wouldn't be able to consume a diet of only blood, but they could consume quite a lot. For some reason I can't imagine, I couldn't find any studies about the maximum percentage of your caloric intake can be blood before it causes problems.

So they'd need some other food sources, but blood would be such a rich fertilizer that this shouldn't be a problem. Honestly, if every citizen has access to this ability (or if specific citizens can summon arbitrarily large amounts of blood), I don't know if there are any limits on the population size here. You would still need somewhere to grow real crops, but if every citizen had a windowsill or rooftop garden that might be enough.

I would bet that every inch of free vertical or horizontal surface of this city would be covered in crop plants. It would be able to exist totally independent of surrounding land that way, making them immune to siege. You couldn't poison their water supply because they could have massive distilling vats producing water out of summoned blood for free, using the rendered fat from the blood as fuel. They might be able to make some kind of biodegradable building material from blood and plant products as well, so they wouldn't even need quarries.

Almost nobody in the city would need to dedicate their lives to producing food. As a result, everyone would be able to become an expert in something. I would expect this city to exist in a neverending golden age, with every mind advancing science, technology, and art, for their entire lives. Once they get good enough, they could start extracting solid iron, copper, and other materials from the blood, so making weapons to defend themselves with isn't even a problem. They would probably discover explosives pretty quickly from working with organic materials constantly, and as such they could conquer surrounding areas. Assuming they even wanted to, given that they don't need anything from them.

This is basically just reality on creative mode.
