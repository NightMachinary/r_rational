  Humans can suffer from iron overload, which could potentially be fatal. This city wouldn't be able to consume a diet of only blood, but they could consume quite a lot. For some reason I can't imagine, I couldn't find any studies about the maximum percentage of your caloric intake can be blood before it causes problems.

Whole blood contains about 50-55 mg of iron per 100 mL. The tolerable upper daily intake level for iron is reported by the USDA to be 45 mg. There's about 125 calories per 100 mL of blood, and you'd be capped at about 80 mL, which works out to about 100 calories. Given a 2,000 calorie daily diet, blood products (blood sausages, blood soups, blood curd, etc.) could only provide about 5% of your regular caloric needs.
