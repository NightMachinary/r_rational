Hm, I wonder why you can't find any studies about the maximum percentage blood your caloric intake can be blood. That really needs to be remedied immediately.

And yeah, the blood being a buffer to famine and siege is a good idea, although I don't think things will be quite as straightforward as you say. I don't think blood is sustainable enough to create a never-ending golden age, although the city is a regional power. Too many waste products and unhygienic environments created from the distillation.

For food, I've been toying with the idea of plants that have evolved specifically to grow only in areas of high concentrations of blood, but I'm not really sure how feasible this is. On one hand, having unique crops is cool and I could have plants growing on every open surface in the city, but on the other, who is going to trade with the devil city for the devil crops?

For technology, I've also been thinking about using the energy from falling blood (summoned from high up) to power mills--but this might be a bad idea. Even if I have the river of blood flow far away into the desert or something, there might be too much gunk and disease.
