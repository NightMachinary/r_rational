I'd like some help imagining some possibilities to build around a city based around blood magic.

This particular form of blood magic is quite limited, and the residents of the city can only summon blood (any type of blood). They cannot manipulate it, or change it within a body. That being said, they are quite clever at using it and other areas in the region do not have access to this magic.

What might be some specific consequences of this ability, or interesting cultural aspects I can develop? So far, I've got:

• They eat the blood. The extra calories allows for a larger population

• Blood meal is used as fertilizer

• They summon blue blood for luck. It is considered fortuitous when it does not clot, and bad luck when it does (it's horseshoe crab blood--which clots in the presence of bacterial endotoxins). Because of this, the city is incredibly hygienic and have discovered the link between hand washing and disease before all their contemporaries

• This city has a horrible reputation with its neighbors, who think blood summoning is taboo and that the city's people are devil-worshippers who engage in dark magic

This is a low-technology setting, not overly dissimilar from ancient Greece.
