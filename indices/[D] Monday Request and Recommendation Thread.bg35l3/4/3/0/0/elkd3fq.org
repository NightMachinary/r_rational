  I'd argue that MC!Voldemort's seemingly insane approach to human interaction in this fiction actually makes a ton of rational sense given his background.

Even if it does, Rational fiction doesn't just mean that the main character's action make sense when taking their background into account. If it did I could write a fic of the Joker acting batshit crazy like the chaotic evil schmuck he is and call it a rational fiction.

This fic was as rational as an average japanese harem comedy.
