  It was mildly amusing. There was no rational aspect.

I mostly agree, but I'd argue that MC!Voldemort's seemingly insane approach to human interaction in this fiction actually makes a ton of rational sense given his background.

He was handed off to an orphanage, and raised in a world where magic isn't real. Then eventually some dude comes by and tells him "Hey actually magic /is/ real and also you're going to a magic school". He's then taken to a magic school, which is essentially an entirely different reality.

With *that* as your background, why would you assume that other things can't be real? Why spend time fighting people about some particular impossibility? Just accept that they believe it to be true, and act as if it were for the purposes of the current conversation.

If Lockhart claims to have defeated vampires in Albania while at the same time fighting wendigos in Australia, then what's more likely? He's lying, or he's somehow managed to cast a spell that allows him to duplicate his body? When magic is involved, it's genuinely impossible to know - so you're best off assuming the worst case.
