Symbiote fairly unpolished? You are being very generous. Thank you! I cringe when I read through relevant sections when it gets a comment (I still monitor it, checking for comments once or twice a month.)

Despite it's flaws, however, it is, by far, the most highly read of the original stories I have written. Even now, years after the last time it was updated, I still get 100+ hits a day pretty regularly.

I eventually plan on merging Bob and Frank into the Reject Hero universe to let them play with superheroes.

It won't be a Rob doing the insertion though, it will be B. Ah, the benefits of having a near-deity character that can reasonably be expected to help protagonists to do extraordinary things that would otherwise be completely outside their abilities.
