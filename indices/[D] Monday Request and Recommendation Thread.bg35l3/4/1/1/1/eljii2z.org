I don't tend to carefully isolate things I like/dislike about works I read/experience, but here's just a couple of things I recall from my read (up through the first few chapters of Book 4):

- I was quite impressed at the hard-sci-fi-ish quantitative details! I don't know how much general preferences vary on this, but I found that the detailed weights/dimensions/considerations were specified much more than I expected, but they were not generally too intrusive, and seemed more or less reasonable when I stopped to consider/imagine the details. That must have been a lot of work!
- The reason I stopped reading was that I found it very hard to stomach the setup of the virtual world; once we saw Bob entering it post-arrest, it sounded a whole lot like a big single-instance superhero MMO (with private sublocations, sure). That seemed to me to be a very strange turn of events, and while upon reflection there were a few places (especially later in the story) where it seemed very difficult to find Watsonian explanations for characters' actions, this particular surprise seemed very hard to justify even on a Doylist level.
