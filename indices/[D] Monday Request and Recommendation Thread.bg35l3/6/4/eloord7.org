I use RSS feeds for standalone sites and webcomics, and the alerts/subscription lists of other sites. This works very well for almost all of them. It means I have to check 5 different sites overall, but since they all show chronological order it's trivial to see which are new updates and which are old, and there's nothing forcing me to check every site at once.

The sole exception is AO3 which lacks native chronological ordering of subscription updates - for this, I use an [[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/extension-of-our-own/jpnkcocpogjbiihgcdionhcabgakcdgo][extension]], which does a pretty good job (but takes a little while to load.)
