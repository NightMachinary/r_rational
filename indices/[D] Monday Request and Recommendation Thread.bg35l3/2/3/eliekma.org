  Does anyone have any recommendations for Audible?

I really like the [[https://www.audible.com/series/Cradle-Audiobooks/B07GVRN95T][Cradle]] series and the [[https://www.audible.com/series/The-Travelers-Gate-Trilogy-Audiobooks/B00ZJ2XR18][Traveler's Gate]] series, both by Will Wight. I'd had Cradle recommended on this subreddit and really enjoyed it.

They're not Urban Fantasy like that Rivers of London series (which I quickly looked up), but the narrators for both are really good, especially Cradle. I'm rec'ing mostly because it's this sub, not because it's explicitly similar.

Though, [[https://www.audible.com/series/The-Dresden-Files-Audiobooks/B005NB2IG0][The Dresden Files]] seems more similar to Rivers of London, being both Mystery and Urban Fantasy. The audiobooks for that are supposed to be really good, and I really need to get around to reading/listening to the series.

Cradle is the only actually good Xianxia that I've read, and is really quite rational. The world makes sense, and all the characters try their best to solve their problems, and the main character often ends up solving things by being clever rather than raw power, since he's usually a lot weaker than everyone else. Definitely one of my favorite series now.

(Xianxia magic is generally improving your magical core to perform magic, often by using the magic of the world, while also improving your body. There's a ton of really bad awful tropes in the genre though, and every one is trash except for Cradle, which is amazing. I know, because I tried a bunch after reading Cradle, and they sucked.)

Traveler's Gate is also very good. It's much more Western in magical style. Not in the classical, DnD, do-anything Wizard, but like how various different Western magical fiction all have unique somewhat limited (in comparison to a do-everything wizard) magical systems. This trilogy is currently finished, though there will probably be future books at some point. This narrative arc is complete, anyway, and the series feels very well put-together.
