Looking through my audible library for things which are both good and were performed well:

The Traitor Baru Cormorant

Ann Leckie, the ancillary series. All of it. The Raven Tower is also good, but the ancillary series takes priority in spades.

Jo Walton: The Just City, and sequels.

Marie Brennan, the Lady Trent series.

Less weighty, but lots of fun:

Jacqueline Carey: Santa Olivia and sequel

Diana Rowland: White Trash Zombie
