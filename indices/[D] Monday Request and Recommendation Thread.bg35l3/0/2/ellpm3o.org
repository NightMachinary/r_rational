The world itself isn't /very/ rational, but personally I think cautious hero has a decent streak of rationality in it. The protagonist actually takes reasonable precautions given his situation, and the mistakes he does make are reasonable for someone who doesn't know the meta-knowledge of the genre/narrative he's now in.
