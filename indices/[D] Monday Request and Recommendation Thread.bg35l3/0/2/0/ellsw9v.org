It has a little bit, but it's clearly being played for laughs, and the hero is in some ways going to nonsensical extremes - attempting to buy 3 sets of armour (a spare and a spare for the spare) is an amusing gag, except they can't carry that.

Ultimately, I don't think it's going to last for very long, because the author will rapidly run out of ways to use the concept for jokes. It's not a bad manga, but taking the concept more seriously could have been pretty neat.
