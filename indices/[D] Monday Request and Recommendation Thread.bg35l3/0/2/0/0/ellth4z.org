Mad-Eye Moody is very hard to play very straight for very long, speaking as an author. Preparation competes for screen time with action; and readers will vary widely in what they think is good preparation, so it's impossible to satisfy them that you're depicting the character the way they think a Moody should be played; and the hindsight is very strong with them, so any loss or setback will automatically be blamed on you having not written Moody well.
