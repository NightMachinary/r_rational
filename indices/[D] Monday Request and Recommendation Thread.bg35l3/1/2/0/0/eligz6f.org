In terms of sexual scenes in Made in Abyss that made me uncomfortable just from my own memory there was:

1. Shoving a ruler up Reg's ass
2. Teacher threatening to tie up Riko naked.
3. Scene showing Riko naked tied up hanging from the air and struggling to get free. (Yikes)
4. Adult character inspecting Reg's penis against his will.

In terms of 7DS I wouldn't be surprised if there was a reason for it and it got better later, but yeah groping a distressed unconscious girl regardless of past relationship is fucked up and made me not feel particularly endeared to the protagonist.

Normally I don't think I'm very sensitive to this kind of stuff, but man something about the casual brushing aside of sexual assault in 7DS just made me deeply uncomfortable.
