Just finished the first season of [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/34599/Made_in_Abyss][Made in Abyss]] yesterday, and would overall give a strong recommendation, excepting some... peculiar choices by the makers. Nothing overtly sexual, and if you're used to anime weirdness it's not too bad, but enough that I'd hesitate to recommend it to a typical friend.

Overall quality of the animation and sound design is incredibly high, and the story quite interesting, basically following two children on a quest to reach the bottom of [[https://i.imgur.com/dXRwiPm.jpg][a large fantasy dungeon]], leaving me excited for a follow-up. It does get darker and move violent as the season progresses, but not as bad as I'd been led to expect. If you could handle a somewhat more gruesome version of the [[https://fma.fandom.com/wiki/Nina_Tucker][Nina Tucker]] storyline from Fullmetal Alchemist, as well as graphic depictions of e.g. bones breaking and people being stabbed, you'd probably be fine.
