A lot of manga readers seem to have their opinion influenced by events in later chapters I've only heard vague ominous references to, and many have the impression that the random child nudity/sexual jokes and the torture and suffering are two faces of the same coin, aka, that the author kinda gets off to drawing pedo snuff. Which, if true, is indeed rather disturbing.
