Huh. While I don't remember the ruler instance, for whatever reason, my mind just isn't making the connection between Riko being tied up naked and anything sexual. I mean, she's a kid---a tomboyish one with a rebellious streak who has never displayed any awareness of mature male-female relations. So considering that she can't be grounded because she has to work and assuming that they don't want to just beat or whip her since it would be cruel or may prevent her from working or she wouldn't learn her lesson that way, an /embarrassing/ punishment seems at least understandable, if not reasonable, to me.

If she were older and more mentally or physically developed, or if the males around her were not little boys with zero sexual awareness, it would /absolutely/ not be okay. But because of her young age, the absence of the kind of "girly" reaction that sexually objectified female anime characters typically show during wardrobe malfunctions, and the artwork style that presents her as androgynously prepubescent child (her body shape is exactly the same as the boys'), it just doesn't feel like something offensive to me. More like naked toddlers in a diaper commercial or little naked village children running around in historical dramas.

Now I'm wondering how much of my current mentality is just a result of desensitization and how much of it is an objective judgement. I'd like to say that I'm able to make a rational distinction between nudity and sexualization and that you're needlessly conflating the two, but it is indeed a fact that the squeezing scene in 7DS didn't bother me /quite/ as much as it probably should have... Something to keep in mind for me going forward I guess.
