Wow, that just seriously changed my view on the subject. When watching foreign media, I always take difference in cultural sensibilities into account and try to draw conclusions about those foreign sensibilities from the differences between them and western (or I guess more accurately, American) media.

When I was a kid and was watching Dragonball for the first time, I remember being surprised in one scene where child Goku was fully naked and they even drew a few curves to represent the genitalia since I'd never seen that in western cartoons before. But when it wasn't taken seriously within the context of the show, I must have come to the conclusion that "if the character is below a certain age or level of physical maturity, anime/Japanese people consider their bodies benign and not worthy of sexually-motivated censorship". This notion was reinforced for me when I saw a similar lack of censorship for children within Studio Ghibli movies (Princess Kaguya comes to mind as an example).

I don't think that conclusion is necessarily wrong either, but you're right that I did completely ignore the framing. Part of that is probably that I don't have enough knowledge about the particulars of visual media to even have a firm concept of "framing" within my mind (I'll only ever notice production or directorial techniques if they literally slap me in the face as being really cool or unusual), but I also probably put a bit too much confidence in the explanation I'd come up with without attempting to verify or disprove it. I was even aware that "lolicon" is a thing in Japan, but I never made the connection between it and the stuff that I'd seen. I guess I just assumed it was some deviant subculture I wasn't in contact with rather than something that subtly permeated even mainstream anime.

I guess it doesn't help that I don't really hold strong conservative morals to begin with and have some contempt for political correctness and censorship. I think the main issue though is that I tend to immerse myself in the worlds of the stories I'm reading/watching and accept the norms and moral standards of those worlds unless there's something that /seriously/ offends my sensibilities (but if something ever gets bad enough to do that, it's usually not /meant/ to be acceptable even in-universe).

For example, in a story I read recently, the MC and his love interest got married at 13-14 years old, but that didn't bother me at all. That said, I would /never/ support something that like happening in America today. Similarly, I'll often cheer for a villain being killed by the MC even though I don't at all accept vigilantism and revenge killing within modern society. I don't think that's all that unusual though. Hanging an orphan up naked for breaking the rules seems plausible and reasonable within the circumstances of that orphanage in Made in Abyss, even though I'd never consider punishing a child in that way in reality, so I never really gave it any more thought.

Anyway, thanks for the response. You gave me a new way of looking at things, but I'm afraid you may have damaged my ability to immerse myself in what I'm watching from now on, since I probably won't be able to help myself from noticing these kinds of production techniques in the future... Cheers
