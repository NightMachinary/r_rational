I guess I must be desensitized to it by now, because I can't even think of what you guys are talking about when it comes to sexual jokes in Made in Abyss. I think i remember the kids being naked at some point because their clothes got dirty or destroyed, but I seem to remember that being like when Goku was naked in early Dragonball or when there's naked toddlers in diaper commercials -- it's assumed to be perfectly nonsexual, so they don't even bother with the "coincidental censorship" thing using steam, hair, etc. Was there something specific you guys were talking about that I'm not remembering? I remember their relationship being rather wholesome...

Regarding 7DS, I agree that that the random /squeezing/ in EP 1 was a bit much, but the show is worth continuing IMO. You should give it another chance unless even the smallest bit of provocative content is an issue for you, since this show has markedly less sexual humor than many other popular shows. For the record, Elizabeth is the only character he ever does something like that to and it turns out there's an important reason for that related to their character histories, so it's not as if he's doing it to a stranger, even if it may seem that way at first. The question of "why only her?" actually becomes a piece of evidence that there's something the viewer doesn't know yet about the relationship between those two characters and is even asked out loud by other characters in the show. It also leads the viewer's thoughts towards an important question and reveal later on in the story.

That said, I'm not going to defend the presence of sexual harassment in the show too far. I'm sure they could have cut it out and replaced it with something else to serve the same purpose which would make the story easier to recommend to your average western viewer, but in the current shounen anime industry, it seems stuff like that is practically required just to keep up with the competition since "everyone's doing it". It's just the medium-specific instance of "sex sells". The particulars may be a bit more offensive to western sensibilities than our own versions of this maxim, but a mismatch of sensibilities is a fairly common cross-cultural phenomenon.
