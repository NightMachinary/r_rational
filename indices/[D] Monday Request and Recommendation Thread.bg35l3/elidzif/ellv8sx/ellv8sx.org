I've just gotten up to date with [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-bad-name-worm-oc-the-gamer.500626/#post-32256937][/A Bad Name/]] by Potato Nose.

The MC's power creeps really quick in the most recent bit of the fanfic. I think it could lead to some interesting encounters but still, I see rapid power creep as somewhat of a red flag.

With that hedge, I recommend it as an interesting, well-written Wormfic.
