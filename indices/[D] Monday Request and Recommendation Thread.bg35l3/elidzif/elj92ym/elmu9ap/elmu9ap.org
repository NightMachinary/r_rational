W00t, you tried my rec Tis Femina!

Ah yeah, sorry, should have explicitly specified - those were the abandoned Naruto fics that I had most regretted were never finished. Rationality was never a criterion by which I was judging them, merely my own enjoyment of the stories.

Glad you gave it a shot despite not liking it. Let me/us know if you read any of the others too
