I've finally tried out the game [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/596970/SUNLESS_SKIES/][Sunless Skies]] recommended months ago, and I second the recommendation. The gameplay isn't particularly engaging and I'm not attached to the story, but I'm still enjoying it for the great and abundant worldbuilding. And even though I hate magical realism with a burning passion, in certain contexts I really appreciate it when a story drops evocative, fantastical aspects about the world but doesn't try to explain them much.

As an example, a passenger on my aether engine just told me about how the queen defeated the tyrant suns and acquired a treasure trove of time, which she uses for her own immortality as well as to reward to her faithful supporters for loyal service. My passenger hopes to be able to afford a small quantity of time once she retires, to stretch out her days of leisure. Very cool, right?

If anyone has any similar recommendations for a game, I would appreciate it.
