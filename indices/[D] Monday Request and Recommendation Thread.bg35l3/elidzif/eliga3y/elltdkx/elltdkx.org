You're almost certainly aware of it, but the previous game Sunless Sea is at least as good. I haven't played Skies, but a review I read said that it felt like a letdown in terms of worldbuilding in comparison*, so if that's what drew you to Skies, Sea should hopefully blow you away.

It's also got a submarine expansion for free!

*Again, I haven't played Skies, so I can't confirm this claim.
