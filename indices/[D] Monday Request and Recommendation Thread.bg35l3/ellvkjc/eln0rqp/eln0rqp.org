Since I'm a pack-rat when it comes to data, I usually download them to Calibre with the plugin FanFicFare. This way, I can be sure that I won't forget that they exist as long as they are in my library. I also favorite/follow the stories by using my accounts on fanfiction.net, ao3, SV, and SB. For any webnovels on a website like WordPress, they almost always have an RSS feed to keep track of.

The stuff that I usually have trouble following are webcomics since I follow so many that I dislike cluttering my emails with so many RSS feeds, so I just keep a list to bookmark and check in manually every few weeks to see what has updated.
