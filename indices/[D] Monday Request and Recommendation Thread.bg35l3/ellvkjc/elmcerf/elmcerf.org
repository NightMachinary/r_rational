WTC + Birds of a Feather are on AO3 which mean you can make an account and Subscribe to them for email notifications. Same thing for Spacebattles (A Bad Name). There's Watch Thread options for email notifications only when the author posts.

I think PGTE requires RSS, but if you frequent this sub, you're not going to forget it exists. But if you really want to track the gamut, set up an RSS feed for the compatible sites and use something like [VisualPing](visualping.io) to detect webpage changes for obscure sites.
