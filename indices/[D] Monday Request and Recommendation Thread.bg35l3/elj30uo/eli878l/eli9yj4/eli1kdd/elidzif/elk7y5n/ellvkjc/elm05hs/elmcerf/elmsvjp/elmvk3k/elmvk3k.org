I'm pretty sure it's [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15996890/chapters/37322936][this fic]], a Harry Potter fanfic with a rational-ish Tom Riddle protagonist and Ravenclaw Hermione.

It has some similarities to Hermione Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation or Applied Cultural Anthropology, and to Tabloid in the Spacebattles Worm fandom.
