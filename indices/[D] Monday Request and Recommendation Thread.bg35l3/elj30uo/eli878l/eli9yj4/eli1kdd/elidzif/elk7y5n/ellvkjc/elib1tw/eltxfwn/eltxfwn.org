Today I read through a lot of the /I'm a spider, so what?!/ manga (there's also a light novel). And it's really fun! It's basically a story about a girl getting transported in an RPG world in the form of a low-level spider. From there on she munchkins her way up the food chain (and the levels of the dungeon she's in). A bit of cleverness, a lot of humour, and a scrappy protagonist you really want to root for. It's a very enjoyable ride.
