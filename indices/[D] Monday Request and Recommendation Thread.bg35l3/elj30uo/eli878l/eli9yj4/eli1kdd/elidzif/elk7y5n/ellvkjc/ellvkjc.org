How does everyone keep track of updates on the various fics they read?

Some stuff gets posted here, but other stuff I've enjoyed does not. For instance, I'm now up to fate with WTC, PGTE, A Bad Name, Birds of a Feather, and half a dozen other fics scattered across fanfic sites, blogs, and forums. I've no idea how to keep track of it all.

I'm worried I'm going to keep reading fics until I get up to date, then forgetting they exist because I'm not aware of the updates.
