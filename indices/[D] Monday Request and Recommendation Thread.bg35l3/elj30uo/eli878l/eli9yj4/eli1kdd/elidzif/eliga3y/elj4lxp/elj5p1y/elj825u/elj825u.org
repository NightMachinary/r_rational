Correct. I have rarely been able to find enough time to write in the last couple years due to being an OTR truck driver and working 70-80+ hours a week.

My typical writing style is to write in large blocks, anywhere from 8 to 20 hours at a time.

That is very, very hard to do in my current job. I live in a tractor trailer six weeks at a time, and my days off are pretty much jammed with non-driving things that I must do. There's also the patent.

Le Sigh.

It's even worse now than before, since I own the truck that I am driving. However, there are a couple potential changes in my life that I am working towards.

I have hammered out most of the issues in the patent application and will be continuing it 'in-part' soon, which will allow me to sidestep a lot of the worst pedantic non-issues that are being seized upon by the examiner (it's their job. Still annoying.) If I can get that patent, I suspect I can wrangle my way into rapid retirement with it, while still ensuring it actually gets exploited and not buried.

Failing that, I may also be able to start taking winters off once the truck is paid off. Winter roads are more dangerous, fuel is winterized and less efficient due to additives, and mileage rates drop in the last half of winter, so I won't be losing a great deal if my truck is paid off.

Stopping driving is not an option. I'm addicted to the road now. Even if I no longer drive commercially, I will have a RV or large cab truck and travel the country to see some of the incredible beauty from closer than the main roads.

I have also been listening to a LOT of audiobooks, and considering how they were written. From bad to good. I have recently finished a series where the author had a tendency to write very, very stilted, unrealistic, conversation. This is a problem I know I have had in the past, and one thing I need to address when I start writing again.

That said, I have definitely been working over my next story fairly extensively in my head. It's a return to the Reject Hero universe from the viewpoint of a powered individual with a body like a amalgam of Plastic Man and a clay Michelin man. His most powerful ability is his appetite. I fully intend it to be rational, but not rationalistic.

When I finally do get extended time to write, I fully expect to web-publish the rough story at a rather high rate of speed.

However, I cannot say when that will be.

I also need to find a medium to write in. Most forums are garbage to write in, and Google Docs is even worse. Wordpress made a lot of changes that I really do not like since I last wrote original works actively. There was a site called Jukeboz or something like that which looked interesting, but they shut down.

When it starts looking like I might have time to write regularly again, I will start seriously looking at somewhere to publish a blogfic.
