I believe the reason behind [[/u/Farmerbob1]]'s lack of notoriety is due to his recent inactivity in the realm of fiction. I've read that somewhere, you could find [[/u/Farmerbob1]] cruising the highways and byways of America in a truck.

I like to imagine that he is dictating the drafts of a great rational epic to his faithful dog, perfecting his work until he decides to hand his keys over and pick up the pen.

I think that /Set In Stone should/ be in way more people's top five rational fiction lists. His combination of modern scientific structure, anachronistic farm life, and lifelike character narration are priceless. Unlike many rational fics, this one has a happy and fulfilling ending.

It knows when to cut off the story, when another author would have bloated the work with an enjoyable but ultimately plot-irrelevant set of additional chapters following the building of the main character's farm. This isn't to say that this story is short on worldbuilding, or that I wouldn't love reading about the main character's continuing story. The author just did a great job of bringing the story to close and neatly closing the central conflict.
