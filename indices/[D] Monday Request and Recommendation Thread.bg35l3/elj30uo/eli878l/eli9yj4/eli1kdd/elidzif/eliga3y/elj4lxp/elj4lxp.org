I read most of /Symbiote/, which was fairly unpolished but quite interesting, and I like reading unpolished work for improving my ability to recognize otherwise-subtle devices. The author has other works and /Set in Stone/ is explicitly meant to be rational (links to both in [[/u/Dent7777]]'s comment above) so I'm curious why his works don't seem to be brought up much here. Perhaps he hasn't put up anything new in the past few years?
