I recently read (listened to) and enjoyed Dennis E. Taylor's Bobiverse series. Yes, the main characters' name is Bob.

It is a mostly-rational fic with a few aspects of rationalism as flavor. Bob basically dies, becomes a corpsesicle, and re-awakens in a dystopian future as the property of a morally reprehensible government. The world is going to hell due to the damage humanity has done to it. The world is abusing corpsicles to create electronic slaves for use in exploring the universe for potential colony sites. Bob is a good little brain-in-a-box until he isn't. Then things get interesting.
