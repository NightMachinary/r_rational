Eh, that's fair for the most part, but sorry that I couldn't recommend anything better in the genre...unless you are willing to try one more suggestion?

Have you tried [[https://www.wuxiaworld.co/Forty-Millenniums-of-Cultivation/][Forty Millenniums of Cultivation]]? I was hesitant to recommend it because it had such a generic start to set up the tropes of Xianxia to have them be subverted later in the story. I feel that it only really begins to shine around a few chapters before the end of Volume 1 which is roughly around chapter 95. Even then it's a slow change as the world-building gets more and more developed.

You can read about when it was recommended to this subreddit [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4zncxn/forty_millenniums_of_cultivation_%E4%BF%AE%E7%9C%9F%E5%9B%9B%E4%B8%87%E5%B9%B4_rt/][here]].

I also second the recommendation for [[https://www.wuxiaworld.co/Cultivation-Chat-Group/][Cultivation Chat Group]], but I mainly support it for the comedy, not how intelligently the characters act.
