I would second this criticism, and extend it from dialogue into the descriptions used. Not only is every thought and idea communicated explicitly and at length, it seems like every single action the main character takes is broken down and listed step. by. step.

Sometimes this is good, but after finishing a sequence describing a trip to a bathhouse and being treated to a lengthy paragraph on how /exactly/ the MC wrapped his towel and was careful to make sure his cameltote bag (which, by the way - boy did I misread that the first few times) was closed in exactly the right way...well. I think I'll take a breather.
