The premise of Symbiote is as follows:

The Alien Argeon crash landed in area 51, and was approached by the US government. In exchange for assistance repairing it's ship, the alien gave the US government some alien technology. The key technology is a sentient, symbiotic organism that pairs with a human, giving that human a set of powerful new abilities. Once the ship was repaired, the government attempted to prevent the alien from leaving, and shot it down upon takeoff.

Our story follows the protagonist Bob as he discovers that he has a symbiote named Frank. With the government in pursuit, Bob attempts to use his new ally and newfound abilities to protect himself and discover how deep the rabbit hole goes.

The story has great action, a fast moving plot, creative use of a unique powerset, fairly rapid power creep, and decent dialogue. However, I would hesitate to call the story anything more than rational-adjacent. I would say this is a nice light read, entertaining and passingly well written for a fanfic.

The premise of Set in Stone is clearly explained in the prologue located [[https://setinstonestory.wordpress.com/2015/10/08/backstory-revamped-into-prologue/][here]].

This story is extremely well written in my opinion, with the care and attention needed to craft a truly rational fiction. The farm-centric Stonepunk nature of this fic is extremely unique and well done. The main character and supporting cast are simultaneously simple country folk and complex, intelligent, multifaceted characters.

The main conflict in the fiction is logically coherent and yet comes off a little wooden at times. The conflict is part morality play, part rationalist experiment, a mainstay of rational fiction that remains an very difficult feature to fit into well written and well paced story.

While Symbiote is entertaining and worth a look, Set In Stone is a grand slam of a rational fiction. I think it deserves a place on the podium if I were to rank my favorite "rational" fictions.
