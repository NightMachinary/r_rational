I've tried all three stories you mentioned here.

White Collar Cultivator was definitely one of the better ones, but I got bored after a while. Kinda started to feel weird, since the main character had very little control over his own life. It didn't feel as story-like either, since it's a quest. I feel no desire to continue reading it, and I have no idea where I stopped (it didn't make much of an impact on me). Was interesting, but didn't feel very rational.

Sufficiently Advanced Magic was pretty good, but didn't feel like a Xianxia. Felt a lot more like Western Fantasy, and somewhat more like a gamer fic, in how it's [[/r/progressionfantasy][r/progressionfantasy]]. It's pretty good, and I do recommend for people to try it out if its synopsis sounds interesting to them. It's much better than a gamer fic though. I've already bought the sequel, but haven't read it yet. That said, it's not as good as Cradle and Traveler's Gate, in my opinion.

The Dao of Magic was absolute trash. I managed to read until chapter 25, I think, but I don't even know how I got that far. The best way to describe this fic is [[/r/iamverysmart][r/iamverysmart]]. The main character is awful and his intellectualism is more like a parody of one. It's a wankfest in how he can feel good about himself and being so amazing. The world itself feels dumb as hell and not rational at all. And around where I dropped it he started acting /even worse/, being /even less rational/. I fucking hate this fic and it was a waste of time reading what I did of it. A good premise though.

I Shall Seal the Heavens was decent (I finished the first section of it, I think). It's magic system is supposed to be somewhat decent, though it's not nearly as good as Cradle. My Disciple Died Yet Again started okay and just got worse. I read through the beginning of the third arc. I also tried skipping and reading arcs further along, and they were even worse.

What else? I'm currently following the Forge of Destiny rewrite on RoyalRoadl and it's okay enough to follow, but not that amazing. More down to earth than ISSTH. There was another fic in the ISSTH-verse that I tried and dropped. Savage Divinity on RoyalRoadl ended up kinda weird and I dropped it.

I know I tried other stuff too, but these are some that really spring to mind. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Cradle is far and beyond the rest; it's unbelievable.
