Personally, I found the sexual aspects much milder than the violence and bodily harm in that show; the infamous bone breaking scene was incredibly uncomfortable to watch, in a "I'm glad I saw this show but 'enjoy' is really the wrong word for this experience" Clockwork Orange sort of way.

I don't know if our culture is too accepting of extreme violence or too sensitive to sexual overtone, but it really does feel like there is an imbalance; nevertheless, both aspects would rule out showing this to normie friends for me.
