  But when it wasn't taken seriously within the context of the show, I must have come to the conclusion that "if the character is below a certain age or level of physical maturity, anime/Japanese people consider their bodies benign and not worthy of sexually-motivated censorship".

I think for early Dragonball that's absolutely the case. The loli/shotacon undertones usually only come with certain specific types of shows and certain specific target demographics. Dragonball was a WSJ series, so mainly targeted at male teens. Which is why you get so many boob shots for Bulma instead. /Those/ are definitely sexual, but of course they are, they're targeted at kids at the kind of age at which seeing a female nipple makes your day.

Now, if you watch something like /No Game No Life/, for all that I think it's a really fun anime... yeah, all the lewd shots of Shiro, the 11 year old genius gamer girl? Those are totally lolicon.
