  I watched the first episode of seven deadly sins on Netflix and multiple times the protagonist groped a female character as a "joke" and it made me so uncomfortable I had to stop watching.

SDS imho is a pretty bad offender because it's not just a joke, it's also really unfunny. I don't mind immoral things happening for the sake of comedy - which is in general the case with groping or sexual harassment jokes. But usually you still get the sense that the author /disagrees/ with those things. Even good ol' Muten Roshi from early Dragonball would usually get his just desserts for trying to cop a feel, he was more like the Wile E. Coyote of perversion than anything else. In SDS, Meliodas just keeps groping girls, and he's supposed to be a heroic protagonist. He's not even really ever called out for it, nor suffer any consequences. It's just "haha groping is funny because boobs".
