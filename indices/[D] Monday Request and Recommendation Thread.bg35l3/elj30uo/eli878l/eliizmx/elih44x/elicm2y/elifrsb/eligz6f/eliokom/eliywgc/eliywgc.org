I think part of the disconnect for you is because none of the characters in universe consider it sexual, you don't realize that the audience is fully supposed to view it as such. One of the main... appeals(/barf/) of lolicon is that the childlike characters are too innocent and naive to know certain actions or behaviors can be sexual. Framing can tell the audience how they're supposed to react to a scene independently from the way characters are reacting in that scene, and made in abyss lingers on scenes of nude children /waaaay/ too long for it to not be a bit questionable of the author's intentions.

Also, I don't remember how explicit is was in the anime, but in the manga, the strung up naked scene is /absolutely/ supposed to be viewed as sexual by the audience.

Wow I even forgot one of the characters told her 'you can't become a bride anymore' and 'you don't even have pubic hair! I'm not interested in you' until I looked this up again. I couldn't read ahead in the manga after the anime finished because I didn't want to read something with shit like this in it. And it /is/ worse and more apparent in the manga, but they didn't end up removing everything in the anime.

And don't get me wrong, I think Made in Abyss has a great story. You just have to divorce the story and characters from some of the unfortunate framing. But the the shota and loli stuff detracts from it way too much for me to ever recommend it to someone who wasn't a lolicon themselves or desensitized to light lolicon by other anime.
