Made In Abyss is a show I love very much, beautiful world, amazing music, but the random overly sexual attempts at "jokes" make it hard to recommend to anyone who is not into anime. So many Japanese shows have this problem and it bothers me a lot. I watched the first episode of seven deadly sins on Netflix and multiple times the protagonist groped a female character as a "joke" and it made me so uncomfortable I had to stop watching.
