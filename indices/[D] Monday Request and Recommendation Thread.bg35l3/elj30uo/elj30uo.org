Some manga:

- [[https://manganelo.com/chapter/actage/chapter_1][Act-Age]] - A girl tries out acting. She does a bit too well. Good story, great art, zero sexual anything so far.
- [[https://mangakakalot.com/chapter/dz918039/chapter_1][The Hero is Overpowered but Overly Cautious]] - A goddess isekaies a dude to defeat a demon lord. He only engages when he becomes able to apply massive overkill. Great art, isn't particularly rational like the description may suggest, doesn't take itself seriously.
- [[https://mangakakalot.com/chapter/xy918167/chapter_1][That Girl Is Not Just Cute]] - Wholesome teenage romance with no apparent overarching plot. Seems that the author just wanted to draw some dramatic face shots. The art is great too, so it works out well so far.
