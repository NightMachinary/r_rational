True, I'd like to think that the author is setting up for a joke with the third time he tries something like that (first being the armor, then the holy water) with the punchline being he was planning on using Rista's gate ability like an RPG's infinite inventory, which is why he doesn't see a problem with buying in bulk.

As for how long it'll last, I guess we'll see! I'm cautiously optimistic (lol) it'll figure something out, considering people were commenting it'd run out of material to joke about since chapter two, and it's still going strong.
