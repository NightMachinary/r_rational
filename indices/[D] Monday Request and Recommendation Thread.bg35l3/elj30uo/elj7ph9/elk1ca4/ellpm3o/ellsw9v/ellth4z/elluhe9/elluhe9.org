That's fair. One approach would be to just not explain the preparations ahead of time, letting the reader guess what they will be - or wait and see.

Alternatively, forcing the Moody into situations where they /have/ to compromise/gamble, either due to lack of resources or information, or time. Then the Moody's failures aren't due to insufficient paranoia, but just... guessing wrong.
