That Girl Is Just Not Cute is 100% fluff, with absolutely no substance whatsoever. Which is fine, and your description is accurate, but I really feel it needs to be emphasised that the only thing this has going for it is seeing vague fluffy art interspersed with dramatic face shots - there is absolutely nothing else to the manga.
