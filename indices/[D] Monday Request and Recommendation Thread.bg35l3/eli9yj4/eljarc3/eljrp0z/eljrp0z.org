The Bobiverse books are pretty good as long as you're not taking the sci-fi too seriously, because some of the things that are treated as "whoa" moments in the novels basically table stakes in other hard sci-fi.

The other thing to keep in mind about Bobiverse is that Bob's not that smart, and he never really puts a lot of effort in to getting smarter. Sure, he's able to jack up his personal frame rate and spend longer periods of time thinking, but he never improves himself so that he can think better.

This may be an intentional choice by the author, because the versions of Bob that /do/ improve themselves in order to think better tend to stop being point of view characters and become Q-like "here's a new gadget for you have fun" supporting characters real quick.
