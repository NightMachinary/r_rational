Just binged set in stone after the top level recommendation. While I enjoyed it, I would not give it nearly the full throated endorsement you just did. The world building is amazing and the conflict and actions are indeed excellent examples of rational story writing with people who have well defined goals and pursue them in ways that make sense. But the dialogue. My God the dialogue. The author seemingly does not understand the idea of subtext. Everything, and I mean everything, is explicitly spelled out for the reader. There is zero trust that we can figure things out from context. It's written like it's for an alien that doesn't quite understand how human social dynamics work but is trying really hard to learn. And the fact of that matter is that VERY little happens. The entire plot of this story would be handled in the first 50 pages of some novels. Given how awesome the world was, the fact that so little happened felt like kind of a waste, like the author came up with s great universe and then couldn't figure out quite what to do with it.

Like I said, I enjoyed it and I would recommend it to fans of rational fiction, but it definitely has some glaring flaws.

And having been the one that recommended symbiote a few weeks ago, I have to say that these flaws seem to be a hallmark of his works. His world building and creativity are amazing, and his ability to write characters with clear goals who work towards them sensibly is great. But he needs to start work-shopping his dialogue or something. It's an unfortunate weak point in otherwise excellent examples of rational fiction.
