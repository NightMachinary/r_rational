I've finished [[https://farmerbob1.wordpress.com/2013/11/13/chapter-1-a-meeting-of-the-minds/][Symbiote]] and [[https://setinstonestory.wordpress.com/2015/10/08/backstory-revamped-into-prologue/][Set In Stone]] since the most recent recommendation thread. What a set of fictions!

I definitely enjoyed Set In Stone more than Symbiote, but both were quite good. Set In Stone just has such a unique flavor to it, something I haven't seen before.

Does anyone have any recommendations for Audible? I just finished the Rivers of London series (or rather I am up to date on the series) and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
