All right, hear me out.

The Dead King's first major act upon meeting Cat was to pull her aside and give her a tutorial in social interaction between immortals. Though it is possible that he was lying through his teeth, I find it highly unlikely due to the fact that he should know Cat doesn't have much of an ego to stroke. Lying to her about her special status has no value to him, so he has no reason to do so.

Second, we know Malicia has been to Keter. It is possible that the whole meeting where Cat proposed her terms was a sham, but again, the Dead King has no reason to turn Cat so completely sour on him so quickly. He knows that his continued unlife depends upon not creating stories that inevitably end in his destruction, and "Ancient lich makes the classic blunder of backstabbing a Callowan" is a pretty ironclad story.

Third, we know that long-distance scrying requires the placement and upkeep of amplifiers at set distances. However, it took weeks for Catherine to get to Keter through Arcadia, so it is not unreasonable to think that getting there from Ater would take many months. With an amplifier chain that long, maintaining it in secret would be difficult even if it didn't require mages to be placed in miles of barren, blasted desert for multiple years. In addition, this network is likely not perfectly secure, and it's probably not possible to maintain an open, secure scry over the entire distance without at least some of the mages along the way realizing what was being spoken, or at least who was being spoken to. There's only one person in that desert worth talking to, after all.

In conclusion, doing active negotiations through long-distance scrying is a massive security risk that is 100% gauranteed to bite Malicia in the ass for Story reasons. This means that, in order for Malicia to be making offers in real time, she must be in Keter right now.

I think Neshamah gave Cat that little speech about how backstabs are passing nuisances among immortals to manipulate her into killing Malicia "right under his own nose," as it were. Obviously, one guest killing another cannot be tolerated, and Cat and her retinue would need to make an immediate dash for the exit, presumably under pursuit by All the Legions of Hell, but that doesn't mean the Dead King would be obligated to actually pursue them beyond his walls. He could make a show of force and believably pull his punches during the chase scene, with multiple close calls for all of the Woe on the way. Once they climbed the walls and jumped into the abyss below, only for Cat to open a door into Arcadia just before they smashed on the rocks below and just after Masego confirmed that he had a means to safely arrest their momentum on the other side, the Armies of the Dead would cease pursuit entirely. The next time Cat came to treat with him, the Dead King could welcome her with open arms, the minor betrayal understood as a passing annoyance with a mortal interloper.
