Fuck man, Diabolist is the best. Cat becomes the Antichrist and all Akua says is "Well done!".

A lot of people point out Cat doesn't /have/ to become the Dread Empress even if she kills Malicia but I'm not so sure. It's certainly true for Heroes but that bridge has been crossed a long time ago. As a Villain, I think there's a certain narrative weight to killing the current Tyrant with your own hands that means you can't just wash your hands off of the entire affair.

If she had a choice, I suspect she'd place Black on the throne but again, I'm not sure that's how it works. He's in the middle of enemy territory, he'd have nothing to do with overthrowing the current regime and hes showed no ambition for the Tower.

Interesting tidbit: Cat was given the room that once belonged to Triumphant /even when Malicia was Dead King's guest./ Looks like he knew what was going to happen from the very beginning - or at least showed Black Queen more respect than the Dread Empress.
