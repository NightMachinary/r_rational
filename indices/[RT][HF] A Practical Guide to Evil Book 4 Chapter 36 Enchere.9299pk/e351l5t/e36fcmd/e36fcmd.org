Even if an enemy country has done something that warrants a bombing, it is still a mistake to escalate straight to /nukes/. That's the issue here. The Crusader churches went straight for the theological-political equivalent of nukes.

Callow was mostly behind Cat. She was very popular with the lower and middle classes but unpopular with the nobility and church. The truebloods were purged by Thief so while the nobles aren't for her they are no longer against her. Now the church is being driven to support her.

The thing about Callow is that they will side with a Callowan they hate over a foreigner they love every time.

  “It's a feudal disaster is what it is,” Thief said. “It means that any oaths sworn to her are dissolved by holy writ and that /any who follow her are ‘estranged from the light of the Heavens/'.”

This declaration essentially excommunicates everyone who doesn't immediately turn on her. Everyone from Brandon Talbot to the high priest to a scullery maid to the random carpentry contractor who does one job replacing one door at the palace are now both damned to hell and a valid target for the Crusading army, according to the Crusader Churches.

And this is /Callow/. The "fuck your outside interference" nation.

They have essentially declared war on both the people and priesthood of Callow. The response is inevitably going to be "fuck you then it's war."

They can argue the Callowan priesthood collaborated with a villain and there might be /some/ merit to the argument but you will notice there was no mention of the Callowan priesthood losing access to miracles and priestly power or a bolt of lightning hitting the House of Light.

Laure's House of Light may have flirted with crossing a line /but they are still in good with the gods above/. For a Proceran church to declare them heretics while the gods haven't and a Proceran army is invading them? It /screams/ of warping religion to serve political aims, and naturally that is what Callow's priesthood is accusing them of.

Essentially, for many this strips away the divine backing of the Crusades and reduces it to a sectarian conflict. /This/ political group is backed by /this/ sect following the Gods Above and /that/ political group is backed by /that/ religious sect following the Gods Above. The story has been tipped away from "Divine Crusade to free the people of Callow from the dreaded tyranny of the Black Queen" and much closer to "Proceran expansionism using religion to get other nations to help with the dirty work."
