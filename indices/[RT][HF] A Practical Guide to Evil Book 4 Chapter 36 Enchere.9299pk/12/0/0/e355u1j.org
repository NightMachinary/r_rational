  Because they effectively declared the priests in Laure heretics. Who are the people going to believe? Some foreigners or their own priests?

I mean, but it's common knowledge that the House of Light in Laure endorsed Catherine, who is a Villain. That's pretty clearly heresy, no? And although in the real world this would be unresolved bickering between different churches, in the Guideverse the Gods Above exist and interact with Creation. Their stance seems clear on which side is Good, and it isn't the one run by a Villain. If they didn't support the Crusade, then the heroes wouldn't have flocked to it, and if the Gods Above don't agree with the heresy declaration, I imagine any heroes trying to fight Callowans would lose their power.

I originally used the Catholic church versus the Church of England as an example, but I guess worship of the Gods Above isn't analogous to Catholicism. Seems more similar to Protestantism, where even though all worshipers pray to the same God, there are huge differences between the actual practices and beliefs depending on sect, language, and location. This is less like the pope condemning a branch of the same religion, and more like several different sects collectively condemning another. Baptists wouldn't care if the Lutherans, Methodists, and Calvinists called them heretics, for example. Looking at it that way, you're right, it makes a lot of sense.
