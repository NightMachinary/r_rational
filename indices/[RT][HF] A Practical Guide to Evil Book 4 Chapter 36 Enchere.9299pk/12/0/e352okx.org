  why does Catherine being declared Arch-heretic of the East strike the group as a serious mistake on Procer's part?
#+end_quote

Because they effectively declared the priests in Laure heretics. Who are the people going to believe? Some foreigners or their own priests? Callowans is all about keeping their grudges, and add the retaliation from Laure's house of light, means that the people will unite behind Cat rather than oppose her. So any possibility of popular uprising against her just died.
