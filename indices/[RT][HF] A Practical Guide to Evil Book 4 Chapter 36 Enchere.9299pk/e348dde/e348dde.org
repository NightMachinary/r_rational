That excommunication fiasco is going to be a shitshow. Besides wrecking Cat's plan for peace and the Pilgrim's redemption trap, it's going to blow up any chances of Callow ever turning back to Good. Like, they slammed that door so hard that everyone thought it was a gunshot. Callowans aren't going to forget about that time when they were a Good nation under Evil domination and other Good nations not only did nothing to help them but also shot them in the back for trying to break free on their own.

That Hasenbach is losing control of the crusade also means that things are going to get really ugly really fast. For all its flaws, Procer is a human foe. The princes didn't sign for holy war and genocide, but the angels aren't going to care. Neither will Malicia or the Dead King, once angels hit the ground, demons will follow.

the Dead King said. I thought "they" referred to Good but apparently Malicia is on board too and so might be anyone else. Let's see just what kind of devil they fear.
