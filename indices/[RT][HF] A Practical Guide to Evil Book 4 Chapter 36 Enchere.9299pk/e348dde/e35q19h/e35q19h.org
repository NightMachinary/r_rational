Actually the really interesting thing is that it opened up a door for a very different redemption arc. Procer has gone a bit off the rails and seems to have lost sight of the fact that Good and Evil aren't supposed to be arbitrary team names, but actual philosophies. With the House of Light in Callow denouncing the heroes and the Crusade as false there's now an opening Cat could theoretically exploit.

Squire, Archer, and Thief, are all neutral names that don't have to be villains. Hierophant, and Adjutant are new so shouldn't have any historical weight pushing them towards villainy. Dioblist is a defeated foe bound to servitude in death. Soverign of Moonless Night is fey and therefore outside the whole good/evil thing. Cat didn't actually become Black Queen (in spite of everyone calling her that) thanks to the Black Knight breaking the super-weapon and the name not settling in.

Cat's curent plan involves killing the Dread Empress so she won't get in the way of throwing the Dead King under the oncoming Crusade both for the goal of liberating/protect a Good Kingdom from tyranny.

This could be spun into the story of How Procer got cleansed of it's Evil via copious amounts of stabbing.
