Villain immortality works much like the One Ring really. Villainy does grant what is basically immortality from mundane life and even from most warfare, just as the ring grants invisibility. But just as those "invisible" make themselves easy prey for the Nazgul, villains all but guarantee they will die in a Story significant way. For all that Amadeus treads that line skillfully, he is unique in his ability to do so and even then at times has held on by a hair's breadth.

That's the entire reason The Dead King goes for the undead version of immortality. Its a lesser experience, as Cat can attest, but it leaves him much less beholden to the trope based traps that the Bard specializes and excels in, and allows him to be on a much more even playing field with Good's immortal monster.
