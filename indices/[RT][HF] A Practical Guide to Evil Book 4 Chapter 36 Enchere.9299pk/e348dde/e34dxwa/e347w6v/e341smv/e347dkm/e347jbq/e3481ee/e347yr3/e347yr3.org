There are taking the information given to them a bit too easily, yes. Mostly the part about Callow, actually. The Dead King has no reason to lie about his reasons for making massive and unacceptable changes to the treaty proposal. And even if he does lie, the fact remains that he made those unacceptable changes.

As for climbing the Tower, Cat said nothing of the sort. She just said she wants to kill Malicia, which doesn't modify the old plan of bringing the Tower down, crushing Praesi nobility under the rocks and burning the ruins just to be sure. Of course, that plan is likely to go haywire and lead to climbing the tower anyway, especially with Akua as advisor.
