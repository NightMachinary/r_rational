I feel like I'm missing something... why does Catherine being declared Arch-heretic of the East strike the group as a serious mistake on Procer's part? I mean, I understand why they come to the conclusion that it's a sign she's losing control of the crusade, but if she actually had been responsible for this, why would it be bad for Hasenbach? Diplomacy has already failed - Callow was already going to be invaded again. She only keeps her Proceran princes on board if they have a chance to snatch up land, so that was a foregone conclusion anyway, wasn't it? All this means is that the next invasion will also need to kill some heretical priests as well as the Army of Callow.

And honestly I'm a bit surprised that the reaction of most of the Callowan Houses of Light was to back Laure's stance. The country is already split over Catherine's reign, so I feel like a significant portion of both the priesthood and regular religious folks would have turned on Laure. It's like if the Catholic church declared that the King of England was a heretic, and so was the archbishop who crowned him. Sure, a lot of people who are invested in them continuing to rule would stick with them, but plenty would go "Hey, yeah, these guys are actually heretics... no way we're going to keep following them." After all, the priesthood DID crown and endorse a Villain, so it's not like the charge of heresy is incorrect. I'd have expected civil war to break out at the proclamation, rather than just a couple small riots in a city or two. I guess this means that even the religious citizenry are Callowan first, and faithful to the Gods Above second?

Anyway, I guess this helps explain what The Dead King meant last chapter when he said:

  â€œA shame that her understanding of what a crusade is was so lacking, but it is too late to leave the saddle once the lion is ridden."
#+end_quote

Sounds to me like a Crusade is something that ends only when one side or the other is wiped out. And the "sides" are strictly defined by Good and Evil, not by countries. So even if Callow is beaten, even if Praes is beaten, the Crusade will continue and invade Serenity after. And if they actually beat The Dead King, they'd then attack the Chain of Hunger or the drow after. It doesn't stop so long as there's any Evil, unless the leaders of the Crusade want to face the consequence of disobeying the Gods Above (which is a surefire death sentence). Does that sound correct?
