Money and man hours can help spy on and influence regular old people like military generals or politicians, but three of the churches in the continent? At the highest levels of which, the Gods Above probably have agents? It's just hard to believe that the enemy of the crusaders would have influence at such high levels of not one, but all three churches, especially when it's right under the noses of the Gods Above.

I know Malicia's good at subterfuge but this is just straight up OPness if it's her, and as such, I think this is just a misguided attempt at cornering Cat by the Gods Above, which coincidentally helps with Malicia's Dead King play.
