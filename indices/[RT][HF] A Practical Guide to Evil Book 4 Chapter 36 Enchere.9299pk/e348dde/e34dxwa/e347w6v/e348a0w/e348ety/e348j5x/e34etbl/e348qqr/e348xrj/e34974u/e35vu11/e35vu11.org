I don't disagree, but Malicia being OP in the context of manipulation is her entire deal. It is what she and this iteration of her role are for. This is the woman who went from barmaid to Empress. A woman who has suppressed and outfoxed the schemes and assassination attempts of Praes for decades, when Black indicated they all but have a heavenly warrant to eventually succeed. A woman who treats tricking the fae as a trifle and who at minimum indirectly caused the end of the Summer/Moon hostility. Remember, before the crusade Hasenbach's reputation was built solely on the fact that she was able to match Malicia in this sphere.
