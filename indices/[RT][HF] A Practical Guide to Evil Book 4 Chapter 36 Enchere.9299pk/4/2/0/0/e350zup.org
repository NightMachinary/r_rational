The dude made an unliving of doing as straight as possible to avoid getting into revenge stories that would end with him dead. You think he would fuck over the one person he acknowledges as the next big thing, just because he's Evil?

If the Dead King wanted to alter the terms, he would just do exactly that, say he did it because he wanted to and there's nothing Cat could do about it. He has no reason to make up a bullshit cover story for his actions. In fact, he has every reasons not to.
