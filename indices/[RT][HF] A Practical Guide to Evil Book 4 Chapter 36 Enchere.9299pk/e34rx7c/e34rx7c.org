I'm confused by the House of Light's reaction in Laure. Doesn't labelling the invasion-supporting heroes as villains kinda lose its punch seeing as how they've crowned a villain as Queen of Callow?

I mean, yeah, theologically they probably shouldn't have done that and Procer/Levant/Ashur are probably right to call them at least a tiny bit heretical for sanctioning Cat's rule.

So, is the position of the HoL in Laure is that villains are bad and the people should be incensed against them, but it's kinda okay to be ruled by one if you don't have much of a choice, and it's really everyone /else/ who are the heretics for not understanding that distinction? Or just that Cat's not really a villain and it's totally fine that she's Queen and everyone else are just being dicks?
