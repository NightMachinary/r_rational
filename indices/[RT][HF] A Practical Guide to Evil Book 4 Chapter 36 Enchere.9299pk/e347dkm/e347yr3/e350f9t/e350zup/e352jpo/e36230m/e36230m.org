But if he does so through lies, he makes it all but inevitable that someone finds out and comes to murder him. Such an attempt is all but gauranteed to succeed due to the narrative weight behind the "ancient lich makes a fatal mistake and perishes" story. Neshamah is just like the Black Knight in that he knows the power of narrative, and therefore knows that he absolutely must nip every narrative that ends in his destruction in the bud as quickly as possible. If he starts a story about betrayal, though, he can't possibly hope to stop it himself.

And besides, he acknowledged Cat as an equal. If he knows anything about her, he should know that she doesn't really have an ego to stroke, so lying to her about her being an immortal has no value to him. He, of course, immediately gave the speech about how backstabs among their kind are just minor inconveniences rather than eternal bonds of hatred, but that also makes perfect sense. If immortals didn't work that way, they would never be able to make alliance under any circumstances.
