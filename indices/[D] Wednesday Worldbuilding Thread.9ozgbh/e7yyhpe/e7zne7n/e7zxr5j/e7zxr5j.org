I understand it, I actually enjoy those stories. When I say bad I don't mean it is horrible and shitty or anything.

It's just a shortening of everything you said in your comment. I didn't want to go on a large 2 paragraphs tangent just to make it more palatable.

My point was I like the setting, and a lot of stories from that setting, and I'd like to read a more developed and well thought out story in this setting.
