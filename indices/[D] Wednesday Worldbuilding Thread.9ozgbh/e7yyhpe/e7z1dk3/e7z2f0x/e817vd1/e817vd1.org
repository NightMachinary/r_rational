True, I forgot about that. (Though, not all Xianxia is like that. Sometimes you've got linear cultivation to miraculous heights, but no Rare Candies made out of the souls of your enemies to eat.)

With that in mind, it's true---the "progression system" of /Cradle/ was carefully balanced so that the characters have now---at the point when they're just strong enough to be able to protect themselves from most random threats---also become strong enough that acquiring more strength requires venturing out into the world vacuuming it all up, rather than staying at home. They've become rather large Qi Katamaris.

However, in /Cradle/, my outlined strategy totally could have worked to help the characters through everything /up until/ ~Highgold. In essence, it's what a more functional version of Sacred Valley would be. (Heck, maybe it's what Sacred Valley originally /was/, and successive generations just forgot.)
