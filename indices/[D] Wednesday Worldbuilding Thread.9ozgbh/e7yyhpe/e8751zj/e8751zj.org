I think Savage Divinity is somewhat a rational-friendly cultivation story.

Not sure if it is what you are looking for.

I'm still not sure if the MC has special abilities or just found a way to get strong/techniques everyone could copy. (and some may have used before MC discovered them independently)

I think most english Xianxia stories/translations could be more enjoyable FOR ME (and maybe the average/normal western person) if they used more western concepts/idoms.

for example use respect instead of face. Bad: Give me face! Good: Show me some respect.

The Xianxia/Wuxa concepts (weak MC getting OP, Respect, revenge, honour, might makes right, people in power are corrupt) could also work well in a classic fantasy setting, but I think you would like to keep the martial warrior setting

You could start with a village that get's destroyed because they can't pay some noble/strong immortal taxes (or the immortal needs to kill for cultivation)

(also cultivation is a bad word to understand for westerners)

The village kids/teenagers are spared (cause the immortal want next time taxes/victims)

Our MC leaves to get strong. Goes to monastery/sect/whatever and starts as disciple. Questions older about abilities and leaves cause not even elders could beat immortal.

goes to a few other sects and learns their beginner techniques.

And cause he learns them and understands how they work/what they do our MC can use them creatively. (Also he saw what basic techniques can do if a real master uses them, when immortal killed the village protectors. Since he learned the same techniques through different ideology lenses, he sees those techniques are not phoenix breath/dragon lungs...)

So while he travels he trains his basic techniques. Maybe he finds some friendly people (merchants/ entertainer) that he can travel with for an arc.

Maybe in the next arc, he mets other kids from his ex village (childhood friends or a cat girl or both or both in one) who got enslaved/killed/crippled. so we learn our MC just got lucky.

Next arc, helping getting friend a new arm/fulfilling last request

Then he gets involved into a war between two sects (really because resources, but the excuse is respect/honour/...) There we learn/get told disciples normally learn techniques until they can show their masters they have rudimentary skills in it and then start learning the next technique.

After that attack on immortal and defeat because immortal used some advanced techniques. rest of arc how he lost hope until he realizes the advanced technique is something he could do with his basic techniques.

(Something like in the rational Naruto fanfic where the black sphere genjutsu(?) is nothing other than the disguise ninjutsu,)

Well, if this was a show, the final arc would be a movie. Immortal get's beaten. We leave our MC, when a village elder makes excuses for not giving him the promised money/resources/helpp (for killing the immortal)

So enough time wasted with that. Probably not what you wanted -_-

tl;dr:

- use words and concept your audience understands

- make the MC do something different than everyone else and explain why no one else does it that way (maybe MCs only way to do it and the start is too hard normally)

- show how the rational thing to do is to behave like most people in that world (if that doesn't work, you should rethink your setting)
