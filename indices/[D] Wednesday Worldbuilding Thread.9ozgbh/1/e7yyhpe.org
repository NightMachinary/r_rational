Any of you ever read Tales of Demons and Gods? Or other similar setting stories? The setting is called Xianxia..

​

How would you go about making a rational story in such a setting without going for the routes we normally see? i.e OP magical treasure, character is reborn with all his knowledge from the future, chosen one, mary sue..

​

The setting has so much potential, but sadly most stories using it tend to be bad.

Anybody knows of something similar, or is planning on creating something like this?
