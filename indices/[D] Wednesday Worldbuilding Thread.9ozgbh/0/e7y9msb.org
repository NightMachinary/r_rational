So i'm building my next pokemon fanfic, and i'm having trouble to decide how much power the gym leaders should have and its attributions.

In my world, 50 years ago kanto and johto seized a war through a pact of non aggresion. At that time, the interregional elite four were created to moderate businees beetween both continents.

Keep in mind that my worldbuilding is similar to pokemon TooS (my greatest inspiration) and so, pokemons are a real threat to society as a rule. One of the main reasons to seal the pact was for better disposal of resources against the wild.

The first thing i thought was to simply use leaders and elite four as some sort of president/governor, but i'm not so sure. Ideas are welcome.
