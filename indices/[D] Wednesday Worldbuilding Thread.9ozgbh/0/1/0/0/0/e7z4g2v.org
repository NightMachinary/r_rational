Maybe i'm overstimating this aspect of the story. It isn't like my characters are political scientists or anything, but i feel like i need to understand at least the basic of how society works law wise.

Leaders come from a society build upon finally mastering this monsters that constantly threatens humanity. Pokeball invention and the arts of taming and training were the only reason that cities could push foward and progress in technology. It makes sense to me that the top dogs of the command chain are the ones more suited to defend and master this constant danger. But if you concentrate all political functions on leaders, they couldn't possibily handle all trainers that want to challenge or train in their gyms. At least some form of support politicians are needed
