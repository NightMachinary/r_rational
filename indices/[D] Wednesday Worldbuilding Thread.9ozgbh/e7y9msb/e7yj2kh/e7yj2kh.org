So would most of the elite four's power be with Pokemon. You could have they have the authority to take charge of local response teams if there is a reason to believe in danger from the local Pokemon. They would also presumably be important in helping decide longer term measures, so their suggestions probably carry surprising weight in all manner of things. I assume they would help plan any emergency plans, as well as things like if certain actions are too likely to annoy Pokemon such as mining to be dangerous. They probably have large authority in immediate disasters and significant weight if they can explain why something is an unacceptable risk. This is just first thoughts though, I kinda need to leave now.
