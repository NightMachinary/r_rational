  But if you concentrate all political functions on leaders, they couldn't possibily handle all trainers that want to challenge or train in their gyms. At least some form of support politicians are needed

I like this train of thought, it's interesting! If people have fought intercontintental wars as part of your premise, then presumably they're sufficiently defended against frequent Pok√©mon attacks such that there is time to specialize into developing technology and politics... but maybe because mastery of battling is so respected that most political leaders have to have been capable trainers too? Or maybe that's not the case...
