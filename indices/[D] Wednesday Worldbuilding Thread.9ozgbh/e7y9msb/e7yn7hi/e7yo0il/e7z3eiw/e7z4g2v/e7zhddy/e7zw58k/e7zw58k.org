Yeah i mean... people would naturally gather power around those who can defy and control nature. Like in TooS, the first monarch was nobunaga who conquered all Kanto after using pokemon as a resouce for war. Likewise, if there's some political or business interest (say building a train rail or something) they would need full support of someone capable of defending the perimeter arouns the construction site.

In the other hand, leaders aren't necessarily good financial managers. Maybe after sometime they would naturally choose someone to take care of tax and legal business. And if that's the case, it's plausible that after sometime people claim to choose this representatives.

So what i got now is:

Leaders can:

Spend tax resouces to military purposes. Create regulation laws. Judge crimes related to pokemon. Command regional rangers forces.

And invest and manage to some degree in other activities without tax money.

Other politicians can:

Spend tax resouces to educational, health and urban safety. Create laws (related to above maters). Judge normal urban crimes.

This kind of division allow me to explore relations between leaders and other politicians. Like Brock and pewter mayor in TooS that don't seem to get along.

What do u think?
