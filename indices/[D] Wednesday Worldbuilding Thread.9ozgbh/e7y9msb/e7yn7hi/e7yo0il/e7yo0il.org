Is there some place or chapter that he explicit tells us how the dynamic between leaders and mayors work? I understand that leaders are to some extend both executive and judicial power, since they can manage man power, take decisions on how to spend resouces and judge crimes. But if they do so, what mayors are for? Who create the laws?

But how does the rangers works on that equasion? They have some judge power when it comes to renegates at least.
