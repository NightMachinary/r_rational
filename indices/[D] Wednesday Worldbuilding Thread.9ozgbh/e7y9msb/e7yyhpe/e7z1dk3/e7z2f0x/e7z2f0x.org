You're overlooking the limited resource problem. Xianxia changes dramatically if the resources required to reach the top aren't highly limited.

Cradle has this to. The last book was all about how the resources left behind by someone at a higher tier were worth insane amounts for those at lower tiers. Ethan has also been spending insane amounts of money to level up Lindon and Yerin. It's the entire reason that he's in trouble with his house/clan right now.
