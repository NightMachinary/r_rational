To me, the way to “win” a Xianxia setting is to be a charismatic cult-leader and attract a bunch of talents to yourself, then build a secret monastery where you all level up and study the secrets of the universe together for a couple decades. Every once in a while, come out of hiding, have your disciples spar with a few famous warriors whose level they have now reached to impress them, then seduce them to join your cult. Now you have higher-level teachers and new knowledge to cross-pollinate with. Rinse and repeat.

Of course, it's not a very compelling narrative. I get the sense that this is exactly what /would have/ happened next in Will Wight's /Cradle/ series, since all the team-building was done and the protagonists have got a few good planners. But, since it's boring, literal aliens intervened to make staying holed up somewhere getting stronger untenable.
