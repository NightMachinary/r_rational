Most likely the reason you find them bad is because of the way it produces enjoyment in the reader. I've read plenty of Xianxia but I have a friend who's read half of everything, and when I talk with him, I can see the completely different style of reading. He practically skims over it, and as he describes, he can miss paragraphs and it won't change the story much.

It's meant for mindless reading on the way to/from work in China, where readers don't have the mental energy to care or criticize logical fallacies in the story. They just want to experience the emotions of character, the feelings of drama and eventual triumph, and the sensation of being important when the real world makes them feel insignificant.

It's why the descriptions are so excessively over the top, why the characters are often caricatures and the MC is a mary sue, why the MC finds a treasure that changes his dismal fate (real life) or goes back in time to fix all of his mistakes, because that's what the readers are here for.
