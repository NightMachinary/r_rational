I'd probably do the same in the beginning, but after rescuing the top warrior and close confidant of the king I would probably continue getting closer to the kingdom under the guise of the powerful magician.

The kingdom is kind of desperate because of the Empire that wants to conquer it, as well as because of corrupt nobles etc. At the same time the King and that one Princess already have plans to improve the kingdom, they simply can't do them because the nobles are too powerful.

By helping the Princess I would slowly try to gain more power in the kingdom and maybe take it over. With the overwhelming might of the guild it might also be reasonable to start conquering the Empire instead of being conquered by it, depending on how much of my power I would be willing to reveal.

At the same time I would have the various minions play spies and earn a lot of money. Many of them are more powerful than anything else so far in the story. Even if they encounter an enemy too powerful for them, some can create teleport gates within seconds and most can communicate instantly via scroll or spell. There are few actually dangerous scenarios, from what has been revealed in the story so far.
