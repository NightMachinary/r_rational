It's not so much him losing his morals, as him losing his ability to feel strongly about anything for more than a few seconds and him valuing his mostly evil minions and guild higher than anything else in the world. He is willing to sacrifice people for his people's wellbeing and isn't bothered by instincts like revulsion anymore.

He also can't just hole up in his guild, because some of his hundreds of minions need food and the building regularly eats money to work.

Read the lightnovel instead of the manga, it contains more information: [[http://skythewood.blogspot.sg/p/knights-and-magic-author-amazake-no.html]]

*The Following contains vague spoilers up to volume 6*

Current goals:

#+begin_quote
  Find other world-travellers
#+end_quote

- He plans to make the name of his guild known world-wide

  - As of volume 6 he has told a total of one surviving person that name. That one probably told the local king.
  - I'm not quite sure if he said his name while someone was spying on him, I think he didn't.

#+begin_quote
  Gain more income than he requires upkeep
#+end_quote

- He and a single of his minions are posing as adventurers.

  - Please note that there are hundreds, if not thousands, of intelligent minions, a large part of which are more powerful than any single mortal known so far in the story. At least a dozen have human forms.
  - Some ideas I had for making money: Hiring some out as top-class mercenaries, plain banditry, locating ore veins and mining via superior magic, killing dragons and stealing their hoards, taking over some remote countries and taking their taxes, gating/teleporting into vaults and taking all money.

#+begin_quote
  Produce consumables
#+end_quote

- They are starting to production of low-level scrolls and potions. Some efforts toward food-production are made.
- Some consumables simply cannot be created, because they were bought with cash instead of in-game.
