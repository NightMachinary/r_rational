That's how I've felt about this whole work. It seems like it could be good, but the serial format lends itself better to longer chapters. This reads more like a published (possibly YA, with the chapter length) book, which doesn't work as well at one chapter a week.

If I had some advice, I might recommend a slower release schedule that drops multiple chapters at a time, as that seems like it would be more likely to get a better response.
