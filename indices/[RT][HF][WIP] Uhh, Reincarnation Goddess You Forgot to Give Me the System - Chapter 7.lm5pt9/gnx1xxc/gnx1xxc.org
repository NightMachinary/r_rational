Seven chapters in and we still have a passive protagonist being led by the hand and shown bits of the world by another character. But, hey, she's quirky and wants to help the other character, so at least she's not pointless?

I understand that maybe the setup can be difficult, or that maybe there needs to be a bit of setup before the MC can get into the groove, but that really needs to happen soon, preferably before we are 10 chapters in.

This story is kind of like the inverse of the Gilded Hero. That one had a passive protagonist too, for far too long, and just when it started getting good when he became active (and it became really good), the author stopped wirintf it. I hope that doesn't happen here.
