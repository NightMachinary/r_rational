Hmm. This is one of those chapters that would probably be completely fine in a non serial format. As it is it feels a bit like nothing happened. We have some light foreshadowing and minor world building but that's pretty much it.

Oh well. Still looking forward to the next update. I think this story has a lot of potential and I hope it reaches that potential.
