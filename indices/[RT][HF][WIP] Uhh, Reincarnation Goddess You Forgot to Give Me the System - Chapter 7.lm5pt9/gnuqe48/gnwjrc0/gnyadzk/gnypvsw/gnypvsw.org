Author here, the trickle is because just one chapter per week is my actual writing speed for this story. I'd love to post more often, with longer updates (where the content merits it), but I'd burn myself out and run out of backlog pretty quickly if I did that.

I'm probably going to take the advice of the posters in this thread and change up my release schedule to be multiple chapters at a time but less often.

Also, you can ignore the Patreon. It's not worth it unless you're a super-fan dying to know what happens next. And even then, it's probably debatable. (As you can see, I'm a real big brain businessman over here haha)
