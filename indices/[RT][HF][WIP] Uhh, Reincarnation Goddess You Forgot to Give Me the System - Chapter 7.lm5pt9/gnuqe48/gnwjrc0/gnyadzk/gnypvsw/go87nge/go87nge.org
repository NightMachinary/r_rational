You could get a lot of mileage out of simply having her ask useful questions. After running for her life and seeing magic her first question was "What's the name of the planet?" How about "Tell me about your magic and is there any way I can get it?" A few other good candidates include:

- What are the stats?
- What does leveling up do?
- What's this about Personal Quests?
- Are the bad guys going to keep looking for us?

That's off the top of my head. Wondering about why the languages are the same seems low on the priority list.
