Worth it /for what/?

I've read through all of them, and they vary in value roughly (but not perfectly!) in line with my first impressions of each of them. Which sequences are most valuable to you varies from person to person, and it's entirely possible that some will be useless or life-changingly amazing when I found them to be okay.

In addition to the concrete content in the sequences, reading /all/ of them can serve as a sort of community primer, if you want that.
