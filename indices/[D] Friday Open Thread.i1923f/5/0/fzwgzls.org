There's an audiobook:

Not all of the posts work in the audio format, but most do.

50 hours long. I dunno, I think it was worth it. If you're interested - keep reading. A lot of this was a bit too dry and math heavy for me though.

Personally, I'm getting more out of Slate Star Codex essays. Scott Alexander is an amazing writer, much more engaging and fun to read.

Collection of all his essays:
