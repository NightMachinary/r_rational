I came across a tool recently that proved useful to me, so I thought I'd share it here. It's a script to make AO3 posting a much less painful process. It automatically adds the html codes to a plaintext google doc so it can be copied directly into the ao3 submission box without further edits. I've used it a couple of times now and so far it is working as advertised. Since so many people share their writing here I thought someone might find it useful.
