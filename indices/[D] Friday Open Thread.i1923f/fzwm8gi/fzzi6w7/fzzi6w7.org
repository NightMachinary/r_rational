I've been on this sub long enough to generally believe any breakage of physics can be exploited for FTL. At first glance this appears to be easy to use for limited range FTL travel. That being said, I'm sure you could leverage that material into more physics breaking materials.

Maybe post it on Saturday's munchkin thread? Or look for munchkin discussion of "dungeon keeper Ami adamantine" for a fantasy material that sounds similar. I'd appreciate links if you find good discussions, I'm on mobile so digging is difficult.

The idea of FTL cable lines is pretty cool for a setting too. Attacks anywhere on the line would be devastating to reception and broadcast points...
