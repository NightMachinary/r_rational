Here's my friend's response:

  1) Resources that homeschoolers/unschoolers use vary widely from person to person. Many unschoolers reject the notion of "providing avenues" and prioritize free exploration, using the world and everyday life as their "toolkit," over everything else. A major part of a lot of unschooling/homeschooling is to have the student take the lead in determining what they want to learn and how they want to learn it. If they want, they might use resources like textbooks, TED talks, workbooks, people to talk to, novels, articles, etc. The amount of freedom the student has in choosing what they want to focus on varies from case to case -- e.g. some parents might be totally fine with it if their kid wants to do art all day and rarely/never practice handwriting, some might try to get the kid to do both.

  Some good resouces I've used are Junior Great Books, the workbooks You Decide! Bill of Rights and Editor in Chief from the Critical Thinking Co., the Murderous Maths series, the Horrible Histories and Horrible Science books, and the Life of Fred math book series. Be warned LoF takes a conservative, religious tone occasionally, but if you don't mind or can ignore that, it's nice and covers everything from arithmetic to calculus and beyond. The websites edX and Coursera are great for children and adults of any age who want to take interesting courses.

  2) Right so this can be hard. Facebook posts can help you find other people. You could post that you are looking for other unschoolers/homeschoolers to form a secular group with. Indicate the kinds of activities (e.g. go to the playground, have a math circle, have a book club, sing songs) you want to do in the group and where you want to meet. We tried this and it worked! There's also something called an umbrella group that would provide guidance and maybe a social network, but I don't know much about those.

  3) I don't know.
