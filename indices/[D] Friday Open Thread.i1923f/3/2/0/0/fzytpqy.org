Thanks. I work twelve to fourteen hour days during the school year, show continual improvement on state tests, give kids their first essays, teach kids to argue with evidence, teach them to graph and analyze, but apparently all that is "mostly useless" and I just provide childcare according to internet experts.

Education in the US has basically managed to show slow but steady growth for the last 20 years, but is always failing and useless in the eyes of internet experts.
