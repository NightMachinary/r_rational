Unless you are running a school district, designing curricula for a living, or serving on a major Board of Education, I am not calling your profession anything. The American education system is composed of a lot of things; teachers are not the people who serve as the primary driver of its behavior.

I'll go further: teachers are by and large the only thing in the current US school system that I don't think is a tire fire. Everything else, from how things are funded to how things are structured to how they're administered and how staffing is done? All of those things are not about teachers on an individual level.

When I shit-talk the system, those are the things I'm shit-talking.

(Trivial example: school system funding via property tax is economically regressive and structurally racist. Second trivial example: funding arts and extra-curriculars on the back of effort/cash from students and their families likewise, at a minimum. Third trivial example: tackle football still exists.)
