All due respect, you called my profession useless without evidence. There's no way to substantively engage, because you won't agree in the validity of any evidence that refutes your pre-existing views.

Don't like standardized tests, look at graduation rates. They're at all time highs. Think High Schools are getting easier? College graduation rates are also increasing. The illiteracy rate is vanishingly small at this point, which is in itself a sign of success. Think that the emotional component of school is more important? Bullying rates seem to be declining over time. Eventually rational people have to respect consilience.
