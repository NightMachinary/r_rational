I recommend Future Man, a short sci-fi series that doesn't take itself too seriously but still manages to have an entertaining plot. It's about a young janitor who beats an 'unbeatable' game, and thus gets chosen by crazy people to go on sci-fi adventures to save the world. Cue wacky hijinks. Mostly because the 'good' guys are insane and the main character spends the whole series doing damage control and talking them out of burning down cities and killing everyone, with mixed results.
