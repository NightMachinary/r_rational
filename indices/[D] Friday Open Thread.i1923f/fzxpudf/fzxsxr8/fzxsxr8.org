I think this is related to the observation that [[https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2016/09/23/survey-69-of-americans-have-less-than-1000-in-savings-infographic/#7b8c0ac81ae6][69% of Americans have <$1k liquid savings]] sitting around, which has always struck me as rather strange, but maybe most of those people just have high limits on the credit cards and it only takes 2-4 days or w/e liquidate investments (esp. stable ones like bonds)? It's always seemed like a headache to have to manage all that, though, so I've always tried to keep $5-10k sitting around in a bank account in case I need it in a context where credit cards are not accepted. As a result, I never really notice when paychecks come in, and otherwise have alerts to notify me of suspicious or esp. large activities.
