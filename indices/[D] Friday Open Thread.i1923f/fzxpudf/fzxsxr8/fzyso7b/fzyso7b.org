I'm trying to say this as nicely as possible, but your comment is incredibly naive. 45% of Americans don't own stock. I would love to own stock, bonds would be ok too! Unfortunately having a roof over my head is nicer.

Think about it this way. The Median household income is $63k. So after taxes, families are getting $48k a year or $4000 a month. The median home price is $320k, that's $1600 a month 30 year fixed at 4.5%. So your monthly income is now $2400. The Median car price is $31k (this figure is unreliable and hard to find); about 600 a month. So now that's down to $1800. Next we have groceries. The USDA says that a moderate plan for a family of four is about $900 a month. So now we're down to $900. Then there's health insurance. CNBC says that the average is $9600 a year, or $800 a month. Then we have car insurance. NAIC says that is on average $1k a year, or $83 a month. Now you're down to $16. Then, Forbes said the average family spends $1700 on clothes per year (average again, seems unreliable). That puts us below zero.

I stopped at zero, but there are other payments like house upkeep, homeowners, gas, student loans, phone bills, haircuts, home appliances, furniture, etc.

So we can quibble here or there with the fact that most places offer average instead of median, like I prefer. Obviously median results will be lower. Of course there are people that spend unwisely, but they are a fraction of the people (like me) who have no wealth because income can barely (or can't) pay bills.

But hopefully you get the impression that for half of families in the US, life is on the margins. You get sick often, have a lot of mechanics bills, or a broken fridge, and a year's savings go out the window. And if more than one happens, you can get into a liquidity crisis spiral.
