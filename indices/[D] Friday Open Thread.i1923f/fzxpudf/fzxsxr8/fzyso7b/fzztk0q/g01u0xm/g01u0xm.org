So first off, vehicle numbers are horrifically hard to parse. I found a blog post with a breakdown that seemed decent but no way authoritative. I think mortgages are an inferior investment opportunity, but one that immediately improves your life by granting you control over a place you spend half your life.

All that said, one aspect of poverty that doesn't get talked about much is that poverty literally makes it harder to make rational decisions.

That plus liquidity crises make it very hard to get out. Liquidity crises are a real source of drain on many people. A lot of time your options are financing or payday loans; either of which increase the cost of living.

A lot of people develop a sort of monetary nihilism. If nothing seems to generate wealth, trying doesn't make sense. Short term gains then provide a "virtuous" feedback cycle. Buying things helps you feel good and ignore monetary problems, which makes monetary problems worse, which leads to short-term thinking, which makes wealth generation harder, which makes buying things seem like the only possible source of comfort, etc.
