I appreciate the clemency, especially in response to a perhaps too hastily written or tone-deaf comment. I was mostly speculating as to why I personally might keep so little in savings, only weakly generalizing to the broader population.

Otherwise yeah, what I'd be curious in is a finer grained breakdown of Americans' spending habits. How much of paycheck-to-paycheck living is due to financial illiteracy vs. informed variation in priorities vs. unforeseen, faultless emergency expenses kickstarting positive feedback loops that further and further entrench poverty? It's also unclear to me how much "personal responsibility" to assign to different sources of financial struggle, when it comes to e.g. eating out vs. meal prepping at home, recreational drug use, lifestyle-related health expenses, and insolvent pregnancy. And difficult not to view example budgets as lower class versions of [[https://twitter.com/MarketWatch/status/1178369905244229633][this]].

In the breakdown you gave, it sounds like the primary investment vehicle in play is real estate, which is inherently rather illiquid. If one prioritizes that over e.g. index funds, it seems straightforward to not have much intermediately available cash. I guess refinancing a mortgage is always an option, but I'm not sure how long that takes. I am a bit surprised at the car number, too, since I'd expect the majority of cars to be used econoboxes. Even new those tend to sell much cheaper (a few years ago we bought a brand new Toyota Corolla for ~$16k, largely because of recently introduced safety features; otherwise, we'd have opted for something costing even less, as the cars we'd owned in the decade prior were were quite reliable and purchased for $4k and $2k each). And clothing too -- I've always wondered what people are spending these sums on, esp. when they don't appear to be dressed all that lavishly. Is it, like, extortionate uniforms for their jobs? I've found I can generally outfit an entire wardrobe for maybe a few $100, and with care and upkeep it can last several years.

(fwiw, I'm nearing 30 in the US and have never made more than the low $40k's each year before taxes, mostly making like $10k-$20k annually throughout my adult life, which includes the last ~2y. But it's always felt like a rather lavish income, since it affords me a lifestyle way in excess of what I had during childhood, and big expenses have been easily cut via stuff like having roommates, not eating out, and taking cheap vacations by e.g. primarily sleeping outside and hitchhiking everywhere. This is also admittedly without any major health expenses or children)
