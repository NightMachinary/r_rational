My primary questions are:

- What are the toolkits being used to provide avenues for inquiry and content?
- How do people seeking to "unschool" their kids find likeminded people local to them? (By likeminded, I mean not religious fundies; most people even in my extremely liberal area who are homeschooling are not people I want my daughter anywhere near, because the Mammonism might be contagious.)
- How is the experience changing due to COVID?
