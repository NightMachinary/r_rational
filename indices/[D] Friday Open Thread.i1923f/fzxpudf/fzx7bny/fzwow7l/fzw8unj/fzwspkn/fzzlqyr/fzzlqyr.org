I'd never heard of "unschooling" before, thanks for bringing it up here! The name reminded me of people who homeschool their children to avoid letting them get "brainwashed by the liberal/athiest/satanist education system" I'm really glad that isn't what this is.

I've always had a theory that a lot of the geniuses of the 20th century were due to a similar learning philosophys/realities. A lot of them were taught by private tutors for individual subjects, which I'm sure let them mostly go as fast or deep into subjects as they wanted to up to a college level (like their tutors) early on. A lot of them also learned by default from books, meaning that their upper limit for their own learning would be sky high.

At one point I tried to figure out how to check this but realized the population would be tiny and massively confounded by other variables. These people largely came from families/cultures that highly value education, and are extremely wealthy. The cost of those tutors would be extremely high so a lot of the benefits would probably wash out by trying to compare equal money spent on other education styles.

I'm not optimistic about how the sudden switch will work out, but we are living in a golden age of widespread education resources through the internet. I just hope the sure to be poor management of online learning doesn't set back online education as a whole after the pandemic.
