*make a catapult out of it?* If you had an indestructible material, you could say cast a 100 mile long, one micron thick rod out of it, with a hinge on one end and a giant bowl on the other end. (I assume that the indestructible material is cast and then settles into indestructibility, or it would be useless).

Now, grab hinge end of this super giant lever, and apply some incredible force to it to make it swing at as close to the speed of light pas possible (use nukes perhabs?). the opposite end of the lever would swing at several times the speed on the hinge end, thus being FTL.

Now the problem is, the sudden acceleration would probably absolutely crush anything that sits in the bowl, unless also made of Indestructium.
