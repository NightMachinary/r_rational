It might be worth distinguishing between FTL communication and FTL travel.

Imagine a toy example where you have two planets, stationary relative to each other and a light year apart. Put a rod of this material reaching from one planet to the other, and push it up and down just like a Morse code tapper to transmit information. The force is transmitted through the rod instantly, and the movements are therefore instantly repeated at the other end and can be decoded. This signal arrives faster than light, a radio message would take a year to cover the same distance.

I'm not sure whether a mechanical arrangement would allow the material to be used for FTL transportation of people, rather than information. However, if you can break down people into information and reconstruct them from it, this material could be used to transmit the information describing a person faster than light and so enable FTL teleportation by using the information to reconstruct them at the other end.
