Is there a bias or better industry word for this occurrence: people generally accept disproportionate punishments/costs for choices other than the default. Because it's something extra or different people accept paying a disproportionate amount for it relative to the generally accepted cost.

I'm on vacation and notice this a lot eating out. A diner for example with $7 pancakes that chargers $1.50 for fruit on top like a sliced banana. A ice cream place with $5 shakes that charge $0.50 per tablespoon of each topping added in.

I personally think of this as "choice punishment bias" but can't find a match for the definition online.
