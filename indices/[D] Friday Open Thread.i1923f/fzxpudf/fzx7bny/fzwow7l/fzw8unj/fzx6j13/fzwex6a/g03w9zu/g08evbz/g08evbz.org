My guess is, people see shakes for $5, they make the decision to buy a shake. When they realize there are extra costs, they've already made the decision and are looking forward to that shake, so they don't back out. If the shake had been priced at a flat $8, it'd generate less sales.

Sort of related to the sunk cost fallacy, (pre)commitment and cognitive dissonance, but nothing 100% fits.
