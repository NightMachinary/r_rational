I've seen some people talk in this sub that if you had a completely unbendable, and indestructive material this could be used to achieve FTL. I'm not sure how that would work though. I mean, sure, if the material is perfectly unbendable and indestructive, then if you apply force to it the lak of elasticity will make it so the force is transmited from one end of the body of material you hate to the oposite end of it instantly, meaning that the force is traveling at FTL speeds. What I'm not quite sure is how we could use hipothetically use this. I can see how the force would travel at FTL in succh material but I can't see how that would allow /us/ to reach FTL. (Also if the material is unbendable and indestructive, how do you even use it?)
