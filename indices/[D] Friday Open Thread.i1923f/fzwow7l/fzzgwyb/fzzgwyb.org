It's also a self-motivating loop, we are on a WtC fanfiction streak keep it up! Each time they pop up and get good reception they remind people of their own fanfiction idea and encourage them to go for it. So the surge is due to a couple of feedback loops that encourage people to make, find, and post the content right now.

I'm pretty happy with the trend, the first few were "disappointing" in that I thought it was a main story update but the stories themselves have been good.

This has also made me realize the WtC update plan is my favorite, we get big chunks of content and huge amounts of discussion at one time. It let's us get really good discussions that I don't think we would have if the content was more spread out.
