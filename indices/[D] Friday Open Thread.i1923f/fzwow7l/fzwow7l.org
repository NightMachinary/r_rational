I'm very inactive on reddit these days (some of you may remember me? I used to be pretty active here a few years back) and I was browsing around here for the first time in a while; can anyone tell me what's up with the recent surge of WtC fanfic? Surge may be a bit of a dramatic word but I feel like I did not see pretty much any FF for it back in the day but now, there's like 3-4 of them just in the past two weeks of posts.

I'm not really calling it a good or bad thing; I'm just curious.
