I really liked this chapter. Feels like things are actually happening!

So it turns out creating a blue isn't as simple as filling slimes with mana from Essence Well. It /could/ be an issue of being too much mana at once or the slimes being too low level, but regardless I like that Rain tried it.

I assume next chapter Rain will get to access the artifact, so that'll be exciting. Either that or he'll just direct the crew towards the disturbance and we'll see it later.
