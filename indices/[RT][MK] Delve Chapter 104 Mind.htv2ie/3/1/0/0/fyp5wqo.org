It's not really a litrpg, though it has skills and other weird shit. They never actually list all they got, and they'll get a lot. No actual stats.

Dude finds an infinite office dungeon in the office he works in, and gets interested. Finds monsters like staplers and plants and dodges exploding coffee mugs. Killing monsters gives skill orbs, which are usually shitty, but when you get a lot of them, you'll get some useful ones too. Could be +1 to cooking blueberry pancakes or +3 to japanese customs bureaucracy. Usually very specific stuff. Ofc, this is not the only kind of orbs and there are other secrets too...

He starts asking roommates and d&d friends to his looting party and... Is this enough?
