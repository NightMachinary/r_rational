A lot of people here also think "Rational" fiction is poorly named, but it's too late to change now. It definitely doesn't mean "rational" in the sense of cold calculated reason (though that is often a fun trope)

It's NOT just good fiction, it's consistency /at the expense of/ other enjoyable features. For example, it means the villain never gets to monologue at the end, and we never find out what his plan was, because he doesn't want to.
