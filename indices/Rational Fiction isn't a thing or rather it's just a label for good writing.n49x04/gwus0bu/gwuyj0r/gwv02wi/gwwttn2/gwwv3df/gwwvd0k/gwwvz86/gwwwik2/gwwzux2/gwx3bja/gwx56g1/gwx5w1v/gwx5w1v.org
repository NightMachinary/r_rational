  Huckleberry Finn is intelligent (albeit rather uneducated), we know his goals and motives, the climax is satisfying (Hemingway disagreed, but that's because he would have liked for the story to end on a depressing note), and the worldbuilding is thoughtful.

Then it sounds like Huck Finn would qualify as Rational assuming its plot and characterization is consistent. But it doesn't *feel* like it belongs here. That's why I'm saying Rational doesn't make sense as a genre or label.

There must be something different between your story and Huck that makes people think your story belongs here and Huck doesn't?
