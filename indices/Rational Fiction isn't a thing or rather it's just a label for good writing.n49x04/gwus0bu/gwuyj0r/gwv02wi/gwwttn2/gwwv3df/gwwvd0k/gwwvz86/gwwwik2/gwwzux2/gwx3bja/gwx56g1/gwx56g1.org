Huckleberry Finn is intelligent (albeit rather uneducated), we know his goals and motives, the climax is satisfying (Hemingway disagreed, but that's because he would have liked for the story to end on a depressing note), and the worldbuilding is thoughtful.

The story does not really involve attempts on Huck's part to improve his thinking, but then, neither does TINTF.
