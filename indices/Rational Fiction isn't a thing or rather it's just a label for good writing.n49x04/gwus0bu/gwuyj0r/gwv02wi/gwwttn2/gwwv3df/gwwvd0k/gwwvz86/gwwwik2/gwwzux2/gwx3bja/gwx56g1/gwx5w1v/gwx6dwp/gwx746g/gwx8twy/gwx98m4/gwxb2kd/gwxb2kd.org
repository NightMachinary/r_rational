I came to my own conclusion, then checked to make sure that there were no signs that I might be wildly off-base. "Dude has opinion about a genre, and the community which is based around that genre thinks he has some good points" is a sign that perhaps I should rethink my own disagreements. "Dude has opinion, and continues to hold that opinion even after several people who are better-acquainted with the genre explain why the opinion is wrong," is not such a sign.

Your position is unpopular because (1) it's wrong and (2) many people are understandably annoyed by seeing people advance this position like it's a wild new thing, when actually we get it, like, every year.
