I'm not on here much, but I think this argument, or one much like it, pops up several times a year at least. I know it's far from the first time I've seen it. Ratfic is a suboptimal label for a cluster of characteristics commonly found in the kind of fiction that's popular with a certain reader group. Those characteristics are not identical to what makes fiction good. To put it another way, would you call Jane Austen a ratfic writer, or just a hack? Not that I'm a fan, myself.
