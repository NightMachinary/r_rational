I already responded with this in another comment but:\\
rationalist fiction *is* a genre and label that is used for the fictions you described, they *also* fit the definition of rational fiction and should be descried as both. Rational fiction *already* doesn't mean rationalist fiction, and I agree rationalist is a genre, while rational is a quality standard on a specific quality metric, and it is used as such. It does look like a genre though.
