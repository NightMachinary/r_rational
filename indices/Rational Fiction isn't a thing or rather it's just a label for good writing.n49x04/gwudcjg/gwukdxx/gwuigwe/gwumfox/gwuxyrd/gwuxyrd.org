A fiction qualifying as rational depends on how transparent the chain of causal events throughout the story is to the reader? In other words, a reader should be able to clearly see how each event in the plot and character's decision making logically interconnects?

My issue is the way that most of these rational fictions create this transparency for the reader is through expressing the thoughts of the characters (usually the main character) and the inductive reasoning the characters use. In that sense I think the genre of Rationalist Fiction does exist.

I think Worth the Candle, Mother of Learning, Metropolitan Man, HPMOR would fall under that category. In fact most of the stories that are labelled as Rational Fiction are actually just Rationalist Fiction.

So I think it makes sense to get rid of Rational Fiction as a genre because it tends to be overly general and replace it with Rationalist Fiction which focuses on the transparency of character's motivations and decisions.
