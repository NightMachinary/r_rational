  But internal consistency is not enough; rational fiction also *rewards* gears-seeking. The story is written so that gears-seeking leads to deeper understanding and appreciation of the story. For example, often a character's success depends on figuring out more about how the world works and scheming about how they can use these raw materials to accomplish what they want. If the story provides the reader with enough information about the world, then the story is calling on them to join in on seeking gears and scheming.

I agree that /rationalist/ fiction is a legitimate genre in that there's a heavy emphasis on a character's thinking processes and use of inductive logic. This inductive logic is usually displayed while the character goes about exploring the world and making sense of it; ie. the scheming and gear-seeking.

I think Worth the Candle, Mother of Learning, Metropolitan Man, HPMOR would fall under that category. In fact most of the stories that are labelled as Rational Fiction are actually just Rationalist Fiction.

But the other qualities of Rational Fiction like consistent characterization and plot-building are too overly general to deserve its own genre.

Rationalist fiction as a genre covers all of the stories that involve characters scheming and gear-seeking.
