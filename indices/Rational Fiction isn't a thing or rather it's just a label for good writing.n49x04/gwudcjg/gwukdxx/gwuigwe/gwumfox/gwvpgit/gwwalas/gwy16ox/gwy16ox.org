I wasn't trying to distinguish rational vs. rationalist fiction in my old comment. To take a stab at it:

Coherent fiction is set in a world that makes sense.

Rational fiction is the subset of coherent fiction that rewards the reader for actively trying to make sense of the world.

Rationalist fiction has at least one "rationalist" character whose thinking the reader can watch, where that character's thinking meets the criteria for coherent & rational fiction (their thinking processes make sense, and the reader is rewarded for trying to make sense of them).
