But don't you think there are stories that would qualify as Rational because they pass a threshold of internal plot and character consistency, but wouldn't be posted on this subreddit because they don't feel like Rational fiction in a genre-sense?

That's why I'm saying Rational should be replaced with Rationalist which is a well-defined genre as opposed to an arbitrary standard of internal consistency.
