  Your position is unpopular because (1) it's wrong and (2) many people are understandably annoyed by seeing people advance this position like it's a wild new thing, when actually we get it, like, every year.

Most people seem to agree the label is suboptimal. I don't think my position is unpopular because it's wrong, but rather because it's inconvenient. It's simply too inconvenient to retroactively try to change the terms and labels even if it would make them more precise.
