Subject matter and how fiction approaches it are part of the definition of rational fiction. In very oversimplified terms, rational fiction promotes Enlightenment subjects like bayesian logic, the usefulness of AI, and the effects of hard magic systems on a world, while most fiction focuses on Romanticist values (the amount of books about technology being bad, things being suddenly overcome through deux ex machinas the protagonists "earned" through morality, and things just happening solely for the sake of message is very high). Frankenstein is a very well written book with consistent characters, yet it is the polar opposite of rational fiction.
