Then this whole thread is just a motte and bailey fallacy where you equivocate between "good writing" in the very narrow sense of logical/consistent plot/characters (the motte) and "good writing" in the more expansive sense that includes Romeo and Juliet or the Deadpool movies despite neither of those having a logical/consistent plot/characters (the bailey).
