I largely agree; other than in the unique cases that are unrealistic on purpose, internal consistency is just good writing, but I disagree that the label does not have merit.

Internal consistency (or rationality, how realistic it is w/e) is one of the multiple measures of what makes a story good along with plot, pacing, characters, and whatever other metrics affect an individual's enjoyment of a story. These are always:

1. Subjective and
2. Often on a scale, where the bar for an experience to be enjoyable for each is also completely subjective along with the point where no further enjoyment is gained with an increase in the specific metric.

In the case for internal consistency, most people's "bar" on how internally consistent a story needs to be before they start getting turned off by it is (in this community's perspective) fairly low. "rational fiction" is just fiction who's internal consistency meter is much higher than the norm, specifically designed for people who are sensitive to this metric. - You are arguing that rational fiction = good writing, I am arguing that internal consistency is a single metric out of many to judge good writing and rational fiction = good writing in this one specific metric only, which basically IS the definition.

^That is basically my argument, but to expand a bit more: a good metaphor for this is movie quality; yes, 1020p is just better than 720p, but for some people, the difference between the two does not affect their enjoyment of the movie. Rational fiction would be the equivalent of 1280p movies, specifically for people who are super sensitive to that measure of quality, and needs a separate label rather than just "good movies" because this sensitivity is *unique.*

As a side note as well: Individuals who are sensitive to this tend to also share other subjective traits, which makes us (I guess) tend to enjoy similar things and a separate label useful for this reason as well.
