I'm talking about */one specific/* attribute of good writing in realism fiction; ie. logical plot and characters. There are other qualities to good writing, and a story can be entertaining even if it has plotholes.

I'm saying rational fiction is too overly general to be a genre and rationalist fiction is a more precise genre.
