  But don't you think there are stories that would qualify as Rational because they pass a threshold of internal plot and character consistency, but wouldn't be posted on this subreddit because they don't feel like Rational fiction in a genre-sense?

Can you give examples of stories that should be here, but were rejected by the community either when posted or when discussed?

  That's why I'm saying Rational should be replaced with Rationalist which is a well-defined genre as opposed to an arbitrary standard of internal consistency.

"Rationalist" has connotations that "rational" does not, as currently used, and I do not see the value in diluting that term.
