That's what I'm saying; people are calling the stories on this subreddit rational fiction, when it's mostly just rationalist fiction.

A pre-requisite of rationalist fiction is that it needs to pass the threshold of internal consistency.

But there are lots of stories with internally consistent plots and characterizations and it doesn't make sense to lump them all under one genre.

So I think it makes more sense for the subreddit to be called Rationalist Fiction as opposed to Rational Fiction.
