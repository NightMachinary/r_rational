This is stupid. Good writing can't be nearly so neatly summed up, and rationality is not at all a component of lots of works, prime examples being many surrealist or poetic works, or any work not centered on character. There are many things that make a work "good" (ignoring the whole ass issue that is assuming there is such a thing as objective goodness). Rational fiction (which exists more as a community than as a genre) is fiction that focuses on one aspect over others, not because it necessarily produces the best work, but because you get different, interesting work.

Here's an interesting metaphor: when one is trying to learn chess, one has this vague sort of goal of "playing well" in the sense of trying to make good moves. A beginner, however, really doesn't know what sort of moves that consists of, and they're essentially playing randomly. One thing that a beginner might try is to replace that goal of "playing well" with a different goal, like, say, "move my pieces near the enemy king", or "have my pieces targetting the most possible squares" which is adjacent, but easier to define. This is a useful learning exercise, and creates chess games (or stories, unwrapping the metaphor) that you haven't seen before, that are both interesting in their own right, and teach you about grander chess.

And finally: if rational fiction were "just good writing", why are there stories that people here like that don't get recommended? If you asked the majority of people here for their favourite books, many would give answers that wouldn't get posted here. The two off the top of my head definitely do not fit the mark.
