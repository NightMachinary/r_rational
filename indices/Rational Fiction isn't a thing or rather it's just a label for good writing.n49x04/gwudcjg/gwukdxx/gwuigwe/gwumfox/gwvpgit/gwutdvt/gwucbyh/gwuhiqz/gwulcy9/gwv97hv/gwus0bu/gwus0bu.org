  Rational fiction is described as fiction that has a world with consistent rules and characters that behave consistently and logically.

No, it isn't. Check the sidebar again, because you've boiled it down /way/ too much.

  But that's the definition of good writing
#+end_quote

No, it isn't. "Good writing" has no simple, universal definition. In one sense, "good writing" is whatever is technically elegant or aesthetically pleasing. In another sense, "good writing" is whatever achieves its aim. If a story is internally inconsistent, but produces specific emotions in its audience, and those are the emotions which its author sought to produce, in that kind of audience, then it was, in this sense, well-written.

What you're doing is confusing "good writing" with "writing that whoislawliett likes."
