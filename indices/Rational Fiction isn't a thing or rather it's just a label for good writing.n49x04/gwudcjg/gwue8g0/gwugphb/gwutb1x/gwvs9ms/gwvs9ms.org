That very particular type of good writing is rational fiction. But in general, /"good writing" just means something people enjoy reading/, and consistently logical writing is just one type of it, for particular readers.

Consistent plot with no holes = rational fiction, but

Not all good writing is (Consistent plot with no holes)

and not all (Consistent plot with no holes) is good writing.

Consistent plot with no holes is something that appeals to a certain demographic of people who like to over-analyse fiction, and consume content cerebrally not strictly emotionally. Since the same people are usually rationality-adjacent, we call it "rational fiction".

Now, it is important not to confuse rational and RATIONALIST fiction, because these two things are not the same. 99% of rational fiction is not rationalist, and a fair bit of rationalist fiction is not rational (inconsistent characterization subservient to rationalist monologues ).
