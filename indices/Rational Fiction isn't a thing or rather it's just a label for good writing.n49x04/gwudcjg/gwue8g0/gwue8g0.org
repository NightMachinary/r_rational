The opposite of Magical Realism isn't Rational fiction, it's Realism.

Harry Potter is a good story, but it's not perfectly written; there are plenty of plotholes (eg. the time turner issue).

By good writing, I mean writing that is well-executed on a technical level, not simply an entertaining story.
