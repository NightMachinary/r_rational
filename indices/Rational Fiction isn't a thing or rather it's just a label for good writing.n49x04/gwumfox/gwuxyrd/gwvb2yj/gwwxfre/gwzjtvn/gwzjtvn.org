  focusing on is rationalist fiction, not rational. So in cases where rational fiction like a genre (or qualifies in a genre-sense as opposed to a standard-sense), it's really rationalist fiction that they're thinking of.

I disagree, in the Monday rec threads, people very often distinguish the two: rational means internally consistent, rationalist means smart MC's. This is clear and people use it as such, there is very little fiction which is rationalist, but much more which is rational.

  Since in order for something to qualify as rational in a genre-sense there has to be transparency in the character's thoughts and reasoning process

I see you specified "genre sense", not sure what exactly you mean by that, "genre sense" of rational fiction is just that its internal consistency is unusually high, it does not require anything that rationalist fiction does (even if it often helps or does contain it).
