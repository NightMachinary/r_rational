I don't like pineapples on pizza. I mean, they're perfectly alright on their own, even cooked, even cooked on top of a pizza! But their flavour usually distracts from my enjoyment of the /rest/ of the food, overwhelming the other good bits, and bringing my /average/ enjoyment down.

An author is perfectly alright if they decide to cut out the scene that rationalizes a villain's motivation, and instead let the audience imagine one purely from genre tropes. They might weigh the pros and cons, and decide that giving the reader that extra bit of information dilutes the rest of the story, or that they can better allocate the word count on other aspects of the central characters' journey.

Making a deliberate and informed trade-off there is /Good Writing/, even if they choose to eschew a more Rational story in the process. They're simply allocating their writing time, and their audience's reading time, on other facets of fiction, and creating a story that fills a different niche as a result.
