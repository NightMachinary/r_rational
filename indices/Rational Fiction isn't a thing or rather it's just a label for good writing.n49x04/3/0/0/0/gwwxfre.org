My issue is that there are lots of stories that would qualify as rational because it passes the standard on the specific quality metric, but people wouldn't see it as rational on this subreddit in a genre-sense.

Because what they're really *focusing on is rationalist fiction, not rational. So in cases where rational fiction* */looks/* *like a genre (or qualifies in a genre-sense as opposed to a standard-sense), it's really rationalist fiction that they're thinking of.*

Therefore it feels unnecessary to label the stories here as rational and just label it as rationalist, because calling them rational is redundant and a bit arbitrary.

I guess the question I have is what's a story that qualifies as rational in a genre sense, but doesn't qualify as rationalist in a genre sense? Cause I'm not aware of any like that. Since in order for something to qualify as rational in a genre-sense there has to be transparency in the character's thoughts and reasoning process, which end up making it into a rationalist fiction.
