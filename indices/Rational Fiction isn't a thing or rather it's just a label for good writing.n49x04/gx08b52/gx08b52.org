One of the hallmarks of rational fiction is that the world does /not/ treat the characters as particularly special. Coincidences are /not/ particularly slanted in their favour.

This is not true, in fiction as a whole. The Protagonist has his own sort of not-exactly-magic; /he's/ the one who solves the insoluble riddle that has stymied the greatest minds of a thousand generations (despite the fact that the average reader has an even chance of solving it himself). The Protagonist is the only one who can defeat the near-undefeatable Antagonist - often through simply happening to be in the right place at the right time. When the Protagonist meets a little old lady and helps her, she turns out to be a powerful fae princess - or the Queen of a nearby kingdom in disguise - or to be able to talk to animals - or similar. The Protagonist is the one who finds the lost superweapon and manages, however unlikely, to activate it /seconds/ before the closely-pursuing Antagonist arrives; the Protagonist is the one who tries a risky maneuvre to escape and comes out of it unharmed; the Protagonist is the one who, when facing sure and certain death, just happens to find at the last second an ancient and powerful teleportation device.

None of the above is rational. None of the above is necessarily poor writing (like anything else, it /can/ be handled poorly). But it is all over Fiction, as a whole. So it makes sense to have a name for stories that at least attempt to resolve the above...
