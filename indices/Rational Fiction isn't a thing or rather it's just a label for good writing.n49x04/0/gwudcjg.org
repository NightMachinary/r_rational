I swear I read this exact argument several years ago. Heck, I think I /had/ this argument with an ex of mine, haha.

This is a false claim. There is very good writing out there that purposely bucks this style. Magical realism springs to mind; the inconsistency of the world and characters is key.

Or heck, even Harry Potter, where the rules of the world seem to change constantly (which is why HPMOR, one of the definitive pieces of rational fiction, was made in the first place). The inconsistency doesn't stop millions of fans from loving the original series, nor does it stop them from thinking it's good writing.

  But there's no such thing as "Rational fiction".

The sidebar gives a definition and common features. If something fits these, why do you oppose calling it rational fiction?
