I meant good writing in the context that the author is /intentionally/ trying to write a story without plot holes or inconsistency. So I'm talking about good writing in the context of Realism as opposed to Magical Realism.

In other words, I'm saying that Rational fiction is just a label for technically well-written Realism fiction.

If the author is intentionally attempting to create inconsistency as a literary technique, that's a different issue.

I do think Rationalist fiction exists though, ie. fiction that focuses heavily on a character's thinking processes and using inductive logic. I think Worth the Candle, Mother of Learning, Metropolitan Man, HPMOR would fall under that category. In fact most of the stories that are labelled as Rational Fiction are actually just Rationalist Fiction.

So I think it makes sense to get rid of Rational Fiction as a genre because it tends to be overly general and replace it with Rationalist Fiction which focuses on the transparency of character's motivations and decisions.
