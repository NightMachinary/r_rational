  The opposite of Magical Realism isn't Rational fiction, it's Realism.

I'm not talking about the opposite of rational fiction. I'm countering your claim that good writing is defined by having a consistent world and characters. That is not the definition of good writing, because there's plenty of writing people consider good without having this.

  By good writing, I mean writing that is well-executed on a technical level, not simply an entertaining story.

If the author purposely creates an inconsistent setting or characters, then it can still be well-executed on a technical level and considered good writing. As mentioned, magical realism is an example of this. I'm a big fan of /Cien AÃ±os De Soledad/ (my username is based off one of the main characters), but the way you've defined "good writing" would not cover it, despite the novel having won tons of awards for, y'know, good writing.

My point is that while you might enjoy a consistent world and characters, you don't need them to have something be "good writing." Rational fiction has these, but it has other features as well - again, see the sidebar and the definition and examples there. Good writing is not the same thing as having a consistent world/characters, and having a consistent world/characters is not the only thing included in rational fiction. Saying rational fiction is just good writing isn't accurate.
