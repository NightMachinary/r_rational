  These definitions are clear: rationalist is a genre, rational is a threshold on the bar of internal consistency, but because this is so unique often looks and acts like a genre.

I agree that rational isn't a genre, that's why I'm confused by this in the sidebar

#+begin_quote
  Aspiring rationalism: the story heavily focuses on characters' thinking, or their attempts to improve their reasoning abilities. This is a feature of *rationalist fiction*, a subcategory of rational fiction.
#+end_quote

Rationalist fiction isn't a subcategory of rational fiction, because rational fiction isn't a category to begin with but a threshold of internal consistency.

Most of the Rational fictions I've come across are Rationalist, so I will have to look at the ones you mentioned to see how they fit outside of Rationalist.
