If we just called this subreddit 'good fiction' then where would we get? Good is too easily confused with popular and I'm sure people have entire arguments on this very topic.

A lot of people are more interested in emotions and relationships as opposed to hard, logical coherent plots, intelligent characters, strategic situations and worldbuilding. Or they might just prefer quality of prose to plot. Rational fiction is like a 1960s era interceptor jet: primary emphasis on speed as opposed to agility, range, avionics, payload... There are a lot of things that make good fighter jets good and just like with literature we're primarily interested in one.
