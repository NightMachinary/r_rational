I'm talking about good writing in a very specific sense; ie. are the plot and characters logical and consistent. So I'm measuring a very specific attribute; obviously there are other things that can make a piece of writing good.

I don't think rational fiction is a genre, so much as a threshold for how free of plot holes something is.

I do think rationalist fiction is a genre though, since the focus is on a character's use of inductive reasoning to solve problems.
