Following the same logic: there are no movies about WW2, only action movies featuring the military.

You are confusing writing style with.. Genre, I think? What you are describing is in other terms an "organic story". The characters act and develop in a self consisting way without being forced by the author or the plot to take an action they would not to otherwise. Game of thrones is a good example of this, like you said.

Rational fiction is basically just fiction with a heavy focus on smart characters making smart decisions, written in an organic way.
