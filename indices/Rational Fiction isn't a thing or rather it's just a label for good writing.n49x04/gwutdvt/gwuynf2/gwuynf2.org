Clarification: /(I'm talking about good writing in Realism fiction in which the author is intentionally trying to create a consistent plot and consistent characters). I'm not talking about Magical Realism or any other genre in which the author intentionally creates inconsistency./

I do think Rationalist fiction exists though, ie. fiction that focuses heavily on a character's thinking processes and using inductive logic. I think Worth the Candle, Mother of Learning, Metropolitan Man, HPMOR would fall under that category. In fact most of the stories that are labelled as Rational Fiction are actually just Rationalist Fiction.

So I think it makes sense to get rid of Rational Fiction as a genre because it tends to be overly general and replace it with Rationalist Fiction which focuses on the transparency of character's motivations and decisions.
