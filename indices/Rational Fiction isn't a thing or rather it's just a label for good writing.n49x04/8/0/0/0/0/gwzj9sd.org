Ok, so I agree here, but I also don't really think the sidebar should be changed: even if in practice rational is not technically a genre, it acts so much like one that treating it as one is meaningful enough to continue doing so. the minimum height of rationality we here tend to enjoy is so much higher than the average, 95% of popular media does not fit in the classification; this effectively makes it a genre IMO.
