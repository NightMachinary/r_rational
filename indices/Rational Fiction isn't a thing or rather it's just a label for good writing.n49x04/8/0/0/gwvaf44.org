  So I think it makes sense to get rid of Rational Fiction as a genre because it tends to be overly general and replace it with Rationalist Fiction which focuses on the transparency of character's motivations and decisions.

I disagree with this: the designation of rational and rational*ist* is clear, understood and used correctly. The fictions you described *are* described as rationalist as well as rational. There are fictions like Beware Of Chicken, Cinnamon bun etc which I would call rational but not rationalist, and fiction like delve, a budding scientist in a fantasy world, etc which I would call rationalist but not rational.

These definitions are clear: rationalist is a genre, rational is a threshold on the bar of internal consistency, but because this is so unique often looks and acts like a genre. This is how the term is used on the sub and does not cause confusion. There is no point changing the word "rational fiction" to "how internally consistent a story is" because it is already defined and understood as that. And as I think you agree, we can't change the word to "good fiction" because this is false, its good fiction judged by one of the many metrics excluding all the exceptions, which is what we define as "rational fiction" already.
