I have been toying with various "Make death cheap" mechanics for somewhat game-like fantasy settings, could someone sanity check this one for me?;

The Rite Of The Pentacle. Five people chain their souls together, magically. As long as at least one of them is still living, this permits accelerated healing (if only one member is hurt, that person heals at five times normal speed, if they all are, it helps not at all, except healing is complete - you can grow back limbs, for example), and the resurrection of the body, as long as the surviving members have physical possession of at least most of the corpse (raising someone from a corpse missing a leg means that person spends months crippled)

This rite is common knowledge, and while expensive, not any /more/ expensive than kitting people out in proper plate - The guards of a prosperous city would certainly be pentacle-bonded.

Hilarious Side Effects:

The bound loose all sexual interest in people not in their pentacle. This is /also/ common knowledge so any all male pentacle is assumed to be a Theban Band , and the most common setup (2 women - Chosen from the most heroically stature farm girls the recruiters could track down, and 3 men) still causes lots of purile speculation. Not usually to their faces, mind. 4-1 setups, in either direction cause lots, and lots of snickering.

Your left eye gains a permanent pentacle in the iris Yes, eye patches are very popular among those who wish to sow doubt about their mortality.
