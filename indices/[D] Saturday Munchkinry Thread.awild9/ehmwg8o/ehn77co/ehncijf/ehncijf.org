His sees the future in which he sees the future. When he fought deku (the main character) he used his quirk and told Deku he would be on the ground at the end of the fight. He then used his quirk to dodge evey attack and at the end of the fight Deku was on the ground. It's the type of precognition where what you see is what will come to pass regardless of what you do.

I don't think he could use it on himself. He never uses a mirror to see his own future despite it being effective strategy. Even if we made it so he could physically make eye contact, though some gristly surgery (or a [[https://bokunoheroacademia.fandom.com/wiki/Warp_Gate][gate quirk]]), I don't think it would work. Quirks typically interact with the user differently to other people; [[https://bokunoheroacademia.fandom.com/wiki/Ochaco_Uraraka][gravity girl]] struggles to float herself despite being able to float much heavier objects and [[https://bokunoheroacademia.fandom.com/wiki/Minoru_Mineta][sticky ball haired dude]] bounces off his sticky balls rather than sticking to them.
