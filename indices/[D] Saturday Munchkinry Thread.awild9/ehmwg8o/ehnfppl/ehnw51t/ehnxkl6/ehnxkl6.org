That's fair, I don't know the setting that well. Still, you could probably get away with a friend winning a lesser prize in the lottery and then splitting it with you. That definitely makes things lot more difficult if everyone is going to know what you're doing though.

Although, I just looked it up and it seems that 20% of people in this world don't have quirks. This seems like a power that you would benefit from keeping a secret, so how hard would it be to just let people believe you are quirkless? You just need to win the lottery once and then I'm sure you could find other ways to make money that are less flashy and benefit from minor uses of the power.
