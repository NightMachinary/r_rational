You can get 44.7 meters away using the viewpoint to run, and you can travel through objects and fly. The intangibility and flying is huge in urban environments or anywhere with lots of cover.

Suicide sims: simulations don't need to survive, they can attack suicidally with explosives or just recklessness since the original will be appearing elsewhere. As long as it doesn't make where the original appears hazardous it's fine.

Infinite ammo: Your simulation can use limited resources for effect while you carry the real ones on for later. Expect very expensive and exotic weapons.

Memory theft: use your ability whenever possible so everyone around you only has 1/2 the time to figure out what's going on. Allies can further take advantage of the disorientation if prepared.

Secret A/B assasin: try to kill someone using A while in a sim, hide for 10s, have a sim try B... You don't even need to see it since the next sim can just come back if there last worked. The victim just gets damaged every 10s with no memory of the attacks.

Powers easy, stealing wealth is easy.

Countering: You need to be able to survive a 10s attack by this person, recognize the signs, then find and neutralize them during the downtimes while getting attacked by simulations every 10s without your knowledge. Without magic tracking or speed this seems impossible in cities unless you can cover the 45m teleport zone around them while surviving sim attacks.

An attack from outside a km works, but the mastermind should plan to avoid this. So they can't be bad enough that bombing 1045 meters all at once is worth killing them.
