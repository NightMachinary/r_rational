Continuing my [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/atwc86/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ehd4r18/?context=0][question from last week]], if you've got access to an Oracle who will give you one piece of binary information about the future or about reality, what is the highest value question you can ask?

If you want to discuss that overall question in this thread, feel free, but this is the aspect of it I'm most interested in.
