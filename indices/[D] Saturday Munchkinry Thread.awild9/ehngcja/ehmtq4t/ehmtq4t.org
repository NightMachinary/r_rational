*Mistborn Munchkinry Miniseries Part 12: Electrum*

Ok, week twelve of the mistborn munchkinry miniseries, for a general overview of the magic system, see [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9zz4sa/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ead595h/][part one]]. I strongly recommend reading the first part of that comment if you weren't here for the past weeks and aren't familiar with the mistborn setting. Parts 2 through 11 can be found here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a23pe3/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/eauwn90/][2]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a4be9x/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ebcx4eg/][3]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a6ftyl/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ebuo08h/][4]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a8lgsu/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ecbqhr8/][5]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/af85cz/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/edw9q7a/][6]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ahmsgc/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/eefzs0m/][7]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ak1kjr/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ef0o7jj/][8]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ametuf/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/eflf195/][9]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ar9jrc/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/eglnl2s/][10]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/atwc86/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/eh4l3jc/][11]]

/Spoiler note/: I will avoid things that I consider excessive spoilers, but the exact workings of the magic system are moderate spoilers themselves, so if you intend to read the books and are sensitive to spoilers you should probably skip this one.

This weeks metal is electrum. As always we're interested in what a electrum twinborn compounder can do, both here on earth (where they are the only one with this powerset) and in Era 2 Scadrial.

*Allomancy*

Allomantically, electrum allows you to see a tiny bit into your own future. As soon as you start burning electrum you see translucent image, called an atium shadow (atium is a different metal, don't worry about it) that is an exact duplicate of your body, except that the image moves ahead of your body. If you grab a cup, the image of your hand will reach the cup first and then your actual hand will follow behind it.

As a general rule in the cosmere, any method to retrieve information from the future does not take into account other information that will be retrieved from the future. That means that the initial shadow you see will be based on how you would act without having seen the shadow, but as soon as the image of the shadow reaches your brain that information exists in the present and your powers become able to use it. If this information would change what you're doing (say, you react in surprise instead of picking up the cup) a second atium shadow appears representing this new prediction.

Then of course this second prediction becomes part of the present and a third shadow pops up representing how you will act with the additional knowledge that the second shadow provides and so on and so on. You do not literally see infinite shadows because the magic has some concept of how similar shadows are to each other and if a new shadow would be too similar to an existing shadow it simply doesn't appear.

All of this happens immediately as the first image appears in the image processing part of your brain (before you've even had a chance to consciously become aware of the information) so for you the shadows all appear to spring into existence at the same time.

The allomancer can control how far ahead of the present the shadows move, but only up to an upper limit that depends on the allomancers power. Realistically you can't push them further than at most 2 or 3 seconds (and that is at the very upper limit of how powerful an allomancer can be).

The primary way electrum is used in the books is to throw of other people with precognition. The shadows that you see are the same shadows that others see if they use precognitive magic to predict your actions, so if you consistently act differently from what the shadows show you become effectively impossible to predict by others.

Another use case that is not much explored in the books (but confirmed to work by word of the author) is to use electrum to enhance your reaction time by immediately copying your shadows actions as soon as you see them happen. This takes a significant amount of practice and it doesn't work as well if your shadow leaves your field of vision (by, say, dodging backwards), but speeding up your reaction time by a full second or more is very significant.

*Precognition and Duralumin/Nicrosil*

Just to quickly adress this (major spoilers for Mistborn Era 1): There is a certain phenomena with atium shadows that if you push them far enough into the future the whole system breaks down and you get to see the future in the same way the gods themselves do, looking forward years or centuries instead of seconds. This only happened once under extremely unusual circumstances (the person in question was tied for second most powerful mistborn of all time and also had very strong ties with the person who just became the god powering allomancy and he still needed to burn a not-insignificant percentage of all remaining atium in the world alongside duralumin to get there) so I'm going to say that this is not something that can be replicated under normal circumstances. Nicrosil/duralumin enhanced electrum just lets you see a couple seconds further into the future at the cost of only being able to use your powers in short bursts.

*Feruchemy*

Feruchemically, electrum stores determination. While storing determination, the allomancer becomes lethargic, unable to fight akrasia or motivate themselves to do much of anything.

When tapping the resulting metalmind the feruchemist gains superhuman persistence, becoming able to devote themselves fully to boring, unpleasant or even painful tasks if they think those tasks help them achieve their long term goals.

At the extreme high end, tapping determination even allows a person to endure torture or do things like deliberately hold their breath until they pass out.
