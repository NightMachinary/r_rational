This is basically just the power of teleportation with cooldown, with the additional benefits of precognition and omniscience (of the surroundings, for 10s). This could be used to easily rob goods of high value and sell them on a black market. It could also be used to easily assassinate targets without trace.

If a criminal had this power, the only solution would be to trap them in a 1 km radius zone so that they can't teleport out of the area. One solution might be to trap them underground (with no access shafts or anything similar), say by luring them with something they want (me?). Of course, I would want to be well-shielded if I was a target, to guard against surprise attacks. A full-body bulletproof armor should suffice. Every inch of the underground bunker needs to also be covered with turrets which can detect someone and shoot them on sight.
