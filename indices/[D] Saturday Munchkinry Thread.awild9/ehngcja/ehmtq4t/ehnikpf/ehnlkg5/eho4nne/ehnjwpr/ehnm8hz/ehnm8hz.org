This is, in fact, based on my understanding of King Crimson from the most recent tv episode. (Reread that first sentence. â˜º) The explanations given in the reddit discussion thread for the episode just didn't make much sense, so I had to invent one for myself.

This /is/ Jojo we're talking about here though, so I'm sure the power will get even more convoluted as the story goes on.
