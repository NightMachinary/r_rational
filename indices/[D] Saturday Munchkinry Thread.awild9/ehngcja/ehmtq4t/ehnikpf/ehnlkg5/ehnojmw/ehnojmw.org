Yeah, without the memory loss, it would just appear to observers like teleportation which also erases your recent wounds. The show I based this on plays up the loss of memory as 'erasing time', but honestly it just seems like the biggest drawback of the power, because it broadcasts to everyone nearby that something supernatural is afoot.

Like suppose there was no memory loss. Then you can teleport into the fed's vault, shove a bar of gold down your pants, wait ten seconds, teleport out, and go melt down your haul.

But since everyone nearby had a mysterious bout of memory loss, they'll connect any future uses of your power to the gold thief and start tracking you down.

Luring the villain into a wide area death-trap is a good idea, albeit expensive to set up. The best I could come up with was somehow discretely planting a deadly device on the villain's person, then activating it right after they warp. But planting the device and surviving long enough to activate it is a difficult prospect.

In the show they do this, but instead of a bomb or something that would finish the fight, it's a magical turtle which sucks the villain into a pocket dimension. It buys them some time, but the villain is able to escape and come back within seconds.
