What if you had a supernatural power that could reliably substitute for creating such a test environment?

As an example: Itachi Uchiha, a character from the Naruto manga/anime possesses the supernatural chakra-fueled power of the Sharingan (which is a sort of special Eye mutations that give their clan exceptional superocular prowess and other types of supernatural chakra-based powers).

Itachi also has the Mangekyo Sharingan, which is an even more bullshit powerup. One of the techniques it allows the user to perform is the [[https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Tsukuyomi][Tsukuyomi]].

Some particularly noteworthy feats of that power are excerpted from the wiki:

"... After making eye contact with a target, Itachi Uchiha traps them in an illusion of his design. Through his unprecedented ability to alter targets' perception of time, he uses Tsukuyomi to subject victims to days' worth of torture in a matter of seconds; examples include continual stabbing or reliving traumatic events over and over..."

"... Itachi uses Tsukuyomi on Izumi Uchiha, causing her to live through decades of a happy life in the span of a few moments..."

So after trawling through fanfiction.net I found [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12408462/6/][this piece of gem]] among the Naruto fanfic fandom (it's barely nsfw in terms of description but there aren't any mention of explicit mature content!) and I saw this author munchkin the hell out of that power in a very machiavellian manner... (Start reading from the second scene cut.)

I don't know if the technique really is that powerful, whether it can be replicated in IRL, and whether there are any methods to preventing/blocking/avoiding/reversing such types of insidious 'natural' mind control/brainwashing.

Basically, I want to know how authentic is this method and if it is, are there any cure for this type of brainwashing?
