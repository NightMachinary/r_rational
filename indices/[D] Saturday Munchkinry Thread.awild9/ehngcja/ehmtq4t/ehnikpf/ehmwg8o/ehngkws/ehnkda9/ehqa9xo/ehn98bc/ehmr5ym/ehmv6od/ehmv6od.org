Reliably brainwash an average adult? That's not a thing. If it were, it would have been exploited for thousands of years and we'd see it in practice all over the world.

The closest we have to that is organized religion, which gets to exploit a ton of cognitive biases. Authority bias, availability cascade, the bandwagon effect, confirmation bias, courtesy bias, the illusion of control, the illusory truth effect, etc. Nonbelievers don't tend to argue to avoid upsetting the bandwagon, and tend to hint that their views are closer if not identical to the believers than they really are to maintain courtesy. Organized religions use various types of holy men as authority figures, and the constant repetition of information as if it is fact makes it seem like it really is a fact. It gives you a sense of greater control over your life than you really have, and it offers simple and easy-to-understand explanations for life that seem like they must be true.

Even with all that, you still have people being raised in religious families, being sent to religious schools, going to church every week, and still somehow ending up as nonbelievers. Religion may be pretty powerful stuff, but there's just no reliable way to make people believe things. Even the truth isn't a reliable way to make people believe, as you can see with flat earthers and anti-vaxxers.
