A group of humans are being hunted by a predator which can sense /negative emotions/. The exact definition of this is nebulous (and we can assume the group must also discover this through their interactions with the predator) but is for all intents and purposes closely aligned with the general folk idea of negative emotions (fear, anger, jealousy, disgust etc.). It does not judge /intent/, however, only emotions. The stronger the emotion, the easier it is for the predator to detect.

​

The predator is blind and can be outrun if it cannot detect someone. If it can, it cannot be outrun and cannot be overpowered.

​

The objective is to devise a reliable way to evade the predator without casualties.
