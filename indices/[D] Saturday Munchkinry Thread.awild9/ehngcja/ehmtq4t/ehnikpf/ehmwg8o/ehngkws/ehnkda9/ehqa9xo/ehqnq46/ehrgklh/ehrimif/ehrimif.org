Ageing, technically no, but even old pentacles are in implausibly good health, so they remain effective combat groups well into senior citizen status, and effective instructors until they have one foot in the grave.

The setting does have ways to not age, but it boils down to a: being a healing focused mage, and b:spending an hour each day doing the magical equivalent of wind-sprints. With every day you skip being permanently added on to your physiological age. An ancient witch looking like a 20 year old is a thing that happens, but it is a sign of /incredible/ personal discipline
