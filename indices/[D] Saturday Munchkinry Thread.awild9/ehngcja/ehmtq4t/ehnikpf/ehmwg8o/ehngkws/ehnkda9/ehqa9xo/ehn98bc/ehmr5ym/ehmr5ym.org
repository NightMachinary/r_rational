So...

How many years does it take to totally subjugate the mind of an average adult (18 years and above) into becoming absolutely dependant on you by using the solitary confinement brainwashing technique?

I'm curious if it can be done reliably and whether or not the victim can withstand/overcome the brainwashing?
