I suppose.

But as for the type of total mind control scenario I was thinking about, that type of scenario is too far-fetched and improbable for real life, right?

Then I suppose we can safely guess that it's a great thing it isn't realistic enough to matter.

Its not much but it's somewhat of a relief atleast.
