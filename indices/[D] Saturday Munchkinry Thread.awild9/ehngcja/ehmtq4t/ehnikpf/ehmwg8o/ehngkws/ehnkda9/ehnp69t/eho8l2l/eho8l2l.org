Well Buddhist monks that are practiced in mindfulness meditation should be able to fight it while keeping it blind. Non judgemental observation is a core principle to them, and even pain has a hard time causing them emotional change.

More generally if there's ever a chance to fight back against the predator it would be blinded if they can empathize hope over anger/vengeance.

Drugs: Use mind altering drugs to blind it. Depending on the sensitivity this might not be too bad. I know people who happily go on runs while drunk or high so they could probably get away. Anti-anxiety IV drugs might be a good fit?

Death Acceptance: If you believe death isn't a bad thing you can take away the emotions brought on by the predator itself, meaning it can't follow you if it's the only problem. (Might not work if you realize there's going to be a lot of pain leading up to death) Even better you could start a predator worshipping cult, death isn't good but death specifically by the predator is an honor etc.
