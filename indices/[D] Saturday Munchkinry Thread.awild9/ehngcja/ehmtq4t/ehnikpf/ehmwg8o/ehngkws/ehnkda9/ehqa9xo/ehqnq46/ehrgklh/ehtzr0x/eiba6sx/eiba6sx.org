It would make sense to keep your pentacle members physically separated so that it becomes harder to injure all 5 at once. Perhaps two neighboring cities could exchange two members of their pentacles, so that neither of them loses strength.

Optimally, you'd have five cities, with one guard from each pentacle in each city, but that could be both politically and romantically impractical.
