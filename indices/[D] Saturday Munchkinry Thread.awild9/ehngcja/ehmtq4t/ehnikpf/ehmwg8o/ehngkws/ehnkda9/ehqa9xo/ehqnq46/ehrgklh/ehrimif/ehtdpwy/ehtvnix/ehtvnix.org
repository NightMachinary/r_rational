1:No.

2:In minor matters, this is routine - a pentacle employed as town guards will very rarely all patrol together, because it is overkill, and carries a theoretical risk of Total Party Kill (.... very theoretical. The rite costs in the ball-park of five sets of white plate. The typical pentacleer is trained incredibly well, and also wearing white-plate. Killing five of them is not something any plausible gang of thugs is going to pull off.) but as a general insurance policy this is /not/ done, because if you are up against a threat which presents a plausible TPK risk - in a war, a major monster hunt, then you would almost certainly be unable to recover the bodies of a partial group that got wiped out anyway, so you send the entire team for maximum chance of victory.

3:.. in theory yes, but it requires that the person you want to recognize stands still, staring a fixed point while you examine their eyeball with a magnifying glass in a well lit room from 7 centimeters away at most. That is, very paranoid people have been known to use this to prove identity, and it is the standard way to prove 5 corpses are a complete set, but its not something you can do in the street.
