I think with this power it is less about the amount you teach and more about who you teach.

The main loop hole I see here is that while the requirement for raising your skill cap in a specific field is teaching someone who is or will be better than you in that field, it never says you have to teach them something to do with that field.

So if I email [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tate][John Tate]] explaining how to do [[https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Forum:Skyrim:Alchemy/Enchanting_Loop?useskin=oasis][the restoration alchemy glitch]] in Skyrim and he reads it, my maths skill cap is raised to genius level.

So I need to get into contact with as many geniuses is as many different fields as I can in order to teach them trivial things. Especially someone good at teaching. While doing that make a bunch of online tutorials on all the topics that I have top class skill caps in.
