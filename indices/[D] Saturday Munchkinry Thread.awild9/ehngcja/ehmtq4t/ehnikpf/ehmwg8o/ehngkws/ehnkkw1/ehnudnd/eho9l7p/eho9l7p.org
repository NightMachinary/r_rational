YouTube channel is focused and potentially effective, but not the best method I think, particularly early as you'll need popularity. The focus of them normally will also make it harder to diversify and targeting the people who can learn the most is hard as they're the least likely to be looking. So start by playing the long game. Your first goal will be finding some people fairly skilled but enough that you can still teach them something in their own fields, this is likely best done through obscure information in their field. Teach a brilliant programmer some quirks in a programming language, a mathematician some maths trick or obscure theory, a teacher some mostly unused model of teaching, whatever. The primary point is you'll want to be gathering some higher cap in a huge range of fields, no need to aim for the tops, but aim for at least degree level probably.

Simultaneously, you start working towards becoming an actual qualified teacher. Primary schooling is where you want to target, easily teach large amounts of information on a huge breadth of subjects as you're teaching people who are essentially forced to try learning and don't know much for the cynical view. You're also likely to get really good at it so the kids should be well off. This will ensure you can easily hit caps in pretty much everything. Kids have relatively meteoric rises in skills due to low baselines so the amount of learning delivered is easy, so the prior cap gathering is mostly to help get started cause their caps will also be tiny. However you can just maintain it, make money on the side using your newfound skills, keep getting progress in practically every field because kids are building up everything. Then you hit the rapid gains, the longer game, or you've started making connections at some point probably because you're highly skilled in dozens of fields.

You've now taught hundreds or thousands of children as a master in many fields, and they've spread into the world and started learning which will start pushing your caps back up. It's a slow positive feedback loop but it is one. Plus even if it's more focused you hopefully get to feel good about yourself, using your skills to help inspire and teach new generations to push science, the arts, sport, and anything they set their mind on by giving them a foundation that nobody else in the world could. Better the world, and the more they better it the better you get. Are you likely to wind up really shaking things up? Well, maybe. Your free time around it will be well used hopefully, and you are an expert.

Don't forget the self focused skills too while doing all this, like the skill of self motivation is the single most valuable skill you can possibly acquire. Lots of somewhat inwards focused skills that wind up invaluable.

Is it the best approach? Maybe not. It seems an easy way to keep maxed however, in a way that can hopefully leave you feeling good about yourself, while offering great long and short term potential.
