How to munchkin Night Eye's quirk from My Hero Academia.

[[https://bokunoheroacademia.fandom.com/wiki/Foresight][Foresight]] (予知, Yochi?): Sir Nighteye's Quirk activates by first touching a target and then making eye contact with them. Once these conditions have been met, Sir Nighteye gains the ability to see the entirety of the target's future, second by second, for one whole hour. Sir Nighteye sees the future like frames of a film, and can only see the target from a third-person perspective and sometimes their surroundings. Sir Nighteye can only activate his Quirk once per 24 hours and has been shown that the future he sees is 100% accurate. However recent events seem to suggest that quirks that alter time in some way can affect the accuracy of his quirk, possibly rendering the predicted outcomes moot, and/or void.

EDIT: more info

His sees the future in which he sees the future. When he fought deku (the main character) he used his quirk and told Deku he would be on the ground at the end of the fight. He then used his quirk to dodge evey attack and at the end of the fight Deku was on the ground. It's the type of precognition where what you see is what will come to pass regardless of what you do.

What ways could this be used and abused in a rational MHA setting?

What are some uses for it that work within the standard MHA world?
