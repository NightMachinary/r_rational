The most obvious exploit to me is as simple as using it to win the lottery. I just looked it up and buying lottery tickets cuts off by 15 minutes or less before the lottery drawing in some states so you can look into someone's future who you've told to watch the lottery. You said you can see the person but only sometimes their surroundings, so just have the person communicate the lottery numbers back to you as they see them on the television.

If not the lottery, it seems like there are a lot of ways to make money off of it. Play a poker game or some other such game of chance and see how the next hour is going to play out and have a massive advantage. You just need to have a friend as a bystander who can communicate exactly what's happening in the game in a way you can utilize effectively. Doing that once a day would quickly bring large profits.
