So his quirk points towards a deterministic universe, where only those with time altering quirks have choice?

Do his actions actively change what he sees if he's reacting to his quirk? For example if he uses it to predict a strike in a fight and dodge is the rest useless or does it update?

Can he use it on himself? Touch himself then look in a mirror? (If that doesn't work you'd have to test if one of his eyes looking into the other directly worked, nasty.)
