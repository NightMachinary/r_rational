I guess it's future-sight day in the Munchkinry thread, because I have a very /bizarre/ power to share as well.

Here's how the power works:

- When you activate the power, you experience a simulation of the immediate future.

- You can see the predicted paths of everything around you, moving in slow motion. Your own body is included in the simulation, and it moves as if it would have if you hadn't activated your power.

- You float around ghost-like within the simulation, moving your viewpoint wherever you like. (Top speed 10mph relative to your body.)

You then have two options:

- The first is to accept the predicted outcome. After ten seconds are predicted, the sim times out, and events happen exactly as foreseen. (Including your own predicted actions.)

- Alternatively, you can activate your secondary power, which imposes the state of the simulation onto the real world (within a kilometer), except that:\\
  a.) Memories aren't copied, and\\
  b.) Your body and anything on your person are teleported into the position of your observation viewpoint in the sim, rather than moving to their predicted positions.

- In either case, you can't activate your power until ten real-time seconds have passed since the previous activation.

--------------

Here's an example.

Let's say a mugger threatens you with a knife. You decide to try disarming them, and activate your power. You float outside of your body and watch yourself fail and get stabbed in slow motion. You don't like that outcome, so you float your perspective into a nearby building, and activate your secondary power.

You are now safe and sound inside the building. From the mugger's perspective, you just teleported away while they shifted position slightly. Everyone else within a kilometer has the experience of a few seconds of memory loss.

So:

How do you leverage this power for fun and profit?

(And for reverse munchkinry, say that you witness a criminal mastermind using this power in the act of committing attempted murder. You manage to escape, but the villain is now hunting you down. How do you defeat them or evade capture?)
