I'm assuming that OP is describing a standard [[https://qntm.org/models#sec5][Multiple History model]] of time travel.

In the process I described above, each successive jump is timed to 'split off' from a point /after/ the previous machine appeared, thus duplicating it across the set of timelines. So at the end, there are 25 separate timelines in which the machine from Timeline A spontaneously appears at 8:00. (and 24 with machine B, 23 with C, etc.)

[[/u/Izeinwinter]], was this the model you had in mind, or was it something more exotic?
