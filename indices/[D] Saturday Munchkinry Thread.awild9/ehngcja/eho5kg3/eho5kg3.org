A. If you decide being a ruler in the past is better than your present this is useful. Do research, get your tools, go back and conquer. You can also fix tragedies in a past by jumping back and changing them, but you will live in the aftermath not the longer term results.

B. Best case scenario: jump back to before my sentenced crime and prevent it. Letting you live in the most modern time without a problem. Unless the government would punish a future traveller for nonreal future crimes? Worst case: jump back to a lifetime before the forming of the government that sentenced you.

If you can jump geographic locations you can do other things, like a second in the past in another country, my primary goal would be staying as modern as possible without persecution.

Edit: You can use your other two jumps for do overs, the same time but now you've tried once or twice, or if you think you made a mistake picking your time.
