The Paradox-Proof Time Machine: A time traveler lands, with its occupant tied up in a straight-jacket with a timed lock, and announces its arrival with radio, flashing lights, and a loud-speaker system. The radio-burst, also includes a lot of data. The accompanying documentation - and the witness testimony of the hapless passenger, explains that you cannot travel to /your/ past, since your past did not include you arriving in a time machine, but, it is none-the-less possible to punt people into a past. From the point of view of the time-line you depart, you just disappear, never to be seen again, so timelines that invent timetravel independently do not tend to use it much, but the senders got a similar package centuries ago, and use copies of that machine very frequently to exile criminals, political opponents, and inconvenient paramours (The guy you got is this, last, category) because the cost of building one is less than keeping people in prison for years, and their government is not very nice.

Capabilities: Max load, 503 kilos, 3 cubic meters. Up to 3 jumps into the past on internal charge, (these were set to auto-trigger on hostile external environment on the exile ship) All jumps are irreversible. It can be recharged, but it eats a mega-watt hour per jump.

Now, obviously, it gets taken apart, and things like its batteries are a major industrial revolution.

Things to munchkin: A: What is this thing good for, other than getting rid of the inconvenient without explicitly getting blood on your hands?

B: You have been judicially sentenced to chrono-exile. You can pick the length of the initial jump, and you may bring anything that fits payload constraints, as long as you can pay for it out of your own resources. What do you bring?
