Espionage: Use the ability inconspicuously to near perfectly follow someone for the next hour. Do it to a guard about to go to work, or anyone who uses a password to get it.

1 hour test / Perfecting Plan: Make a plan with an ally, then use there quirk to see if the next hour goes well. If not, stop them and make a new plan with the info you've gained. You can try variations on a plan every day without targets knowing this way.

Best/Worst Idea: Free strong individuals from prison by spying on guards. If their sign in process is less than an hour you can learn it, and if you can't do it yourself get the info to others who can. You could use this and a certain shapeshifter to try to free a quirk combiner, for either profit or doom.
