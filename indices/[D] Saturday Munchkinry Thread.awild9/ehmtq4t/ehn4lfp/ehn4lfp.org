Feruchemy: Stock and sleep: store all your determination prior to sleeping to stock up. This also might reduce your stress prior to sleeping? Risky if you might be attacked in the night or have a natural disasters happen.

10 minute abs: tap stores for short amounts of very high intensity workouts. Olympic athletes can never give 100%, but you can at will. (Maybe. Depending on willpower vs adrenaline etc.) There's solid research for "5 minute workouts", five minutes of hard intensity along with with 25 minutes of warm up and cool down, which would be perfect for this.

Is there a point where you can store so much that you can't muster the will to tap? If not you can store your determination when waiting for something into the "too lazy to leave" zone then tap when it's time.

Side note: holding your breath until you pass out is doable by a lot of college level swimmers and I assume free divers without too much mental stress. It has a lot more to do with what you get used to than sheer willpower, you get used to ignoring the burning and tightening sensations from training so taking it further is more of a fear/practicality problem than willpower.
