My first thought would be to get a couple in the group to run in opposite directions, ideally with cellphone contact if they're not in the usual horror movie blackout zone. Make it clear to them that the longer they go without noticing the monster, the more likely it's going for their partner instead. That way, they should hopefully alternate between strongly negative emotions of concern for their partner when the predator is distant and the relief of knowing they're the ones being targeted when it's close, causing it to bounce back and forth between them without reaching either.

Of course, this assumes the rest of the group is capable of staying positive, and that the couple is in love: if there are relationship complications, this would be a bad way of finding out!
