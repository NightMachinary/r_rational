Cannibalism becomes a very effective strategy in siege warfare, if that is still a thing in your setting. Why pack a massive store of food when you can just have your guards eat each other and heal back the meat. Thanks to the Pentacle healing you don't even have to worry about the I'llness cannibalism normally causes.

Dose the Pentacle heal damage you received before you under took the rite? What about inborn disabilitys, both mental and physical?

I think that the rite would be quite good as a binding marriage vow. It removes the desire to cheat as long as you make sure to geld the other three members of the Pentacle.

A little hack I see is over time chopping bits of a Pentacle member and assembling a second body with those bits. Then if that Pentacle member ever gets completely destroyed they can still be rased back to life useing the second corpse you created earlier.
