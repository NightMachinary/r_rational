The healing is not super fast - Yes, people who are starving have been known to draw straws, eat a leg, and grow it back over the summer, but.. Not as plan a. That is plan Z. Somewhere /after/ you have used Strongly Advised Against summoning rites and eaten demon stake until people started spouting scales.

.. That is technically possible, but would involve at least a decade of surgeries and recoveries (and access to a magical freezer.) So, more likely to be a grisly rumor about a particular group than something anyone has actually done. Thanks for the idea though. Having good local conspiracy theories lends depth.

The people who care about binding marriage wows (high nobility) usually have more direct magics to that end (Testing bloodlines is relatively trivial) or just do not have any taboos against polygamy.
