If I teach Einstein something about physics, will I become equal to Einstein in physics ability even if that one fact is the only thing about physics I know? In general, will I acquire the /entirety/ of a student's skill in a field irrespective of how much I have advanced it?

Also, do I increase in skill even if my student increases in skill /after/ I have already taught them?
