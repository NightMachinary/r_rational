the ultimate nuke-proof panic room! sure, your stuck in the past you went to, but you get to bring gold and aim for a pleasant decade. and its a LOT better than staying in a timeline where everyone dies. as a plus, you also bring news of what horrors the future could hold, so that it can be avoided.

also: waste disposal. this sounds like the easiest unethical way to dispose of nuclear waste. just drop it somewhere unpopulated... like a nuclear test sight on the day of the test. or far enough back in time that it will decay before it can matter. (SURPRISE! shouts the box, a moment before the asteroid kills the dinosaurs)

ultimately, this time machine is a way to effectively destroy matter/energy. start testing deep time, to see if there is a more distant point in time that can bypass the restriction (think billions of years).
