Attempts at using it for duping reliably fail, not that anyone really knows why, since it did not come with a explanation of the physics.

However, they fail because it actively avoids timelines it (or its passengers!) exists in. All jumps back land you in an Everett branch you are not from, but short jumps go sideways in time more than anything else, which is why features like "Jump again if the outside is hostile" exist - Its to make landing in the ashes of a Final War more survivable.
