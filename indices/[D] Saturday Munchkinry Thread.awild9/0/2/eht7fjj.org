I can just go back a few years in time to before the first time machine showed up, and I'd pack the machine full of economic datasets and cutting edge research material.

I have some contacts in the electricity distribution industry, and recharging the machine takes less energy than a typical household uses in a year, so it should be pretty easy to just use on repeat and make us super rich.

One application would be item duplication by sending the machine a short distance into the past.

Here's the idea:

Timeline A: You send Machine A 8 hours into the past with a bar of gold and a note at 3pm.

Timeline B: Machine A appears at 8:00. You send Machine B back 7 hours and 50 minutes.

Timeline C: Machine A appears at 8:00. Machine B appears at 8:10. You send Machine C 7 hours, 40 minutes back in time.

Timeline D: A appears at 8:00, B appears at 8:10, C appears at 8:20. Send Machine D back 7 hours, 30 minutes.

...

If the process stops at Z, then timeline Z has 26 time machines and 26 bars of gold.

The average timeline has 12.5 of each. Sure there's that one timeline that just loses the machine, but they have some valuable data, so they'll be fine. There are ways to give the final timeline arbitrarily large weight, but I don't want to get into that deep time cosmic horror stuff, so any iteration procedures we design will have finite cutoffs.

I could also duplicate myself by hopping in the initial Machine A. That way I wouldn't need to be held accountable for the lost gold. But if I do decide to duplicate myself, there's going to be at most 3 copies per universe. I've seen children's television; I know how clones can get out of hand.
