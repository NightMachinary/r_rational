I did a good search for least useful superpowers and one of the suggestions was perfect hindsight. I think the idea it isn't great to know exactly how you screwed up after the fact but actually this seems really useful. Knowing the exact probabilities for swing number 22 to hit. Knowing exactly which muscles should have been trained more to avoid said blast. Knowing exactly how you should have positions. And the ability to adopt greatly through a fight by knowing why certain things aren't working.
