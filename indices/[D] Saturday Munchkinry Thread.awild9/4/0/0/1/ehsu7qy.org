If I understand how this is structured, the best approach is to seek out the most talented available student and help them with some trivial insight (setting your cap) then teach basics to wide audiences of beginners to reach that cap.

So yes, probably a youtube channel. I think the most efficient form is to run a talkshow where you invite experts on to help explain their work to a beginner audience. If you can give your expert any insights during the show, that sets the cap, then the broadcast gets you to the cap. You should be able to easily find insights to share once you've built up a few fields, especially if you learn widely cross-applicable skills like statistics or critical theory.

For bootstrapping the skill, being a TA for intro classes in a wide variety of fields is an easily obtainable way to do that in miniature.
