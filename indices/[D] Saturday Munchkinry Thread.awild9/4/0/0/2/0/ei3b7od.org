No. The fields are not super narrowly defined, if you teach a physicist better ways to do fluid dynamics simulations (and that is useful to the work of that physicist), it will count, and generally speaking, teaching relevant applied math will work for any of the hard sciences, but deboning a chicken gets you the skill cap(s) that person has for cooking, slaughtering, and other such things.
