I don't know of any empirical evidence of methods to subjugate the mind of adults. As [[/u/Norseman2]] points out we would expect the probability of seeing such a method in widespread use to be higher if it existed so the lack of such well-known methods to be weak evidence against their existence.

There's also little evidence that it's possible to completely subjugate the mind of even a child given with how many problems parents and juvenile detention facilities have with that exact problem. And given that neuroplasticity decreases over time I think you should start here before considering adults.

Various fictions have posed speculations about such a thing being possible but that doesn't mean that it actually exists.
