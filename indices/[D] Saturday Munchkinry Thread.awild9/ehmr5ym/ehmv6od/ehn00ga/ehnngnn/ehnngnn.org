On the topic of Tsukuyomi, you could potentially create illusionary loops modeled after reality, tweaked a bit every loop so they aren't predictable, and punish the victim every time they don't behave as desired in the simulation (or if they try to probe the illusion to check if it's reality or not). In canon, Tsukuyomi tends to lead to unconsciousness once it ends, but if it didn't, the victim might not be able to tell that the illusion ended and may comply with whatever they were tortured into (virtual reality torture is also probably leagues more effective than the traditional sort).

We could just imagine this as virtual reality brainwashing. For example, say part of the simulation is them "unplugging" from the VR interface to make them think they escaped or that seeking therapy to help them with the brainwashing is also part of the simulation. Basically any method that could be used to counter the brainwashing could be included as part of the brainwashing procedure.
