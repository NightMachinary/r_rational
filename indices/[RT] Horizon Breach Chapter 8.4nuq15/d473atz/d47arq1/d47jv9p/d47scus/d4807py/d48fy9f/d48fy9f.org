Okay. I still have some thoughts on the subject of Elder Tale that you may want to consider, but in Elder Tale one of the issues was the increase in monster spawn rates and their invasions of LH's home city, right?

I'm wondering, with the introduction of mana, etc, if monsters wouldn't begin spawning like they did in ET, or if local fauna and wildlife would begin to be treated like in ET. This could eventually lead to things like consistent raids from (dire) wolves which take out hunters/ranchers. You mentioned a Genius jumping the portal, but I can't help but think that Monsters would actually become a recurring thing.

Anyway, I think I'm going to write a chapter for my own story and see how that goes one of these days.
