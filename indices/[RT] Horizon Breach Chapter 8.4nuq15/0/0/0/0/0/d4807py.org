People of the land get the same perks as adventurers, but with one quarter the xp gain and no respawns, making it extremely risky to grind XP. People on earth are treated basically the same, but they don't even have the luxury of easily available monsters.

So most people on earth won't choose to get kickass magic skills for the same reason most Landers don't-- it's inconvenient, risky, and painful.
