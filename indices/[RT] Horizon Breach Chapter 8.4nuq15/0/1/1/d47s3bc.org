Yeah, be careful- if i was in the LH universe and my kid returned from LH, i wouldnt even mention school for at least a few days.

And, as an adventurer, if i returned to the human world with all of my powers intact, work/school wouldn't even be a thing for me any more. I'd fight with my parents and even blow them off-what are they gonna do?
