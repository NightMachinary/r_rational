  But, if the transformation to adventurer has made EVERYTHING more efficient, then effectively every single adventurer can manage a lot more data at the same time, and efficiently analyze a huge amount of information. Which does make them smarter, just for the fact that every kind of thought and analysis they are capable of has become way more efficient. Efficient.

That's true, but you seem to be overestimating the degree to which adventurers get a boost.

The absolute fastest feat in the anime that requires some measure of thinking is Nyanta and Shiroe making a combo with .01 second precision.

That sounds incredibly impressive, but consider this: At 120 beats per minute, sixteenth notes are .125 seconds apiece. Your average Jazz musician playing swing notes is going to play sub-.1 second notes chained to each other. If there's more than .05 seconds of variation, they're going to sound out of time.

So your average Jazz musician can consistently act within .05 seconds, for minutes at a time, either reading sheet music or improvising. And that's at 120 BPM.

Your virtuoso concert pianist is going to lay down 36th notes at much higher tempos

Shiroe and Nyanta pulled it off /once,/ and Nyanta is a very high level specimen of one of the fastest classes in the game. And it's not like they just suddenly gained that ability-- they played together for years, practicing their timing.

The fastest feat in my fic is Minori blinking her spell off and on within (about) .07 seconds. I can turn an electronic stopwatch off and on in about .14 seconds. Minori obviously is faster than a regular human, especially since this is her first time trying this, but even she doesn't get the timing perfectly.

So I'd estimate that, in the anime (don't know about the LN) the maximum speedup adventurers get is about 2x, when they're really really focused, and even then only for brief periods of time.

There's obviously some speedup involved for adventurers to move as quickly as they do (even though abilities work a little on autopilot), but I doubt their regular experience of time is that much more than 1 to 1.

  But, dunno, even if his parents are so obsessed with school, it's really weird that they'd push for it within hours of meeting their son that has been missing for years and was thought dead...

You know, you have a point. How does moving back the last part to the end of the next chapter sound? Content won't be changed much (except to acknowledge it happens later) but I think it would seem more believable.
