  Martial artists think quickly, but that doesn't necessarily make them good, for example, particle physisists.

Are you referring to real life martial artists? If yes, then no, they don't technically think faster. It's just that with practice most of the processing (for any activity) becomes hardwired as the neural connections adapt, which makes them much more efficient and require less mental capacity.

But, if the transformation to adventurer has made EVERYTHING more efficient, then effectively every single adventurer can manage a lot more data at the same time, and efficiently analyze a huge amount of information. Which does make them smarter, just for the fact that every kind of thought and analysis they are capable of has become way more efficient. Efficient.

  That being said, I think you make a good point as far as both minori's and shoryu's parent's pushing for school. For shoryu's mom as I'm charachterizing her, it's in charachter, but not so much for Minori's parents, so I think I'll go back and edit Minori's conversation.

Interesting, I'll check it up again afterwards then. But, dunno, even if his parents are so obsessed with school, it's really weird that they'd push for it within hours of meeting their son that has been missing for years and was thought dead...

And again, as said above, it's weird that he'd just go with it so easily, considering how independent he had to become to be successful in LH.
