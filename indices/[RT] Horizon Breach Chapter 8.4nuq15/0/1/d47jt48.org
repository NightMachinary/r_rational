To clarify, adventurers get better reflexes/processing speed, but aren't actually any smarter than before. Martial artists think quickly, but that doesn't necessarily make them good, for example, particle physisists.

That being said, I think you make a good point as far as both minori's and shoryu's parent's pushing for school. For shoryu's mom as I'm charachterizing her, it's in charachter, but not so much for Minori's parents, so I think I'll go back and edit Minori's conversation.
