Oh dang, thanks for the reply.

I read some more, had to skip the marriage day chapter... Aaaaand the nazi one. Mostly in it to see Lawrence get his comeuppance now.

Thanks for a gripping story, even if I can't stomach all of it. Too much actual holocaust and rape happening right now for me to be comfortable reading fiction about it.
