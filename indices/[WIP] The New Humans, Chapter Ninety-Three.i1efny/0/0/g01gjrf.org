Hi, the author here. I apologize if any of my writing upset you, but I am flattered you finished book one.

>! !< >! So, author here. Breakdown of the second book. The kids slowly realise just how horrible the Institute is over the course of the volume, and eventually come to rebel after Lawrence secretly murders a student for having powers he doesn't approve of, which drives Zywie away, and leads to her reporting Lawrence to Tim Valour. The kids straight up take over the school, but some are killed during a government raid, with the rest being scattered to the winds. The third book covers them figuring out what to do, and eventually building a new community. Just noting, we do actually see a depiction of a "Married Day". It's not explicit, but I would consider it disturbing. If you want to skip it, it's chapter Twenty-Four. !<
