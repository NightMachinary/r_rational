Hey there, started reading this and got to the end of book one. Started picking up on the hints but desperately didn't want them to be true.

I'd really like to keep reading, but I'm just completely sickened by the concepts involved. I'm fully asking if anyone would mind spoiling the second book for me, to see if I could stomach still reading it.
