There's a bigger difference in tone than just "comedic versus serious." In the original, Harry is practically sociopathic and Professor McGonagall is... idk, inconsistent? She goes back and forth between submissive and authoritative. Their personalities have been smoothed out.

That's why I'm curious about the extent of the editing, because there are a lot of people who base their opinion of HPMOR on the fact that they read the first 10 or 20 chapters 5 years ago or more, and I'm wondering if... eh, I'm just going to bite the bullet in a month or three (whenever I next reread HPMOR again) and switch back and forth paragraph by paragraph until I hit Chapter 17 (I'm pretty sure that's the last chapter that'll have been altered since that's the last chapter that's been Britpicked).

I left this comment sitting here for a while and actually started doing that, and found the first difference:

#+begin_quote
  The funny thing was, he /ought/ to have agreed with Dad.
#+end_quote

Versus:

#+begin_quote
  The funny thing was, he /should/ have agreed with Dad.
#+end_quote

Found another:

#+begin_quote
  It ought to have been an open-and-shut case for Mum joking, lying or being insane, in ascending order of awfulness.
#+end_quote

Versus:

#+begin_quote
  It should have been a clean case for Mum joking, lying or being insane, in ascending order of awfulness.
#+end_quote

And /another/:

#+begin_quote
  Harry gave a mental shrug to himself.
#+end_quote

Versus:

#+begin_quote
  Harry mentally shrugged.
#+end_quote

So yeah, I'm not going to document all the sentence-level changes like these (not publicly, anyway), but if I find any other whole scenes that have been significantly altered/rewritten, I'll make a note of them.
