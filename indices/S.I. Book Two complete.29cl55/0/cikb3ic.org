I really like the project so far. I get the same vibe from it as with "Rapture of the Nerds", "Accelerando" and other books I can't recall right now. In all, the protagonist stumbles through a strange hodgepodge world where everything is happening everywhere at once, where whole plot threads open and close again, sometimes within the same paragraph. I guess that could be a danger with this kind of narrative: The main thread can struggle to shine through all that's happening.

Two things: 1.) Is S.I. the final, official title? You know, renaming a TvTropes page would be so annoying. 2.) I always imagine Bunny much like the rabbit-person from Overgrowth. Is that visually accurate?
