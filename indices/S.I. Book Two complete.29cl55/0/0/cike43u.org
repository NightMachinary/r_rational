  The main thread can struggle to shine through all that's happening.

It's an issue I've been aware of since before I started writing, when I was just planning a simple road trip through various Adventure Towns. (Would you believe I actually did intend for Bunny to head straight in the direction of Phoenix, instead of, um, pretty much the exact opposite? :) )

  Is S.I. the final, official title?
#+end_quote

It stands for a number of things relevant to the story (Self-Important, Self-Indulgent, Signal Integrity, System International, Science & Industry, etc), I haven't thought of a better title in a month, and nobody's made any suggestions - so it seems likely to stick.

  a TvTropes page
#+end_quote

Anyone who wants to put one up, let me know, so I can stick up at least a placeholder page at a permanent address.

  the rabbit-person from Overgrowth. Is that visually accurate?
#+end_quote

I haven't paid attention to that one since playing with Lugaru a few years back, but after a quick Google Images search, it seems pretty close.
