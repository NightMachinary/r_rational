I haven't decided yet.

For comparison, I'd originally planned for the chapter I'm in the middle of writing to focus on a certain topic; but a minor detail I was planning on covering in about a paragraph has ballooned to take over the whole chapter for itself, and the protagonist is now making plans I wasn't expecting her to make.
