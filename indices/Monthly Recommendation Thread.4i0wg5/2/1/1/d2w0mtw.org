As an important note: I have read one other HP fic with a fantastic romance arc (and I suppose some dark-ish style magic). In fact, It might be the most "rational" romance focused story I've ever read and I highly recommend it. It was months ago when I came across it, and I cant remember its name, but It's an OC focused fic following a muggleborn Ravenclaw girl and a Slytherin boy with Veela heritage.

Tons of "communication and compromise are vital to a relationship" stuff and realistic and legitimately tense relationship conflicts. Manages to explore the wizard/muggle culture clash, wizarding politics, and consent incredibly maturely. If anyone recognizes which fic I'm talking about, I'd love to be reminded which is was.
