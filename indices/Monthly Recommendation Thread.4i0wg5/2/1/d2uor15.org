This is the funniest summary I've read in a long time.

From my own archive, the most rational romance fics are

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5623923/1/The-Paladin-Protocol][Paladin Protocol]] - /Big Bang Theory/ with less nerd-blackface

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11446957/1/A-Cadmean-Victory][Cadmean Victory]] - the only /Harry Potter/ fic with both dark magic and a romance arc worth reading. Really, really well written too.
