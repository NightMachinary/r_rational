If i remember correctly the best part about people lie was the interactions between hinata sasuke and naruto. Which were done extremely well. Also similarly to time braid it took some liberties with the setting that made it far less predictable and far more interesting. Having said that as opposed to time braid it had significantly less of an idea what to do with said setting and was never truly completed.

But it does end on a nice note, so would still say that anyone that liked the 3 member dynamic should give this one a read.
