Further recommendations!

/Friendship is Optimal/ is certainly excellent, but the standard qualification is that if you take issue with the writing, you should instead just read [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/69770/friendship-is-optimal-caelum-est-conterrens][/Caelum est Conterrens/]].

If that isn't your cup of tea either, one of my favorite works of fanfiction is [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/109290/the-reign-of-queen-twilight-sparkle][/The Reign of Queen Twilight Sparkle/]], which is perfectly readable on its own if you're very intent on murderous overlords and thus unwilling to read the prequel, ([[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/67362/hard-reset][/Hard Reset/]]).
