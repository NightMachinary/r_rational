Yeah, in /Groundhog Day/ and /The Best Night Ever/ both at the end the protagonists realize that munckining is meaningless/pointless and "getting the girl" is what matters. As if in /Mother of Learning/ it turned out that the point of the loop was not about the primordial, but about making Zorian appreciate and fall in love with Akoja (his forced date from the first iteration).
