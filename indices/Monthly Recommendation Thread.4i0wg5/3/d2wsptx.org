On the video game front, I'd like to link an old game: [[https://www.gog.com/game/master_of_magic][Master of Magic]] (The link goes to GOG where you can buy it. Alternatively, you can find a [[http://www.myabandonware.com/game/master-of-magic-21t#download][DOSBox version]] if you're on Mac.)

If you read the reviews you will see a steady stream of "Best fantasy 4X game ever" and similar.

Want to know more? Take Civilization and cross it with Magic: the Gathering. Five color-themed schools of magic, hundreds of spells, dozens of creatures, fourteen races with a dozen or more units each, two worlds (Arcanus and Myrror) to explore...there's more replay value than you will ever be able to use up. Among the strategies you could try:

- Slings and Arrows: Endless hordes of happy little hobbit slingers!
- Hero Hit Team: Heroes with artifacts that let them rain down fire and destruction!
- Black Hearts: Shadow Demons or Wraiths: cast them early, cast them often, kill everything that moves.

There's tons more.

CONS: The game was made in 1994 so the graphics and music are awful by modern standards. The AI also isn't as good as one would like.

Aside from those, this is an amazing game.
