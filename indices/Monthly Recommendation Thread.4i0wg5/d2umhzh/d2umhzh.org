[[https://omatranslations.com/table-of-contents-wmw/][Warlock of the Magus World]] is quite good if you want a story with a ruthless, morally ambiguous protagonist who's out for nothing but his own ends. It does have a few unexplained -at least at the point that I'm at- parts fundamental to the story, mostly related to the MC's reincarnation, and the fact he gets his AI chip in this next world. But it does a great job at having a sensible protagonist who doesn't go out of his way to create trouble for no reason, who takes into account whether a certain course of action will reveal his secrets, and a few other things. The main character is basically a younger Quirrelmort, although a little worse in the planning department and with the added bullshit of AI to cheat his way to the top. It's not for everyone, though, so if you've read until he's enrolled in the school and you're not enjoying it, then just drop it.
