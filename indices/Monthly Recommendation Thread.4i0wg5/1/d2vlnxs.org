Probably one of my favorite video games of all time is METAL GEAR RISING: REVENGEANCE [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op8mjKZxccM][(trailer)]].

You can buy it for console (PS3/360) or PC. I played it on PC using a gamepad (which works better than a mouse/keyboard for this I think). It's available on Steam here: [[http://store.steampowered.com/app/235460/]]

Yes that is an all caps name, for an ALL CAPS GAME. Is REVENGEANCE a word? No, but sometimes... in a world seeped in REVENGE, can man Rise above VENGEANCE?

First off, watch the trailer: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op8mjKZxccM]]

Now that you're done shitting yourself with how awesome this game is, buy it. It's on Steam, and also available for Xbox 360 and PS3. Are you not already buying it? Not convinced by its greatness? Watch mission 1 then:

REVENGEANCE is like 90% boss fights, sweet sicknasty cutscenes, and slashing things with swords. Every design decision in this game was made in pursuit of the goal of "BE AS AWESOME AS POSSIBLE" (and yes, that is in all caps, like the name of this game). For example, literally everything. That's right, the entire game is an example of itself! The pacing of the game is turned up to 11/10, 100% of the time, with occasional breaks to let you catch your breath. Every cutscene is sweet. Every fight is amazing. The boss fights are awesome and when the bosses enter their final form the music (which is btw super awesome) gets extra hardcore. Every moment of this game is a dopamine rush. It's kinda exhausting in a way, and after playing it, other games seem shallow and meaningless in comparison. Can you really play something as slow-paced as Skyrim after living the AWESOME that is REVENGEANCE?

There's lots of little things too besides just the score. Like, the way you move around is well-designed, and the game designers went out of their way to make things convenient. You have infinite sprinting, no stupid stamina bars. You can slash and hack as much as you want, and instead of mp your mechanic for doing sweet things is either meter (which you can build up and then expend for bullet time swordslashing) or enemy damage. Weak enemies are susceptible to awesome finishing moves. The actual cutting, stabbing, and quicktime actions are super fun. The music and look of the game pump you up. This is a game meant for people who want to, for a time, live life in ALL CAPS.

If you get this game for PC, btw, make sure to play it with your gamepad and not mouse/keyboard. It plays much better that way.

I showed this game to a mixed audience of gamers and non-gamers and everyone came away thinking it was awesome. Everyone took turns playing and had fun. A game that's 90% cutscenes, bossfights, and sweet sword-swinging action with over the top music, sound, and amazing graphics is hard to beat. Of 5 people in the room with me, two went and bought the game the next day.

I have only one negative thing to say about this game (having played through about a third of it): after you play this game, other games become but a pale shadow of the true gaming experience. Honestly, this game ruins you for other games. It's THAT GOOD. This game leaves them all behind. Shit, the OST alone blows away so many game OSTs it's unreal.

Here's one song from an early boss fight: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RlSgnpLbro]]

Also most bosses have their own unique boss fight music and the lyrics reflect that boss's life or inner life because that's more awesome and this game thrives on awesomeness

If you don't want to buy this game after the trailer, the OST, and watching mission one, I feel sorry for you, to lead such a gray and sad life. That being said, maybe it's the right choice. For like, weeks, all other video games were ruined for me after playing this game. I literally didn't play The Witcher III because every moment I spent in that game I was like "wow, this game is slow, boring, and unexciting compared to REVENGEANCE" and it was true.
