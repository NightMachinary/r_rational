The Company novels by Kage Baker are pretty strange but interesting time-travel romances that I quite enjoyed. First book is In The Garden of Iden. The books don't stand alone all that well, but as a series they're pretty decent.

Kage Baker's best single work is Anvil of the World, and it is really excellent but not a romance in any way.
