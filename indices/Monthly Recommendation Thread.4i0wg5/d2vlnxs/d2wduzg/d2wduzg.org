To add on to this, the game has the best cutting system in all the world, literary any thing that can be cut (props, people, some buildings) can be cut in the exact place you want in as many possible pieces you can see with your eye, and then you can cut those pieces until the game cant render them anymore and your CUT NUMBERS (game counts cuts and gives more points for bigger number) rise into the hundreds.

Its true what Blazing said, other games after MGR feel slow, tedious and overall weak. On the plus side the full game has several difficulty levels, an OK parry system you can master for no damage experience, as well as buttload of challenge arenas.

The PC version GOES EVEN BEYOND THAT and includes the DLC campaigns for the BRAZILIAN SAMURAI an CYBORG DOG, who can also cut shit into infinity.

For added bonus, comple a certain mission and unlock a mariachi poncho and sombrero combo to wear during gameplay.

The other downside I can think of is the enemy count. That is to say there isn't enough of them to cut up.
