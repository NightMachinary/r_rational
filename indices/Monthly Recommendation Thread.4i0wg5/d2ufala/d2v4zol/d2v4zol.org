I figured I'd elaborate: the prologue describes a group of powerful characters who are leading a city in a siege defence, and their plans for keeping the city together after the war. The Great Galavar is mostly backstory for the main leader of that city.

The characterisations are great, and very diverse. Galavar is the [[/r/rational]] standard main character - incredibly smart guy winning everyone over with his elaborate plans; but the rest of the people are very different. It reads very well.
