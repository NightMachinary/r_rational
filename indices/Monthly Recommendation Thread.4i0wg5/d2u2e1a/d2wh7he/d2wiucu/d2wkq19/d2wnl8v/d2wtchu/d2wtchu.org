  Here we have a good exhibit of a Carrion Lord worshipper: perfectly willing to subjugate others for his own ends, and yet hypocritical enough to claim moral superiority while doing it. You'd think they'd at least be honest enough not to pretend they're the good guys while throwing around mind-rape threats, but no.

A) Glad you can see the humor in WH40K.

B) >implying I actually believe in the Imperial Creed, especially over the Imperial Truth.

  Since we're on the topic of WH40k goodness (and so this post isn't completely off topic), I'm going to point people at Thousand Shinji and Shinji and Warhammer40k. Neither of them would probably qualify as good by my current standards, but they were the first two fanfics I've ever read and I enjoyed them to ridiculous degree back then.

OMFG, I love S&WH40K! God I wish it would fucking get back to fucking updating again instead of doing that from-the-start rewrite!
