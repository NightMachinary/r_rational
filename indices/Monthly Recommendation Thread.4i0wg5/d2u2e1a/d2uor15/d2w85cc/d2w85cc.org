I just can't get into Cadmean Victory. It has all these annoying cliches, which crop up constantly:

- Studying for one summer is enough for Harry to not only catch up to Hermione, but effortlessly surpass her in most subjects.
- Harry is naturally capable of using some kind of powerful battle conjuration without any training. Salazar Slytherin couldn't use it lightly in his prime, but Harry is capable of casting it with zero training. He manages it one time under pressure, which completely exhausts him, but after that he has no trouble repeating the feat and not suffering significant exhaustion.
- There is a portrait of Salazar Slytherin in the chamber of secrets, and he immediately recognises Harry as his heir and commits to helping him. There is a handy time turner nearby and of course there is a bunch of manuals about secret powerful magic.
- Harry is the first wizard ever to think of summoning a swarm of butterflies to tank the killing curse for him.
- Somehow Harry is the only male in the student body, who is not affected by the Veela.

And that's just in the first six chapters out of a hundred. Seriously, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11669575/1/For-Love-of-Magic][For Love of Magic]] was easier to handle. At least there Harry creates his advantages by doing something fairly unorthodox, instead of suddenly just becoming naturally special and better than his peers after his third year, or stumbling upon secret chambers full of powerful advisors, artefacts and grimoires. I can handle a certain amount of cliches as long as there is /something/ new, but this Cadmean Victory is just piling them one by one.

If you're really pining for some Harry Potter with dark magic and romance, I'd suggest [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived]]. It's far from a masterpiece, but I didn't have to force myself to keep reading it at least. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]] might be worth checking out as well, if you're looking for something longer than 150 kilowords.
