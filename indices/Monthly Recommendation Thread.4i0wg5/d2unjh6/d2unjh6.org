/Kindred/ by Octavia Butler is a novel with a rational, level-headed protagonist, some unexplained magic stuff, thorough research and strong writing. It does have a bunch of graphic violence, including sexual violence and racially motivated hate crimes, so if you're looking for a book to cheer you up, this isn't it. 8/10.
