I'm of two minds of Suze's inexperience. It's both refreshing, to see Godship handled in such a way, and frustrating, because I can't stop imaging how well I would be doing in her position.

And by well, I mean I would go full on, over the top, theatrical, dark caped, shadow hooded Death up in this bitch. I'd be the worst Death they'd ever dealt with, and probably start a war just due to my sheer lack of respect for the Gods and their petty rules.
