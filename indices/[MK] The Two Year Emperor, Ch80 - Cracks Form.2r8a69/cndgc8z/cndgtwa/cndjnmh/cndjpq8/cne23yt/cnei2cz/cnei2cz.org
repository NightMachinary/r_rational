Death, the office, has the most sources of "ambient power" -- every undead is a power source for Death. Even without worshippers, Death is a god you don't want to mess with.

Worshippers are where the real power comes from, though, and Death has fewer actual worshippers than many other portfolios -- most people have an easier time getting behind (e.g.) a mother goddess like Amilsandre than a god of death. Neklos was turning this around by telling Afi to go out aggressively converting -- it got to the point where Death /did/ have the most worshippers. Most of those were undead, however, and the majority of them were vaporized during the course of 2YE...especially in the unseen period between the end of Book 1 and the start of Book 2, during which Albrecht went and took out most of the undead in Anundj√•.

Suze's big problem right now is that all of the people who actually /do/ worship Death are currently worshipping the wrong one. The prayers are all directed towards Neklos, which means the power they carry is pretty much going into /dev/null. As of chapter 80 she's starting to turn that around.
