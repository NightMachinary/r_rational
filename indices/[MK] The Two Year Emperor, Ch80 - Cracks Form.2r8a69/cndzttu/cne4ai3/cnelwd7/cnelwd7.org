I am actually enjoying Book 2 /much/ more than Book 1, which got somewhat stale near the end (due to repetitive munchkining; what's clever the first time is expected the second and boring the third). Book 2 has novel situations, interesting character development, and no obvious end point which means plot developments are much less predictable (whereas Book 1, like almost all adventures, has an expected ending of "the bad guy is defeated"; occasionally this is subverted by having the bad guy win - see 24's Jack Bauer for an example of bad guys repeatedly losing and winning, it gets old).

As far as I'm concerned, the less we see of Jake in Book 2, the better. Giving Suze actual agency makes her a far more interesting character (in Book 1 she was a prop that occasionally offered suggestions and received pats on the head).
