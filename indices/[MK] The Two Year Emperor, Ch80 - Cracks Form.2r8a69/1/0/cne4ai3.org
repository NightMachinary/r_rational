Thank you for saying so. Thank you especially for saying so now instead of just waiting a bit longer and then leaving a review / comment here that says "this sucks, I'm gone".

You're actually the second person to say something like this. I've also noticed fewer reviews, reddit comments, and upvotes on book 2 than on book 1.

I'm wondering at this point if I should just wrap book 2 and move on to the next project; I'm still enjoying writing Suze, Ellen, and April, but perhaps 2YE has had a good run and it's time to put it to bed.

The next project will be original fantasy in a postapocalyptic magitek world.

What do people think?
