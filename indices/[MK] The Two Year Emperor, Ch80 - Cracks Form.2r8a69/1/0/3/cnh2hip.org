  I'm wondering at this point if I should just wrap book 2 and move on to the next project; I'm still enjoying writing Suze, Ellen, and April, but perhaps 2YE has had a good run and it's time to put it to bed.

Me, I /like/ Suze, as a character, and I still like the story. But it feels like she's missing many opportunities to be as smart as she was set up to be in book 1. It felt like her nature was the kind of person to be learning and remembering, but so far in book 2 we have a lot of her ... not doing this.

You have been hinting here that there are reasons for this, but if these hints have made it into the story itself, it hasn't been clear. This doesn't necessarily make it a /worse/ story, but it does come across as a different kind of story than just a sequel to the first.

Actually, I'll amend that that line about the hints. Suze's extreme character change does remind me of a similar outbreak of irrationality in the story, namely Jake's drinking problem. I might guess that this is intended to show Suze is being manipulated, just like Jake was.

But Jake's behavioral changes were extreme on a human level, and stood out as something not particularly like him. Suze, however, has recently been through a rather large life change so we're not really calibrated with what's /supposed/ to be normal for her now---and on top of that, she's moved to the deity level, where it's already hard to tell the difference between a naturally extreme personality and one that's been perverted (cf. Poe's law). Acting weird is less suspicious for a new-made goddess than it is for a new-made emperor.

I'd love to see Suze transform the whole idea of death into something awesome (in a world with resurrection, it doesn't have to be as terrible as to us). If she'll be like this for a while, though, it'd be nice to see the story support what's going on more. (because if there's anything I imagine [[/r/rational]] likes, it's good long explanations)
