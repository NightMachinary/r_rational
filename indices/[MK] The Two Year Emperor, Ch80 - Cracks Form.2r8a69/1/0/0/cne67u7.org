I think the world needs a bit of an overhaul. Jake toying with the rules did that in the first book.

Suze quickly embracing her role as Death and trying to topple the gods in alliance with Jake, a bit like Kishoto's spin-off, would serve the same purpose in the second book. I really want to see Suze and Jake team up to take on the gods, take on the rules, and fuck things up big time.

Nonetheless, I'm still loving 2YE. Rock on dude.
