I think what most drew me to TYE was the interplay between Jake coming up with ways to break the rules any generally acting rational among folks who are often times stuck in their narrow "things have always been done like this" views.

With the three girls I feel like that they are behaving anything but rationally, Suze has shown herself to be quite competent her current actions seem out of character. The mom had the opportunity to gain enough power to protect herself and here daughter but she just ran away.

Its just frustrating, I keep wanting to scream at the characters to get their act together and start acting rationally.

Still, that said I'll stick with it, I loved book 1 so much that I'm more than willing to see where this goes :-)
