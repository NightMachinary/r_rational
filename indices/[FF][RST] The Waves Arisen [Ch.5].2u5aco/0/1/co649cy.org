I don't like how it reads either, it doesn't /feel/ realistic, but it probably is about right.

Psychologically you have several biases in play for both of them.

Orochimaru is playing the trustworthy friend to kabuto's suspicious character, think of it as a form of God cop bad cop.

Sasuke has been given a very valuable gift for free, the sharingan he is obsessed with, so he now trusts snake face way more than he should.

Then his new benefactor is honest with him about the risk of the cursed seal (but only partly, presuming it still carries the other side effects) which again builds trust.

Finally, this person he trusts has used it himself (apparently, presumably a lie) so he clearly thinks the risk is worth it. Add in the story they /happened/ to overhear about a young, short chunnin beating several jounin at once...

As for Naruto, in this story he is riddled with insecurity. He describes them all as loners, like he is trying to see similarities between them. Projection, or something.

He is constantly trying to tie their team together and make a family it seems, because he hasn't had any before. He gives away power for free, despite knowing how valuable it is.

And he had also fallen for the small risk/big risk set up by orochimaru.

I think the characters as written could do this. It just reads like they are being silly, because they are being gamed and each have psychological weaknesses.
