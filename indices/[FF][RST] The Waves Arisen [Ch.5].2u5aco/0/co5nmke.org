This chapter fell a bit flat. I was confused for a bit about the Hot Springs / Sound village thing. They were used a lot next to each other so I was initially of the impression that HS was the main city of land of Sound, or something, and had to reread once that stopped making sense. Seems sound is a new village that's taken over some HS territory, is that right?

But most of all Naruto and Sasuke are holding the biggest idiot ball here. You want to respect his 'I might die but if I live I'll be stronger?' Okay, but what reason you have to believe its true? Just the word of a stranger that conveniently knows a lot about your powers? That might be in character for canon!naruto, but is jarring here.
