Maybe I'm too used to seeing Hinata stutter through every other word in the stories I read--but, until this chapter, I was assuming that she didn't have her canon shyness because I hadn't seen anything to indicate otherwise (stuttering, smiling only weakly, shrinking in on herself, etc.). Maybe it should've been made more apparent earlier?
