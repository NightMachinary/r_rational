Happy to see this back although sad about the reason.

"Little Matador" seems like an anagram involving "Matilda," since from the plot summary it seems like...well...most Dahl books but Matilda especially, with "Ms. Sweet" substituted in for "Ms. Honey." But I don't know what to do with the leftover letters, except maybe "Let Matilda Rot".
