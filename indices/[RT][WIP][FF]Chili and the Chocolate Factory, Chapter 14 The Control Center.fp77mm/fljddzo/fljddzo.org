If you're wondering why this is chapter 14 when the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/f9s555/wipff_chili_and_the_chocolate_factory_fudge/][last chapter was 14 too]], it's because the previous chapter 13 was an announcement of the story's hiatus, that has now been deleted. This shifted ff.net's chapter count back one. Now the last discussion thread links to the wrong chapter, but I'm just glad we got another update.

I wonder if Keerthi will be the main perceptive character for now on(or at least as long as she's in the factory, as ominous as that sounds), or if we'll get narration from other characters too.
