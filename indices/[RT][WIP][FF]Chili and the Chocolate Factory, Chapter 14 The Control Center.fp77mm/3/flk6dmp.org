So it looks like Charlie is torturing his family. That was not what I was expecting from a chapter that started with consciences being fully sentient skin tags that you get after a certain amount of moral development.

Possibly this is wordplay, like when he says "destroy them" or "own them" and he means beat them badly at a computer game. But I doubt it.
