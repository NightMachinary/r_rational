This is one of the few stories I keep an eye out for these days. I love the way you explore the physical implications of super speed and other superhero tropes.

That said, this was the first chapter I found myself skipping through. The first part is wrong -- high speed trading is not something that Flicker's speed would help with, since it's limited by speed of light delays and not human action. Check the book "Flash Boys" for more, but suffice to say that there's no room for super speed to help if you're building single-purpose fiber optic lines for your trading and specifying which cage your servers should be in at the data center so that you can be as close as possible to the exchange's servers.

The conversation in the high speed vault had me skipping ahead. I'm sure you've done a ton of work on your model of temporal mechanics and how retrocausal attacks work -- I can tell, because it's got "author's jewel" all over it. Unfortunately, it's too complicated for the reader (well, this reader) and, frankly, boring. Characters in the Flicker-verse have a habit of sitting down and having Serious Conversations which can slow things down a lot, but when the conversation is purely about the temporal model it's too much for me.

Again, I want to repeat that I love this story and your writing. This is the only chapter in three (4?) books where I've had these issues.
