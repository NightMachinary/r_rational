Speed of light in long distance fiber optic cable is about 0.69 c. Flicker is faster than that. That's how people thought (prior to this chapter) that she was making her money. It's also why arbitragers going over any distance prefer to use chains of LOS microwave relay towers, though those didn't go up until a few years before 2015 in our world. For an interesting discussion, see here: [[http://oklo.org/2015/02/22/electra/]] But you can't do that over the ocean very easily. Now, if Flicker travels at 0.8 c between her exchange relays, it's very loud, obvious, and destructive. So she doesn't do that. That's why her microsat network being complete is important, they are in LEO, and specifically designed for low latency. Their main purpose is to reduce her com time to the Database as much as possible, but they work for trading, too. No one else (in 2012 in my world) has a similar network, and she makes her pure speed trades between exchanges that are far apart and the great circle route goes over water, where you can't use towers. (NY/Tokyo/London/Singapore for ex) So her microsat network is faster than both sea floor cables and regular satellites in Geosynchronous orbit.

Where she makes her money on shorter trade distance is by exploiting trading programs. The other speed traders do not have human level intelligence at a speed that can keep up with Flicker (or the Database), and she now has a model based on individual charcterization of every trader and data propagation and reaction delays (Vizier is running some Black Swan 0.9 software)

The conversation in the vault isn't about my model--it's about Doc giving his best judgement when he's still working on something, because there is a threat to Flicker (messing herself up because she's wrong about the cause of a memory inconsistency) and she has a character trait of not accepting "do this" without an explanation. I could write a better explanation--but that's not what Doc has.

I'm glad you're enjoying the rest of the stories 8-)
