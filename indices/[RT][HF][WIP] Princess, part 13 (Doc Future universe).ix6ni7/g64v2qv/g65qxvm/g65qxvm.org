  "Talk to her and Dr. Reinhart about setting up a non-destructive way to compartmentalize no-longer-relevant memories. You don't want to get rid of them, because they may correspond to high speed mind logs that you have no direct way of accessing, and you don't want to introduce any new inconsistencies if you can help it."

Doesn't this set up a couple small continuity glitches with Fall? First, that if she already has that mechanism set up, why not use it on Skybreaker's memories? Second and more subtle, isn't setting that up augmenting, or at least close to it? To a smaller degree than the memory techniques she semi-licitly acquires and uses (and is warned are poorly-structured and put her on an inevitable road to augmentation) in Fall, but if she's literally already learned the basic version from Stella, it seems implausible that she wouldn't notice that it was similar in a way that incited a conversation about augmentation.
