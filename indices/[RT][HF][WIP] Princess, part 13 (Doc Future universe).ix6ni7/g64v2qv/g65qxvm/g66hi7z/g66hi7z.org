There will eventually be some expository clean-up in Fall, but this isn't really an issue: The techniques Flicker gets partial access to in Fall are incomplete and cognitive ones, not memory, and the memory techniques she does end up using only work on her biological brain. She does not have access to the non-volatile memory debris in her high-speed mind in the same way (Doc just warned her that creates a potential consistency problem.) Flicker does have later issues with /overusing/ memory compartmentalization--it becomes her go-to technique for handling psychological problems, where it introduces new issues.

(Spoiler) Stella worries about Flicker using her papers from Fall because the published ones have Belle Tinker level or better misdirection and many of the unpublished ones were intended only for herself and Doc, and include important assumptions about what the reader must already know or they wouldn't still be alive and functional 8-)

Edit: One note about the 'Skybreaker' viewpoint character in Fall: it gets a lot of things wrong because of assumptions made to fill holes where memories are missing or inaccessible after Donner's song disrupts things. So it goes off into overinterpreting-the-Voynich-manuscript level craziness because it assumes that Flicker's human body and brain must have been planned by Explorer, when they weren't.
