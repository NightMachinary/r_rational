Hm. I'm still not convinced that the trading thing works. In addition to speed of light issues, HFTs have access to special trade types that allow them to jump the queue on orders and so other sorts of shenanigans that frankly sounded like cheating to me when I read about them. Still, it's your works and the SoL issue was my main objection. Presumably Flicker can get access to whatever trade options the other HFTs use and then beat them on time. Okay, cool.

Thanks for the explanation.
