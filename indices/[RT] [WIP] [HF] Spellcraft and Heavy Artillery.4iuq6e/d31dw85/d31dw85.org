First thing that jumps out at me (in a bad way) is that you tell rather than show immediately. We get "he was thin with expensive clothes" rather than "fabric clung to the hollow where a healthy man would have a gut. It crawled with embroidery, red and gold. Tom glared. What was a rich little waif doing in here?" I don't care what the mage looks like because I have no concept of what he actually looks like or how Tom feels about it, even though the paragraph is in Tom's POV.

On a character level, I don't like him much either. He has a very "rich officer slumming it with underlings" tone, full of condescension. Maybe that's intentional, but it's more irritating than sympathetic to my eyes at least.
