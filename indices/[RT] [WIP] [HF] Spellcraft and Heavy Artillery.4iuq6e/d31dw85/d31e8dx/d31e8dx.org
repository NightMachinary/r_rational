The lack of being sympathetic is intentional, very much intentional. This character has a hard time becoming sympathetic...

As to the feedback, very much appreciated. My usual process is to finish a story, wait, re-read it, create a second draft, send it to beta readers, re-read it, create a third draft, possibly publish that one after line edits. This is an experiment... it's all first draft, although I will edit as I get feedback on it, and as I re-read it. When I have enough space from the story I will incorporate that feedback into an edit.

Those edits scare me a little bit, but the ones that really scare me are bigger story arc and structure edits. This is the first thing I have released this way, I'm used to being able to go back and edit things before people see them... it's frankly a little terrifying.
