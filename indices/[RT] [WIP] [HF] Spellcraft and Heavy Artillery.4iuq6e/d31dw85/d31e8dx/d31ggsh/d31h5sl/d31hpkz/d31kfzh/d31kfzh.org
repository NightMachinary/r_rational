Thanks, that actually helps a lot. I will modify Tom's thoughts on the matter. I do say in the next chapter that Adrian creeps him out, but I realized it's not in that chapter. Have to make it more clear that it's a matter of vested self interest... oh, and Adrian paying for all the drinks over the course of the night. That helps them react positively in the moment. Maybe an aside moment between Tom and one of the men, something like that.
