I'm releasing this as a serial novel. My goal is to have a combination of good literary values, and strong rational story development.

I have a well developed magic system, and a well developed set of motivations for the world and the characters. I can't promise to always be perfect, but I try.

Also, this series will always be available free on my site. I may also release it via Amazon once I have it complete, but never only on Amazon (any rumours that amazon requires six months exclusivity are based entirely on KDP select, which is an opt in program, one I will never join as it is antithetical to my core values).

Hope you like it.
