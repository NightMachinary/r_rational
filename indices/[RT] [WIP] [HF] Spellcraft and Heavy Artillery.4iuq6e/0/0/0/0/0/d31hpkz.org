Okay - that's kind of how it reads... But not really. It seems like, in-story, he's extremely likeable to the men, even though he's unlikeable to the reader, and the way they seem to instantly like him lends an unpleasant patina of Gary Stuishness to the writing. I think you were going for something like that, but the way it works is a little bit unpleasant. Combined with a lack of showing - we only know how Tom feels about expensive things because he says so directly - and the general feel is "here's a guy slumming it with his inferiors, and even though he's supposed to be unlikeable and condescending, they lap it right up."

The fact that all his physical qualities are positve - rich, thin, soft-voiced, eloquent - and he feels like a guy who's supposed to be likeable, and is liked by other characters - but that directly jars with the reader's impression, which is, "what a condescending prick".
