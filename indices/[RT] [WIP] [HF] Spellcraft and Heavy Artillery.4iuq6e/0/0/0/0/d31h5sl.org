Well, it's to have something to edit really... so yeah, characters, overall plot, getting something out there that I can shape into what I want.

My longest finished piece is just over 60k... and by finished I mean I'm doing line edits right now. All the content edits are finished. I'm going to be self publishing that one in a couple of weeks (I have a photo shoot scheduled to create the cover image I need, but the model is in the Bahamas until next week).

This project is very, very ambitious. It stemmed from thinking about what a society would look like if classic Dungeons and Dragons style magic existed, taking into account the fact that societies are largely shaped by warfare. Then I had to come up with crunchier rules for the magic system, because D&D magic makes little to no sense.

Adrian being hard to like is an important element in the story. The men are nice to him because he can make or break their career, but nobody really likes him very much at this point.
