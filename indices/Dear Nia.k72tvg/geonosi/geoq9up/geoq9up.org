Nia invented a technology which allows different quantum forks to communicate with each other. Then she died in a global thermonuclear war. Her husband got his hands on the technology and contacted another version of Nia in another quantum fork, one whose husband died in that war instead. But he isn't the first grieving version of himself to contact that Nia, and she cuts off contact because there's nothing she can do for him and doesn't want to be heartbroken all over again.

He dies, alone and cold, in the war which failed to rend the world of the Nia who cut him off.

Then it turns out there's another Nia, in a world which didn't have the war, who contacted other versions of herself to get those transcripts, and used them in her PHD thesis. The man who accepted her thesis also tried this and was promptly overwhelmed with existential horror, for which he required therapy. They forwarded the entire thing to the military to hopefully stave off that war, and the many worlds march on.
