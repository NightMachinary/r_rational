Nia and Soren are a couple.

Nia invents a machine that let's you send messages to parallel universes.

A drone bombs their house, killing Nia in one universe and Soren in the other.

The Soren that survives uses the machine to contact the Nia that survives. She tells him that this is goodbye and that she's not /his/ Nia (and he is not her Soren), but he doesn't accept that and wants more.

She uses lots of science and philosophy to tell him how wrong he is, he uses raw emotion to tell her that he isn't wrong in all the ways that count.

In her world peace has come. She cuts communication with Soren and moves on. Soren on the other hand is surrounded by war and despairing and angry.

Timeskip.

Some Nia uses conversations with parallel family members (and selves maybe) do write a philosophical thesis and gets a(nother?) doctorate. It's not clear to me if she's a third Nia who never lost her family, if the Nia writing the letters lied about her family status to the Soren writing the letters, or if the person congratulating her is just confused.

The end.

You might have gotten confused because everyone was voice acted by the same person.
