I'm not sure why they haven't sent Allen home once Albert verified his story. Balancing it out, it seems: Chance Allen reveals secret * damage of the secret > harm from sending him home. Harm from sending him home is only losing 1 person - others will already have the idea of claiming they spoke to Albert even if Allen isn't sent home.

Maybe they want him to stay and they're evaluating him for a leadership position, but I can't see why they think he'd accept.
