Albert will confirm or deny if he spoke to people to Countymen and Statemen, in order to prevent that sort of scenario where people make claims. Most of the time though, people don't say anything about speaking to Albert, because he strongly discourages it, and he's very good with mental judo.

Allen lived his entire life and never knew his mother spoke to Albert until the letter from her that explained some of her encounter, for example. The officers know that Fobi spoke to Albert, but she won't say anything about it. Albert is very good at keeping people quiet if he wants them quiet.

That's one reason why the militia officers and Urda are concerned. Albert didn't work to try to keep Allen quiet.
