I got that, and my perception is likely filtered through my own military experience. Everyone gets orders they don't like. You do them, and sometimes you grumble, but I didn't see things getting anywhere towards mutinous, just a frustrated leader, advisers ready to act as reasonable checks, and a scared and angry bright boy in a bad situation.

To be clear I think I might be assuming a much higher tipping point before any form of subversion or rebellion is worth considering. These militia are essentially in there own boot camp, which is part of my model, but they are conscripts and don't have a lot of trust in their first and second layer leaders, which is so foreign to me I didn't even realize it was a bias.

Thanks it's always good to get a better model of how you think.
