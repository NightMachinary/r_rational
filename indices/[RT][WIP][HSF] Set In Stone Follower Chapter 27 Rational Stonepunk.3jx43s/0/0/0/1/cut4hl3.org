It was obvious for me because of the discussion here about previous chapters pointing out Allen's growing political influence, but if I was reading straight through without the enforced waits between chapter updates it wouldn't have been nearly as easy to see.

The main factor is that Allen just isn't the sort of person who is greedy for power/control and with such a deep immersion in his character, I know I would have had not been able to guess at Urda's model of Allen's behavior since it's inaccurate and he simply won't being staging a takeover anytime soon.
