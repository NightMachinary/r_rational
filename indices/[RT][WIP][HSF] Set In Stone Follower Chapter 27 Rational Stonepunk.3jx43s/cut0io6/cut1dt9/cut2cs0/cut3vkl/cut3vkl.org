. . . That I can see, the long game /shakes head/ not so much. Allen is very much a shut up and multiply guy. Not to say he isn't ambitious, but his social grounding makes it clear to me that the power he'd want is a better farm. Considering, the height to which the officer corp actually seems to be good at judging people, I'd be surprised if they thought that was a concern. At least, without them taking action that clearly demonstrated themselves as an enemy, and not a reasonable investigator using all moral options. It doesn't make sense for the LT to be concerned about a rebellion though I can now see where you were working that, and even guess a few might be intentional catspaws of his if he was worried; it does makes perfect sense for the statesman, but I guess I was too in Allen's shoes to see him being assessed for that threat.
