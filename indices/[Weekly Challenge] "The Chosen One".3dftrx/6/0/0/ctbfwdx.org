I realize the whole point of it was the ending, but it left a seriously awful taste in my mouth anyway. Of course she can break herself out of one self-alteration of questionable morality, but if she self alters into a paperclipper clearly she is automatically doomed forever and will never be able to see the error of her ways. If she was going to get herself stuck with her changes, the first thing should've stuck her; this result just feels inconsistent and forced.

Basically, it's the same thing that irritates me about Alex Beyman ([[http://www.inkitt.com/AlexBeyman]]) stories.
