Thanks man. Appreciate the feedback! And it almost feels like canon, because Golden Age Superman was killing people all the time. Not to mention the collateral damage from any big fights probably took out a few innocents each time as well. But we never see the Man of Steel bothered by that at all, despite him being a paragon of good and justice.
