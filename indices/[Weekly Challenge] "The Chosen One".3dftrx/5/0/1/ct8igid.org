Maybe I'm just not in the right mood for it and/or not the right audience for the story. The language was a turn-off for me and the plot of a child applying rationality wasn't appealing to me. I ended up making it about halfway before skimming the rest.

Something I'm wondering: is this meant to be Teppia's writing, a transcription of her speech or something else? The story started with "Hello class" which made me think it was speech, but it lacked punctuation that would be there if it were transcribed (eg. he thinks /its/ because).
