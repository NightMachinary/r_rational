If you're in the mood for reading, [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/4vj/a_rationalists_account_of_objectification/][this]] is what I want to tell you.

Sorry it's long, I can't think of a shorter way to say that which isn't easily misunderstood. But if you agree with the link, then my reply is "it really does not matter if he views the representation on the screen as a thing in different poses, as long as he doesn't systematically pigeonhole people into a stereotype during interpersonal interactions, and while That type of objectification might be loosely related to This type of pigeonholing, the two are not nearly closely related enough to justify you policing the very notion of watching a TV show in whole or part because you think one or more of the characters are attractive."

In fact, as the very first comment quoting M. Monroe in that article illustrates, knowing her name wouldn't have helped a thing. There's no indication that thinking an actress is attractive and thinking nothing else of note about her will make you treat her as an object /after you meet her/ - that's an important /but sufficiently unrelated/ issue to how you see any works she performed, sufficiently unrelated in that you don't get to judge people by the way they experience the works.

(That is to say - some people thought Monroe was a sex symbol and treated her like an object when they met her. Some people thought Monroe was a sex symbol and treated her like a person when they met her. Some people saw her as something /more/ than a sex symbol, and /still/ treated her like an object in the sense that they just saw her as a famous person commodity type thing. And so on. Related but still Pretty Separate issues.)
