I wouldn't complain if the author said he (I'd bet $50 that the author is a guy) wanted to watch her because he thinks she's a good actor or because he likes the character but didn't know her name. Instead, he's treating her as a thing that he can view in different poses, and he's not doing a good enough job pretending to value her as a person to learn her name.
