The author is emulating problematic behavior for amusement, you say? How does that help anyone? I suppose it helps him justify his behavior to himself. He can sleep better at night. But in terms of the effects on others, it'd be better if he hadn't said that in the first place rather than saying it and then letting people whisper "It was a joke, he actually admires Karen Gillan's acting." (An assertion, I might add, that has absolutely no evidence behind it.)
