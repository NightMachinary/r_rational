  I'd bet you wouldn't be as offended by a joke about police shooting rich white people, compared to one about shooting poor black people.

This is, of course, completely incorrect. Since the shooting of poor black people is /normal/, we're inured to it. A joke about police shooting rich white people would be /supremely/ offensive, since it would confront the privileged classes with the pain, horror, and despair we put ever so much effort into ignoring.
