Not a question of "trust", just a question of understanding the argument. This isn't the sort of issue that one is supposed to trust experts on!

  Karen Gillan probably didn't set out to show off her body and use acting as a means. She probably set off to be a good actor and got her role as a result of hard work and skill. Reducing her efforts to bodily objectification is a violation of that preference.

I don't disagree with the ideals you're outlining here - that it would be nice if there /existed/ a form of art which incorporated acting without incorporating the artist's physicality - but the practical reality is that it's film. It's about appearance and skill in roughly equal parts - both are necessary, but neither is sufficient. I say this as a person with family in acting - the very first thing they ask from a new actor is a photograph. Every aspiring actor and actress understands that when they set out in the career. It is an inherently physical medium.

No one wants to be treated as an object within interpersonal interactions, but within the context of media I feel like it's a bit taboo to start dictating what viewers are /supposed/ to get from it. It's the artist's job to convey what they wish to convey, not the viewers job to receive the correct message.
