I trust lukeprog on some things, but not on feminism and objectification.

One thing that makes this example of objectification problematic is the fact that Karen Gillan probably didn't set out to show off her body and use acting as a means. She probably set off to be a good actor and got her role as a result of hard work and skill. Reducing her efforts to bodily objectification is a violation of that preference. It's especially vexing because women's worth (as perceived by society) tends to be no more than how easily people can objectify them. And doubly so because there are plenty of women in the porn industry who explicitly decide that they want people to objectify them like this.
