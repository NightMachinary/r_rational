AI : artificial intelligence

FAI : friendly AI

UFAI : unfriendly AI

"Friendly" means "aligned with the interests of humanity" -- an FAI will figure out how to make us all happy. A UFAI is any AI that isn't friendly -- unless it actively wants to be nice to us (friendly), we are going to either be its enemies or "those puny little bugs that are using the resources I need", and in either case we're all dead. There's also the category of "hostile UFAI", but people don't usually bother with that -- whether it wants to torture us all for eternity or just turn the mass comprising our bodies into paperclips, it's definitely not friendly.

The above is (over)simplified, of course.
