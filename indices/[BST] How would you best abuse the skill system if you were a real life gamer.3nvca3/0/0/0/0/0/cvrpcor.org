I believe that the Gamer system works on sheer repetition with the level of difficulty increasing the amount of gained EXP.

So verifying it being a friendly AI might give you more exp but not worth the risk. So just grind away those non-confirmations.

Taking this out of the box and examining it with the rest of the mechanics, you can just use Observe on your finished product and it should tell you if it's friendly or not.
