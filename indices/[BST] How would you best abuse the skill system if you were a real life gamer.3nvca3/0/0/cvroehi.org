  Why, the skill of FAI design, of course. As an added bonus, your information about your skill level would tell you when you're done.

Well, that pretty much puts paid to this thread. Nice job breaking it, hero. ;>

Although, actually...the only way to increase your skill would be to try to design an FAI, and you might not advance unless you actually tried out the design. If so, you will almost certainly create a UFAI first and destroy the world. Once again, nice job breaking it, hero.
