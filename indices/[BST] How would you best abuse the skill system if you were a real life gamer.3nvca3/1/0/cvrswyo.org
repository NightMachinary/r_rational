It makes sense to tackle things from a meta perspective, but how do you get the skills in the first place? I mean the only way I can think of is, constantly creating multiple new skills in ma very short period of time to trigger Skill Acquisition, and constantly leveling up multiple skills in an exceptionally short amount of time to trigger Skill Leveling. However, those are things the Gamer will be motivated to do anyway and how can the system see it as a new skill in of itself?

EDIT: I wonder how the Gaming System would react to a gamer who is a "completionist"? I bet there'd be a reward of some sort for leveling every possible skill to 100. Maybe, Skill Leveling?
