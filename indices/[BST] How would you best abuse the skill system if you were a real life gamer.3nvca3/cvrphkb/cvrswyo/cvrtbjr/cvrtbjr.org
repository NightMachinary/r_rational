Well without knowing more details of what exactly a "skill" is, it's all really a crap shoot regardless. While an interesting plot point, the skill system has always come across as effectively author fiat whether a given activity develops into a skill or not.

So basically, your procedure seems the best bet for developing each skill if you're trying to be at all rigorous.
