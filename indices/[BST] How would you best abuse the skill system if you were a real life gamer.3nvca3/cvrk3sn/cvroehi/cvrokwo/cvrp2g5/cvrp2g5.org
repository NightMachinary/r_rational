So, design an AI on a closed system that has no outputs -- not even a text channel. Immediately destroy the AI on the assumption that it was UFAI. Repeat until your skill is 100%. Assume that the final product is an FAI.

That works unless your skill advancement depends on verifying the (U)FAI status of the AI.
