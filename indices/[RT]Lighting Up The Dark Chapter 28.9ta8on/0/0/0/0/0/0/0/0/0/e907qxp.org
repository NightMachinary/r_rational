  But then it's not like Naruto is set in ancient times.

Well, it's in different world. With obviously very weird tech levels jumping around. They don't have guns and vehicles, but do have radio tech and all kinds of futuristic stuff that works on chakra. I'd bet having magic around hinders tech too. Kishimoto said he didn't really think about consistent tech level, but that it would be somewhat before our time.

The world has just had two huge wars, like Kakashi fought on one of them and next one is coming, so when exactly is the economy flourishing? :s I don't think that world is really stable enough to become like ours in things like ethical thinking and society and stuff.

  And they are actually capable of treating illnesses basically at our level or beyond. Sakura was capable of treating an unknown poison on the go. Tsunade cured a spinal fracture. They performed eye surgery on the field! Orochimaru created human clones, spliced DNA and they kept a kid with a chronic bone infection alive for years! Maybe they are warmongers, but they aren't backwards.

This is ninjas, which are huge minority of the people and can't be used as example of general tech level.

  I've heard from many sources that this belief about marriage historically coming very soon is more of a modern day myth

And I've heard from many sources that it's actually true. Wikipedia certainly agrees.

  Historically, the age of consent for a sexual union was determined by tribal custom, or was a matter for families to decide. In most cases, this coincided with signs of puberty: such as menstruation for a girl and pubic hair for a boy.[1]

  In Jewish oral tradition, men cannot consent to marriage until they reach the age of majority of 13 years and one day and have undergone puberty. With no signs of puberty, they are considered minors until the age of twenty. After twenty, they are not considered adults if they show signs of impotence. If they show no signs of puberty or do show impotence, they automatically become adults by age 35 and can marry. The same rules apply to women, except their age of majority is 12 years and a day.[2][3]

  In Ancient Rome, it was very common for girls to marry and have children shortly after the onset of puberty. Roman law required brides to be at least 12 years old.[4] In Roman law, first marriages to brides from 12 to 24 required the consent of the bride and her father; by the late antique period, Roman law permitted women over 25 to marry without parental consent.[5] The Catholic canon law followed the Roman law. In the 12th century, the Catholic Church drastically changed legal standards for marital consent by allowing daughters over 12 and sons over 14 to marry without their parents' approval, even if their marriage was made clandestinely.[6] Parish studies have confirmed that late medieval women did sometimes marry without their parents' approval.[7]
