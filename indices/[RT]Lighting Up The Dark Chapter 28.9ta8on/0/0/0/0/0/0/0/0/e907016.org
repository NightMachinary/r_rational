I've heard from many sources that this belief about marriage historically coming very soon is more of a modern day myth, and that aside from rare cases where nobles and empires were involved, marriage actually came around what we would consider full teenage, like sixteen-nineteen. But then it's not like Naruto is set in ancient times. I'll point out that in Naruto international economy is flourishing (think of the deal with wave) when they're not at war, which explains why they can have convenience stores, fridges, air conditioners, radios and cameras. Naruto had a photo taken for his ninja ID at the very start of the manga and the photo was ready in a matter of hours/a day. And they are actually capable of treating illnesses basically at our level or beyond. Sakura was capable of treating an unknown poison on the go. Tsunade cured a spinal fracture. They performed eye surgery on the field! Orochimaru created human clones, spliced DNA and they kept a kid with a chronic bone infection alive for years! Maybe they are warmongers, but they aren't backwards.

  Just that they should know about that kind of stuff and definitely learn something about both seduction and sex in academy.

Eh, maybe they should. I live in a first-world country and was not taught sexual education at school. And my education didn't need to privilege fighting, survival, martial arts and murder desensitisation.
