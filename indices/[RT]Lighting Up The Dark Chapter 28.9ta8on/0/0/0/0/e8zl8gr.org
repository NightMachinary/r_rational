You mean that the child who was shunned by his whole community -with a high ranking figure explicitly out to alienate him-, who only talked with the Hokage -who could give him approximately as much time as the POTUS can his children-, with an unspecified parental figure -who is implied to have been dead for some years-, and later with only one of his teachers -mostly during class ours-, could have ended up with developmental issues/severe gaps in his knowledge?!

Nah, I can't see how that would be possible.

Ok, sorry, sarcasm out, but I don't get how that would be surprising. Remember that, at the same age, LUTD!Hinata has a fairly good grasp of sexuality.
