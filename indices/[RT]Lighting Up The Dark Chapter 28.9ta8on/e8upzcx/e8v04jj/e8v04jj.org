I love how here Naruto is a genius of technique construction and a trained kid-soldier, but in these things he's still a naive twelve year old.

There's this trend in works where the protagonists are supposed to be intelligent, especially young and brilliant, of writing them basically as adults. I'm happy LUTD manages to avoid this pitfall.
