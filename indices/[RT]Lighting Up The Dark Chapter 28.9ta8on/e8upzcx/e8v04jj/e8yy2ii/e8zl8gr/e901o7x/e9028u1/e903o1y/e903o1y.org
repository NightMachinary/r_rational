Historically marriage age was often when puberty came. It's a little bit bullshitty that backwards warlike societies like these without modern medicine they would think like us on these issues.

But of course fiction has to please the reader and not many would probably enjoy too much realism.

But anyway, I didn't even suggest they should go seduce people as fresh genin. Just that they should /know/ about that kind of stuff and definitely learn something about both seduction and sex in academy.
