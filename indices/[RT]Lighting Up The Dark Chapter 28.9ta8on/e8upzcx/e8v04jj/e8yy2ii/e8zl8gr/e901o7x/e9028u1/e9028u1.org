Sure, but, first, this is not canon, it's AU, and it's not like canon ever claimed to be the pinnacle of rationality and self-consistency. Second, the sexy jutsu is a naive technique that shows a naive understanding of sexuality. Third, ninjas are supposed to seduce people too, but not kids (in this fanfiction). You will remember during Kakashi's trial that everyone in the court was scandalised such a young child had used seduction against the enemy, the Hokage had to remind everyone about the Hidden Stone "scandal", and pointed out that is was a diffused practise during the warring clans period (implying that it's not done anymore).
