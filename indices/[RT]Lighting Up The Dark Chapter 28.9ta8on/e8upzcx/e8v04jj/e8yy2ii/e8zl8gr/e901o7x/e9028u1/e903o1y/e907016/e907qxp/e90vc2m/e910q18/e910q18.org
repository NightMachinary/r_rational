  The world has just had two huge wars, like Kakashi fought on one of them and next one is coming, so when exactly is the economy flourishing?
#+end_quote

If you think about it, it could be said that one of the biggest strides forward of the world's economy has been the introduction of the metal containers and metal ships for mass, reliable cargo shipping around the world. One can imagine storage seals could have a similar impact on trade, in peace times. Maybe they just are really good at picking the economy back up. And besides, you can't really have commonplace fridges and radios without a functioning international economy. I mean, you /could/, but not really, and not if you wanted to achieve anything else in the meantime.

  I don't think that world is really stable enough to become like ours in things like ethical thinking and society and stuff.

There's this theory that the modern parity between sexes is due in large measure to the contraceptive pill, as it gave women the freedom to decide when to be mothers and when not to, and raised female sexuality from the field of reproduction to that of recreation, as it had always been for men. It doesn't seem too far fetched to imagine that there's a similar social dynamic in the Narutoverse.

  This is ninjas, which are huge minority of the people and can't be used as example of general tech level.
#+end_quote

That, simply, does not matches our observations. Not in the sense that we see civilians being treated in the same hospital as Naruto does (though we're never told the opposite), but in that there are the preconditions for modern ethics and social dynamics to happen, and we see them happen. Supposing there is this big tech, medical and social divide between ninja and civilians would make what we observe less probable, so it's more reasonable to suppose that it's not the case.

  And I've heard from many sources that it's actually true. Wikipedia certainly agrees.
#+end_quote

I actually wanted to give the frame of time I was referring to, but then I edited my comment and it got lost. I meant in the past as in the Middle Age Europe, maybe Edo Period Japan. We know that the Narutoverse is at least as advanced as that.

  It's practically a trade school. To think that it wouldn't teach anything about important part of the trade is kinda ridiculous. Also training against that.

Maybe it's modular. It's well established that a ninja's education doesn't stop at the academy. Maybe they leave this kind of topic to the jonin sensei.
