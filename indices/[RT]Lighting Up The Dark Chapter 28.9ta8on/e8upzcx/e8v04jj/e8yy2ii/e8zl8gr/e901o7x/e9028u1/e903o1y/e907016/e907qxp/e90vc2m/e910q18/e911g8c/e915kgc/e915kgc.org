  It's a ninja village, which are rare. Daimyos rule over a huge amounts of normal citizens. The show is all about the ninjas and ninja villages. Civvies in ninja villages are very priviledged, as they can be in chakra enhanced care.

Even if it was true, which I'm not sold on, this would have little bearing on our point, because Konoha can be viewed as a self-contained society. It doesn't matter if outside the village social norms are backwards, inside the village children are not taught seduction tactics, they don't marry as soon as they reach puberty, and there's a fair amount of equality between the sexes.

  We know Narutoverse is pretty grim. Konoha is portrayed as a good guy village, but they are ok with torture and child soldiers and stuff.

They have different sensibilities regarding war when compared to ours, for sure. Still, this doesn't mean that they are behind us on anything else.
