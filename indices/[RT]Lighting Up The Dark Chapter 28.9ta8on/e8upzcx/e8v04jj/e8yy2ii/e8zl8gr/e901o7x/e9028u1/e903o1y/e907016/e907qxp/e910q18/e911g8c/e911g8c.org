It's a ninja village, which are rare. Daimyos rule over a huge amounts of normal citizens. The show is all about the ninjas and ninja villages. Civvies in ninja villages are very priviledged, as they can be in chakra enhanced care.

We know Narutoverse is pretty grim. Konoha is portrayed as a good guy village, but they are ok with torture and child soldiers and stuff.
