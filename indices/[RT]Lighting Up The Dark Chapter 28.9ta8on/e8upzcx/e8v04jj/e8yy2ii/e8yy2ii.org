Huh? If anything, it's extremely unrealistic for a 12 year old to be this unaware of sex. And I mean any 12 year old, not even a smart one. In the real world, this would be indicative of a developmental issue. This is a classical trap of adults writing children while forgetting what children are actually like at certain ages.
