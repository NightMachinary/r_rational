Thanks for posting this link. I meant to do this myself but shamefully forgot in the flurry of uploading to three different sites which all have different formatting requirements (AO3 does strange things with paragraph breaks, SV turns all my backgrounds + text black unless I remember to use workarounds, and FFN just plain eats some things and there's nothing I can do about it).
