On the surface, it's not very difficult to do whatever you wanted to. Master Zhao manages to avoid a spot of bird poop just by sidestepping, so day trading stocks would be a very efficient way to make money, or any other arbitrary goal you have.

Therefore, the problem is not achieving your goals, but rather staying sane enough you don't commit suicide. Investing in a good psychologist is very important, and you've got a bit of leeway to get it right, since you get to see how they work out. In the story, human connection is essential to maintaining sanity, so surrounding yourself with good people is a must. Finding them is not that difficult, due to, again, the ability to save scum. They betray you, you realize it, pop back to the main timeline for round 2.

An interesting note is that each timeline fundamentally changes the future timelines. Master Zhao doesn't take advantage of it for not being a learned man, but even taking a single development from each future would eventually result in a massive divergence in future loops. Investing in mnemonic techniques might not be a bad idea.
