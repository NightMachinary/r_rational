The only interesting trick I can think of involving allomantic bronze is to use it to transmit messages. Any two bronze mistings could communicate telepathically by turning their power on and off, using different length 'pulses' to essentially think Morse code at each other. If the average detection range for bronze is large enough, you could use a relay system and turn bronze mistings into a pseudo-telegraph.
