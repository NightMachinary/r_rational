One of many metals I wish I could tap. Is it confirmed that storing wakefulness is all-or-nothing, i.e. you can't store 10% of your wakefulness and get slightly drowsy for a while?

This can also be used as a poor man's A-Cadmium, to get through a long flight, boring lecture, eternal doctor's office waiting room, etc.

I wonder what the downsides are to just storing 100% wakefulness every night instead of falling asleep. Could you store for 8 hours, then tap 50% for the remaining 16? Nice cure for insomnia if so.
