I forget, can Feruchemists tap metals that are infused by other Feruchemists?

If so, you can get a sleep trade started up between the bronze Feruchemists, where some are paid to spend their time infusing bronze so the others can be awake longer. They would have a job that literally pays them to sleep, how envious.

As for the bronze allochemists, look back at all the previous allochemist munchkin ideas. Hire bronze allochemists as guards to stop their shenanigans. For example, last week's zinc allochemists manipulating horse races by rioting fatigue? Station a few bronze allochemists at the races, detect whether anyone is burning zinc, and hunt them down.
