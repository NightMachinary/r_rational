*Mistborn Munchkinry Miniseries Part 7: Bronze*

Ok, week seven of the mistborn munchkinry miniseries, for general overview of the magic system, see [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9zz4sa/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ead595h/][part one]]. I strongly recommend reading the first part of that comment if you weren't here for the past weeks and aren't familiar with the mistborn setting. Parts 2 through 6 can be found here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a23pe3/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/eauwn90/][2]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a4be9x/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ebcx4eg/][3]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a6ftyl/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ebuo08h/][4]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a8lgsu/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ecbqhr8/][5]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/af85cz/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/edw9q7a/][6]].

/Spoiler note/: I will avoid things that I consider excessive spoilers, but the exact workings of the magic system are moderate spoilers themselves, so if you intend to read the books and are sensitive to spoilers you should probably skip this one.

This weeks metal is bronze. As always I'm interested in what a bronze twinborn compounder can do, both here on earth (where they are the only one with this powerset) and in Era 2 Scadrial. For this particular metal and a few of the ones we'll see in the future the allomantic half doesn't do much if no other allomancers exist, so on earth you'd mostly be stuck with only the feruchemic half (plus compounding).

*Allomancy*

Allomantically, bronze allows you to detect other allomancers that are using their power. Once you start burning bronze you can hear faint heartbeat-like pulses being emanated whenever allomancy is used.

More powerful allomancy generates more powerful pulses and the pulses are stronger near their source. As a consequence, the range across which you can detect pulses varies strongly by how powerful the pulses are: very weak allomancy you might only be able to detect from within the same building while very powerful allomancy might be detected across an entire city. Spoilers: At the extreme high end we've seen one instance where pulses can carry across an entire continent, but those were caused by a literal god trying to break free and no allomancer is (or in fact can even theoretically be) powerful enough to replicate that feat

The pulses corresponding to different metals being burned each have their own distinctive signature to them, things like rythm, frequency and whether the pulses feel like they're pushing or pulling are all subtly different for the different metals. With some practice bronze allomancers are able to distinguish what metal is being used, but also things like whether the pulses are strong because their source is nearby or because the source is powerful, whether the metal being burned is feruchemically charged (ie. whether the other person is compounding) and even, with a lot of practice, what the allomancer is doing exactly (ie. is a soother trying to surpress fear or anger).

It is also theoretically possible to detect feruchemy (and other forms of magic), but this is far more difficult than detecting allomancy and no one on Scadrial has figured out how to do it yet.

Allomancy being used near someone burning copper is hidden from your powers (spoilers for next week, I guess), but otherwise things being in between you and your target do not interfere with your abilities.

*Feruchemy*

Feruchemically, bronze lets you store wakefulness. Bronze is unique among feruchemic metals in that it lets you create metalminds while sleeping, as soon as you start filling a bronze metalmind you immediately fall into a deep, dreamless sleep. When you wake up, you don't feel any more rested than before you went to sleep, instead you now have a filled bronze metalmind that you can tap from when you get sleepy.

Tapping a bronze metalmind makes you less sleepy, more attentive and active and lets you go without sleep for longer. This is different from caffeine and other such drugs in that it allows you to stay awake indefinitely without negative consequences, provided that you have enough stored wakefulness.

Tapping more wakefulness than is needed to compensate for lack of sleep makes you slightly more attentive and sharp (as if you've been sleeping under ideal circumstances), but this effect has a pretty sharp cap, being extremely awake is pretty much the same as being just normally awake.
