In principle, that should work. Your question boils down to, "Does the double slit exeriment still work even if you /really really/ don't disturb the particles when you measure them?" The answer is yes. Unfortunately, there are some practical problems with using this to detect a magic invisible ghost that is affected by light without itself affecting the light.

First, and most importantly, living beings are terrible particle detectors. The ghost is probably too big to reliably cover one slit and not the other (without infeasibly large setups that probably require radio waves to keep from just being two separate single slits), and it's probably also nowhere near sensitive enough to detect individual photons or whatever. It doesn't matter what the ghost /sees/, exactly; physics is just as happy to treat a change in temperature as a "measurement", even if the ghost doesn't notice it. But if the quantum state |Ghost after being hit by photons 2, 4, 6, and 8⟩ is not distinct from the quantum state |Ghost after being hit by photons 3, 6, 7, and 8⟩, then they won't disrupt the interference pattern. And if those states are only a little bit distinct, then they'll only disrupt the pattern a little bit. For humans, at least, I don't think we end up different in those different possible worlds.

Second, even if your ghost has a ghostly photodetector tube to make things work, they will certainly need to cooperate in order to be noticed. Not a problem if you do have a cooperative ghost, but an antagonistic ghost isn't going to conveniently walk in between your multiple pieces of equipment and accidentally set up their own detectors.

Third, in order to detect a ghost, you have to already know that it's there. If you're running a double slit experiment and you're not getting an interference pattern when you expect to, your first thought isn't going to be, "Is there an invisible observer?" It's going to be "Damnit, I thought I had it isolated enough. I guess we're starting over." And rightly so; Nearly all "detections" will end up being experimental error or otherwise false positives.

On the plus side, if your experimenter does suspect there's a cooperative ghost around, then they might be able to confirm that. /Maybe./ But if you manage to solve these practical problems, then in principle yes, a quantum interference detection system can notice anything that interacts with the universe in any way, even if it doesn't disturb anything as it does so.
