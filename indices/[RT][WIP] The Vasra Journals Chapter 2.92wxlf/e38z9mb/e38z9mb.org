Six thousand words to a reader is a watery soup, but by Azura (By Azura By Azura) my brain will burst like the heart of a mortal gazing onto Yog-sothoth's sexy cosmic-class body.

Hope you guys enjoy it, the pacing will slow down a bit and involve more character building in the next few chapters.

edit: I think this is several steps from turning into a Japanese harem light novel, gods help me.
