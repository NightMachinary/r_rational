Decisions are not made in isolation, you need to think about the far future and the unknown. If people only think about the immediate effects of their choices, they get suckered in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_auction][dollar auctions]]. Betraying your friends is bad, because being that kind of person will lead to behaviors that signal others to be wary of you. A really simple way to circumvent the issue you raised is to [[https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Ethical_injunction][Promise]] not to betray your friends, and only make Promises you know can keep with near infinite confidence.

Why make such a promise? You're putting yourself at risk if such a scenario arises! But *if* that's very unlikely, and you gain a lot of trust by making the Promise, then it's worth the risk. This is an entirely 'rational' method of maintaining trustworthiness.

To make this clear: being idealistic prevents you from making immoral decisions, but has the benefit that people trust you easily. This is equivalent to making the Promise.

It's not clear at first glance, but being (not just acting) ethical is a very rational decision.
