Honestly I used to think that about dogs and then I got a dog. I tell you, I don't care how many generations of selective breeding have made her love me no matter what, when I come home and see that big black bag of elbows wagging its tail and spinning around with joy, the endorphins in my brain fire off like crazy or something because I love it - probably because the same number of generations of selective breeding have co-evolved me to love it.
