  The way they behave, their facial expressions, the sounds they make are all traits evolved specifically to hijack humans emotions and get us to feed and care for them.

Y'know what else evolved traits to hijack human emotions for the purpose of eliciting a parental response? /The effing human infant/. An infant doesn't display love because it feels the recipient is worthy of it, they display love because they've been given food and warmth and affection and security. Same as any other higher mammal.
