Using your words, let's develop a model. There are people who want conditional love, people who want unconditional love, and since they don't appear to be mutually exclusive, people who want both in various proportions. If what people are looking for is conditional love, then replacing human interaction with a pet would be unhealthy. People looking for unconditional love can often look for it in animals or humans, with little loss in quality. It's far more likely that these people who consider dogs their only friends are looking for unconditional love in the first place. It is also possible that these people want both conditional and unconditional love, but have nobody close to them that can give them the former, so their best relationship is their pet which can at least give them the latter.

This model matches your observations without necessitating unhealthy behaviour.

Along with that, your comment seems to assume:

- A rise in dog culture means a rise in /unhealthy/ dog culture
- The destruction of the American family, etc, is related to the rise of dog culture (healthy or otherwise) through a significant factor for both.
- That dogs evolved due to human interaction is a bad mark against them. Note: humans evolved for human interaction.
- That a dog's love is unconditional. Note: An abused dog will react differently. They have conditions, they're just different to human ones. In light of this detail, many humans are better at giving unconditional love (eg. good parents).

If you have arguments/resources to bridge these assumptions, then I would be interested to learn. Otherwise, they appear quite suspicious.

Since you have expressed that you prefer conditional love (me too), I understand your sentiments the matter. I consider this very much an end-value. Please understand that other people have unconditional love as an end-value. Their existence doesn't signify an end of civilisation brokenness, they've always been here.
