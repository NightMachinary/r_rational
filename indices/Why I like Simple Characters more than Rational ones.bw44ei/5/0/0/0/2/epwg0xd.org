Like, is there anything wrong with the fact that dogs evolved to make us like them? We artificially accepted chocolate bars and double bacon cheeseburgers to be food items that we really enjoy, does that make it somehow wrong, shallow, or otherwise to enjoy somethign just because it was developed to appeal to us?

There's this weird sort of asceticism I've observed in the rationalist movement - I'm half expecting the inevitable response from someone here who has replaced their diet with Soylent because it's more logical/rational than giving into culinary pleasures.

But, ultimately, I feel like life is about taking pleasures when it is appropriate/responsible/ethical/logical, and to me, having a chocolate bar or a nice meal, seeing my dog freak out when I take the leash out for a walk, snuggling on the couch with a romantic partner, etc, those are all ends and there's nothing... shameful about the fact that those ends are pleasurable only because of evolution hijacking my brain. It doesn't make it "illogical" to like those things.
