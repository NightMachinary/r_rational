I agree that you see more about a someone's character when you see what they are willing to give up.

If you can only make that out when "giving something up" means "blundering right into despite any losses" that's on you.

You can understand the values of a rational, intelligent agent by what they are optimizing for. Where do the steps lead? Do they care more about keeping the house, the car, or the dog in the divorce? It's not about whether they are doing something that benefits them in the long term, it's about what they even think "benefits" means.

You want to use Davos as an example of a simple man? You don't think he makes intelligent decisions about risk? Davos, the smuggler? A man who prospered in career that is entirely based on knowing what everyone else wants and thinks and expects and outmaneuvering them? Davos, who got his position as Stannis's hand by, when everyone was concerned with "How do I become king?" showing up to complicate things with "but actually, what SORT of king do you want to be, and would you rather be an unworthy king, or someone you think is worthy of being king but isn't?" Davos is a good man, and his intelligence is intuitive, but don't mistake him for a simpleton just because he's smart enough to effortlessly understand the nuances he concerns himself with.

Simple characters betray everyone around them all the time. They're just too blinded by their own tunnel vision to see it coming.

Robb Stark screwed over everyone dumb enough to trust him because he wanted to do the honorable thing and marry the woman he knocked up. Never mind that doing that meant he had to do the dishonorable thing and break his oaths, or that he would be saddling all his friends and supporters with a small kingdom's worth of enemies they had done nothing to earn themselves. I'm sure that his simple sincerity was a big comfort to all the families that had to find out their fathers and brothers and sons wouldn't be coming home, or who were slaughtered alongside everyone they'd ever known because his army was too dead to come protect his people, because Robb's simple idea of leadership didn't have room for the responsibilities leadership entails.

Simple people are not more trustworthy than intelligent ones. Not thinking ahead from different angles makes people LESS trustworthy, because even when you are sure of their intentions you can't be sure of their actions, and they're prone to forgetting the life-and-death concerns of their friends whenever another simple intention strikes them.
