I think this is not really a separation between "simple" and "rational" as it is between a character with a deontologist and an utilitarian.

The deontologist has fixed values. If they say, "I want to be your friend!" you can trust them, because lying is one of their big no-nos, and they will NOT do it, because they stick to their rules.

The utilitarian weighs their values from time to time. They could say "I want to be your friend!" because they mean it, or because they think even lying is acceptable if a greater good is at stake. They have a very small set of ethical goals and decide everything else on the fly.

Ultimately, that's the problem with utilitarianism: it's not optimal for gaining other people's trust. Harry Potter Evans-Verres in HPMOR is definitely a utilitarian in most of what he does, and that's sort of provided the mould for many rational and rationalist characters after him. But his utilitarianism is exactly what gets him in trouble with people in that story. I don't think it's impossible to have a rational character who's also a deontologist - in fact, in some ways, Hermione in HPMOR is just that, or at least provides that contrast. And this problem is exactly what often drives a wedge between them. I don't think the point of the story was ever "Harry is always right and Hermione is always wrong" with respect to that conflict. Harry gets very very close to complete disaster thanks to his excessive flexibility.
