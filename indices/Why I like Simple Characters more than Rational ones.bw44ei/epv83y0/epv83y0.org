This is more of a morality related issue than rationality related. The probability is probably the same or very similar for both rational and simple characters.

​

It also depends on how immoral this betrayal is, does it result in somebody dying or is it something smaller like inconveniencing rich powerful people? Is inconveniencing a few rich innocent people ok if you help hundreds avoid starvation ? Is it ok if one rich innocent person dies for the same reason ?

​

As you can see this is a morality discussion, to some moral people hurting innocents is unacceptable, to others it would depend on the outcome the scale of the suffering you cause in exchange for the suffering it would avoid. It depends on the persons morality, is one view better than the other ? Does doing good justify doing a bit of bad? How far is it ok to go? etc..
