This comment's sentences might not be in their ideal order. Something that comes to mind here about these two types of people you portray are 'Which would I rather my child grows up to be?'. I think I'd rather my child be smart, careful, introspective and thoroughly-thinking (including and especially when it comes to consequences, and other choosing-between-different-futures and how-to-impose-one's-own-will-on-the-world) rather than sincere shallow-minded cannon-fodder.

​

This extends to protagonists--if one hopes to hope for a protagonist to do well, does it not become intensely frustrating to see them think thinks through on the surface level, then go no further? To see them walk right into self-defeating crises that you predicted earlier and you feel they could have if they had spent a little more time thinking through whether their choices made sense? Or worse, to make self-defeating choices and have those choices turn out fine for them every time because the Author is visibility twisting probability and the world's history to make it happen by coincidence (again, lucky coincidences every time)?

​

It can be fun that if you have two characters like this who have different goals and interact, it's easy to love-to-hate whichever of them isn't the protagonist because they're so hard to deal with(/trust/overcome).

​

That, and people choosing things by gut instinct is painful for me in that how gut instincts often only reflect one's prejudices, rather than what is or is not defensible behaviour.
