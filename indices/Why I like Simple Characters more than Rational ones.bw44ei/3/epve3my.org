Personally, I feel differently. When I observe a non-rational character make a sub-optimal decision because of a "gut feeling" or because it was the "right thing to do" even when others are on the line, I tend to disdain them. I can forgive a character attempting to make a smart decision and failing because "they don't have what it takes" or because their emotional reaction causes them to hesitate, however a character knowingly deciding not to select the best possible option they can makes me view them as selfish or stupid.

Going forward, I'm going to assume that when you refer to smart characters, you're referring to intelligent and rational characters.

  A simple guy wanting to be your friend is just because he wants to be your friend. A smart guy wanting to be your friend could be out to manipulate you for social/political gain and there's no way of separating a sociopath from a genuine friend

I agree that someone deciding to form a relationship with me because they enjoy my company is prefereable to them forming one because the possible material, social or political gains.

I disagree however, that only smart people could be out to manipulate you. Consider the case of the socially/politically ambitious character. For these characters, relationships are formed on a different basis than how much they enjoy your company. I think it's clear based on the high school experience of many and politics throughout history that you don't need to be smart or rational to be socially/politically ambitious.

  Unless it's actively a dumb decision to be your friend anymore, actively something that would hurt the guy more than help him, you can't trust a guy to be genuine
#+end_quote

Strongly disagree here. People form genuine friendships all the time that don't actively hurt them. The vast majority of the friends I've made have been incidental through, school, clubs, hobbies and work. I struggle to think of a single friend I've made that has whose friendship has been an actively negative influence to my goals or values.

  It's only when he does something stupid, something that doesn't benefit him long term, that I see the character is acting on the way he really feels, the way his true values lie. The real him.
#+end_quote

Here I agree that when someone acts counter to one their apparent interests, they reveal more of their "value hierarchy". However, once again, I strongly disagree that this can only be accomplished through stupid decisions.

Consider the case of the character who loves their family, learns that they only way to save the city is to sacrifice them, and does so. Assuming that sacrificing their family was the only way to save the city and that conclusion was reached rationally we learn that this character has some degree of utilitarian values. I think it's clear from this that it is hard decisions (decisions that run counter to some core value or come at a high cost) that demonstrate a characters values much more that stupid decisions (decisions that are reached through poor or no reasoning).

  If no one knew, and no one would punish them would a "good" rational or a "good" simple, impulsive character be more likely to betray a group of people they don't care about to achieve their ultimate ambitions?

  I feel a rational "good" person would be more able to rationalize this decision.

  [...]

  A simple "good" guy would very well be more likely to reject it immediately on surface level because of his gut instinct.
#+end_quote

I think that it depends on the ambition. If it's a personal ambition then I think both characters being "good" characters are likely to reject the offer. Alternatively if the ambition is time sensitive and is related to lives of others or a similar "higher cause" then I agree that the "good" rational character would be much more likely to accept the offer than the "good" simple character.

​

*TL;DR:* I think that when you say "smart character" you mean "ambitious, means-end rationalist" and when you say simple character you mean "honest, moral character"
