Others have said basically this, but I feel like they're not being especially clear, so I wanted to say a quick piece.

I think you're confusing a rational character with one who is cunning or manipulative. You can have a character who is both rational and simple, as long as the author has set up their abilities and motivations that way. A rational character, for me, is simply one who acts believably, given the available information.
