I'm gonna split the difference with you on this one:

There's nothing wrong with thinking of a dog as part of your family, any more than there would be something wrong with a Roman patriarch thinking of his slaves as people within his household. Thinking of dogs as just tools instead of living, feeling creatures is frankly a red flag about just how well someone can rationalize their cruelty to others. Similarly, the friendship of a dog is not particularly lesser than the friendship of a human who is mentally retarded enough that they will never be able to really understand you or the things you do. A simpleton's heart is no less sincere.

The difference between dogs and cuckoos is that dogs take care of themselves willingly and successfully without their "hosts." We've modified THEM to put up with OUR abusive shit and ask for seconds so that we can take advantage of them as living tools. They're the real world equivalent of a sci-fi servitor race.

That said, I draw the line at "fur baby" stuff. For most American parents, having their children outlive them is absolutely devastating. It often leads to suicide, particularly if there are no remaining children, and very often leads to the parents divorcing and going their own ways. Yet I can't think of any "fur parents" who divorced and killed themselves because their cat died. If their feelings don't actually equal a parent's feelings for their child they are just lying to themselves.

Bottom line, I agree that people need relationships with their actual peers to be healthy, but it's also healthy and virtuous to have compassion and affection for your lessers, even if they are dogs.
