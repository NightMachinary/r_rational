You (We) are free to discuss anything man, as long as the topic suitable for the subreddit.

Now, onto the matter.

I think you missed the definition of rational character. It's always motive first, means later. Rational character always have goal in mind before making decision or taking action. If a rational character betray somebody, s/he does not need to make up excuse. Her/his conscience has always been clear. It's the goal that drive. Not momentary decision that need justification.

Characters motive and trait is analogous in some special way. For motive, it has been mentioned (in fiction) over and over again that some is more reliable than other. Greed is more trusted than philanthropy. Similarly, for trait, some is more reliable than other! Dumb is more transparent than smart. And obviously, consistent/determined characters is more trusted on their motive than the flighty ones. This is the reason why philanthropic dumb dude is about equal in trustiness compared to greedy smart guy: trait and motive reliability is about cancel each other.

Maybe you did not like rational character because they're rarely dumb. Indeed they never hold the much despised idiot ball. But we've seen them making wrong decision when ill-informed. Did it affect their trustworthiness?

Their motive may also be a problem. They're almost always for the betterment of life in general. At least among the defining works that's freely available. Their traits and motive had always been on the low side on the scale.

As a test I'd like to tell me your impression about the character named Zorian who is a smart dude (low in scale) with motive for survival (high in scale). Compare him with character named Alanic who's determined (high) with a motive for compassion/devotion (low). I would guess their trustiness is about equal.
