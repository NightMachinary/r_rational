#+begin_quote
  [Out of a random selection of 600 people], 18 of them would be considered dark. Maybe 6 of them would have IQ > 115.

I'mma need to see some math on that one.

3% would be Dark Triad people, for 18 out of 600. Call that Group A. ~15% would have an IQ higher than 115, for 90 out of 600. Call that Group B. There's nothing saying that that's a Venn Diagram with overlapping circles. Group A and Group B could share literally zero members in common, giving 0 out of 18 an IQ higher than 115. It could also be the case that the Group A circle is entirely contained within the Group B circle, giving 18 out of 18 an IQ higher than 115. I have no idea how you arrived at 6

+3%+ 15% of 18 is 2.7, so guessing 6 is saying that you think Dark Triad people are */more than twice as likely/* as "normal" people to have an IQ higher than 115. If I personally had to guess, I'd say 3, because I'm pretty sure they're */not/* significantly more likely than "normal" people to have an IQ higher than 115.

Which was sorta my point.

~98% of people have an IQ lower than 130, so presumably only ~2% of Cluster B types are going to be smarter than that. They're rare anyways, so most of the Cluster B types that most people interact with aren't going to be exceptionally intelligent.

I mean, hell, we could bypass all of that and say that if 3% of the general population is "dark" then only 3 to 5% of people in the "exceptionally intellectually gifted" category are "dark," so it's bigoted to assume "smart people" are untrustworthy.
