Yes, what I had in mind was too about choosing their victims. The prevalence of dark triad is estimated to be about 3%[[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4649950/][[1]]] [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder][[2]]] . Average person knows 600 people[[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3666355/#!po=71.3483][[3]]]. So 18 of them would be considered dark. Maybe 6 of them would have IQ > 115. Of those, how many would have a motive to pull something particularly on you? It's likely they don't know you that well, that leaves the question are you the /obvious/ victim type? That I don't know, but the point I'm trying to reach is that it isn't likely you'd remember someone you know by name as intelligent and dark.
