Narcissists want to be in control of how others see them, so if a human "wrongs them" (ie, calls them out on their personality disorder and/or cuts off contact) a narcissist will want to do damage control so that others view the narcissist as the victim and don't believe the human in the event that said human should attempt to expose the narcissist as the non-human they are, and to do that the narcissist runs a smear campaign against the human and spreads vicious lies through the human's social circle to try to get the human estranged from their support group.

Narcissism is a mask with no face underneath. All a narcissist cares about is preserving the reputation of the mask.
