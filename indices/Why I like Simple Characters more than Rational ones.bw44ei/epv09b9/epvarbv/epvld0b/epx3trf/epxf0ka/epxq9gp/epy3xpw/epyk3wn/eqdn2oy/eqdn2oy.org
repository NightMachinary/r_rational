Never heard of the Dark Triad but I have to say this Dark Triad quiz seems enormously petty. All they care about is getting back at people? Surely a pyschopath narcissist wouldn't remotely care about that?

It'd be like going out of your way to burn an anthill because once an ant bit you. Isn't the whole point of narcissism to see yourself as superior?

Seems to me that it's not a good measure for manipulative people.

Plus questions like these are binary not a scale it's impossible to answer weakly (dis)agree.
