I see, I admit I didn't do the math, just relied on my bad visual intuition. But I realise now that including the IQ distribution was faulty in the first place. As the point I was trying to make that the total sample size of [18 minus the ones that you barely know] is only small evidence of your hypothesis that the IQ distribution among dark people is skewed to the left. But a simplification on my part I agree, as you said, we don't define all manipulative people as clinically dark.
