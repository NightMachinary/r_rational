When I say "manipulative" I mean in the "Cluster B" sense. Maybe not full on NPD/HPD/BPD/APD, but quite a bit more "Dark Triad" than most normal people. I'm not talking about Harry/Draco reciprocity crap from HPMOR, I'm talking about lying and gaslighting. From what I've experienced, they seem to do it indiscriminately to everyone they interact with and only become interested in people who give them the sort of response they're looking for.
