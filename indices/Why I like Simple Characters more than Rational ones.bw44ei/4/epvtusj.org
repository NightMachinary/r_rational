Since this is a fiction subreddit, let me use examples to illustrate my point. From [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/aspects-hp-twig-worm-pact-au.724264/#post-54733534][Aspects]], (oversimplifying):

- Sylvester is rational and manipulative.
- Blake is rational but not manipulative.

They act and think completely differently.

In mainstream media, manipulative characters usually act like they're more rational, but they're almost always more irrational. This may have contributed to your impression.

Edited: removed repetition of others' arguments.
