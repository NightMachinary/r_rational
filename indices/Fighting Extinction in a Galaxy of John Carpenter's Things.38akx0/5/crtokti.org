Speaking of The Thing, which I recently rewatched and fell in love with all over again, I'm looking at an inspired monster to maybe make a small mystery/horror game out of, and I'm doing a lot of research to make the creatures and the setting plausible. :D Unfortunately, or fortunately, depending on the desired tone of gameplay, I can't really work out how gruesome transformations like in the movie are physically possible. It's kind of strange. So instead, my monster is a worm that grows from eggs laid inside you and evolved along with mammals to control mammalian brains. And they hijack their host's intelligence, so this gives you all the impostor paranoia and mystery from the movie, which is the part I liked most, frankly. So it's not quite The Thing, but a cross between The Thing (especially the setting and tone of an Antarctic station) and Yeerks from Animorphs.
