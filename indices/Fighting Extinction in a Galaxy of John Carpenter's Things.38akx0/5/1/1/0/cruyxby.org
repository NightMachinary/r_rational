you seemed uncertain on biological plausibility of things. But to put it another way, there is a lot to be said of complex parasites that don't follow the traditional view of 'wormy' parasites. My favorite of which is sacculina. and considering it's probably possible that things also deal with plants you should not feel limited to just the animal kingdom. Parasitic fungi are pretty impressive.
