An ideas & fiction blog: [[http://whitemarbleblock.blogspot.com/][White Marble Block]]

I run a number of columns on there too, ranging from worldbuilding advice to horror writing to story ideas. I'm still trying to build up, but what I'd like to do is show that, in today's world, you can survive as a writer without aggressively copyrighting everything that you make, so everything is under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.

I also have a twitter account, [[https://twitter.com/The_Idea_Bank][The Idea Bank]], where I post story ideas every day, and a [[http://www.mediafire.com/view/kz4dv41ud9fcbdk/Cyclopedia_of_Comparative_Mythology.pdf][guide to comparative mythology]] written with worldbuilders in mind.
