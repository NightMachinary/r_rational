Except for the purposes of body-snatching, I need an organism that plausibly has the same neural basis as humans, and can hide inside a human body. My limitations are well-reasoned. :/ And my issue was with the /physical/ possibility of The Thing's rapid shapeshifting, replete as it was with bony deposits and chitinous limbs, despite the relatively limited material composition of the human body. Not to mention the massive strength required for a two-meter tentacle to anchor itself to the floor and articulate so quickly and with such force. One would think the infected hosts were consuming the tin along with their tinned food.
