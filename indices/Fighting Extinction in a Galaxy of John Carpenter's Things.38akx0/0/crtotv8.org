On-topic with the thread: there would probably be chemical indicators that something was contaminated with the Thing (kind of inevitable, there's no such thing as perfect imitation biochemically), which would be absorbed into security protocols everywhere. Maybe a detection spray made of nanites would be developed, where they release a luminescent compound on contact, and we can detect the threat level of planets by releasing it into the atmosphere. It could even be a standard part of ventilation systems, particularly aboard spacecraft, it would just need to be safe to breathe.

Unknown species of Things would also be a risk, since they might lack presently known indicators. So even despite the presence of nanodetectors, it would be a standard security protocol. "My partner has been consumed by a mimetic alien life form" would be on page 50 of security manuals.
