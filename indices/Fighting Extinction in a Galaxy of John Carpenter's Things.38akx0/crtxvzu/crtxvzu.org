"Yes". Colonizing living planets is vandalism in any universe. If you can build starships, you don't need planets for anything, and the bio-chemistry of any living planet is with very high likelyhood incompatible with ours in any case, so you would have to kill off the native life to live on them. Converting random dead floating rocks into installations fit for whatever your plans are is much less problematic, and in this case, also safer.
