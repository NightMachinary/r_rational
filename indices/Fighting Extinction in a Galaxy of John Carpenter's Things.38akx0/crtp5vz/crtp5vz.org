Well, we have already been sending out radio signals for some decades, and I don't know if high atmosphere testing of hydrogen bombs sends out some kind of easily identifiable signal, but chances are continuing to use communications technologies as normal here at home is not going to significantly increase the chance of being found. Similarly, anything that would find us on the moons of Jupiter is going to find us on Earth, so the Sol system we might as well colonize/strip mine. Care should of course be taken to not allow anything from outside any colony/ship/station/country to mingle with any kind of animal without being tested. We don't know if Things can take on insect forms and then just land on you and take you that way, so you know what? Mandatory testing for everyone all the time. Realistically, you'll have to prioritize, but we should still definitely implant everyone on Earth with a small machine that tests their blood automatically every now and then, and which has a unique identifier for every person. Failure to have the machine in you is grounds for immediate quarantine.

I'm also in favour of giving everyone a comprehensive medical check up every year at tax payers' expense just to check that nothing weird or subtle and new is going on, but I'd hold that position even without aliens to worry about.

We know that Things purge themselves of piercings and such, so an easy first step is to make everyone have a piercing made out of whatever non-biological material they are not allergic against. Still, I'm going to insist on the tiny machines for everyone in risky places, like off earth, customs, politicians, military, medical personal including cleaners, etc, just in case they can consciously suppress the piercing-removal. Access to sensitive locations, like airports, should /always/ include a quick blood test.
