Depending on your headcanon, it might be followed by "I think that I may have been consumed by a mimetic alien life form whose personality is currently dormant inside me".

I didn't think about unknown species, but that would make sense. Given how flexible they are, presumably they would be differentiated according to chemical indicators.
