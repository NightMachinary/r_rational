He did open by having the presumed final encounter of his adventure attack the players at the opening of the adventure. The in story DM doesn't seem to be pulling his punches. He's also retroactively changing events, altering the rules to weaken the player.

The standard thing to do if a DM was angry with you would be to take them somewhere private, have a chat, if you did something shitty or you don't care about blame offer to buy them a beer or a pizza, ask them if they're having some sort of trouble with work or school and if they need someone to talk (since, they seem to be freaking out way too much over a game). Is there some reason they can't do that?
