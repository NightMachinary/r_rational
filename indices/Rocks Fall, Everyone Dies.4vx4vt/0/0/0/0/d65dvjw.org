I think he's talking about DMing a game of DnD. Not DMing DnD itself, but in a sorta meta-DM way. He'll be playing a DM who is mad with his players in the sub game and the players will be playing players WO are gaming rules in the sub game but the DM isn't mad at them in real life or in the one level game.
