The first task is to figure out how this internet access from the 19th century works. See if I can communicate with the future. Can I make major changes to the past, or is it basically inflexible?

My ultimate goal here will be to gain access to this time travel technology. I don't really understand what happened, but I'm hopeful that I can figure things out.
