No, not really. TCP/IP and HTTP do pretty much all of it. The only HTTP header a client must provide is /Host/. The server will generally reply with a /Date/ header, but that's hardly a deal-breaker. TCP, on the other hand, is more concerned with sequencing, and IP only cares about source and destination.
