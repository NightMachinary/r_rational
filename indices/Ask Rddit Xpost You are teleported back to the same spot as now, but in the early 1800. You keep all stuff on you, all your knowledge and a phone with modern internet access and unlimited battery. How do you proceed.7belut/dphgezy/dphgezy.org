Real glad I'm on the first floor in a city founded well before 1800. I'm a few months late to invent the battery, but assuming this means "January 1 1800" I can still scoop electrolysis by a few months to get myself noticed by the scientific community. Having enough clout now not to be immediately dismissed as a crackpot, I can hopefully explain my situation to the scientific community and get continued living expenses paid while we work out how to implement inventions from the future.
