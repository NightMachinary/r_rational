If this happens at this moment, I'd at least have one pair of socks, gloves, a hoody. Given the time of year and accounting for climate change... probably get frostbite and lose my extremely useful fingers in short order (they're really cheap gloves), or toes, since I'm not currently wearing warm shoes. Also, been trying to run a calorie deficit for a few days, and am already kinda thirsty, so if the cold wouldn't get me, dehydration and starvation probably would.

Assuming that this happens instead on my way home from a holiday feast, the first thing to do is to use the magical internet connection to get someone on video call, stat. It's dangerous to go alone. If the internet connection has limitations that prevent calls, then I'd have to focus on finding a way to survive the winter and find safe food/water. There might be some people within 100km, but I wouldn't rely on it, or with meeting them going well. If all of that works out, I'd either wait for a sunny day, or use my phone's compass, and head in the general direction of the Mississippi River. With the absence of reliable roadways, food, etc, this will almost certainly take several times as long as it should. I think 2mph would be optimistic under these conditions, so let's assume we're looking at a week or so. Assuming /all/ of that works out, follow the river until I find someone I can communicate with. (Also, try to reduce the odds of losing the phone, or having it easily stolen during the "umm, hi?" phase of contact.)

Odds are, the first people I'd be able to communicate with would speak French, and while I speak some, understanding native speakers is another matter entirely. I'd be hard pressed to keep the phone a secret, so it'd almost certainly be stolen at some point, and I'm pretty much doomed thence forth. My best hope would probably be running into a genuinely virtuous, charitable, bilingual person with sufficient resources to have my back long enough to get back to action. Since such people are hard to find and harder to recognize, and we've already required /way/ more than 3 things to go right, It's probably safe to assume me=doomed.

But assuming that /all/ of that /extremely convenient/ stuff works out, I suppose I'd try to play the "no seriously Siri is not a demon... OK, I'm sure there's a seal of Solomon here somewhere..." game until the Louisiana Purchase shakes things up. If I haven't gone beyond someone's pet oracle by that point, "i'd sell information to whichever US explorer/diplomat/merchant will buy. I miiight need to find a way to disincentivize people from screwing me over, but I'm not sure how to leverage what I can get from the internet to accomplish this. Credible oracles really oughtn't make a habit of lies and deception, and we're talking people who would not be sufficiently impressed by predicting earthquakes and hurricanes. I think I /can/ make the phone effectively useless to anyone who would try to steal it, other than the most methodical investigators (If it's an iPhone, screen curtain and voiceover at the highest speed I can understand is enough to lock out most moderns). However, I really /should/ plan for the possibility of my death (what with the terrible medical system and me being the bottleneck for rapid improvement), so I probably would need to teach someone how to use it. And I think I'm bad enough at people that I really struggle to keep up even these best case predictions.

Oh, and try very hard not to contract smallpox, cholera, dysentery, malaria, yellow fever, or siffolus. Like, I'd need to focus on pushing medical advancement very quickly, just as a matter of self preservation. The mosquitos are bad enough /without/ the ability to kill you. ... Ugh, and I just realized all the wonderful biting arthropods I'd have to hike through. If I get warning before this trip, most of my equipment will have to be a ton of granola bars, oranges, and bug repellant. Oh, and V8s. There goes my entire backpack.

(P.S. need to work on my Japanese and put my phone in Japanese. You know, for security.)
