Not only does my city not exist, but nobody who speaks a language resembling any of the ones I speak to any degree of fluency lives within several thousand kilometres.

Fortunately there are Noongar dictionaries online, so I can use those as a starting point for communication and pick up on the language within a year or so.

I think realistically I'd try to integrate with whichever local tribal group would have me. I don't really see the point in trying to do an Uplift, but I'll use my knowledge and internet access to the best of my ability to make our lives easier. Realistically it won't really change much because of the lack of infrastructure.

The first British settlers come in 1830 so I'll probably still be alive when that happens. That'll be trippy for them. I'll offer some suggestions. I work in road design so I'll probably advise them to leave nice big road reserves, and I'll tell them about the gold desposits inland. See if I can meet up with a scientist who has access to industrial methods and work out how to accellerate technology.

Realistically though I guess my main hope is for an idyllic hunter-gatherer lifestyle, which I know is far from actually existed in reality. With some googling I might have access to some climate records from 1800s and be able to predict droughts and stuff, maybe.
