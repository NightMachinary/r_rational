After thinking about this scenario a bit, I realize I'd rather see someone do the harder version:

You are a native of the early 19th century, and have come across a modern-day smartphone with internet access, unlimited battery, and is not locked. The original owner appears to have died tragically. Initially you don't know what this device is, or how it works, but eventually you discover that it responds to the name "Okay Google", and is able to display cat pictures. What do you do from there?
