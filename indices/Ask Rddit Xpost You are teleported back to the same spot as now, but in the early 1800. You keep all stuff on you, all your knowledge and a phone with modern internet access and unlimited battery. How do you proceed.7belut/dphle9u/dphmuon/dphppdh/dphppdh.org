Well, if I get in the same altitude I'll fall to death but at least If civilization survives they will have a unlimited battery to power them in the heath death of the universe. Otherwise I will have to get more information on the internet about local history and some basic information that i would need to survive and not seem suspicious( first ask other people on the internet what information is more important) .

Then I would try to get a place to stay and a job, or figure out how to get at least food and water.

Depending on the situation impressing someone which my magic glowing rectangle that only I can use can be a good idea or a terrible one depending on cirscunstance .

Once I have time and safety ask on the internet for ideas of what to do disguised as hypothetical scenarios,( maybe say that in writing a story about a time traveler to the 1800 and ask people for ideas and info to make it more realistic).

My phone gives me insane math superpowers , so figure out how munch of my awesome computing power I can let people know and what kinds of jobs I can get whith that( I'm actually really interested in that , maybe I'll propose a similar thing but whith only a calculator and no memories of future tech in the next Saturday munchkinism thread ).

I live in Spain so I'll have to ensure I leave the country in a few years.

I'll investigate what happened to me in my original timeline to search for clues.

It would be awesome if I could prove that I time traveled to the people of my time and therefore get help from a ton of experts , but it's unlikely that I will be able to convince people.But convincing people from the year 1800 is easier given that I don't lose mi phone.

On the long term my goal is triying to uplift civilization as munch as posible, and try to make people more interested on x risk prevention and life extension, and If I can get rudimentary cryonics before I die better( but I don't think I would be able to improve tech that munch), and improve civilization in general .
