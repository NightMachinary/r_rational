I'm at a good place for a city, but almost 100 years early. The first thing I would do is try to get to the nearest HBC fort, (found via maps and Wikipedia), then try to get East far enough to reach a city (probably Winnipeg or Ottawa). Set myself up as an academic, and trade technology for a good standard of living while simultaneously advancing Canada as a world power.
