I plummet haphazardly into the bushes. The town I live in has been around for at least 500 years, so I'm two minutes away from the town centre, and a couple of miles away from where my ancestors lived. I'd go find them, because that seems like a laugh. So now I'm in central Scotland during the Scottish enlightenment. I'll go invent electronics and chill out with the cool 19th century rationalist community that was big at the time. I can understand Scots well enough to communicate, I don't think that would be too much of an issue. I'd probably do okay for myself.
