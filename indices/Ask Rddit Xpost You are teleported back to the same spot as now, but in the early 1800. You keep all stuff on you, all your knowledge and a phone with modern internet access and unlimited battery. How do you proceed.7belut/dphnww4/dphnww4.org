Inconveniently I am in Mountain View, which was not incorporated for another century. The San Francisco mission exists, but I'm still in Spanish territory and will be until Mexican independence in 20 years. I don't speak Spanish, and my English will make me stand out. I will also be mistaken for Jewish, which is not illegal in Spanish territory at this time but not convenient. Travel will be difficult.

My best bet is probably to jump-start the Gold Rush. If I can find maps of the biggest deposits/the areas owned by those who made the most money, I can probably do reasonably well and get infrastructure flowing in. Unfortunately this would probably also produce war and totally upend the political history of North America, since war with Spain in the 1810s would probably make the history of Mexico completely different, and possibly derail Manifest Destiny and the political unity of the USA, so the Civil War might not happen. On the plus side, this means that I would have a comparatively early way to check Wikipedia and see if my effects on the future are changing the internet I see.
