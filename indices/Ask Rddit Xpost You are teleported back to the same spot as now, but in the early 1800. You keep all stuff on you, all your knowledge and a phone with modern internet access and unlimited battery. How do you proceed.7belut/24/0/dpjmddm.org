Really? Of all the things you could achieve, that's your #1 priority?

I mean, you only have to wait a few decades for him to be shot in jail /anyway/...

You wouldn't rather, say, rearrange relationships to alter /Hitler's/ family tree? Or take steps to reduce the death toll from the US civil war? Massively expand the body of medical knowledge? Or, if you're more self-interested, you should easily be able to find enough gold seams, buried treasure, etc, to set yourself up for life.

Out of all the endless possibilities, this choice baffles me.
