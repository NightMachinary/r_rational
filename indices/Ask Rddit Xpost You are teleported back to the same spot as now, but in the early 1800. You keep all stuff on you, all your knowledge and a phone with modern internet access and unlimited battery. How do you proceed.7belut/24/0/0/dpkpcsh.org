It's not the best thing I could do (not my "#1 priority"), but due to personal experience it's the first thing I thought of. Joseph Smith Jr. was born in 1806 and died in 1844, but the religion he founded ruins lives to this day. Pop over to [[/r/exmormon][r/exmormon]] to see what I'm talking about.

I've thought of the discussion prompt on my own many times (except I usually imagine an earlier date and a solar powered laptop with wikipedia downloaded to it) and have wanted to see some rational fiction about it. It's the reason I enjoyed [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7568728/1/Saruman-of-many-Devices][Saruman of many Devices]] dispite having no interest in guns. I also really liked the lecture at the end of [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/74/Mother-of-Learning][chapter 74 of Mother of Learning]] where Silverlake points out how modern industry relies on an entire society of infrastructure.

I think I would focus on advancing human knowledge via publishing. I'd allow others to build infrastructure based on the things I publish. I'd focus first on advancing medical knowledge.

What's the most efficient way to get to the stage of mass publishing?

What would happen if people learned about the risks of overpopulation and climate change part way through the industrial revolution (1760 - 1840)?
