I'm sorry to hear that; it sounds like there's a sad story there.

I doubt that whatever happened is Joseph Smith's personal fault, though, in the way that millions of deaths can be laid at Hitler's feet. And the Smiths would be already married by then, so you'd be hard pressed to intervene nonviolently; tweaking Hitler's ancestry would likely be simpler.

Also, the existence of disgruntled people who leave is far from sufficient proof that an organisation is a blight on humanity worthy of being erased from time. If there are people who get upset and leave the Democratic party, should we therefore go back a few years more and erase Andrew Jackson? More likely the mistakes and problems are being made by a few people in this century.

The printing press was already around long before the 1800s, but you could certainly add a lot to what was being printed. Shouldn't be too hard to make enough money to pay for it.
