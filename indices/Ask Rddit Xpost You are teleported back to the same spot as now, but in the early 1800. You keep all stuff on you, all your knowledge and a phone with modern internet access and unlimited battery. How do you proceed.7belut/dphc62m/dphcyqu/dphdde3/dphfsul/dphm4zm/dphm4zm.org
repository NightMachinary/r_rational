Using time loops to brute force dificult things is dangerous ,you are basically creating an outcome pump that searches a future where you stopped the loop, and usually "do not mess with time "stile solutions are easier to find than how to solve ai safety, for example you die before starting the time loop, or you become convinced that you solved fai without actualy doing it.
