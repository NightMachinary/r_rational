If you want to jumpstart the AI revolution, your best bet will be to cross your fingers and hope you aren't in a separate timeline. Using your internet access, set up a communication loop with the future, and use the loop to brute force solutions to difficult problems. Like the FAI one. Eventually you'll want to solve the time-travel problem, too, and then you're laughing.

Without time-travel hacks, you'll be able to uplift to early-mid 21st century technology, at best. In this case, your best bet will be to figure out how the phone is communicating with the internet: it's either technological or magical, and either one means hacks.

And to be fair, figuring out how the unlimited battery works could also mean hacks.
