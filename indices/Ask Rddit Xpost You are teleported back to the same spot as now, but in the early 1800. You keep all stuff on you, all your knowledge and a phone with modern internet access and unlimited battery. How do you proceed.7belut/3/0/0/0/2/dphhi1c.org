I'm referring to the second Great Awakening and Restoration in the US ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Christianity_in_the_United_States#19th_century]]) that undid a lot of the skeptical and rational culture changes that were underway across europe and the colonies ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment]]).

Jefferson and other intellectuals of the time were Deists, for instance, and there was a broad support for science and rationality around the turn of the century that was slowly pushed back by growing anti-intellectual Christian movements. However, care would need to be taken that the Abolitionist origins in many faith circles weren't snuffed out along with the evangelicism.
