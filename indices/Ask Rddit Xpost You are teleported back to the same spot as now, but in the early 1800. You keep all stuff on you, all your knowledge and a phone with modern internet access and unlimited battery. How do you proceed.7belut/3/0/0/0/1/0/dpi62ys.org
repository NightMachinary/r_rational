Yes... I am aware of the difficulties. The large solution space is why paradoxes in closed time-like loops are (probably) guaranteed to be impossible. Nevertheless, I suspect it would be fairly easy to implement solutions for difficult-to-solve/easy-to-prove style problems. Perhaps AI doesn't fall into this category, but as you leverage the loop to solve successively more difficult problems, you may end up in a slow-takeoff scenario. I still think it's the best bet if you want to beat current technology.
