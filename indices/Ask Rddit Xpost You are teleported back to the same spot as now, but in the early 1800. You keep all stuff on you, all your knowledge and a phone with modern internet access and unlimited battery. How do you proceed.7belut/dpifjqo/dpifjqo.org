Step one, panic.

Step two, attempt to contact anyone and let them know what happened. (I can't phone, but I can send out panicy emails. I can work with that.) It won't do me any good, but I don't know that yet.

Step thr - no, step /one and a half/, climb a tree. I should be able to see the (much smaller) city from up there, and it probably won't be more than three or four days' hike away.

...I'll need water, eventually. I can see a river from up in my tree. Food will be trickier, I'll have to find an ally, perhaps in the city... I can certainly 'invent' stuff to pay my way...
