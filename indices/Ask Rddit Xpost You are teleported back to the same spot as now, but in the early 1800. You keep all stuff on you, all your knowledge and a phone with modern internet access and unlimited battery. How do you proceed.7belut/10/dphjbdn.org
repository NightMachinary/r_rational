When you start out, that phone will be the single most valuable object on Earth. You're going to want to keep it secret until you're powerful enough to protect it. Never take it out unless you're alone, preferably at night, with no chance of anyone walking in on you looking into a mysterious light square. You'll be doing a /lot/ of nighttime reading.

You probably don't have any 1800s dollars on you, so first thing would probably be to work a few hours washing dishes or sweeping floors. Once you have a seed, it's off to whichever racetracks have the best historical records in the area. Gotta move around a lot and start small so nobody clues in to the fact that you're a time traveler.

Now that you have a little nest egg built up, start investing. Just like before, spread your investments out and go through middlemen. At this point you should probably hire bodyguards, you're going to get rich fast.

Once you've backed the inventors of the steam engine, cotton gin, lightbulb, etc. (or maybe invented one or two of these yourself, if you like crafts) you'll be firmly set up as a magnate and power player in your city. Now you can start looking at historical USGS data and buying up parcels of land with valuable deposits. Stay away from oil, it won't be valuable for long.

Congratulations, your name is now spoken in the same sentences as Rothschild and Vanderbilt! You can start your own mining/manufacturing industry now. I recommend starting with solar power and communications. Tesla won't come around for another few decades, so you can shamelessly steal the idea of the electric car, and make sure it takes this time.

It should only take a few years for you to become Earth's wealthiest and most-loved individual. Quality of life has skyrocketed thanks to you, and this 'internet' thing is so much fun! Appoint your most trusted advisers to run your factories and server farms, it's time to go stop colonialism.

Regrettably, the British East India Company already has its hooks in the subcontinent, but the real damage hasn't yet begun. Buy the Company. Research where the most valuable tea, ink, silk, etc. come from, go make fair trade deals with those populations.

You'll have to do a lot of micromanaging in Europe to make sure they don't sink their teeth into India and Africa. You could do this by going to those places and giving them the technology to fend off incursion, but the whole point is to let them develop on their own, so maybe just give them medical technology and outbid anyone who wants to set up trade. Up to you and how valuable you think Western ideals are. Definitely give everyone solar and comms.

The greatest catastrophes of the 19th century have been averted and you're by far the most powerful human alive, so now you can do pretty much what you like. You might kill Hitler's parents, but we're approaching a post-scarcity society, so Communism probably never arises for the National Socialists to fight. It might be fun to start the UN a century earlier and then try to unify the world under your rule, but that's a lot of responsibility, and things are going pretty smoothly worldwide at this point. Honestly I recommend appointing someone to do that while you build Xanadu and work on making sure your favorite authors and artists are born (and if not, on recreating their masterworks).

You've given humanity a 200-year shortcut, minus all the pollution and exploitation! Regrettably this doesn't give you immortality, but put your best medical researchers and CS folks on the case. You for sure have access to the best medical technology around, so pump your labs full of cash and hope 2 centuries was enough of a boost.
