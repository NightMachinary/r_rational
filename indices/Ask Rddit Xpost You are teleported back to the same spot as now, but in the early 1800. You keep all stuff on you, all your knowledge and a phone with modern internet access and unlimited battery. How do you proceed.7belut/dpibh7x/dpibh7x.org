I get whatever work I can, live life quietly and try to avoid getting lynched or something (black). I get married and have kids and tell them my story along with where to find me in 2017. They tell their kids and so on until that version of me receives a letter from me telling him to seriously arm up the day of the time jump.

2nd me comes back seconds after I got there seriously armed and while I'm impressed, I become somewhat used to it as more me's start pouring in with weapons, food, and various materials, basically stuff previous versions of me realized we can't replicate even with smartphone research. Eventually more meds stop showing up. Changing the future as much as we're going to means I'm probably not born in this universe.

My army of me sets up camp near an area we can mine for precious metals (smartphone research) and sends out squads to rescue slaves and bring them to my little proto-country. They'll be free citizens but they'll have to swear allegiance to the grand council of Me's. We're friendly enough but we're also basically a Me-worshipping cult. Better than being slaves though right? With the added labor of folks with actual farming experience, the money we can make from mining, and our overwhelming military might, the U.S. has no choice but to let us keep one of their states as our own separate country. A few groups of me stay in America as citizens. They bet on pretty much anything they can research and start businesses/ investing in profitable businesses. Eventually their families get rich enough to bribe politicians and sometime in the mid to late 1900s the U.S. cedes more land/territories to its newest and most terrifying ally.

After that, the focus is bringing all of our resources to bear to find the source of my one-time time jump in the first place. Assuming that can be accomplished, we send squads of indoctrinated citizen-soldiers led by versions of me (plucked from the 1800s) back to different points in time to sew themselves into various seats of power. The me's won't be at the forefront for obvious reasons, but I only trust myself to keep my cult in line.

By 2017 every world leader has agreed to make me (whichever members of the collective got to make it back to the future) their God-Kings and we mostly just use the power to park free and impress hot chicks at bars.
