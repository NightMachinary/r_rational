Great story. Vampire society is damn scary - it would be literal hell to be immortal and bound up in chains like the progenitor of the MC just so their society has control of a single young agent/convert. Unless the chains bit is a lie and (s)he's a volunteer and living in a comfortable prison somewhere - but even then 40 some odd years of complete lack of freedom - on second thought I guess that kind of parallels the MC.
