I forget where exactly it is but there's section like this in ffn.nodwick.com where they do munchkining in a "modern vampire" setting, stuff like their politics resembling an embezzlement scheme, blood draining being marketed as a beauty treatment with no clear association with any vampires and using the fact that most vampires are incredibly vain to use kahki shorts and hawian print T-shirts as a nigh impenetrable disguise from other vampires.
