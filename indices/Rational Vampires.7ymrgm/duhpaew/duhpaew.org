It's a Twilight fanfiction, but it throws the romance out of the window and focuses entirely on the vampires, werewolves, witches and their implications, as rationalist!Bella tries to break everything.\\
Plenty of detailed planning and rational discussion, some messing with altered states of mind, especially with relationships/affection.
