It's best to think of Luminosity and Radiance as two books in the same way that The Lord of the Rings is three. They easily could have been structured as one very long book with some major changes (in point of view, for example) in the middle. If you haven't read the sequel then I suggest doing so, because it makes things happy again by the end.
