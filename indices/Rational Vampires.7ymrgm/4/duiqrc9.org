I'll get a lot of flak for this, but: /Staked/ by J.F. Lewis.

It's pulpy action, not really highbrow. But the characters behave in ways that make sense and the description of vampire stuff (particularly the blood-as-all-fluids stuff and the things that vampires can't do) were very convincing when I read it.

I also read it directly after Twilight and it was a refreshing change; that probably colored it for me.
