I read a book a while ago. Borrowed it from a professor friend of mine. He's very busy, so I don't want to bother him, but I can't remember the name and it's killing me.

It was about the proofs of evolution -- the experiences of Darwin and the other biologists that led them to first form evolutionary theory; the discovery of the coelacanth; the fossil discoveries in Mongolia; the dinosaur extinction; and finally (and most excitingly) the fish without blood in Antarctica.

It was a great book, really showing /why/ we think what we think today about biology and history. Highly recommended -- and I really wish I could remember the name.

ETA: It's /Into the Jungle/.
