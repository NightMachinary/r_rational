The Self Made Tapestry: Pattern Formation in Nature. Excellent book. Very detailed descriptions of some neat things in physics, but still understandable to laypersons.

The Charisma Myth. Much much better than The 48 Laws of Power.

Micromotives and Macrobehavior by Schelling. Also, The Strategy of Conflict by Schelling.
