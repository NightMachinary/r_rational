Something by Roy Baumeister (I'm tempted to say "everything", but it's not practical).

Keith Stanovich, at least Robot's Rebellion.

Marvin Minsky, Society of Mind

Hayakawa is good, but is a bit dated. I'm also very tempted to add Herbert Simon to the list but it's the same. They were waay ahead of their time, but half a century is half a century.

Many people here probably read Jared Diamond - I'm also recommending Ian Morris as a newer, arguably better alternative. (Why the West Rules etc).

If the format is acceptable, [[http://www.amazon.com/Foundations-Cognitive-Psychology-Core-Readings/dp/0262621592][Foundations of Cognitive Psychology]] is awesome.

Nicholas Nassim Taleb - the whole pack, probably starting with Anti-fragile.
