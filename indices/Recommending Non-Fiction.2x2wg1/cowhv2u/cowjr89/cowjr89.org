True and I would recommend that for people who are learning about a specific subject. But I think that people who go to RationalReads are more interested in /interesting/ books that relate to cognitive science (how we think) or decision making (what habits to cultivate) with strong elements of rationality.

In this precise context, it's very unlike you'll find anyone who can recommend things relating directly to rationality. Remember that rationality is an extremely narrow range of cognitive science and there is very little about direct applications to every-day life.
