/[[http://www.amazon.com/The-Man-Who-Mistook-Wife/dp/1491514078][The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat]]/ by Oliver Sacks has a bunch of stuff about neurology in the form of case studies - I highly reccomend it.

Also some of Steven Pinker's stuff, notably [[http://www.amazon.com/Language-Instinct-Mind-Creates-P-S/dp/0061336467/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&sr=&qid=][/The Language Instinct/]].
