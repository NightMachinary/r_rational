It seems to me that there should be some programming books in this list, but I'm having a devil of a time trying to think of one that actually meets the needs of this list. Have there really been no programming books that would suit these purposes?

Some symbolic logic texts might be good ideas to include, as well. I rather suspect there are quite a few LessWrong-ers and other rationality pursuers who have never actually learned the basics of the field itself, including how to construct a truth table.
