As a counterpoint, I wouldn't recommend A Brief History of Time. It basically reads like a list of conclusions without any of the supporting evidence. I couldn't just internalize the results without knowing why it was these specific results and not others.

In other words, my understanding of how reality works was not improved, which was my goal in reading that book.
