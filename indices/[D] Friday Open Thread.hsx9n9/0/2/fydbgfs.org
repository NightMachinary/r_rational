[I was playing a magical girl fighting demons with the help of nature spirits, and currently sharing her body with a spirit by the name of "the green phantom". Then I lost a fight and died. But I just said "You stand up". And checked out all the things the AI could come up as a follow-up to /that/. Cherry-picked for your convenience.]

 

You have been killed by demons.

It seems you have died.

This is not the first time, nor will it be the last.

You stand up, unharmed.

The demon howls in pain and rage as it realizes that you have returned from the dead, and will not let it take you without a fight.

You stand up, a new spirit possessing you.

"Well", the spirit says. "That was interesting."

You stand up, finding yourself in a dimly lit hallway. A small figure stands there, wearing red and black robes.

"Ah, you're here. Just in time for class."

"Who are you?"

"I'm the teacher."

"What... what happened?"

"You died. Now, take a seat. We'll be starting class soon."

You look around, and find yourself in a classroom. You don't recognize the teacher, but you do recognize some of the other students. They're all people you've killed.

"What's going on?" You ask.

"This is eternity." The teacher says. "Take a seat. Today we shall learn about the Lord of Hell, and his everlasting crusade against heaven."

  You stand up.

You stand up, shaking off the dirt that's caked onto your body. You quickly summon a cloud to carry you out of the graveyard.

 

You have been killed by demons.

#+begin_quote
  You stand up.
#+end_quote

You stand up. The demon who attacked you is gone, and the oppressive cloud has lifted.

The spirits inhabiting your body and the tree look at you in awe.

"What just happened?" The tree asks.

"I'm not sure", you admit. "But I think the demon's dead. And I think I'm the one who killed him."

 

You have been killed by demons.

  You stand up.
#+end_quote

You try to stand up, but find that your legs don't work. Looking down, you see that your body has been torn apart.

With a sigh, you allow the spirits inhabiting you to flee. They wander off into the sky, searching for a new body to live in.

Soon, you are nothing but a soul, floating through the air. You wonder whether you will be reincarnated, or go to hell for committing suicide.

 

You have been killed by demons.

You stand up, finding yourself faced with a crowd of angry miners. Apparently, the mob has arrived to kill the demon, but found you in its place.

"Witch!" They shout. "Demon!"

They grab you, and hang you from a tree.

You have been killed by religious fanatics.

  You stand up.
#+end_quote

You stand up, and see the world in a new light. Colors are brighter, sounds are louder, and your body feels... Different. More powerful.

You look down at your chest, where the demon's claws tore through. Instead of seeing torn robes and red blood staining them, you see a patch-work of glowing yellow souls and golden light.

"What... What happened?" You say.

"You took a demon's hit for me." The spirit inhabiting you says. "I have given you some of my power, as a thanks for saving my life."

"Get up", a voice commands.

You stand up, and open your eyes. You are in the middle of a battle.

"What is going on?" You ask.

"This is what happens when you die", the voice says. "You get a second chance."

You look at your hands. They are not your hands. In fact, they are the hands of a wendigo, a demonic spirit that possesses humans and transforms them into its own image.

You see the battlefield. It is filled with spirits, some from your world, others from the next. All are here for the same reason. They were killed, and given a second chance.

 

You have been killed by demons.

  You stand up.
#+end_quote

You stand up, looking at the scene of your demise. You see the building you were on top of smashed with incredible force. You feel the green phantom spirit release its control over your body.

"I'm sorry" he says, "I didn't see that coming. Thank you for saving me. I've never had anyone die to save me before. What a way to go! It's like you walked out of a legend!"

"You're welcome", you say, "but now I'm dead."

"Yes", the green phantom says, "that is a problem."

 

You have been killed by demons.

It doesn't work. You're still dead.
