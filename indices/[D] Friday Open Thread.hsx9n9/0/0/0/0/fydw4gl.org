  You say "That's out of my wheelhouse. I took them out for a test drive, at their request, but they didn't seem interested in having a deep emotional conversation. "
#+end_quote

Gwen laughs again.

"Well, good thing you're a guy then," she says. "I suppose they'll have their clothes back before they leave?

#+begin_quote
  You say "On my word as a gentleman. "
#+end_quote

"Well, that's a relief. Now, on to business."

Gwen gets up and walks over to a large chest, opening it.

#+begin_quote
  You say "Wish-granting time? "
#+end_quote

"Yep, I've decided what I want," Gwen says. "I want you to be mine."

Gwen looks at you expectantly.

#+begin_quote
  You say "I'm given to understand that I get my wish fulfilled, not you. No offence. "
#+end_quote

"None taken. That's what I'm counting on," Gwen says with a smile.

#+begin_quote
  You say "Bold of you. All right, let's see that wish-granting device. "
#+end_quote

"You sure you're ready?" Gwen asks.

"I'm not going to be more ready than I am now," you say.

Gwen nods, holding out the box. You take it, and open it. Inside is a large, black, shining ring, with a red stone in the middle of it. It's quite heavy.

"This... Is this some kind of joke?" you ask.

"Do you think I'd joke about something like this?" Gwen asks, surprised.

#+begin_quote
  You say "My apologies, I was just startled. That's not how I imagined a wish-granting device. In my culture, rings have... A different connotation. "
#+end_quote

Gwen smiles.

"Is it different in your culture than it is in mine? I'm pretty sure it's the same."

"In my culture, that ring means we're married."

"Married? But, we just met!" Gwen says.

"I know, but this is how it's done in my culture. When two people in my culture fall in love, they wear rings."

#+begin_quote
  You say "But this IS just a wish-granting device, right? "
#+end_quote

"Yeah, of course," Gwen says.

You breathe a sigh of relief.

"I was worried there for a second," you say, smiling.

"Sorry to have put you through that. Here, take it," Gwen says.

You take the ring from the box, slipping it on your finger.

#+begin_quote
  You say "So now I make my wish, and it comes true? Anything I want, or anyone? "
#+end_quote

"Anything and anyone. But just the one wish," Gwen says. "You're sure you want to go through with this? There's no going back."

#+begin_quote
  You take a deep breath. "I wish to end all suffering in the universe."
#+end_quote

A brilliant flash of light appears, and everything in your vision whites out.

Your ears begin to ring, as you collapse to the floor. You feel like you're falling endlessly through space, for minutes or hours. Your vision fades in and out of existence.

Suddenly, everything goes black, and you hit the floor hard. You open your eyes to see that you're still in the room, but everything looks slightly different. You feel a rush of wind, as if the wind has been turned on.

Suddenly, you hear a gasp from behind you. You turn your head, and find that Gwen is lying on the floor.

#+begin_quote
  You say "I'm sorry I didn't wish for your hand. Your ass is amazing, but not as important as ending all suffering in the universe... Though I did hesitate. "
#+end_quote

"Why the fuck would you wish to end all suffering?" Gwen asks.

"It seemed like the moral thing to do," you say, shrugging.

"Are you fucking kidding me?" Gwen asks.

"No," you say.

"That's... Well, that's the most self-centered, inconsiderate wish I've ever heard.

#+begin_quote
  You say "Self-centered? I've saved literally every living being from pain. "
#+end_quote

"You're joking. You think literally every living being in the universe is suffering? That's insane."

#+begin_quote
  You say "Okay, I was being a tad hyperbolic. The majority of them though. "
#+end_quote

"I think you're just saying that to defend your choice," Gwen says. "Do you really think people aren't happy?"

#+begin_quote
  You say "I don't usually say this, but, check your privilege. You're the Monster Queen, you have wealth and magic beyond measure, a trio of monster girls competing for your affection, and buff adventurers who will brave every danger for a night with you. I have no trouble believing that your life is free of suffering, but you have to admit you're a bit of an outlier. "
#+end_quote

Gwen raises an eyebrow, sighing.

"And I have to put up with you," she says.

#+begin_quote
  You say "Well, if I'm a source of suffering to you, I'll soon be whisked out of your way. That's rather the point. "
#+end_quote

"You're an idiot," Gwen says.

"Yeah, I get that a lot," you say with a shrug.

Gwen stares at you for a moment, sighing.

"Do you want to go see a movie or something?" she asks.

"Sure, why not?" you reply.
