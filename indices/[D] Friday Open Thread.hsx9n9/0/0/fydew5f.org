Like all the greatest of mankind's technologies, AI Dungeon is extensively used for porn. The most popular user-created scenarios include like a million variants of "fuck this monster girl".

It's honestly more suited to it than to text adventures; its corpus contains large amounts of web erotica, and sex scenes are in general pretty straightforward compared to RPG plots. For the price of a little prompting and retries on your part, it can write content indistinguishable from human literotica but catered to your exact fetishes. It does have trouble keeping track of body positions when there's more than 2 people involved though, and it's pretty much impossible to deter from simultaneous orgasms.

Also, I got to tell a monstergirl queen to check her god-damn privilege when she complained that I used my one Wish to end all suffering instead of to marry her - and she argued back. That was fun.

There is [[/r/AIDungeonNSFW2]] but it's trying to pick up the pieces of the auto-banned [[/r/AIDungeonNSFW]] without the discoverability, so it's not as active as the player base no doubt deserves.
