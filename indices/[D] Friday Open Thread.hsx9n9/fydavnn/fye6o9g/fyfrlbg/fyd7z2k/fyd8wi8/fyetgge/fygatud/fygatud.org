Doesn't Alcor charge something like $200,000 one-time + $550 membership fee annually + $180 CMS annually?

Over 30 years, that's >$220,000.

While it's difficult to put a price on a chance at a new life, I can't help but feel that it's a LOT of money for a maybe. Realistically speaking, how many of their patients were cryopreserved in such a state that they could be resuscitated without significant brain damage? My bets are: not many.
