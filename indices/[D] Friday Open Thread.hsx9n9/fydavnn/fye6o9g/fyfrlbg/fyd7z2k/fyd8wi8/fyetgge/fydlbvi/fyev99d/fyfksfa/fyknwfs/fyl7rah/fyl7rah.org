  ("the president of the cryonics organization Alcor Life Extension Foundation from 1983 to 1988, and Research Director until 1992.[1] He was also the founder and president of BioPreservation, Inc., and a cofounder, member of the Board of Directors, and Director of Research of Twenty-First Century Medicine (a cryobiological/critical care medicine research company) from 1993 to 1999.[2]")

there's no concern that he is anti-cryonics. I think his audience(/intended audience) are cryonics enthusiasts, so he isn't writing like he would if it were more generally targeted. Instead, his goal in writing this was presumably to put pressure on Alcor to shape up, but I don't know that anything changed.
