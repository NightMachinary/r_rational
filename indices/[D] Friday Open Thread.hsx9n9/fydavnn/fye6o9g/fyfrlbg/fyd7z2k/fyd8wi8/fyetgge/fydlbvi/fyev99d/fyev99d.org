Yes! The leading cryonics companies are [[https://www.alcor.org/BecomeMember/index.html][Alcore]] and the [[https://www.cryonics.org/][Cryonics Institute]] (CI). The last time cryonics was in the mainstream consciousness was in the '60s and '70s, and at this time, it was utter quackery and tremendously expensive. That, combined with the morbidity of freezing "dead" bodies, general cultural [[https://www.nickbostrom.com/fable/dragon.html][worshipping of death as a coping mechanism]], and unfortunate lack of effective advertising on the part of legitimate cryonics companies, led to decades of the field being seen as an impossible endeavour.

But since then, our capacity to cryopreserve has grown by leaps and bounds. [[https://www.alcor.org/sciencerefs.html][You can read scientific articles about it here]] and look at [[https://www.alcor.org/FAQs/index.html#][Alcor's FAQ here]]. Nowadays cryopreservation, while it may not be perfect in all respects, is cheap, and has a high chance of succeeding. Considering the benefits, in my opinion it's a no-brainer.
