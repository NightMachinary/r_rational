IDK, life insurance exists outside the cryo world too. As far as I know, insurance companies have to make money somehow, so I doubt it's much cheaper than cash.

The article linked in the other comment about Alcor is kinda... yikes. Maybe cryopreservation is the future, but I think I'll hold off until the companies involved get serious. It seems to me that while the actual theory might be sound, the practical executions are somewhat lacking; they all just appear to muck about with drills and ice baths and hope that future(tm) medicine will be able to fix their mistakes.

But hey, it's better than any chance, right?
