I've heard good things about [[http://www.rudihoffman.com/][Rudi Hoffman]], and [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yKXKcyoBzWtECzXrE/you-only-live-twice][this LW post is pretty informative]]. But I have never succeeded in convincing family members to sign up, despite the incredibly low cost. In any case, good luck!
