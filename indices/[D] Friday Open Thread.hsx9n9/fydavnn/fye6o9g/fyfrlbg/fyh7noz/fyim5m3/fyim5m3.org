i don't even know how i'd tag my posts with a weasel based fursona

but that said the username was inspired by [[https://farthingwood.fandom.com/wiki/Weasel][Weasel from the Animals of Farthing Wood]], since she's basically me: loud, annoying, can't sing at ALL, but people seem to put up with her and love her anyway.
