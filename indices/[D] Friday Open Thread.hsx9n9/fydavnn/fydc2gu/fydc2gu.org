[Here is an AI-human collaborative short story, written (off that same killed-by-demons prompt) by repeatedly asking the AI for a couple of sentences more, and retrying every time I found the new sentences unsatisfying. The story didn't seem to be moving towards a conclusion any time soon, I just stopped when I got bored.]

You walk over to the "Afterlife Registration" desk, where a bored-looking man looks up at you.

"Hello", he says. "Do you need assistance?"

"I don't know" you say. "I died."

"Ah", says the man. "What can I do for you?"

"Well, I died..."

"Quite right", says the man. "It's perfectly normal to be worried about what happens after you die. Where do you want to go?"

"I don't know", you say. "Where do I go?"

The man smiles at you. "Where would you like to go?"

You think for a moment. "Heaven. I want to go to heaven."

"You want to go to the Christian Heaven?"

"Yes. That's what I want."

The man frowns, and pauses for a moment. "I'm sorry", he says finally. "We don't have that here."

"You don't have... What? Why not?"

"Heaven doesn't exist."

You stare at him in shock. "What? But... It has to!"

The man shakes his head. "No, it doesn't. It's just a fairy tale made up by people thousands of years ago."

"It is not!" you say, beginning to get angry. "My... My Grandma went there when she died!"

"Sorry", says the man. "If you're looking for an afterlife where you can be with your Grandma, you won't find it here."

"But..." You think for a moment. "What about... Hell?"

The man smiles. "Yes, Hell does exist. We have that here."

"Oh, great!" you say. "I want to go there."

The man frowns. "I'm sorry, but we're full. We just don't have the space. If you want, I can put in a request, but it'll be a few million years before you get in."

"A few million..." You stop, doing some quick calculations. "But, that's longer than the Earth has even existed!"

The man smiles again. "That's correct."

"You're crazy" you say. "This place is crazy. I'm leaving."

You turn to leave, but the man grabs your shoulder. "Hey, wait!" he says. "If you don't want to stay here or in Hell, you can choose the third option."

"There's a third option?" you ask.

The man nods. "There's a third option. It's a bit strange and new, so not many people take it, but I'm sure we can get it set up for you."

You frown. "Well, what is it?"

The man smiles, and points to a large sign on the wall behind you. It shows a picture of a handsome man in an evening gown, with the words "Heaven: Be a star!" across the top.

"You can become a star!" the man says. "We can make you into a beautiful shining star! Just like in the sky!"

"I... Don't think that's what Heaven should be like", you say. "Besides, if I remember my astronomy, stars eventually burn out."

"These stars are special", says the man. "They never burn out! Well, not for billions of years. And you get to be married to one of the stars!"

You turn, and see a beautiful woman standing behind you. "Hello", she says. "I'm a red giant. It would be an honor to become one with you."

"Er... Okay" you say.

The man smiles. "So, to sum up: You have the option of becoming a star, or staying here and being unhappy."

You look at the two options. Becoming a star does have a certain appeal to it... But you can't help but worry. Will you really never die? You don't know if you want to live forever. Also, being married to a star seems a bit... Boring. You've never been interested in those types of women. But, staying here forever without any hope of leaving seems like a horrible fate as well. At least if you were a star, you'd be doing something. You could be a real contributing part of... Something. You have no idea what, but it still seems better than being here.

"... I want to be a star" you say finally.

The man smiles. "Well, that's wonderful! Stars are a large part of what keeps this place going. We need more of them." He turns to you. "Now, to turn you into a star, we need to make some small changes to your body. We can't have you bursting into flames or anything."

You nod, and the man holds up a small, round object. "This is a Curvite," he says. "One of the building blocks of our world. All matter is made up of Curvites." He puts the small stone down on the table. "Now, I'm going to put this in your hand."

You extend your hand, and the man drops the Curvite into it. "Thanks", you say, looking at the stone. It's a light blue color, and perfectly smooth.

"Now, you're going to feel a bit dizzy, and probably very sleepy. Don't worry, that's normal. Once you've fallen asleep, we'll begin the transformation." He smiles at you. "I look forward to seeing you shine bright in the sky."

The man leaves, and you lie down on the table. After a few minutes, you close your eyes.
