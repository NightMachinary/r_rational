This is the GPT-3 thread. Behold the great mechanical wordsmith in the cloud.

[[https://mobile.twitter.com/xuenay/status/1283312640199196673][Here]] is a list of cool things it has done. Of particular interest to this sub, [[https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3#harry-potter-and-the-methods-of-rationality][gwern's HPMOR continuations]], which do a fine job of emulating Quirrell's teaching voice even if the plot is incoherent.

 

Alas GPT-3 is not publicly accessible (there's a [[https://beta.openai.com/][waitlist]] for access to their API but don't hold your breath), and TalkToTransformer (GPT-2) is no longer free.

However, the free game [[https://play.aidungeon.io/][AI Dungeon]] runs on GPT-2, and its premium (with 1 week free trial) "dragon" model runs on GPT-3. It's tweaked to be a text adventure GM, but there's only so much that can be done when the code is barely understood in the first place. So you can use it as a back door into GPT if you don't mind the continuations occasionally veering back to second person or the topic of dragons. Plus it's a fun game in its own right.

Lots of people in the rationalish community have been posting their AI Dungeon experiments, tedious to find them all but there's a handful on [[/r/slatestarcodex]] (and of course [[/r/aidungeon]] is its own sub; mostly for memes though).

I'll post some of my own below. All on GPT-3. I haven't yet mastered the use of the pin/memory function yet, I know coherence can be improved with it.
