I have to admit, I've never seen that post, and while I haven't read it in full yet, so far it is highly concerning, and I will be reexamining a lot of my previously held beliefs about the trustworthiness of these companies.

Edit: although I do think that the title, and the article's leading picture are needlessly inflammatory, and prime you to think negatively about Alcore and cryonics as a whole.
