Damn, I've been rereading Skin Game before starting the new one. Thank you for the heads up, having the background makes a big difference and thank you for not spoiling anything. If I'd read it without that information I might have thought the series wasn't worthwhile anymore or that my tastes had changed without knowing why it didn't seem as good as the others.
