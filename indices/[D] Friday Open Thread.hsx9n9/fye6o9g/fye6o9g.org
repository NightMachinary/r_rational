This week saw the release of the latest Dresden Files book, which I recommended on Monday.

It marks what is unequivocally the most disappointing installment of a series that I really enjoy. Apparently what happened is it was going to be too long, like 1.5 long books, so the publisher demanded that it be split into two books. They made this demand late into the editing process, and as a result the author had to shuffle things around and cut and compress plot lines.

The end result is incredibly disappointing. It includes issues like the same new information being introduced for the first time multiple times, by and to the same characters. It includes characters who might have a falling apart as a result of plot elements from the next book instead having /incredibly/ stupid misunderstandings in this one. I'm by far the most disappointed I have ever been in a series that is in my top 10 favourites of all time.

The silver lining I guess is that the next book/the rest of this one comes out in only a few months, so this crushing disappointment should not stand as the current state of the series for very long.

But if you were thinking of reading the series, wait until October, because the latest book doesn't have an ending, not even a cliffhanger, it just ends arbitrarily during a little downtime. And it's not even a long book. This is like the first third of the too long book, and on the /short/ side of books in this series
