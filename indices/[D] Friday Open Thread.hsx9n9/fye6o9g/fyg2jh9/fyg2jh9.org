That's a real shame to hear. I've been really enjoying the Dresden Files, so I'll wait to read the next two at once. I wonder if a weak book in the series would hurt the publisher more in the long run than if they'd simply gone with the longer length. I obviously can't speak for everyone, but for me a longer good-quality story is actually a bonus, not a detriment.
