Awesome, thank you! I started it last week and was sad when I got to the last chapter. I really enjoy your world, reminds me of Glimwarden but you have fleshed out a lot more worldbuilding. Ram is frustrating sometimes but that's because you do a great job of keeping the characters consistent.

And every few chapters you show me a word I've never seen! Vocabulary lessons!
