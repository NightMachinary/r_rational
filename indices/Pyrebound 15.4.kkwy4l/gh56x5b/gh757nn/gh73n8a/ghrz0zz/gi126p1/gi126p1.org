I started reading your fic today and breezed through part one. Your writing style is very smooth and easy to read, and the plot started off with a bang. I love how even though Ram's world and culture are completely foreign, his problems definitely aren't, and that makes him relatable. I'm already invested in seeing how Ram handles the bad hand he's been dealt. Worldbuilding is great too, makes his harsh world seem beautiful. Thanks for writing!
