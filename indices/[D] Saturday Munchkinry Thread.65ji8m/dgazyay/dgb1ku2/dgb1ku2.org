Time passes at a 1:1 rate /within/ the daydream, but what's it like outside? If I'm on a train ride and make a daydream, like an impromptu dance party on the train, that lasts until I get off the train, will I wake up at my destination or only a few minutes/seconds/instantly after starting to daydream?

If it's 1:1 with outside time as well, then assuming I'm physically in a 'daydream state' of being generally silent and zoned out, using the power in any social context is all but impossible. I'd have to find a good place to zone out and at least a few minutes for any good social use of it. I can't use it to 'get right' many things because many things are time sensitive and I'd have to daydream through the event to simulate it.

However, while in a daydream I happen to have an interesting trait found commonly in time loop stories, the complete and utter absence of consequences. I can take a gun and run through the streets shooting it wildly and, in the real world, suffer nothing from it. Were I entirely unscrupulous, I could take at least a knife or something, and torture people for info I wanted. Need to ace a test? Wave a knife at the teacher and demand the answers (during the lunch hour when I can be zoned out reasonably). Want to know if someone's hiding something? Point a gun at their head and demand an explanation.

For a less ethically compromising variant, it gives a good skillset for investigation of all varieties. Approach the area ahead of time in a daydream, note failure points, and use that to make the real deal more successful. Of course, you can /also/ combine that with pointing guns at people's heads and demanding answers, if you can convince yourself to do it.

The last real trick is going public with the power, or at least that I have /a/ power. For controlled tests, I can ask a tester to write down a different thing on two separate pieces of paper, and conceal them however they like. Then, I will ask to read one paper and tell them what's in the other. Once the papers are concealed, I daydream asking for paper A, read it, then wake up and ask for paper B, reporting on what's on paper A. A single-paper version of this experiment would have a challenge in that in the daydream I'd have to convince them to let me read the paper despite that invalidating the experiment, but a double-paper setup sidesteps that.
