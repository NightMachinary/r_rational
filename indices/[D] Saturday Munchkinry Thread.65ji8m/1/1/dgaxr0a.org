Well since you can't choose whether to contaminate something the best bet is to simply pick some bedrock nearly anywhere on earth. You will immediately spread to the entire continental crust, then to the oceanic crust and pretty much all of the earth's crust.\\
The ability to spread to any connected solid surface that's coarser than sand is /incredibly/ powerful, since once you get very deep pretty much all the earth's crust is connected by solid material coarser than sand.

So yeah you pretty much instantly spread to the entire earth's crust, with the exception of much of the surface where things are covered by soil, sand and the like. Still people definitely notice that every mountain or any area of rock or gravel that connects to bedrock indirectly suddenly becomes green.\\
Right from the get go nobody's going to stop you and all buildings with remotely deep foundations are also green, which extends to all connected concrete (thus including nearly all roads).\\
Most trees are probably also affected if their roots go deep enough to reach coarse soil, and well it seems like a great amount of the population and many animals are immediately green.
