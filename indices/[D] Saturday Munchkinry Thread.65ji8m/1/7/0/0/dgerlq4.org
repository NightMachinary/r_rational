Yeah, this was a really fun one to think about though. I enjoyed it.

I change my answer to a train track on a level crossing in a highly populated city. About an hour before the sun comes up.

I should be on every train wheel and a solid line on the train tracks before the sun comes up.

Hopefully I'm an entire glowing rail network, and on thousands of car tyres, and all over the road network before the sun comes down and I'm much more noticeable.

The pests in the city are another spread vector once I get on their feet.
