Never mind Alzheimer's, as you are dying, your brain gradually stops working. Just before 100% of you was dead, only 99.9% of you was dead, including 99.9% of your brain. So wouldn't you end up reincarnating as basically a blank slate anyway because when you were last still alive, almost all of your brain was gone?

Also, if a soul doesn't carry memories and experiences, keeping the same soul is as meaningless as saying you get to keep the same atoms in your body.
