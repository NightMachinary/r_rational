This does nothing for me until I die, an outcome still to be put off as long as possible (I'd end up in a messily uncoordinated body without any of my current support structures). It does mean that my next body gains a substantial advantage in already having a complete education at the age of two (but I'll probably have to re-learn things like how to talk).

...those first two years are going to be one long embarrassing moment.
