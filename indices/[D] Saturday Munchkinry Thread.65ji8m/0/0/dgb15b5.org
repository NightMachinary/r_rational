This is almost as powerful as Coil's power for the purposes of information gathering. Depending on your morals, lead-pipe legilimancy yields all the passwords you need.

I shall assume that we don't see ending a daydream as killing everyone in it. (Other people within the daydream may disagree, of course.)

An easy tactic to use this power for great good is to daydream going public with your power on, say, reddit, and asking people for a way to prove it to them on the next daydream using, say, a PGP-signed message from other people to themselves saying that it originated inside what was claimed to be a daydream. The public could then spend all its ressources immediately on acquiring knowledge and give it to me to (anonymously?) make public. This would be dangerous as this might leak the existence of this power - for all I know, someone is holding back a piece of research right now with a prepared channel of steganography for just such an occasion. Note that if I can resist being convinced to go public for real, this puts the brainpower of the entire world behind thinking up more ideas for me without myself having actually gone public.

An easy way to make money is to mine bitcoins using proof-of-work stolen from daydreams. Not sure how to do it without possibly attracting attention.

Physicists might be highly interested in the effect of chaos theory on quantum random number generators on the other side of the planet within less/more time after the divergence point than light would take to reach them.

Great care must be taken with this power after anyone has the ability to release an AGI, given their ability to break out of such boxes. Using it continuously then halves the time we have left in the worst case, even without doing anything different in the daydream.

Edit: What happens to a Schroedinger's cat if you look in the box in a daydream? If its state collapses, anyone with a quantum computer might send messages out of a dream, so be careful with going public even in a dream. If it doesn't, I'm not sure how exactly, but quantum computers should be more powerful in your hands.
