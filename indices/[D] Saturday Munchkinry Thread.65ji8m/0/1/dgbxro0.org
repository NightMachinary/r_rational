Hmmm... I can glance over a scratchcard for a lottery - the sort where you scratch it off to see whether or not you can win anything - and decide after a brief daydream whether or not it's worth the price with no actual risk taken.

I can daydream my way into cheap but relaxing holidays, and daydream my way through free entertainment. (For example, I could daydream my way through watching a movie and conveniently wake up back home without having to pay for the ticket).

I can become an untraceable spy - daydreaming my way through breaking (inexpertly) into a room and carefully reading through secret documents, only to wake up with the real documents undisturbed and thus no evidence left as to how that info got into my head.

I can become a useful risk-free test pilot - once I learn how to fly a plane (perhaps daydreaming my way through the lessons?) I can sit in the cockpit of a newly designed plane for a couple of hours then wake up and tell the engineers what /really/ needs to be fixed /now/. (This will require demonstrating my powers to said engineers).
