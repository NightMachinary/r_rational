Your daydreams are now 100% accurate, meaning that if you imagine yourself doing something, how you imagine everyone and everything reacts is exactly the same as how they would react in real life.

RULES:

- These daydreams must always begin at your current moment.

- Time passes at a 1:1 rate; if you want to do something on the other side of the world, you have to keep daydreaming for the whole 13-hour flight; stopping the daydream will cause you to restart back where you are in real life.

- Your senses in the daydream are no greater than those in real life.

- If you die in the daydream, nothing happens; it just ends.

How do you take advantage of this power?
