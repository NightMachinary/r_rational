One thing I think people missed in your scenario is that it never says actually says you are limited in what you can imagine yourself doing. So of course unless that's patched (or maybe it was intended to have that exploit) it means you can just imagine yourself conjuring your desired FAI from thin air. Then the world reacts realistically and the FAI tells you how to make it as quickly as possible.
