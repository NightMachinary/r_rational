Am I correct in assuming that we are essentially an ever repeating ink stamp in the way we spread, not something that grows and spreads?

If so I'm certain we will be treated like a contagion and isolated pretty easily once awareness is raised.

I want to be economically unfeasible to remove or contain after public awareness kicks in.

I would definitely want to get my tendrils into the ocean for the long game and eventually start appearing on shorelines around the world with no hope of ever fully eradicating me.

I want a more explosive start than that. Animals will be a great ally. I want me some ant colonies and migratory birds for sure.

Bees? It would be nice if people went... "well we can stop the bees, but we probably shouldn't. Guess we have to let them touch literally every plant everywhere."

But forget all of that.

STICK ME ON THE DOOR HANDLE RIGHT BEFORE A MEETING BETWEEN WORLD LEADERS.

Or stick me right in the middle of the forehead of glorious leader Kim Jong Un.

I like drama.
