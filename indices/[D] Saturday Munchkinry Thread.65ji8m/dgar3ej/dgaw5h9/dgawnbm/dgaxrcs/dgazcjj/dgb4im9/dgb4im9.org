1. Do disconnected patches share their consciousness/memories/etc.?
2. Does mental processing power scale with area?

If 2, it seems like you could pass yourself off as a novelty mirror or the like. Just reflect what you see, maybe putting a spin on it Ã  la Snapchat filters if the user wants it. You could also copy the appearance and sound of anyone you'd seen and heard, e.g. to mock an enemy for the amusement of the "owner".

It wouldn't be too expensive to make an additional device to convert your green-tinged output to true colour (unless your output is strictly limited to the visual spectrum, in which case you'd introduce some noise in the process), so long as the patch has the processing power to perform that conversion. You could, of course, explain the process to any entrepeneurs that happened upon you and felt like becoming filthy rich

If 1 also, you could effectively market yourself as ultra-fast internet that can be put on countless easily made surfaces. Chat with somebody on the other side of the world for free, act as a bug (the spying tool) or security camera, etc.

If 1 but not 2, you're going to quickly run into a problem with any approach like this. If neither 1 nor 2, your usefulness is limited but not negated.

In terms of starting position, anywhere that people are likely to notice you and not immediately attempt to scour you is good. The best option for a human-centric strategy is going to be starting near a curious human, preferably one who would like to show you to the world (for the sake of knowledge, money, or humour; it doesn't matter).
