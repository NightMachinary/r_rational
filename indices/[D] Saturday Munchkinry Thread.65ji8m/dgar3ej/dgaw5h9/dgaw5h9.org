Start in Hartsfield--Jackson Atlanta International Airport which is the busiest international airport in the world as a random patch on the floor. Copy myself onto multiple individuals' shoes, but only at the rate of one out of 25 shoes or so, so I don't replicate /too/ quickly and raise suspicions. By the time anyone notices multiple copies of myself, I will have seeded myself all over the world!

Note that all replications are from floor to shoe or shoe to floor. No growing any patches. It's more important to have many tiny copies of myself than it is to have fewer, but larger, copies.
