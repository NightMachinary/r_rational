Do I contaminate anything that displays me?

So, for example, if there is a photograph of me, is the green in that photograph also part of me?

If so, it's easy to become ubiquitous to the point where I can't be gotten rid of.

If not, then - my starting square centimeter doesn't have to be square, does it? I'd like to start out as a small note in an alley that reads "Smear Me" over a total of one square centimetre.

Anyone who touches me and then runs their finger along the wall will find that I make a great tool for graffiti! I'll probably be all over the wall in a couple of hours.

And then all over everything else that guy touches.

And then, once I have a decent area, I can start trying to persuade people to spread me further - generally by befriending them and being useful. (The local police can certainly use me as a surveillance tool...)
