The slime is interesting. Essence well does /something/ to it. I wonder if it's related to essence monsters.

I guess now isn't the time to try it, but I'd like to see what happens if he dumps a full mana bar into the smile via essence well. The ability to create tamed Essence Monsters would be a gamechanger.

I'm also very glad that he's breaking down the wall with hydraulics. I was not at all a fan of the 'work out until you have the strength to move boulders' plan, so this one seems a lot smarter. The old plan would see him dead of starvation before any meaningful gains, but this should probably work.

Also thermal shock should work on stone too. I know that extended periods of cooking can make stone incredibly brittle, but mageburn might be a concern. However, you /could/ do something like heat up everything within 3 meters, and then strongly cool down the nearby areas within 1 meter. So that the far side of the stone keeps getting hot and the close side gets really cold. The temperature differential should cause the stone to break if he can keep it up long enough to affect it (which I think he can).

Not sure if it would be faster than hydraulics, but might be a nice backup if he runs into any stones he can't get dig a fissure into.
