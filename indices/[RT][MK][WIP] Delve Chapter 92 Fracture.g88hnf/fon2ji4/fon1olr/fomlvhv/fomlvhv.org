The slime is getting me really excited. Either Rain's going to find a way to increase his level cap and make his own safe and easy to kill high level blues by pumping a weak slime full of mana(notice Dozer took 100 mana, at level 1. Hmmm), or he's going to raise an incredibly powerful pet and pump all his excess EXP/Mana into him, and maybe we'll get a second Slime god. If only updates happened quicker, I'd really love to see what loophole Rain creates and exploits quicker.
