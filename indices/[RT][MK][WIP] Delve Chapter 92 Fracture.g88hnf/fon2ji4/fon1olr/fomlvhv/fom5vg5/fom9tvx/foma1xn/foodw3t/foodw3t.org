If he can't figure out what to do with the slime after all this is over, I think it'd be pretty cute to offer it to Ameliah as a birthday present or something. A level 50 slime god pet pal for her to take on her adventures would be hilarious. Or offer it to Talheart. It would be the perfect companion. Doesn't talk. Doesn't poop. Can store money. Itd be great.
