So in a lot of comments on the story, people are expecting her to end the invasion and kill all the Dwarves. I agree that's likely considering the way the story has gone so far. However, wouldn't it be much smarter to see if she could side with the Dwarves and get a favor or three? She didn't really have a dog in this fight and the Drow are fucking terrible.
