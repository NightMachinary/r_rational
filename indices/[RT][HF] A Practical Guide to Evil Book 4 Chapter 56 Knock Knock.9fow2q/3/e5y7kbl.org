Well, on the bright side it will be easier to get a drow alliance if she figures out a way to save their civilisation. Now all she needs to do is turn back a massive invasion, decades in the making, by the most powerful force in the continent and she can't be seen to kill a single one of their soldiers....and it has to be done before one of the other great powers in the world invade Callow since they all have reasons to do it.

At least it's unlikely that the rats or gnomes will get involved.
