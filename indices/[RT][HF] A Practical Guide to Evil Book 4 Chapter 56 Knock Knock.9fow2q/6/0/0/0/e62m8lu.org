I don't see any way where a fight against the dwarves ends well. We've heard over and over again how powerful they are as a nation and how easily they can be angered, and no amount of spit, vinegar and horrific self-mutilation from Cat's part is going to help if the cities of Callow start sinking into the earth because she stepped on the wrong toes.

Unless something really drastic comes up, she just can't afford to give them a reason to spite her. Even if she just tricks them in some manner which gets her what she wants, she has to do so in a way which leaves them either satisfied or unaware.
