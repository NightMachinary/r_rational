It would be horrifically hilarious if this entire dwarven invasion is the result of a drow killing a single dwarf some time ago. The previous chapter mentioned that killing one dwarf would cause the entire race to come down upon the killer's location and wipe it out.

It also means that Cat & Co's hands are tied when it comes to assisting the drow. Either they do so while hidden, or kill all witnesses (much like the dwarves are doing to the drow, actually...). I think the smartest thing to do would be to find some way to destroy the dwarven lanterns that the main army has, which would cause them to get lost in the Gloom and be unable to meet up with the vanguard. Then make sure none of the vanguard escape alive. But that still means having to deal with 15k+ dwarves who have already slaughtered at least three sigils seemingly without issue...
