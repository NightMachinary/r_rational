Seeing how the lamps are fragile sunlight devices, Cat's title as the Duchess of Moonless Nights should be a pretty scary thought for the dwarves.

Still, I don't think Cat can afford going against them. From what we've heard, they'd burn down Callow and salt the ashes if anyone ever caught a whiff of her actions resulting in the deaths of thousands of dwarves and the failure of their astronomically expensive invasion.
