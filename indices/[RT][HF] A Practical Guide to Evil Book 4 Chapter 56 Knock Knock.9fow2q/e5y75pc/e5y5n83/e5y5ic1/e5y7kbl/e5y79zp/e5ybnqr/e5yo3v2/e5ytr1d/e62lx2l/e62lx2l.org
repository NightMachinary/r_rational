  Still, I don't think Cat can afford going against them

So what is the alternative? She evacuates a warlike race as they're under attack, or she just leaves and returns to the surface? Or she enlists the dwarves - a "Good" race - to her cause?

I think your objection makes sense, but narratively it's a dead end. Cat will almost certainly do something to the dwarves, and it won't be backing down or befriending them!
