A pleasant fantasy! I am put in mind how 'Living well is the best revenge' never made much sense to me until reading various novels and realising "Ah, it wasn't just living well--it was living *better* than them, and *staying socially connected with them so they and lots of their social acquaintances can see you living better and you can see them seeing it*/./". A concern being that the more contact you have with them the more opportunity they have to pull your legs somehow in spite.

Immediate thoughts afterwards: it feels as though memory-searching could be scheduled earlier to account for increasing times, or--even better--the same automatic system that puts the thread of attention there on time could also serve up an index/pointer for those particular relevant memories without needing to search the entire archive from scratch.

(Also, yes, of course it bothers (or would/will bother) them, as I imagine the person imagining them not being bothered actually understands. <smile>)
