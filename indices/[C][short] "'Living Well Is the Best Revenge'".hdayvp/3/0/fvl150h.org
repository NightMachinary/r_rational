Hi, thanks for commenting! (Upvoted.) Can you be a /little/ bit more specific? "Eh. Lame" doesn't help me get better as a writer, because it doesn't tell me /what/ I should do differently in the future, whereas /specific/ criticisms like, "This does not have a plot" or "Those clauses about 'humanly-incomprehensible' /&c./ are really clunky prose" are more actionable.

To this you might perhaps reply, "But the function of my saying 'Eh. Lame' wasn't to help you improve as a writer; rather, it was merely a low-dimensional signal intended to help fellow [[/r/rational]] readers decide what's worth their time to look at." However, I tend to think downvotes are better suited to this purpose (rather than nonspecific negative comments)---do you disagree?
