Hah! Aren't offensive comments more flavourful than mere downvotes, though? Personally, I hate upcummie systems on sites like this. They're highly legible, but wrench all incoming information into that legible structure in a way that neuters the 'feel' of the website. It's the old 4chan vs. web 2.0 dynamic.

Anyway, I'll try and give an honest review.

The word 'lame' has had an interesting etymology. As I understand it, originally, it merely meant locally disabled: You have a lame leg, or so on. Later on, it was used as a specific pejorative, directly based on the original meaning of the word: something that's lame is limp, lacks motive power, is weak, etcetera. Later, I think the word's use got more and more generic, to the point where most people used it as a simple alternative to 'bad', or any other not-really-that-offensive pejorative. (Ironically, 'lame' itself became a pretty lame pejorative!)

Anyway, it was sense no. 2 in which I commented. It was a vague feeling I got reading the story, so the following is introspection and self-armchair-psychology.

You'd want a short story to be, in some way, /striking/; you want the story to be interesting; to have some power, a point. I think this story has a point, but it falls flat in a way that robs it of motive power, renders it weak.

Where's the power in the vignette meant to be?

In layers:\\
First the backdrop of the pedestrian suburbanites, not especially morally strong (and implicitly guilty of some sin of some sort during the god-child (your)'s lifetime), but living long and inoffensively happy lives. On top, you have the childish god, impish, but still at heart good, who comes along every now and again and screams 'fuck you', not bothering the suburbanites. Now, the implicit ethical layer is where the point of the story lives. The revenge is living well: Let the suburbanites have their paradise, while you ascend to godhood, your mind exploring things they could never understand, whole universes flourishing and folding up in a whisper of a thought-

And this being, descended from a human, of such supposedly morally valuable complexity, is just leaving the suburbanites to their mental suburban hell of missed opportunities. They don't change, they don't have the chance to /see/, they live in the continued forced squalor of a human head, and the god-child is fine with it. You've condemned these people to hell, their heads wrapped in a vice, and they don't even know it. The god-character /did/ have their revenge, in the end- one that only they could truly understand, knowing how much they were denying from these baby superintelligences, and knowing just how they could nudge-nurture their growth without any moral harm ensuing. But they don't do that, because if they did, the story couldn't happen.

The story presents a high-minded virtuous air, with the childishness as a punchline. But the framing falls flat trying to justify the story. The framing needs suburbia to still exist, so the superintelligence's ideas about suburbia have to be weak and boring. So the framing, the whole story, becomes as /lame/ as the suburbanites it prides itself on having pity and compassion for.

TL;DR: the god-figure is just as pedestrian as the people it's playfully mocking, but not in the way you think, and it's worse because it would know what it's doing, making it more morally culpable. But the setting is presented as an okay place; to a friendly superintelligence, I think this setting would be a dystopia. The story doesn't seem to get/acknowledge this impression, so it's weak/lame.

Anyway, this comment wasn't very well written. I'm not good at putting feelings into words, and I think I failed to communicate what I felt reading your story properly. If you have any follow-up questions, or want clarification, don't hesitate to ask.
