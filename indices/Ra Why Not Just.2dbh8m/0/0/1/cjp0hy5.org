The fight confused me at first because I had thought that The Glass Man was sort of like a "Incarnated Ra" built out of thin air like that mech created by Abstract Weapon all those chapters ago. You did a good job of establishing its dominance when it first nicked the Bridge from Laura.

But then in this fight it turns out to be a /human/, which is a step /down/ in power that kinda threw me off at first. Hope that makes sense.
