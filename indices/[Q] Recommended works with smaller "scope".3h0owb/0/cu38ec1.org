Looking through [[/r/rational/top/]] (and limited to those I've read):

- /The Martain/, a man has to survive alone on Mars (exotic location but small scope)
- [[http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/the-cambist-and-lord-iron-a-fairy-tale-of-economics/?xcbv][/The Cambist and the Lord Iron/]], a story about economics in a small city

Everything else accelerates in scope towards the end or just starts with a scope that's quite large. (Or I haven't read it, or I don't recommend it, or I was skimming.)
