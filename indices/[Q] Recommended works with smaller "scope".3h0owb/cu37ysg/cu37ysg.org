You need to try E. E. Smith's stuff. It's the trope-namer for [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LensmanArmsRace][Lensman Arms Race]]

His first novel was "Skylark". They start out with handguns and by the last book they're using entire galaxies as weapons.

Err... maybe you need to not try it.
