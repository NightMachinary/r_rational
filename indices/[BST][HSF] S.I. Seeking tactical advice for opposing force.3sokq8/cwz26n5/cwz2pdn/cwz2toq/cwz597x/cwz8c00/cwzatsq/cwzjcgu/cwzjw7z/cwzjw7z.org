  Where did the leak come from?
#+end_quote

A copy boy at the Story Town Times runs an extra copy of in-progress stories, and stories the paper decides not to run, to a dead drop, which he thinks is picked up by a local pro-Changed activist group. He receives a small stipend for his troubles at the same drop. The operation is run by a local cut-out, who takes the info and passes it to a Free Company maildrop, and takes cash from the maildrop to pass back to the copy boy.

  Is it reliable?

The copy boy doesn't manage to pass on every story, but everything he's passed on seems to be genuine internal documents from the newspaper.

  Is it possible to get more information from the source?

Possible, but difficult - even if the copy boy could be persuaded to actively look for papers, it's unlikely the reporter involved has left such papers where he could find them. Some sort of clever plan would likely be required...
