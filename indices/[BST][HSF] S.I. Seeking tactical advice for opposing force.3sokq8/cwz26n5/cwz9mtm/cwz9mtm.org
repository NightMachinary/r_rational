Okay first off this just screams to me like a rushed military operation, because they are trying to kill Bunny with only 3-4 days of planning before her scheduled departure. In addition, even if they don't reveal the existence of clones, they are still allowing valuable information to escape if people learn about an unknown military force which implies a strong independent organization. I'd attempt covert strategies only, with the squads attacking only if there is no other option left and if they truly think they can win easily. Retreat is required at some signal upon %(loss of fighting forces) or else everyone will die. Coordinating armies is HARD!

Also note that due to Bunny's equipment being of higher value than the knowledge of the Company's existence, I'd think about rearranging that list of priorities, because it's harder to take back a secret once it's been revealed than it would be to try again for Bunny's equipment if the secret is still safe.

Right off the bat, I'd recommend lying traps with explosives in the path that Bunny is expected to leave. Or if Munchkin is believed to be so durable that it'd survive explosions, then I'd be looking into digging disguised trenches to prevent Munchkin from being able to move. I don't know how difficult it'd be to dig a large enough pit to crash Munchkin since there is no mention of how many men 'I' have, but if I don't know about Munchkin's ability to navigate difficult terrain, then I would be using bombs and camouflaged pits in Bunny's expected routes of departure.

That's last-resort plans which require significant prep time. Now for more immediate plans, I'd look into any other enemies of Bunny who are in the area for an alliance. I don't know if there are any, but if there is, then I'd present myself as mercenaries hired by people angry at Bunny. I'd try to get Bunny to leave Munchkin by paying people in the nearby town to give her services as some sort of gratitude from an anonymous benefactor. This works if Bunny has recently helped the locals, but even if this isn't the case, then Bunny has probably made friends with powerful people who can send a message and money to the local spa, restaurant, bar, or some similar place to relax. If this works, then she's away from Munchkin. If not, then maybe she'll eat the complimentary poisoned chocolates that were sent with the invitation. Note that the messenger only gives her the chocolates, if she refuses the leave Munchkin.

I noticed that you don't mention any plans to use snipers, is there a reason for this?

That's all I've got!
