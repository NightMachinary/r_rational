Okay, I removed the spoilers from my previous post.

Taking into account the information about the racists, I'd use them to lure Bunny out of Munchkin. Then, release chemicals /behind/ the crowd and not by Munchkin. This way people will be frightened and run /towards/ her and Munchkin. Now we've got our agents who were seeded in the crowd (and maybe acting sympathetic to Bunny earlier if you want them to stay with her for a long-term cover) inside Munchkin, or at the least very close to Bunny.

From there, I'd recommend setting off an EMP if it's small enough to covertly sneak in, directly attacking Bunny with her back turned, or just grabbing stuff from Munchkin and running. I'm a little uncertain which one your soldiers would choose, since I don't know how self-sacrificing they are.

To give you advice on choosing which plan to have the military use, keep in mind the KISS! rule: Keep It Simple, Stupid!

So having a higher preference for the plans that require fewer things to to go right for it to work. I like my suggestion, because it only requires two parts: Bunny coming out to talk to the racists, and having everyone running towards her.
