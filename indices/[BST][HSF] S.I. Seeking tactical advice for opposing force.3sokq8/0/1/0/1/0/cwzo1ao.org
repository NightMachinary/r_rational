  Apart from bombs and guns, how is the free company at chemical warfare? Chlorine is definitely 1900s tech.

Keeping such chemicals around to deal with large kaiju, infectious zombies, swarms of carnivorous gerbils, and other threats of the post-Singularity world isn't a completely insane strategy, and would help the Free Company's cover by explaining their gas masks; even if nobody in their right minds would want such weapons anywhere near their own homes.

On a more narrative level, the Free Company trying a gas attack would fit well with a few other things, and I'm more willing to have them employ such a weapon than, perhaps, is strictly justified by the tactics. (In case you're wondering, [[#s][spoiler]] .)
