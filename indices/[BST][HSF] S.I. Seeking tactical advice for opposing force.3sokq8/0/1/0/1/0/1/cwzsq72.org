A gas attack seems like at most an extra added on to an assault. Since we do have gas masks, it might provide an extra variable to harass the enemy into not thinking. In this case, it'd probably be nonlethal gas if possible, since lethal gas in urban areas is very bad for PR and doesn't provide us with any extra utility.

Thing is, it decreases our own visibility and it's pretty likely that Bunny has countermeasures. Such as, you know, a gas mask. I don't know if the Company has any higher-tech variants that coalesce into acid on surfaces to eat through filters and kill through skin contact. But that in turn would be way too hazardous for our own forces, since we still need to plunge into the cloud to secure the target.
