Snipers are still potentially useful. You don't have to kill Bunny, just incapacitate her for long enough to capture/kill her. Unless she can regenerate instantly, turning her heart kibble is as good as a death at the tactical scale.

Are the people who might rush her into Munchkin similarly augmented? Because if not, sniping the EMTs sounds attractive.

Snipers provide the element of surprise, and incapacitate Bunny and whoever rushes to her help. All you have to do is keep her in place long enough to get a bomb out, and hopefully she won't be able to react during this time. Of course, the unknown AI is a wild card, so it's probably worth trying a simultaneous EMP on the Munchkin, if it can be located.

Apart from bombs and guns, how is the free company at chemical warfare? Chlorine is definitely 1900s tech. Anything you can do to stop people from rushing Bunny to safety helps, and poisoning the area doesn't matter if you're just going to bomb it to heck anyway.
