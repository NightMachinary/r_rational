  What's Bunny's usual reaction to, say, para-racist groups holding a rally at her location to harass her?
#+end_quote

Bunny appears to consider herself an intellectual, so she's reasonably likely to try to engage protesters.

  What's the Hive like anyway?

A group of people and animals with a similar set of Changes, who arrived from the southwest a few years ago, and found a place to live south of the main Changed ghetto of Story Town. They are viewed with suspicion, as they accept new members, who somehow acquire similar Changes, but nobody ever quits their group. Members have a variety of body shapes, but all are identifiable by their standard colour plan: Matte black, with cyan lines and patches. They have limited economic interaction, mainly selling pipes and hardware and buying trinkets and alcohol.
