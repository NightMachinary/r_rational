Don't worry about spoilers - anyone reading this far knows what they're getting into. :)

  Okay first off this just screams to me like a rushed military operation, because they are trying to kill Bunny with only 3-4 days of planning before her scheduled departure.
#+end_quote

That's a fair cop. Munchkin can travel at faster than pre-Singularity highway speeds, and Bunny created the heliograph network now spreading its tentacles through the region - by the time anyone in the Free Company knows where Bunny is, she's usually already gone.

  if people learn about an unknown military force which implies a strong independent organization.

The existence of the Free Company isn't a secret; that they'd be willing to engage in full-scale operations inside a city isn't a detail they've yet revealed.

  Also note that due to Bunny's equipment being of higher value than the knowledge of the Company's existence
#+end_quote

That's not quite what I meant to express. If somebody other than the Free Company can be blamed for whatever damage happens in the city, whether Bunny herself or some third party, then that would be good, but isn't quite as important as dealing with Bunny.

  if I don't know about Munchkin's ability to navigate difficult terrain
#+end_quote

While Bunny seems to prefer using railbeds and roads, she's been observed driving Munchkin into Indian Country, which is reported to currently be complete wilderness.

#+begin_quote
  I'd look into any other enemies of Bunny who are in the area for an alliance.
#+end_quote

Some possibilities include: portions of the city's government who dislike the Lake Erie squids; the ship's captain from Acadia who lost men during Bunny's expedition to Lion Castle; the man whom Bunny tased at a public event, who was the choice of the city's bureaucracy to liaise with Bunny; the city's group of self-proclaimed "wizards", one of whom attempted to duel with her in a public setting. Or perhaps one of the groups of anti-Changed para-racists, or any of the locals who dislike the heliograph network.

Do any of them seem more worth approaching than the others?

#+begin_quote
  I noticed that you don't mention any plans to use snipers, is there a reason for this?
#+end_quote

There is - someone tried that three years ago, and by now the Company's Intel group could have picked up the medical reports showing her heart was destroyed. Seems like it didn't put a permanent stop to her.
