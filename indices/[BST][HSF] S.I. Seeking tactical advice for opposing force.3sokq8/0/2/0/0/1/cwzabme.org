First of all, thank you /very/ much for your reply - you've already improved my future writing, confirming the usefulness of the local hivemind. :)

I tried to cover this in 'Standing Orders' - one of which is supposed to be along the lines of maintaining the Free Company as an organized unit, capable of continuing to pass along scouting reports of the region and performing other missions. Using up men and materiel to take out Bunny is an option - using up the entire Free Company is supposed to be off the table.

There are enough clones in Pittsburgh to have built a small-scale munitions industry, though the lack of fossil fuels and high-tech power plants limits the output, plus it has to be divided up among more groups than just the Youngstown Free Company.

YFC has no air support - the few times Pittsburgh has gotten something motorized into the air, the machines were rapidly rendered non-functional, either directly, or due to contaminated fuel, or some other process. (It's almost as if the whole world is conspiring against flying machines... but that's a silly thought.)

The difficulties the commander would be able to get from Intel is that Bunny rarely seems to travel more than a building away from Munchkin; and that, due to the persistent problems with radio interference, by the time any reports get passed along about where Munchkin is parked, it's often already scooted somewhere else. Knowing where Bunny is going to be ahead of time, even if she's going to be close to Munchkin, is probably the tipping point making taking her out potentially feasible at all.

A difficulty that the company commander is likely to be unaware of is that Bunny has a [[#s][secret info]]. Not to say that this isn't a plan worth trying, but if tried, I'll be focusing on the interesting ways it fails.

The company has reports on what appears to have been a similar attempt on Bunny's life three years ago: A sniper turned Bunny's heart into kibbles-and-bits, but Bunny's own people rushed her into Munchkin, and she's walking around today. Trying the same plan again and hoping for different results seems contra-indicated.
