TL:DR The plan list sucks, what do we do if Bunny beatd of the troops, plan to fail? Look at Headquarters priorities no acceptable loss limit, no mention of non-combatant ROE, and exposing the company is worth this furballs loot, which is less then the bunny's head! That means we have to be willing to burn everything here to the ground to kill bunny. How are we stocked for explosives and incendiaries, is air support available?

My 2cp worth: Pls note my training was in blowing up other ships and my experience with infantry is drinking with them and driving the "bus" for them to go do things. Also I am making the assumption that bunny is being assessed as a very high risk based on the cock up that those operational priorities seem to indicate.

E: suicide bombing bunny with assault team backup. If you have maintained an anonymous identity, then you can safely fulfill the first and third priorities Then pick up the second by trying to steal munchkin after you're sure bunny's chunky salsa is burned.

The second priority being higher than the third priority is a bit of a pants shitting nightmare to whichever clone has the company commander/operational planning hat. It means bunny as a tactical threat is worth giving up a significant strategic advantage and exposure of covert elements currently in place. Depending on how expendable our Pittsburgh man find himself, the level of intelligence he has on Bunny's past exploits, and his morals, then a contingency, or better yet preemptive suicide? bomb to Bunny in a public place away from munchkin with "overwhelming fire and maneuver" followup and a secondary raid of munchkin looks very enticing compared to an urban assault in a facility full of changed of unknown armament, capability, number, and temperament, especially with a mobile strong-point parked out front. You want to get bunny before it's in the hive.

Please do realize company commanders are basically constrained rational agents with a very simple goal set. The real question is if the bomb will be a company member, pre-positioned, or some way to burn the facility with bunny inside while retreating, and still hot enough to destroy most forms of known changed.

This is going to either start or end with a very big boom and a lot of fire: if the Pittsburgh company has the firepower available. A free company doesn't want to set off big bombs in a another city,it makes it hard to get hired or paid, but if something is worth an overt strike and risk of exposure then it's worth having a fully resourced contingency plan: to wit big explosions by air support , artillery or the poor man's contingency of truck bombs and incendiaries. Just because the company isn't strictly rationalist doesn't mean it's willing to risk exposure and fail You probably need something that at least seems

Also the rational/smart/(Field officer vs company officer) way to do this is with a sniper shooting to maim/kill, a fake set of EMT's to "evacuate" the queen and an interrogation team, and something energetic to eliminate bunny after interrogation if they survived the inital strike and interrogation. Contingency plan would be to blow up the entire area (Hive, or city depending on resources available and threat assessment should dictate resources allocated) and then send in troops to burn everything if bunny couldn't be extracted. In that light this operation stinks of inadequate planning time an desperation, which might be a justification for not having an adequate fallback measures, but would seem a like reason to cancel the operation in a more professional force.
