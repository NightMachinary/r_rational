Our intel is pretty horrible as well, given that we appear to know very little to nothing about what sort of opposition we'll encounter. Does our own equipment survive the EMP, and what sort of odds do we give that the EMP will work on her stuff? If her vehicle doesn't get shut down by it immediately at the start of the initial attack, that's bad. To minimize the issues posed by not knowing this stuff, we should blow one of the EMPs as close to exactly when the attack begins as possible (while leaving ourselves able to operate) so that the target has no time to try and figure out countermeasures or even check what stuff she still has that works.

A sufficient amount of pure firepower is a method that's expounded upon pretty well above, so if we don't have access to such or we don't want to use it, the key in the initial surprise attack should be to have an obvious, overtly hostile force whose objective is primarily to just try and succeed in the mission. They will shoot to kill with no hesitation as according to what we know she's unlikely to die from being killed anyway. They will attack by starting from a surrounding position and rapidly moving in, using surprise and weight of fire to overwhelm, disorient and hopefully incapacitate all opposition. Start off with a large barrage of explosives, which are good for all of the above. Make sure you've got oversight on the area with sufficient optics so that no-one (and nothing) can use the explosions as cover from you. If it so happens that this first unit doesn't appear to be able to just win outright, their second priority is to distract, confuse and most importantly isolate the queen from her resources and companions. How precisely this is done depends on the conditions on the ground but for example one could wait until she is, for whatever reason, naturally somewhat isolated - this would probably be during transit - and initiate the attack in a way that specifically cuts off her ability to move towards allies. Hopefully the EMP will keep AIs down, and if the target is not given time to think at all she will hopefully not be able to think around our plans.

The second force should be an 'ally' that arrives to the scene if the first force has not been immediately able to achieve the primary objective. They should not look hostile (wearing face-masks and bodysuits) so if we can't disguise ourselves for whatever reason (we should be able to do that) then look into finding reliable outsiders to work in direct supervision from us on this part. If the first force manages to pin the target and move in, they should not need the second force - if the first force is overwhelmed by the enemy having too much firepower then all available support should be called in to smash them, instead of going with this plan. But if Bunny somehow manages to escape the surround even momentarily, second force moves in to 'assist' the target against the first force before she has time to make contact with any allies or start making plans of her own, making sure she has no time to think. They should take control of the situation and use the fact that she has her guard down to hit her with the second EMP from as close as possible, then capture and whisk her away before any response arrives. First force should keep harassing her until the second force launches the second ambush, then fold in. We must not to leave any of our own behind due to our orders, so the first force needs to take care of that. Speed is key - we can't let Bunny have time to think or deploy and use any of the unknowns she has, because we can't effectively plan for things we don't know.

If the target reacts to the initial ambush not by attempting to flee but by blocking the attack and setting up to defend and wait for allies, pull out all the stops, forget about any capture attempts and just throw in everything we have to annihilate her. No need for fancy plans here - transition smoothly from the initial ambush to throwing in all the firepower we have at our disposal. If Bunny isn't fleeing, she's probably thinking and also probably has allies on the way. Also the fact that she can defend against us means that her resources match ours already. Take our best possible shot at overwhelming her defenses and destroying her immediately before any more of her advantages come to play. If we can plan to hit her in transit from one place to another, and we know her route, set up powerful IEDs in the ambush location in places that look most likely for her to hole up in if the initial attack does not overwhelm her, then blow them up simultaneously with a mass assault.

If we hit her with everything we've got and she takes it straight on and is still standing, pick up our pieces and retreat - obviously our gear and intel simply isn't good enough.

A key part of making any surprise attack successful here is that we must be able to ambush Bunny in the initial attack. That way we can keep her too busy to bring her advantages to play. We shouldn't try and attack/raid the Hive, knowing just that she's somewhere inside, because that way she'll get a warning about the attack before she's being hit by the bullets, and so has time. If we have no other options, however, due to not being able to catch her anywhere in the open, then we need to do our utmost so that our attack finds and targets Bunny herself as soon as possible.
