I can work with that plan. In case you, or anyone reading this, wants to try continuing the Red Team thought experiment:

After thinking a bit about which parts of the Glenn Research Facility are most likely to survive the next 35 years, and then the next unspecified number of decades post-Singularity, I'm going to set the main entrance to the Hive, and Munchkin's parking space, being the hanger with 'NASA' on the roof which is hopefully visible at [[https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Glenn+Research+Center/@41.4147769,-81.8602674,281m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x8830ecc592ad8f03:0xeed6ba5b0f6ca8f6!6m1!1e1?hl=en][this GMap]]. In case the larger area is worth considering, then on [[https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?hl=en&authuser=0&mid=zgCtV3FYl4HY.kuB0utvpfQ2g][this map]], the point labelled 'Rocky River Outlet' is where Story Town and most of the city's non-Hive changed live, the 'Alcoa Forgings' point is where most of the industry is, the grey blob is where human buildings were replaced with strange towers during the Singularity, and the cluster of points around 'University Circle' is the rich point of town. A lot of the rest got reclaimed by nature post-Singularity, but the city's population is rising and rebuilding fast.

Bunny is currently under medical orders to try to relax, and so her doctor will likely veto confronting anti-Changed protesters, so we'll be following the "If she refuses to make a personal appearance" contingency. However, in addition, her tricorder (laser spectrometer plus AI analyst) is likely to pick up some of the loose molecules from the explosives and give warning before the Free Company realizes she's aware something is hinky. And as a third confounding factor, the Hive is aware of the negative opinions of the locals about them, and has been drawing on lessons from certain previous groups who have faced the possibility of mob violence. (I'm currently of two minds whether the Hive's main choice of reaction will be more along the lines of the aggressive ideals of "Jews For The Preservation of Firearms Ownership" or the more defensive "lots and lots of escape tunnels" (they're very good at digging).)

Snipers may have some difficulty identifying Bunny during the ruckus, as she'll be wearing a skin-tight suit giving her their cyan-on-black colour scheme, and she's currently massively pregnant, which she wasn't a month ago.

Due to Complicated Plot Reasons, shortly after the Free Company's attack begins, a kaiju is going to start attacking the city's industrial sector, ten miles to the east of the Hive.

On a narrative level, what sort of complications would most likely induce at least some of the Company to chase after Bunny the five miles north to the lakeshore (slightly longer if the route of the Rocky River is followed), near Story Town and the storybook transformation zone? For example, if the Company's scouts picked up lots of small groups of Hive members exiting short escape tunnels, would the company commander be willing to split his forces to go after them all; or would that be more likely after a while of hunting through the Hive, with a sudden breakout by Hive members when the Company's infantry got too close to their hidey-hole? If the land-train of Munchkin separated into its five separate carriages, each of which started running up to speed to get away in a different direction, only one or two of which seem to have been knocked out by the EMP, how would the commander react? If Bunny tried to open negotiations, perhaps through a PA system, trying to ask what the attackers actually want, would the commander be willing to stop the shooting long enough to talk?

(... Depending on the company commander's response to such negotiations, if Bunny then claimed that the self-destruct charge on Munchkin was roughly equivalent to one kiloton of explosive force, would the commander change any of his plans?)
