Okay, so a summary of the plan given some extra information below:

Contact racists, arrange a protest/rally at the Hive aimed against Bunny. See if we can't use disgruntled politicians to delay any official response to the rally. Use it as a means to sneak our people closer with their equipment.

Try to draw Bunny out. If she makes a personal appearance, take a moment to try and ensure she actually is there instead of using some sort of trickery to just make it look like she's there. Then initiate the attack by using an EMP from as close as can be managed, specifically targeting Munchkin if we have any clue where it might be. Simultaneously have several snipers fire at Bunny and any of her entourage that are visible. Send in the squads under the cover of the crowd - at this point use explosives to break up any attempt by the enemy to organize or evacuate the target, and maybe gas to disorient them further. Rush in, grab her, leave, blame the racists.

Now for contingencies.

If she manages to escape the initial ambush but is separated from her immediate allies, send an unit disguised as allies (local pro-Changed group?) to assist her as the attackers pursue. Lead her to the second EMP and use it in as close proximity as possible. Maybe she'll even slip out information on what her counter-plans are, such as the location of Munchkin, any allies that are responding or tech she has. Grab her, leave, blame the racists.

If she is unfazed by the initial attack and hunkers down to defend and wait for help, using some resource of hers that we don't know of to beat off our attack, make a calculation - does it look like we can win if we pull out all the stops and fire everything we've got at her? If so, do that. No point attempting to capture anymore, just blow up everything. If not, retreat before help arrives.

If she refuses to make a personal appearance to the rally, use the crowd to sneak our people as close as possible, then launch an assault into the Hive. We should be able to make an educated guess as to where in the Hive Munchkin and Bunny might be by seeing how traffic moves in and out, looking at the emissions and the profile of the structure. Nothing concrete, but use it to our advantage anyway. Use the first EMP as close we can get it just as we begin the attack, have our squads move in rapidly and in force to locate and capture or destroy Bunny and Munchkin, bringing the other EMP to set off as soon as either of the two are spotted. Leave a significant force outside with hidden explosives and snipers to attempt to catch her if she escapes. Try to ensure there aren't any hidden tunnels away from the Hive - that'd suck.

If we have antitank rifles, our snipers might want some.
