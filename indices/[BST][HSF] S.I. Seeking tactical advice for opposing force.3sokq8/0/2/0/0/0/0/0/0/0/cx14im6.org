How useful the tricorder will be depends on its range and accuracy. The plan, after all, is to first fire an EMP (that might take out the device) and then bring in explosives.

Essentially with this information the initial assault into the Hive will probably cause some confusion and chaos simply due to the suddenness of things. If we can get the racists to actually join the assault, that'll also help as communications will be clogged and the Hive might not be clear on whether it's mob violence or an organized attack before it's too late. As the squads penetrate the outer shell of the defenders and start cutting lines of communication and logistics, things get messier. After some minutes it should be clear to the Company commander that the assault is not proceeding particularly well in terms of quickly locating Bunny and escaping, so he'll focus on exfiltrating any bogged down units if such exist and spreading a cordon.

If they see lots of small groups of Hive members escaping from a lot of tunnels, the Company will probably attempt to engage them all quickly to pin them down with light troops, keeping a larger force in reserve ready to move at any engagement that proves to have Bunny involved. If the Hive members tried a large single breakout, a group of fighters would engage them from range (snipers) to pin them and find out if the target is within the group. If it seems possible, collapse in on them with major forces, if not, back off and leave them to lick their wounds while keeping them observed, try and find where Bunny is.

If Munchkin separated into parts and began to head off, the Company would use all available assets to try and stop as many of those carriages as possible with explosives, anti-tank rifles and the second EMP. Then send in forces to capture and scour through all the ones that were caught. No real point in trying to pursue any that get away. If Bunny is not located, spread our troops into a wider cordon, begin with cleanup to preserve as much secrecy as possible and set up to watch the area for a reasonable amount of time until it's determined that Bunny has escaped.

If Bunny tried to open negotiations, the Company would of course accept. Even if Company troops never stopped shooting at all, just /saying/ that you'll agree would cause confusion in the enemy and might let your forces take advantage. And most importantly it's an opportunity to look for clues as to Bunny's location. The Company would play for time , while the main goal in any negotiations for Company would be to find out where Bunny is so that they can send everyone there and resume hostilities there and only there.

If Bunny claimed that she'd be willing to blow up Munchkin, take it with a major grain of salt. She's unlikely to use such a thing except in an extremely desperate situation, and we should be aware of it if she were in one. If it looks possible that it might actually be used (Bunny is trapped in a dead end corridor and our troops are closing in) then our reserve units and command team would attempt to find shelter in order to make use of the potential explosion which should shatter all the defenders but only a part of the attackers.

Oh, and they'd tell Bunny that there's no need for such measures, she just has to surrender herself to be captured and she will not be harmed, nor will anyone else afterwards.
