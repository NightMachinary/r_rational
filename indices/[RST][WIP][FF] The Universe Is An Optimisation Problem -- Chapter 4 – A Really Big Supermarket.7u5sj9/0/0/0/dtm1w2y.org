sorry for the wait in my reply -- it started in late december 2016, and it took me about twenty days to put out chapter two. chapter three took 6 days, and chapter four took me 14 days. i realised that my earlier plans probably weren't viable, because chapters two and three were 20-30% material that i'd written before.

the current update schedule is every two weeks on wednesdays (in new zealand). it's torturously slow, i know, but it's really the best i can do right now.
