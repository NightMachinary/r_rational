(Why would the money supply expand, if the muggles are paying for the free food with their own notes and goblins are paying for the notes with their own gold, both remaining constant? If anything, wouldn't muggle food prices drop as the food supply expanded with other goods and services holding steady for a mostly-constant amount of money?)

I find myself more curious about the note of the type that Ozland exchanged; if that sort of time-limited power expires without being presented (to the church) and used, then whoever holds it will have suffered a loss while Ozland will have permanent (until used) gold. Are the goblins going to seek out and sell that note (at a profit) to someone who has a use for (/can make a profit by) using the motorway at those times, or is this a way to bankrupt the goblins by getting them to exchange all their wealth for promises which will go unclaimed with expiry dates?

(*contemplation of the difference between 'measurement of absolute value' (to everyone) and 'measurement of absolute value to you, specifically, the goblin who will be attempting to use a certain set of methods to get value out of it'* That would be interesting when it comes to the stockmarket--measuring how much something will be worth if sold an hour/day/week later, say, and deciding to buy it (or short-sell it) according to whether one would make a profit or not.)
