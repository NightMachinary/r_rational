Interesting story.

How is wizard money worth anything? If I took things from the supermarket, sold them for muggle currency, and then exchanged that currency to galleons, I would have a money making machine.

The time loop seems... convinient. If I want to reach immortality, real immortality as in can't be killed, I would just have to consistently time loop such that time would make sure I wasn't killed such that I could go back in time to do the thing I wanted.
