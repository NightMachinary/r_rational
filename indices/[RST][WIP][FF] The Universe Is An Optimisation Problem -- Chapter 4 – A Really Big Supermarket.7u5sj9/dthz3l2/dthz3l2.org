This is brilliant! The world-building is truly magical. You've somehow managed to capture the whimsical spirit of Rowling's universe while dramatically increasing its breadth. The fact that you have a looming (existential!) danger somehow works well with the light-hearted tone in this chapter.

FWIW I had found the first two-and-a-half chapters slightly jarring, due to the many jumps in perspective, if still interesting. OTOH they did successfully serve the purpose of setting up the background for the story --- I have no idea whether and how this could have been done better.
