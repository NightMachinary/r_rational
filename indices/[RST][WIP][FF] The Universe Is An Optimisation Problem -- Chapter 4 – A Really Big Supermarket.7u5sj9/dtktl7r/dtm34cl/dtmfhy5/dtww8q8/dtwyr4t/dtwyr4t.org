...given that the sale takes place, if they're really able to sell it to someone (someone who will likely in turn sell it to certain muggles who own cars?), exchanging things with goblins sounds like an amazing way of extracting all sorts of value out of things normally unimportant to oneself... Granted, most would only be able to sell passage through their garden, rather than (for instance) passage through an entire city's sewer system.

(For the stock market, perhaps instead what would happen is that goblin trades would return stock prices to their true-value-reflected value hyper-efficiently, reducing the profit gainable when the hand is overplayed? Remembering a certain fiction about a character called Flicker doing a similar thing and potentially ending the world upon suddenly stopping.)

A sudden question--what ties/couples market cap to equity? Other than a person with >50% of shares who can order a company to give themselves money directly, what is the gold-backing of a single share to make people compete for it and elevate its price? Is there an option to redeem shares through the company itself, getting a guaranteed (equality-related?) payout, thus providing incentive for people to buy a share in the hope that if the company does well it will have a higher guaranteed-minimum redeeming price?

(That is, if share price were completely uncoupled to actual financial utility, bought and sold only between shareholders with no way of selling them back, I would imagine the price would fluctuate unrelatedly either unrelatedly low or unrelatedly high, like art... or, rather than redeeming at the company itself, is it to do with 'if someone wants to do a hostile takeover, they'll have to buy up the shares'--but again, what actually links that to true company value? ...it feels as though I'm missing something absolutely critical in the chain of causality, something which has bothered me on and off for years about my mental model of what the stockmarket is...)
