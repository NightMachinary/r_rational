If the value-o-meter creates a stable time loop by sending back the value of the note at the time the goblins sell it, probably minus some commission/interest, that's perfectly reasonable. The goblins have an incentive to find a market for the promise, and have an assurance that they will be able to find a buyer. If they willn't had been able to find a buyer, the note wouldn't clear in the present. They want to be able to clear arbitrary things of value, after all, that's how they turn a profit.

So, in theory, the time-limited power could expire without the goblins profiting, so the value at sale goes to 0, so there is no sale. Presumably, playing the stock market this way just breaks everything really quickly, and a lot of weird cosmic coincidences start happening to ratchet everything back on track.
