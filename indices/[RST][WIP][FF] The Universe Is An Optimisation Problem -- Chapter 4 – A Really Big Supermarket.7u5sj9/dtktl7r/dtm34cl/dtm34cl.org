  How is wizard money worth anything? If I took things from the supermarket, sold them for muggle currency, and then exchanged that currency to galleons, I would have a money making machine.

this has happened in the past and lead to a semi-major expansion in the money supply (followed by a deflationary spiral managed by the concerted efforts of lucius malfoy, the ministry, and gringotts -- all of whom have antiquated sensibilities about the role of inflation in an economy). the ministry enforced laws concerning commercial ventures with muggles (i.e if you haven't filled in the forms and gotten it stamped, you can't -- a fairly expensive process) as a legal extension of the statute of secrecy, and since then, nobody has done it. the penalties for violating the statute of secrecy are much too high for something that involves carting food out of public entrances and selling them to muggles (apparition is unreliable and dangerous in the supermarket). people do take food from the supermarket to share with their muggle families, but anything which could be viable as a commercial venture is much too obvious.

  The time loop seems... convinient. If I want to reach immortality, real immortality as in can't be killed, I would just have to consistently time loop such that time would make sure I wasn't killed such that I could go back in time to do the thing I wanted.

you could create a time-turner schedule so that you would consistently see your older self in the morning at a certain meet-point, and perhaps exchange a limited amount of information, which would mean you getting killed (or rendered unable to time turn) in the next six hours would be inconsistent. your future-copy wouldn't have the same guarantee, and you wouldn't have the same guarantee any other parts of the day.

based off my understanding of the mechanics of time travel as outlined in hpmor, you dying sometime later in the day would just mean your future-copy just wouldn't appear at the meet-point. if you were to take an unbreakable vow to consistently time-turn according to schedule (which is probably a reasonable thing to do), that would mean only three things could happen in the next six hours: your time-turner breaks, you die, or you are rendered incapable of using your time-turner. using a time-turner in the way you described would mean these possibilities would become unavoidable.

the time loop that appeared in this chapter is in essence the same as the time loop that appeared in the prank chapters in hpmor.

e: i made a basic economics error, multipartitemind is right.
