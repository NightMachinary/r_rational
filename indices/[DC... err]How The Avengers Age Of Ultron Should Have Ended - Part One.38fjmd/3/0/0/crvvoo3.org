The nuke issue was sort of dealt with (another AI undermining him, changing the codes or something). We can say they at least hung a lampshade there. But still, anything like a real superintelligence, if it was actually trying, could have ended this very quickly with a lot less trouble.

Even being just moderately intelligent like a normal geeky human would have made him so much more effective. He's worse than canon!Voldemort.... I mean, what kind of replication rate did he have? And no compunctions about or particular costs to exponential replication? It seemed like he was able to make a new copy every few hours. Even with it taking days, I just can't comprehend his failure to leave a few copies in hard to find locations... Or embedding them in non-obvious-looking robotic bodies.

With those super rockets of his capable of space launching a mountain, why the heck didn't he immediately start mining asteroids for materials? He could have attacked the Avengers with trillions of drone-bodies within months, not to mention, with a bit of orbital mechanics, a stream of kinetic impact weapons moving at tens of kilometers per second with appreciable fractions of the earth's mass each, and as a backup plan a fleet of solar mirrors that can fry every living (non-invulnerable) thing on the surface within seconds.

And he wants vibranium for obvious reasons, but the original source for vibranium was a meteor, so why wasn't he combing the solar system for more? There ought to be megatons of it out there, and he doesn't even bother to check?!

Aside from that, great movie! (Well, better than Interstellar by considerable margin anyway.)
