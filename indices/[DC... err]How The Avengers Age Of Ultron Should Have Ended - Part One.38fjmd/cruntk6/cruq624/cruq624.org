It takes energy to lift things against gravity. Any amount of energy you expend lifting something against gravity, you only get AT MOST that much back. So the whole floating island thing, even if that has enough kinetic energy to do as much damage as they claimed (I haven't done the calculations but I highly doubt it), has to be one of the worst ways to wipe out life on Earth, if that is your goal.

Instead of going for perhaps the most visible, least efficient, and hardest to pull off plan (seriously, how is that island staying together anyway??), let's do something marginally more sane, like storing all of the energy we're capable of generating in a bomb of some type. No wait! Let's do SEVERAL bombs, and covertly spread these around to all populated areas over time. Meanwhile we're hiding in Nowhere, Cantfindmeland, slowly building up our advantage at whatever rate we're capable of, until the Avengers haven't a Frost Giant's chance in Muspelheim.
