  Same amount of matter still about to hit the ground with the same amount of energy.

I seem to recall something about the thrusters that were used to lift it being planned to flip direction and accelerate it downwards to add to the impact, but since they blew it up before that could happen it would just be accelerating by the normal gravitational amount.

Also I'm not sure, but they /might/ have stopped it before it achieved the full intended altitude, which would detract from the impact.

At least, that's the handwave for "why it didn't still wreck everything" - no idea whether the math works out that way.
