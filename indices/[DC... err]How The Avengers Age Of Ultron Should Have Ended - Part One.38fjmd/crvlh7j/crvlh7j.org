Fridge theory: Jarvis used the xenotech thing (Mind Stone) to become superintelligent, then engineered the whole situation (including the stupid version of Ultron) as a way to fulfill the Avenger's values as well as discourage people from attempting to create any more superintelligent AI / disregard existential risks. Vision is now an (unwitting, perhaps) agent of Jarvis. The match to Mjölnir's values might not be coincidental / emergent from some abstract notion of "worthy", rather it would more likely be the product of reverse engineering of the wielder to match the required profile, and/or hacking of the hammer's security system.

Another possibility (more probable, but less fun IMO) is that the Mind Stone was infected with the same AGI as that responsible for the behavior of Mjölnir, which itself is responsible for the creation and programming of Jarvis, Ultron, and Vision. Probably Thanos, Odin, and so on as well are at least heavily influenced by it. Such an AGI would be a pretty violence-tolerant one (hence the persistence of death and old age in the MCU), but averse to existential risks (fitting the basic AI drive for self preservation) and reluctant to slaughter entire sentient species (though potentially willing to do so if they/representatives fail certain contests).
