  It went like this:

  A tav.

  A resh.

  A fearsome joy.

  A fervent wish.
#+end_quote

Now if only I knew what these words, wikipedia tells me the first is craved onto a golems head, and the second means head; so I'm assuming this refers to mankinds creation as the fearsome joy and fervent wish seem to be very much what everyone was doing at the moment it was spoken.

But wheres the broken hallelujah?.... unless .... ... he did say hi to uriel did he not? maybe the greeting isn't broken the god being greeted is?
