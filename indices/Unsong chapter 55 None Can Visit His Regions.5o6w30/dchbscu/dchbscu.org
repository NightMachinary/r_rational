  THE THEORETICAL KABBALAH CORRESPONDS TO THE WORLD OF ATZILUTH. IT IS THE ANALYSIS OF THE FORM OF ADAM KADMON. THIS FORM IS UNTOUCHABLE AND THE SLIGHTEST CHANGE TO IT WOULD PROBABLY DESTROY THE WORLD.

(Uriel, 44)

An analogue to Hell certainly exists in Adam Kadamon. That the Comet King couldn't destroy Hell without also destroying the world isn't a coincidence.

Also, we know that the apocalypse is coming in the 2017 storyline.
