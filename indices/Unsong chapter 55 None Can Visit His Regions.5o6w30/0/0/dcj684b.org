I was going to say that I wasn't sure the timeline matched up for that, but then I reread [[http://unsongbook.com/chapter-30-over-the-dark-deserts/][chapter 30]]:

#+begin_quote
  In the mid '90s, Las Vegas was on edge with rumors of some kind of necromantic cult. The Comet King had come to the city, smoked out the cultists, and personally executed the leader. There it should have ended.

  As the century drew to a close, the rumors started up again. Killing the leader had only made him stronger. Now he was regrouping. Those who died in the fight against him became soldiers in his armies. He wore a deep scarlet robe with a hood covering his head. No one had ever seen his face.

  The Comet King had other problems now. His great crusade had failed. His wife was dead. He kept to his room, leaving the day-to-day work of governance to his Cometspawn. They were less confident than he was. They stayed out of Las Vegas, delegated the problem to subordinates, hoped it would take care of itself.

And then there's this:

  The necromancer declared himself a king and took up residence beneath the great black pyramid of Luxor.

The Luxor is named after the Egyptian city of the same name, which sits where Thebes used to. According to Wikipedia, Luxor comes from the Arabic /al-ʾuqṣur/ (الأقصر), lit. "the palaces".

In English, "Lux" is the SI unit of illumination. "-or", as a suffix, is used to construct agent nouns (e.g. "realtor", "debtor", "juror"). So "Luxor" would be "one who enlightens".

This being Unsong, this may have been planned.

Also, it fits better than my theory that the Other King and the Comet King did a switch, though it leaves me wondering who the captain of the /Not a Metaphor/ is (unless the Comet King fragmented himself somehow, which I don't really find appealing as a twist).
