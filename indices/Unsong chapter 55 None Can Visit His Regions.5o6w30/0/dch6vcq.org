After this, the Comet King is defeated by the Other King and his necromantic legions. Following this, his children die cursing his name.

So, his wife dead and his plan failed, the Comet King resolves to get into Hell one way or another. Unfortunately, it's impossible - like Acker before him, he's too wise and great to be sent to Hell. Even if he were to commit suicide, he would only ascend into Heaven, the selflessness of his sacrifice making it ironically invalid.

Taking inspiration from Acker, he creates the persona of the Other King, planning to commit enough sin to outweigh the good he's done so that he might die and go to Hell, where he can speak HaMephorash and destroy it once and for all. He "kills" himself and lays siege to Royal Colorado, committing atrocities along the way so that he might undo the ultimate evil in the afterlife.
