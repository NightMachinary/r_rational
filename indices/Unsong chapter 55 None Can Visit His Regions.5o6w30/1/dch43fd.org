...Did they Comet King not realize that whatever "God" is, it does not align with human morality? I mean, just the of all the suffering in the World alone kind of indicates that "God" isn't really aligned with human values, the fact that Hell literally exists is just making it more obvious. Uriel realized this. What doesn't Ana or Aaron or Sohu or the Comet King get this simple fact? If they really want to fix things, they need to be aiming for the level of power to alter a facet of "God". Is that the lesson of this story? Theodicy is a bad idea?
