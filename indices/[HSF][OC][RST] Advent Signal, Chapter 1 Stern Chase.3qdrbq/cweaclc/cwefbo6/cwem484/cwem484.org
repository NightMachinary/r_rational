Math is hard. When I ran the numbers on her time to collide with the missiles I did it from the assumption of starting at rest. Which, yeah, is definitely wrong. How should I correct it? I mean plot-wise all that matters is she gets her tranission out, dies when her ship explodes, and takes out the destroyers in the process. The details of how it happens should be due to the cold gods of mathematics.

So increase distances between the ships, increase speed of the missiles, possibly change time to close?

The destroyers wouldn't have started their deceleration burn until she actually stopped. Or, more likely, take her out with nukes and blow past the wreckage at several km/s relative.

Her fusion candle is fairly narrow, and the highly maneuverable destroyers could easily dodge the particle stream. Probably part of regular training for pilots. The problem with practically applying the Kzinti lesson is that everyone learns it and its counters during their first weeks in pilot school.
