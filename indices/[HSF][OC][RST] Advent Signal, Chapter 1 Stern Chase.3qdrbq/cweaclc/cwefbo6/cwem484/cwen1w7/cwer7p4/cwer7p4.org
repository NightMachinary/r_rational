  1. Nerf the hell out of their drives. Her drive should be generating a fraction of a gee long term, maybe a gee peak, but she can't maintain that for long... I mean minutes, not hours. The military ships can handle 10 gee short term, for minutes, and a gee for a few hours, but long term they should be running a fraction of a gee too. A larger fraction, but still a fraction.

I wanted to go for high efficiency 1 G standard torch drives. They fly in brachistone transfers doing 1 G halfway, then flip, then 1 G deceleration to destination. No long periods on the float for the most part, just regular 1 G burns. Obviously that's a 'normal' situation, not a military one, but I rather wanted to have 1 G constant acceleration to be the standard.

  1. There's no "deceleration burn". They are trying to match her position and velocity. They know her total delta vee, and her course, they can predict where she can be for days ahead with pretty good precision. They'll be burning half way to her predicted position, then decelerating the rest, with the big pushes at the beginning and the end of the journey... because it is more effective, and to allow for maneuvering.

That only works if she's flying in a straight line, she's not. Every time they try to position themselves to match course and get 'ahead' of her, she changes course. She's also constantly accelerating with no particular destination in mind and has a head start. If they match course and velocity with her and cut their engines to coast towards intercept...well she keeps accelerating and pulls away. Instead they just keep accelerating at a slightly highly rate then her, and slowly close the gap. Given that she's actively maneuvering to avoid capture, going for a hard burn, coasting, then another hard burn to match velocity isn't going to work as well. Maybe hard burn so their solar velocity is much higher then hers, then going for a lower acceleration, then hard deceleration to match velocity?

  3.Given the size of the vessel, it can't be carrying much propellant, so the exhaust has to have unghodly velocity. If you're chasing a fusion drive vessel with a high exhaust velocity, there really aren't any good counters. The beam is traveling close to lightspeed, and you're moving at kilometers per second and can barely shift your vector even at ten gees.

But you're also really far away for the most part. Though yeah, they should have cut acceleration and started maneuvering as soon as she came about.

  1. They're going to be spread out to cover more predicted vectors. They're not going to be within tens of kilometers of each other.
#+end_quote

Also true. Need to get over my classic soft sci-fi 'ships flying in close formation' mentality.

  Given the situation, the only way I can see to make it work is for her to convincingly fake running out of fuel and surrendering, and blowing her drive when they come close. If she's actively resisting, they're going to stand off and nuke her from orbit.

I think I can work with that, mind re-reading after I edit and letting me know how it looks?
