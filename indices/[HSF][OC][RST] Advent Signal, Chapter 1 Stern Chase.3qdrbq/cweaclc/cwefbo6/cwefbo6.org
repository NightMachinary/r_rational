Very "first draft". You could do with a re-read to clean up wording.

Also, at half a G difference in acceleration they're going to close that 10km gap in about 100 minutes, but they'll have a relative velocity over 3 km/s just from that hour and a half of thrust.

But you say they've been chasing her for hours already? Then their relative velocities are already dozens of kilometers per second. 10 kilometers means they're zipping past her right /now/. They need to /decelerate/, in fact they need to /have been decelerating/ for some time now, if they're going to be going slow enough to engage.

Given that most of the thrust is directed along the axis of the ship, you're not going to feel much lateral force from a turn. It's not like in an aircraft where you're pushing against the atmosphere.

If the military ships are capable of 10G acceleration, and they're moving at multiple kilometer per second relative velocities (probably hundreds of kilometers per second) missiles only managing 4G would be like fighter jets shooting bottle rockets at each other. You'd need much higher accelerations from the missiles for them to be practical weapons.

But given those figures, at 2G relative acceleration, it's still going to take over an hour for those missiles to reach her. Assuming the military ships had matched velocities close enough for an engagement to be practical in the first place.

Why doesn't she just aim her jet at them?
