  I wanted to go for high efficiency 1 G standard torch drives.

And I suspect that you probably can't get there with a 70 meter pile of junk thrown together by a hacker. Niven's "Singleships" were pretty good hard-ish SF in 1972, but if you're going to do the math I'm not sure you can do it with fusion.

  That only works if she's flying in a straight line, she's not.

It works if you know the total delta vee she has and you know her initial orbit. Even with "standard torch drives" there's a limited solution space, and it gets more and more limited as she uses up her propellant. Remember, interplanetary velocities are /high/. You can't do a right turn in space except by interacting with a gravity well.

  Maybe hard burn so their solar velocity is much higher then hers, then going for a lower acceleration, then hard deceleration to match velocity?

I think that's another way of putting the same thing. ^^
