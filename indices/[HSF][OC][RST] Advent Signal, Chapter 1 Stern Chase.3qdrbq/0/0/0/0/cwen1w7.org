1. Nerf the hell out of their drives. Her drive should be generating a fraction of a gee long term, maybe a gee peak, but she can't maintain that for long... I mean minutes, not hours. The military ships can handle 10 gee short term, for minutes, and a gee for a few hours, but long term they should be running a fraction of a gee too. A larger fraction, but still a fraction.

2. There's no "deceleration burn". They are trying to match her position and velocity. They know her total delta vee, and her course, they can predict where she can be for days ahead with pretty good precision. They'll be burning half way to her predicted position, then decelerating the rest, with the big pushes at the beginning and the end of the journey... because it is more effective, and to allow for maneuvering.

3. Given the size of the vessel, it can't be carrying much propellant, so the exhaust has to have unghodly velocity. If you're chasing a fusion drive vessel with a high exhaust velocity, there really /aren't/ any good counters. The beam is traveling close to lightspeed, and you're moving at kilometers per second and can barely shift your vector even at ten gees.

4. They're going to be spread out to cover more predicted vectors. They're not going to be within tens of kilometers of each other.

Given the situation, the only way I can see to make it work is for her to convincingly fake running out of fuel and surrendering, and blowing her drive when they come close. If she's actively resisting, they're going to stand off and nuke her from orbit.
