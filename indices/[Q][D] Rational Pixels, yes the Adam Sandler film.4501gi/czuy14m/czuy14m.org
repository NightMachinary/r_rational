I think the greatest challenge is that the possible story space is both too large and too narrow.

I say that because the "hyper-advanced nanomachine aliens" bit is all that you can really work with- as you've observed, the pixel part was mostly just to try to adapt to what they thought was local imagery. Once you move past it, you just have standard suffeciently-advanced-aliens, which much of fiction (especially rational fiction) has thoroughly explored. So past that, the only part of substance one can gain is having more rational versions of established characters explore this new space- and since the setting is otherwise boring and the characters uninteresting, you don't have much there.

Not trying to shoot down creativity- if you want to try to make something interesting out of it, PLEASE DO! I'm just giving honest feedback.
