1. Imagine never committing a mistake more than once, knowing which method to apply to every situation almost instantly after learning them, being able to quickly modify your state of mind after being presented new evidence. That's a N times better than human quality-type intelligence. Dogs have a very hard time teaching other dogs, but humans figured out how to train them effectively, similarly a N times intelligence could teach us in ways that other humans can't teach us, including teaching behavior/emotional changes that are very hard to achieve via psychology.
2. If one can say a quantum gravity theory is an all-encompassing theory of physics, then similarly a single AI theory will emerge. But, like in physics, there will be much to explore in particular parts of this theory and it'll be easy to be an expert in one and a dabbler in the others.
3. One can do useful theoretical research in any science, like in theoretical vs experimental physics.
