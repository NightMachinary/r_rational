  Do you think intelligence can be increased tenfold, thousandfold and so on? What does it mean, exactly, to increase intelligence?
#+end_quote

Yes, depending on your definition of intelligence. Computers are already thousands or millions of times better at certain 'thinking' tasks than humans. If you look at things like image recognition that has gotten exponentially better as algorithms have improved in the last few years it doesn't take much imagination to figure that machines could become much more intelligent quickly. Add that to the fact that a progressively better AI doesn't need an extended childhood to learn, it can just pickup useful algorithms instantly and learn new ideas and advancements very quickly. Imagine how our own intelligence could improve if we could simply share all our skills with each other instanteously. If you could learn to play guitar by downloading SantanaGuitarSkills.exe and learn to do advanced Calculus by downloading a program I believe most people would assume you were insanely intelligent. As far as creative intelligence goes, most creative intelligence just has to do with combination, guessing and repetition and then weeding out the crap that is created, I see no reason AI won't be able to do this as time goes on (and indeed this principle is what most learning algorithms are based on - [[http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/18/google-image-recognition-neural-network-androids-dream-electric-sheep][just check out this fun little thing from google's image recognition algorithm]].

  Is there a fundamental difference in the brain architecture between high IQ individuals and low IQ individuals?*
#+end_quote

Well, there is at least some difference between the structure of high IQ and Low IQ individuals. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience_and_intelligence][Brain size, size of Corpus Callosum, and cortical thickness have all been positively correlated with intelligence in various studies.]] Besides which we do not have a strong knowledge of the underlying microstructures of brains yet, nor do we really know how they work, but it clear from educational, nutritional, and environmental factors that have strong correlations to intelligence that brains with certain inputs do better than other brains.

  Currently AI research seems to be a big number of subfields, do you think this will remain so, or will there ever be an all-encompassing theory of intelligence?
#+end_quote

It will be modification of subfields that push the boundaries of what AI can do but a single over-arching intelligence COULD be created that prioritized system resources towards the difference subfields and combined results from different subfields. Just like in human intelligence, it is the inputs we get from various sources that lead to our creativity and intelligent behaviors. Advances in the Perception and Learning subfields for AI provide fuel for advances in Reasoning algorithms for AI, just as the human abilities to read and see and interpret our surroundings are what allow us to create new innovations.

  To what extent can you do useful theoretical research separately from actually building an AI?
#+end_quote

Well, in the end all work on the subfields of AI is this sort of useful research. Because those are the tools an AI will need to improve itself and the world.
