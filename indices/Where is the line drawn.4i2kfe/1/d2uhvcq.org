I am God of Death? I give no-one any punishment on the condition that the people I judge guilty pretend to be under unimaginable torment if anyone actually ever summons them up to talk, on pain of... pain. Being omnipresent, I can pro-actively punish (or otherwise influence) future defectors until they play along. There's no point actually torturing people on the other side, so long as the people on earth believe that I will.

As for what I think of his actions? I judge him based on the results his actions were most likely to have, not the bizarre stroke of luck that he somehow actually to have happen. If 4/10 times his conscious choice would lead to the death of his charge, and 5/10 would lead to his injury, he doesn't get off innocent just because he lucked into being in the 1/10.
