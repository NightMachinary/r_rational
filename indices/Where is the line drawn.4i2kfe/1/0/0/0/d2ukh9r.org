It's worth noting that like, in general, most real life situations that share an appearance with "torture this person to produce the water of life" are actually bad. The reason our moral intuition flinches away from this kind of thing is that "I will do this terrible bad thing in order to do this good thing" often turns out to only be true up until the "in order" part of the sentence. Humans are in generally really bad at judging these things. If you are willing to torture a person to produce the water of life, due to your occasional errors in judgement perhaps you'll also torture a person to do nothing sometimes. It's safer to torture no people.

This is why, for example, pullers of levers in the trolly problem sometimes aren't also person-shovers. Pushing someone in front of a train to save 5 lives looks /a lot/ like pushing someone in front of a train and saving no lives. In fact, most of the time you're given a chance to shove someone in front of a train to save lives, it doesn't actually save lives. This is why we have a moral intuition against it.

I will be charitable and note that there are times when you have to make decisions with immediate negative moral costs. Generally, though, following a rule of "don't do something unethical to cause a more ethical outcome" is the right choice. We're bad at understanding how these systems work. We're bad at predicting where our course of action could go wrong. We're bad at guessing when our assumptions are wrong or when something is less sure than it is. We're bad at identifying what is good and what is bad in a situation. For all these reasons, in real life, you must always be hesitant to torture people to produce the water of life.
