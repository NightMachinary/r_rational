The whole Triwizard thing just makes less sense the more closely you look at it.

Not only was there no obligation for Harry to actually compete instead of forfeiting (it wasn't even his school on the line, since Hogwarts was represented by Cedric) or for the teachers to encourage him to, but it was also one of the /least practical/ ways imaginable of getting Harry to touch a portkey. Why not just Portus his toothbrush?

As I remember EY put multiple lampshades on it.
