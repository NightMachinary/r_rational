Ugh. This whole conversation has been done to death in so many fanfictions (often terribly) that just mentioning it anymore is enough for me to roll my eyes. The whole "Dumbledore is evil/stupid/abusive" interpretation clearly isn't what the author intended, doesn't add anything other than cynical shock value to the text, and isn't even novel anymore. Can we /please/ just accept Dumbledore's actions as one of the many things in the series that doesn't quite add up and /move on for Christ's sake?/

All that being said, Dumbledore seems almost entirely irrelevant to the question ultimately being asked, said question being, "Should we judge people by their actions or their intentions?" And that is a question which I feel goes beyond the scope of this subreddit.

(Yes, I'm aware that the OP says we don't know his intentions. This is utterly silly, as it leaves us with nothing but his results to go off of, in which case you're judging a person's morality by their competence)
