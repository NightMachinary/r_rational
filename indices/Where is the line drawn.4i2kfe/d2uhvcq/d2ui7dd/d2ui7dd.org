Okay, so, fancy acausal insurance rationality is hard, but you answered the question well enough. Rate him on the probability of the outcomes from his actions rather than the outcomes he actually got, makes sense. What i was sort of going for was: since the actions themselves were objectively pretty awful FOR HARRY, but they ended up okay for everyone else, would the actions be justifiable? If i torture someone because their body produces the water of life when they are in agonizaing pain, and i give that water to everyone thus rendering humanity immortal, is that okay?
