  If i torture someone because their body produces the water of life when they are in agonizaing pain, and i give that water to everyone thus rendering humanity immortal, is that okay?

I'd be okay with it happening. I wouldn't be /happy/ with it, but I recognise that it's pretty much a flat improvement upon the current state-of-the-world in aggregate. I probably wouldn't want to actually hang around the torturers since they're the kind of people who torture people, but I'd respect the task itself in the abstract.

It would be better if it were more okay and hopefully, eventually technology would make his/her suffering unnecessary, but I imagine that wouldn't be particularly comforting to him/her. My bar for being convinced that torturing someone actually produces essence of life would be pretty high though, and I'd want to at least try and make sure it's not secretly some kind of bizarre test by a higher power as well.
