> The evolution of magic in the story is also very cool and intuitive, and I am looking forward to see how it continues to develop with the hints toward greater power from beyond and whatnot.

One thing you have to remember is that people are unreliable narrators. All they know is that they think the power comes from somewhere else. This whole plot point is super important in the story. A small hint - Our story is titled Ascension.

> It feels like there's tones of strict hierarchy underlying the structure of this world that everyone just accepts (other than red, which seems to make it intentional). I hope this gets explored more...

Yeah, we will get into it, but not all at once. Reviewers have mentioned that we should take a more gradual approach to presenting the information so that they do not get lost while reading it.

> I'm looking forward to see what will happen if Red and Ritchie ever cross paths again considering how their lives changed the first time they met.

You just might get your wish in this ACT.

> Can pokemon learn to read/write? They obviously can listen, and psychics can talk (telepathically), so it seems like it should be--if not simple then at least possible--to teach even a small number of pokemon what letters mean and how to make them. Heck unown are pokemon that are letters so at least they might have some form of literacy innately. This opens a big ol can of worms in the pokemon-as-second-class-citizens thing going on here, but it also would solve the asymmetrical information transmission problem that a lot of the pokemon-trainer relationship seems to take for granted. True, it would break one of the axioms of the anime: that humans and pokemon cant speak directly, but it just keeps bugging me that SOMEBODY would have at least tried it in universe.

We have lore for the whole how language developed, why pokemon understand humans and why humans can't understand pokemon. It will be in later Acts. It is theoretically possible to teach a pokemon how to read, or baring that, how to recognise letters. This will be very tedious and will likely only be plausible in any reasonable time frame with pokemon with a high degree of sapience. As for unnown... We have a lot of lore there as well.

> You mentioned that civilization has written history only up to 600 years back, and before then humans were basically cave dwellers. This time scale seems a bit too condensed to go from proto-bronze age tech to future tech with space folding in the span that it took our world to go from the printing press to digital storage and wireless transmission. What were the factors that caused such a huge leap in technology in the setting? Is it that psychic pokemon helped improve tech by leaps and bounds with their super brains? Did legendaries help at all? Are there government cover ups of the super old writings because civilization back then was actually involved in some giant cataclysm with pokemon like groudon and kyogre and many of the evidence of these events are being hidden from the public to avoid hysteria that there are beings that could end the world at a moment's notice?

A lot of this will be explore in future Acts. But yes. /Written history and Records,/ only exist to around 600 years ago.

Another thing is, you cannot directly say that their world is more developed than ours. Development usually moves from necessity to luxury. From biomimicry to innovation. Planes were first designed from watching animals fly unlike computers, where a conceptual idea had to be created. The pokemon world holds materials far beyond our own.\\
An example of this--- In our world, scientists understood the genetic code, replication, how cells work and how stem cells transform. Then they moved to cloning. Knowledge spread and technology grew. In the pokemon world, someone found a ditto cell and used it for medicine. They are able to get the same results with much less effort. But the thought process, the /why,/ may be significanty worse than our world. That is why there is a skewed technology curve in the ascencion verse. Technology for military and development have been developed extensively, especially if it depends on material found in the Ascension verse. On the other hand, luxuary technology tends to be far, far behind.

> Are you planning on going back and fixing the typos in already written chapters? There tend to be a few throughout many chapters, and I'd be willing to make a list of what I catch if I ever reread the chapters.

I make fixes regularly. If they are minor changes, I update every month, major changes I fix immediately. We are already planning to go back to earlier chapters after this Act and polish them up a bit. For example, we used sweat drop ( a metaphorical verb) that many people didn't appreciate, and we were planning to change that.

We greatly appreciate readers pointing out typos and incorrect useage. We are also open to suggestions, if certain lines are written awkwardly/presented poorly and you tell us a better way to put them. Thank you.

> You mention sweat dropping several times through the story, what did you mean by it? (ex. Red sweat dropped when ...)

Sweatdrop is a metaphor for exasperation. It indicates /I can't believe this is happening. I/t is likely inspired by anime, as it is represented by a stylized bead of sweat. It has been used in the Pokemon show as well. That being said, we realized plenty of people may not recognize it and therefore we will change it in future edits to some other witty line when we get time or if a reader suggests a replacement dialogue.

> How's Gary doing? We recently got an update on Leaf's and Ethan's badge count but not a word on what Gary's been up to ever since he started his journey.

Well not too much about Garry at the moment. He isn't a main charecter at the moment, though he will have importance in specific Acts.

> Mia is a cinnamon roll and deserves to be protected >:(

Yes. Poor Mia.

> That's my 20 cents on the story so far, sorry if it got pretty rambly. You've got some good ideas going here and I'm looking forward to seeing how things develop. I don't think I'd really consider this a rational fiction story per se but I'm glad to have found it. Til next time! Stay safe and healthy, best wishes.

I hoped it would be rational enough, considering we literally rebuilt the world to and created lore to ensure everything was logically consistent. We are sorry if you felt otherwise. That being said---Thank you and we are glad you enjoyed it. It was a long and nice review, worth much more than 20 cents imo.
