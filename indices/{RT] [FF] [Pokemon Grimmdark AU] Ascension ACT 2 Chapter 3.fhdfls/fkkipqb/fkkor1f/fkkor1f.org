Just finished the first chapter, and I'm liking this story so far! I agree with DvDCover that it doesn't seem to be very grim in setting so much as bad things tend to happen to Red constantly. Nothing wrong with that, just seems like a mishandling of expectations in your pitch.

There are some head scratchers in terms of the setting though. For one, Red is established to be second in his class, only barely behind blue (Gary, damn that's gonna be weird to fix mentally) for his trainer exams, yet he doesn't know about a lot of things that I would have thought to be common knowledge in the world--such as riolu evolving into lucario or what the ability snow cloak does (especially since he wants to be a champion and is an admitted smarmy egghead).

That twist with the starters was nuts! Red's trajectory in your story seemed to be mirroring the Red from OoS, so I figured we were in for something similar, but then /that/ happened. Still, I approve of his started choice, even if it's unorthodox. (It'll be even better if the *power of friendship* power ups make it into your canon somehow).

One last thing, it's pretty obvious you're going to be bucking established rules a little considering you gave a mawile the ability snow cloak, so is it safe to assume that game mechanics won't be a one-to-one transition to this poke-verse? (ie. hyper cutter functioning like huge power, ralts and mankey sharing a breeding group, etc.) If that's the case I'd like to know what kind of rules or guidelines you're using to make changes to things, just so that i'm not left wondering if that was supposed to be a typo or not.

Okay, the actual last thing. This Red is such a 14 year old trash talker that Ive mentally noted down as Asshat Red and I love him for it; he's smart, but also not a computer and that makes me want to see him run the gauntlet just to see how he makes it out the other end of all this.
