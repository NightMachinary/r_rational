I just caught up to the most recent chapters, and you have me eagerly waiting for the next chapters! Most of the viridian forest adventure was fantastic, and I love the chemistry of the main crew. The evolution of magic in the story is also very cool and intuitive, and I am looking forward to see how it continues to develop with the hints toward greater power from beyond and whatnot. (Does it have to do with the unown? My bet is it has to do with the unown.)

It quickly became apparent that this story is much closer to the anime-verse with a good splattering of the manga-verse thrown in; it made for an interesting mix in tone. On the one hand you have a world where pretty much all of the creatures are sentient (not just the psychic ones), and on the other you have a society that is hugely tailored to keeping these creatures tamed and trained by humans for the safety of humanity. It feels like there's tones of strict hierarchy underlying the structure of this world that everyone just accepts (other than red, which seems to make it intentional). I hope this gets explored more deeply because it feels like a really interesting case study into classism and xenophobia, especially since in this world it seems that there are legitimate justifications considering how much power pokemon have over humans.

Ritchie's story is pretty great, and it definitely feels a lot more grim/dark on his end than on Red's. I think it highlights the biggest clash of the two types of tone you set up in the setting; on the one hand, you have an aspiring young trainer and his loving crew of friends trying to do their best and become pokemon masters, and on the other you have a world that operates in a believably real way and will not bend backwards to cater to good intentions. One could even say that it is a clash of Truth versus Ideals, hey? ;) (that gen 5 hidden deep lore) I'm looking forward to see what will happen if Red and Ritchie ever cross paths again considering how their lives changed the first time they met.

Can we talk about Ash(ley) (I facepalmed when i figured it out) for a minute? Is she a typical trainer in this setting? Up to the point where we are introduced to her the only other trainers we see battle use similar rules of engagement. What I mean is that they send out a pokemon and tell the pokemon exactly what move to use and when to use it but not much else; the trainers direct the battle strategy by dictating move choice, but leave the execution up to the pokemon. From the way Ashley behaves, this is the sort of battling she is used to and she is said to be a very experienced trainer. When Red throws this trainer-pokemon dynamic away, Ashley basically short circuits as though she has never come across a battler that DOESNT dictate pokemon battles move-by-move. And it's not even that Red is unique in this, or even one of the first, since you have Professor Oak touch on the subject and later Travers doing basically what Red did with his bug types. So it makes me wonder if it's just the upper echelons of trainers that figure out how to coordinate battle strategies with more custom commands, or if its just gym circuit trainers that are parroting this behavior. (One more thing about Ashley, she came across as a smug jackass and I want to see her suffer. Will she ever come back into the story and interact with Red again? I'd like to see a rematch between the two to see how their respective training has progressed comparatively.

Can pokemon learn to read/write? They obviously can listen, and psychics can talk (telepathically), so it seems like it should be--if not simple then at least possible--to teach even a small number of pokemon what letters mean and how to make them. Heck unown are pokemon that are letters so at least they might have some form of literacy innately. This opens a big ol can of worms in the pokemon-as-second-class-citizens thing going on here, but it also would solve the asymmetrical information transmission problem that a lot of the pokemon-trainer relationship seems to take for granted. True, it would break one of the axioms of the anime: that humans and pokemon cant speak directly, but it just keeps bugging me that SOMEBODY would have at least tried it in universe.

You mentioned that civilization has written history only up to 600 years back, and before then humans were basically cave dwellers. This time scale seems a bit too condensed to go from proto-bronze age tech to future tech with space folding in the span that it took our world to go from the printing press to digital storage and wireless transmission. What were the factors that caused such a huge leap in technology in the setting? Is it that psychic pokemon helped improve tech by leaps and bounds with their super brains? Did legendaries help at all? Are there government cover ups of the super old writings because civilization back then was actually involved in some giant cataclysm with pokemon like groudon and kyogre and many of the evidence of these events are being hidden from the public to avoid hysteria that there are beings that could end the world at a moment's notice?

There are several times where the point of view character changes mid scene and it can be confusing as to who is the new narrator. I think the most prominent of these was somewhere in viridian forest where it switches between several human and pokemon all in quick succession. You've been using the dash break as a formatting tool to show scene changes and time skips, maybe it would be a good idea to look into another formatting tool or symbol or something to show narrator shifts as well.

A couple of closing thoughts:

Are you planning on going back and fixing the typos in already written chapters? There tend to be a few throughout many chapters, and I'd be willing to make a list of what I catch if I ever reread the chapters.

You mention sweat dropping several times through the story, what did you mean by it? (ex. Red sweat dropped when ...)

How's Gary doing? We recently got an update on Leaf's and Ethan's badge count but not a word on what Gary's been up to ever since he started his journey.

Mia is a cinnamon roll and deserves to be protected >:(

That's my 20 cents on the story so far, sorry if it got pretty rambly. You've got some good ideas going here and I'm looking forward to seeing how things develop. I don't think I'd really consider this a rational fiction story per se but I'm glad to have found it. Til next time! Stay safe and healthy, best wishes.
