The grimmdark/horror tags were meant to warn the readers of dark themes. For example, the events in ch 14, and in the new act have several horror elements, and readers were glad to be warned. If you think there is a better/more suitable tag to express this feel free to suggest it In other words, what tag would you use for - Dark story in a realistic world. We do want to give some warning as a courtesy for readers, so they may avoid what they do not want to read.

We had a few references in the early chapters, but I don't remember adding ANY cross chapter 6. It would be helpful if you gave some examples, as well as how they were confusing. We will then re-edit those chapters. We don't want to break reader immersion either. (That being said, have you felt that in recent chapters, or just in the initial few?). Further, most reference's we did use felt (at least from an authors POV) that they could legitimately exist in-universe. When we go over the chapters for another edit, we will look at them again and remove ones that are not.

We are glad you enjoyed the story! Thank you for the review.

I couldn't get into Sun Soul, but for different reasons.

I kind of felt like sun souls was more about the people and less about the pokemon. Like you could take out pokemon from the story and put in some other threat and it would make no difference.

And it also fell into the category of overly coincidential horror, which kind of hurt it for me. For example, Pallet town was fine for Ash's entire life, (over fifteen years) and the day he steps, out a gyarados destroys it. Like it was done to quickly establish a motive for him to get stronger, but I don't know... I guess when you take it to the extreme that everyone dies so commonly, death itself becomes a low-stake variable which makes it low-impact when it happens.

I enjoyed Game of Champions a lot. I couldn't really get into Origin of Species either, but that has nothing to do with the story and entirely to do with the fact that the author chose to write it in present tense. Somehow, my brain really hurts trying to read it in that format.
