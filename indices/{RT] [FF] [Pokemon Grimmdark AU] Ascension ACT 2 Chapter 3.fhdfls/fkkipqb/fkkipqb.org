I've read through the entire story now. Sweatdrops aside, here are some of my thoughts. Just going to preface this by saying that these are the things i DON'T like. I love everything else, but these specific points grates me just a bit too much.

The main focal point here is: This story is not grimdark. I keep waiting for the actual grimdark, but its just not there. What I see is a dark story taking place in an otherwise normal world. Its more realistic than grim, and dark only when its dictated by the story. If this story is going to be grimdark, it needs more grim. It needs the overhanging hopelessness, and a lot of the safety nets needs to be removed.

Baseline grimdark for Pokemon is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5367085/1/The-Sun-Soul][The Sun Soul]]. That story shows a proper grimdark world, where everything is well, proper grim and dark. Events, world, institutions and whatnot. Really give it a read if you guys have not already.

The other point is more of an annoyance, but it keeps showing up too often: There are too many references jumbled in, and it breaks immersion. Be it pop culture, references to other stories, songs, catchphrases and whatever. I cant pick out any specifics from the top of my head, but theres been one too many times where I went "Wait what? Why is that in here?"

If you compare it to the references you find in [[https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/2015/01/25/chapter-1/][The waves arisen]]. You got references to Wu Tang Clan, an actual Panasonic TV and Monty Python thrown in there, some snide cameo remarks about other fanfictions, and even a bizzare outkast reference. All these references work because its something that could happen in that universe. You cant kill the Wu Tang Clan, so of course they survived and became an actual ninja clan. Or in good old HPMOR. The "Spoons +3" they come across in Diagon Alley. This is definitely something that could exist there.

The references peppered in Ascension is not something that could have happened in this universe, so it makes no sense that they would be there. They need to be more in-universe or self referential, if that makes sense. They need to have a reason for existing in the first place.

Other than the stuff I mentioned above, this is all solid work. I can definitely see the work that has been put into the unseen world building and the characters. It would not surprise me if you guys had prewritten character sheets and studies, and some minor historic lore of the world itself.

Im going to keep reading this to whatever conclusion it comes to, and with time I can see this catching up to both Origin of Species and The game of Champions in terms of quality. So keep at it, you can go far with this fic.
