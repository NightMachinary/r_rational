I don't think he's planning to attack anyone, he probably just assumes the current peace (with the other regions) can't last forever and wants to be prepared in case it doesn't.

The problem is that this kind of preparedness also makes you much more likely to escalate a future conflict to the point of violence.

As for who he will end up fighting? Hard to say, maybe Giovanni, maybe Mewtwo, maybe someone else we haven't met yet.
