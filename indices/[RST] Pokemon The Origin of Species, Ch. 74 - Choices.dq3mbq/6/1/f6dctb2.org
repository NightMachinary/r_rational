I disagree about the map. The chaos and confusion reflects that of the characters. /They/ don't have an exact map of what's going on. Everything seems OK until they get bushwhacked of of nowhere, or wander through a minefield, or have to carefully move through animals that can be spooked into a stampede at any moment.

I certainly do agree about the descriptions of the Mon. I get that this is a Pokemon story and most people will have a firm grasp of the creatures involved. But... there are often new readers who have little experience with mon who are told that the story is good from others and come to read it, knowing only the basic level of pokemon's 'cultural osmosis'. Also, there's over 800 of the critters now. A bit more descriptivesness on the individual creatures would probably help give people a good mental image, while also giving the veterans a new way to see old mon.
