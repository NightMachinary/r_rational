  I thought Vlad chose to ride away, not throw himself in. Am I missing something?

I agree; [[/u/DaystarEld]] I think this did end up being a bit confusing, probably because there were so many things going on (and the scene is interleaved with Blue interacting with Sabra!), but I think what happened was that Vlad started to go back and help, then saw what was happening and decided it was better to flee.
