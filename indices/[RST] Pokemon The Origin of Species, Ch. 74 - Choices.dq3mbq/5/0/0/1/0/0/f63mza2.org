  "But people still face certain death for those they care about, even if the recipient doesn't want them to. He can both not want Gramps to make that choice for him, and understand why he does.

  What he couldn't forgive was that Red didn't care for Aiko the way his grandfather cares for him. That he might not care for Blue the way Blue cares for him."

The second sentence is tricky to read, because it's just hard to express this in English. Additionally, the next sentence follows directly as a contrast with the former, so that one in turn is easier to understand if it's moved to the same paragraph. It's also a tiny bit confusing that you switch antecedents when you get to the last sentence, although that seems fairly minor given the amount of times you directly name the characters.

I thought I had a particular rephrasing in mind earlier, but I guess I don't anymore, unfortunately. I'll keep thinking about it...
