In the section just after Blue realizes Surge's trying to prep them for war, there're two consecutive paragraphs where Lizzy is the named speaker. (The part where the dialogue is "...pretty big risk,", "What if they get hurt?", and "It would be on them, wouldn't it?") It looks like either one of the speakers wasn't supposed to be Lizzy, or that second dialogue was actually a response by someone else, which should probably be on another paragraph.
