With the Nidos it's clear that it's an artefact of the game. They were going for differences in the sexes before Pokemon even had sex as a part of their data and that was the only way to do it in Gen I, though that did allow for different move sets and stats in a way that the modern method doesn't allow. As for Nidorina's and Nidoqueen's infertility, I'm pretty sure that was a coding error that has been grandfathered into every subsequent game in accordance with some internal design rule of Game Freak's.
