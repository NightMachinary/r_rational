Yeah, the simple answer is that as the games got more complex and added first genders without differentiating species, then different appearances by gender, then different stats and moves and evolutions by gender, the whole concept originally set up was turned on its head.

One way to resolve this is to say that Nidoran(M/F) are a single specie of pokemon which diverges drastically by gender. I think it's safe to dismiss the fertility stuff as a game conceit, but we could also do interesting things with it by saying something like:

"Nidoran live in family clusters that always breed before they evolve, then the parents basically just protect their kids until they're able to breed and evolve, after which the grandparents are now nidoking/queen of their families."
