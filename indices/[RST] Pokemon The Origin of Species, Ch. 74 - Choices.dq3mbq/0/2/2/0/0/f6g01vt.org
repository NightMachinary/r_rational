Red has shown (in Blue's mind) that he doesn't value their bond as much as Blue does. If someone is willing to put your interests above their own, it means that they care for you regardless of whether you want them to or not. If someone isn't willing to do it, it means they don't care about you as much, also regardless of whether or not you want them to.

This is what "it is the thought that counts" means. Love isn't necessarily about what someone does, it's about what they're willing to do. If someone doesn't help you because you told them not to, it's very different from someone not helping you because they don't want to.
