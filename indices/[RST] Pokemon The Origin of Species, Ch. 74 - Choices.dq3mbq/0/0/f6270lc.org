So I may have done this too subtly, but I wanted to communicate that this isn't actually what happened by noting first that Surge had shot down Sabra's idea for the last challenge because it would have been too hard, and second that Sabra is specifically not saying "This is a lesson for you," but rather "I want to see how your people deal with situations like this."

I should probably clarify this more in the chapter, since [[/u/knickersinaknit]] and [[/u/memes_of_production]] had similar interpretations. Remember that Sabra lost her friend and one of her mentors in the exact same way that Blue lost Aiko. It isn't actually /about/ Blue, he's just the person who happens to be involved in both what happened between Jack/Aiko/Red, and the gym's first opportunity to simulate that sort of situation.
