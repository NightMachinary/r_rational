In my mind, there's two parts to this.

The first is directed at Blue in particular, where it translates to "I want to see how you react when your friends are forced to make the same choice Red did and not all of them pick the response you want."

The second is that this is functionally equivalent to military training, specifically tailored to group cohesion and leadership. The 'squad', as it were, is being presented with a dilemma. A dilemma, in military terms, is roughly defined as 'a set of two or more problems to where the correct answer for one results in an incorrect answer for the others, and responding to none of them is the worst option of all'. The test isn't so much to find out if you can 'beat' it (you can't, that's why its a dilemma), but if you can come to and act on a 'good enough' decision fast enough to suffer the least loss. How you respond to both the choice and the resultant loss is the whole point.
