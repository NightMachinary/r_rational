Me 3 hours ago: Blue is being a major asshole and reacting ridiculously to this whole thing.

Blue: "What he couldn't forgive was that Red didn't care for Aiko the way his grandfather cares for him. That he might not care for /Blue/ the way Blue cares for him. "

Me: Nevermind, favorite character, I love you.

Jokes aside, I am so happy this chapter happened and I'm so glad it looks like Blue is finally coming to terms with The Whole Aiko Thing. The match seemed brutally unfair, though, and even though I know logically "Surge set up the challenge this way to teach *everyone* a lesson about difficult choices", it kind of feels like "Surge royally fucked over Bretta and Vlad's chances to get a badge just to waggle a finger at Blue and say 'see how it feels??'". Like, they set up a whole building with Voltorb and unleashed a Dragonite on a bunch of kids just so Blue would maybe realize "damn, I've kind of been an ass." At first I thought it was a coincidence but then Sabra straight up says "Yeah, we tried to make this just like the Red and Aiko situation." It seems...mean, to the other trainers. Although I guess this is mostly remedied by Surge's offer to give the two a 1v1 battle the very next day.

Still, fantastic chapter, and as always I'm excited for the next!
