You're assuming a specific duality of good and evil.

You're missing the actual reality of corrupt people using power unfettered by law to acquire more power.

Remember that most of the regions in the world this story takes place in are now at peace, after a great war nobody wants to repeat. There will still be militaries and such, and maybe even small brushfire proxy wars, but they are just coming down off their World War analog. However, in every war, crime syndicates flourish in the homelands of the combatants, to the point where they can even gain international influence. This happened both with the US Mafia and the Japanese Yakuza in the real world.

Surge knows exactly what kind of harm a small group of people with Pokemon can do. He also knows that there are basically the equivalent of living nuclear weapons flying through the sky or running across the land, and it's only a matter of time until one or more are caught.

Basically, he's not worried about the most recent war, but the nature of the 'next' war, and he wants his people to be ready.
