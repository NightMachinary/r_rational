Yeah, I have no problems with the lesson itself, it just seems unrealistically centered on Blue. Instead of Sabra being like "yep, we set this all up just so you, specifically, could realize this lesson", I expected it to be the opposite; Blue saying something like "was this all just to teach me something?" and Sabra is like "what? no. you think you're that important? We just wanted to instill this valuable lesson in every trainer etc etc." That doesn't necessarily need to be the full truth--After all, Sabra has the most motive to set up the scenario this way, because she saw the effect Aiko's death had on Red--but I think her saying it out loud is a bit tell-don't-show. Blue realizing it on his own seems more natural. He's a smart guy, after all.
