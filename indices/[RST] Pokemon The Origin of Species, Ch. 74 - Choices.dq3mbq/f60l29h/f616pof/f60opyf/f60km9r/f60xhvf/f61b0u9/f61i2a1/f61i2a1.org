This is one of those chapters where the fact that most authors commit hard to solely the written word becomes a problem. The battle scene here was in desperate need of a map, for the reader. It's tons of new locales, new Pokemon, and newish people, so getting a full grasp of the scene is a challenge. Visual elements can cut through so much of that! I think few authors really consider it, and they should.

Additionally, I am withholding judgement till after the Big Speech in the next chapter, but I don't believe this was an effective way to teach the lesson intended. Like sure Vlad ran to help out the other trainer - he wasn't in any danger! All that was on the line was a badge. I'm sure he cared, don't get me wrong, but the scenario it's meant to mimic is one where you literally would have died. I feel like this would teach a false confidence, like you have practiced a set of tradeoffs when in reality they are completely on another plane.

(None of this says it's bad writing, it's okay for the characters Blue and Surge to make mistakes like that. But we will see if the world treats this like a real "test")
