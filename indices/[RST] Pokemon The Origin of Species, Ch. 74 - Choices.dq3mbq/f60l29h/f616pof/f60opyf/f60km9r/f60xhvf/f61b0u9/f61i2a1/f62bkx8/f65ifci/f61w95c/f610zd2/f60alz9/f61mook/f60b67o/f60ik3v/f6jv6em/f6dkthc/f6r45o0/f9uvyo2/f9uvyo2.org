I agree, but in my case I couldn't care less about Leaf's "save all the pokemon" goals. I'm actually shocked Blue can put up with her knowing her attitudes... Maybe no one informed him about how Leaf went nuts trying to save the pokemon instead of the civilians during the Zapdos attack. I was expecting the big fallout to be over Leaf, for that reason - with Red following his heart and supporting Leaf despite contradictory personal values, while Blue (not being emotionally biased due to a lack of crush on Leaf) being furious with her for caring more about the pokemon over people.

Either way, I'm with you on being way more interested in the three of them travelling and having adventures together than following Red's training and Leaf's vegan attitude.
