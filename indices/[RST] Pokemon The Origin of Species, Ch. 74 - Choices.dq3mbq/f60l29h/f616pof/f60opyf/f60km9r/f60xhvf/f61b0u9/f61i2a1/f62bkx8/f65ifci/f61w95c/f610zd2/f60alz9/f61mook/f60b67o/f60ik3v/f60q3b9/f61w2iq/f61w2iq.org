  As for gender being treated as different species, it strikes me that you could explain it as a subjective, culturally-based distinction made for entirely practical purposes.

Absolutely this! From a design perspective, it's clear that the games have taken a while to settle on an effective way to represent sexual dimorphism (potentially/probably limited by technology, too), but it's pretty cool that we can also take the perspective that hey, the definition of "species" can get very, very fuzzy.

Red's got a lot of work to do, hah!
