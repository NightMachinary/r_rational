I do think that helped a ton, actually! Knowing its about the "process" of Vlad's actions, and not the one final decision, made that juxtaposition much clearer, and his own thoughts more applicable.

Though I did honestly think it was a typo, outside of this context I certainly would be just sharing thoughts, not actually suggesting changes. I certainly don't expect an author to agree with me on my points, I enjoy seeing their vision unfold.
