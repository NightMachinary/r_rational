Not just someone. He doesn't expect some random kid will do it.

He knows that technology like that is very limited and the initial runs of it will cause a sord of "Legendary Gold Rush", and that the early people doing it will *not* be paragons of virtue, but more likely criminally minded. If not the leader of an entire organization of such people.
