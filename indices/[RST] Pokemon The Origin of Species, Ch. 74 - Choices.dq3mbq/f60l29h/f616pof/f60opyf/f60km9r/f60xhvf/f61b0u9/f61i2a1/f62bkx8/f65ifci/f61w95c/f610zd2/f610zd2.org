The fascinating thing about Surge prepping for war is that there isn't an obvious threat for him to be reacting to. That is, if he's Dumbledore, who is Voldemort? There doesn't seem to be a Team Rocket equivalent.

Like, we get the occasional Giovanni chapter, but his shadiness seems way more tied up in enslaving Mewtwo than it does in any intent to conquer or attack cites.

Surge feels kind of incomplete, in that he seems to be trying to make sure everyone is ready for war, but it isn't obvious to me why he thinks that.
