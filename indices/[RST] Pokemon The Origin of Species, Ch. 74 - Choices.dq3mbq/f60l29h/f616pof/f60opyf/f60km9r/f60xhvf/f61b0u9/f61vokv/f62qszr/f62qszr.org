I was trying (and clearly failing) to draw the comparison between the initial rush to help and the final decision to flee. Does this help? (Paging [[/u/Memes_Of_Production]] and [[/u/Leemorry]] too)

"What Red did, and what Vlad did, are different. Their situations are different. The results are different.

But when Blue was watching it all unfold... as he watched Vlad decide, between a doomed attempt to save his friend, and a chance save himself and the civilian...

Blue didn't feel an answer. He didn't find a solution. On both sides, there was only pain. And that was true even before Vlad rushed away from the gate, away from the badge he'd earned, to try and save Bretta in the first place.

It was too much like Red choosing to come to Vermilion in the first place, and the comparison made it clear that for Blue it's never just been a matter of cowardice vs selflessness.

He understands why Gramps came for him during the storm. Of course he does. He doesn't feel worthy of his grandfather's life, and the risk is just too high in a way it's not with Daisy: a certainty rather than a risk, poison rather than a dice roll. But people still face certain death for those they care about, even if the recipient doesn't want them to. He can both not want Gramps to make that choice for him, and understand why he does.

What he couldn't forgive was that Red didn't care for Aiko the way his grandfather cares for him. That he might not care for Blue the way Blue cares for him.

Surge said the act couldn't be judged, but Blue still feels the hurt, the disappointment. Is that not judgement?

He's not sure.

But the anger...

The anger feels like it's missing. Like it's sucked all the air out of the room it was in, leaving an emptiness he doesn't understand."
