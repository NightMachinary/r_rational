Hi Daystar

I was wondering what was your opinion of gender dimorphism in Pokemon, especially where it results in the male and female being classified as different species. Especially with Nidoqueen and Nidoking. Sure they have slightly different movesets and stats distribution, but Meowstic also has different movesets and could have different abilities, and yet they're classified as one species. Gallade and Froslass are classified separately being a gender specific evolutionary branch compared to the one both genders could access, Mothim and Wormadam are the male and female of their species, but are classified separately.

Speaking of the Nido line, what's your take on Nidorina and Nidoqueen being unable to breed? Treat it as a game conceit? After all, while menopause is a thing that can happen, that is a reflection of old age. Why should any lifeform just reaching the prime of its life suddenly become infertile?

And then, there are the one-gender only Pokemon without clear opposite gender counterparts. For example, fanon has it that Tauros and Miltank are counterparts, but this isn't reflected in the gameplay. Are you going with fanon and treating this one as a game conceit? Because that doesn't solve the issue for all one-gender Pokemon.

And then, there's the basic question of why are the male and female of the species even classified as separate in the first place.
