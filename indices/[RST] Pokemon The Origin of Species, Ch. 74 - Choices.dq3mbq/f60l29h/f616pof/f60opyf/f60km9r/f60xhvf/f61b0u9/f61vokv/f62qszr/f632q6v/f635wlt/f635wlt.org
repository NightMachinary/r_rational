I think it's overall clearer, yep!

#+begin_quote
  "It was too much like Red choosing to come to Vermilion in the first place, and the comparison made it clear that for Blue it's never just been a matter of cowardice vs selflessness."
#+end_quote

This sentence is a little confusing, though. Maybe it can be reworded as "It was too much like Red choosing to come [to Vermilion] to help deal with the storm in the first place"; it might just be me, but it took a few moments to recall "Red chose to come to Vermilion to help deal with Zapdos fallout; he wasn't already present". There's probably a less wordy/awkward phrasing.

I have some phrasing/structure thoughts on the next two paragraphs as well, if you'd like me to share them publicly or privately.
