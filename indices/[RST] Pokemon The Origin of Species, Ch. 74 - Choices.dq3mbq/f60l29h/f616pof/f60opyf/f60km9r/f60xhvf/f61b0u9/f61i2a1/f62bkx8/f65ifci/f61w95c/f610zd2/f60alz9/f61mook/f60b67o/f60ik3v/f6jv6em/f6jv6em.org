I just caught back up to this series since starting my college term and I'm always impressed by the breadth of Pokemon you utilize. I remember one of the psychics during red's section owning a Torracat, a Pokemon native to Alola. The attention put into using Pokemon from a wide variety of regions helps main the world feel more real, as it's extremely likely to meet someone with foreign Pokemon with how global the PC system seems to be.

With the decrease in Pokemon present in the upcoming games, its nice to see that those (likely) left behind are not forgotten.
