Having a tangela strapped to your back sounds heavy.

According to Bulbapedia, tangela weigh 77.2 lbs. (35.0 kg). Given that all the characters are in their early teens, a tangela could easily weigh half as much as the person carrying it, which is an extremely heavy load for a sustained hike.

Not to mention whatever other gear Elaine or Hitoshi was carrying.
