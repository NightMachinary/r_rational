This fic can get complex with its battle scenarios sometimes. I read through the chapter with not enough focus, and lost track of the logistics of everything around the market field. Makes the chapter climax a bit confusing, though I get the gist of it. Gonna have to reread it later.

Doesn't help that I can barely remember about half of the characters around Blue. Combination of introducing many in a short span and reading a chapter a month, I guess. Maybe it's more clear who's who if you read through it once it's complete.
