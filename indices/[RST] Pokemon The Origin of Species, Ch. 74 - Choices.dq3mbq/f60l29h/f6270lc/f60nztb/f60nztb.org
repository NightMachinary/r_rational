I'd agree with that, it did make the lesson feel rather heavy-handed. I know Blue's one of the main characters, but I feel this chapter really leaned on that point.

EDIT: after thinking on this a little more, I think the chapter could be improved by keeping those 'sometimes you have to make hard choices and there are no correct answers' lesson in there, but maybe Blue could also have a humbling realization that he wasn't the only one who had to make that choice during the Zapdos attack. I doubt Aiko was the only trainer who perished. I think the understanding that he's not alone in his feelings of rage and disappointment in those who made a save-themselves choice could be a great motivation to share what happened at the chapter's end.
