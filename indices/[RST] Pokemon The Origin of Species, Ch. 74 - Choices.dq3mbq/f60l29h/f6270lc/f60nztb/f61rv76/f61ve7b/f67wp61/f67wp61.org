I think it's unfortunate that Blue is using his grandfather as a reference point here, because parents and grandparents often /would/ sacrifice themselves for their children, without any expectation of the reverse. It's not supposed to be an equal relationship. And Blue wouldn't really want one of his peers trying to act like a parent to him.
