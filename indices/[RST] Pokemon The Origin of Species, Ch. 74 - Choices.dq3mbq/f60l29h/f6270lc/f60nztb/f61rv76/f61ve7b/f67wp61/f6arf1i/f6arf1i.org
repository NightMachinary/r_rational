I dont think Blue actually wants Red to ealk to his death. He wants Red to be willing to do it like Oak did. He is worried that despite their bond, Red wouldnt risk his life to save him due to his rational logic. Something linked to their previous arguments where Red was too analytical and cold.

It's not wyat Red actually does, it is the thought that counts.
