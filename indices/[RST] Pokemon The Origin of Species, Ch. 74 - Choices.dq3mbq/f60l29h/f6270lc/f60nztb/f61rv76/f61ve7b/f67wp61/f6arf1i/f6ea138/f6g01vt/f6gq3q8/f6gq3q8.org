It isn't about putting Blue's interests above his own, it's about dying when there is no hope. But I think you're right, it's the thought that counts; however Blue isn't going to ask him to not do it, as far as I see.

He asked his grandfather; he won't ask Red. Even Blue acknowledges the difference in what his feelings regarding his grandfather are (he handwaves “but it's different, it doesn't count” at his thoughts, but he noticed)

He wants Red to be willing + he won't discourage it = it is the same as wanting it, as opposed to actively not wanting it (like heroes usually do when it comes to the people they love; they actively not want them to die trying to save them when the risk is too great)

  Love isn't necessarily about what someone does, it's about what they're willing to do.

This is about Red, not Blue, correct? I'm purposefully not touching on what Red does/doesn't feel (we weren't shown), I'm only unhappy with what Blue's thoughts seem to tell about what /he/ feels and the notion that if you decide you would die for someone even on hopeless odds, they now owe it to you or you get to be angry
