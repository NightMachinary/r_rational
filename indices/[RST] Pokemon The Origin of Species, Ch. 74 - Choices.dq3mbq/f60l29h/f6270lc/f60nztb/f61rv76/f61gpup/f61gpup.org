It's pretty clear that Surge is training his gym members for battle against Rocket. I think he wanted them to experience something specifically like what happened with Blue and Red, because that's a scenario that could happen very easily in war and it's important to 1) understand how it makes you feel and 2) not hate your fellow trainers because of the impossible decisions they make.
