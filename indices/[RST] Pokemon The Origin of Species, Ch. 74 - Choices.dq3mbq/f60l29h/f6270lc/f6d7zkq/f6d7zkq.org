Well, it *is* about Blue, insomuch as he is one of the Deuteragonists of the story, and we the audience are reading his saga. But that's obviously not what you meant. :D

However, what really makes me happy about this one is that it *directly* addresses Blue's attitude toward Red, and shines a light on the former's hypocrisy--or, at least his foolish attitude toward the situation. Blue has held this grudge for far too long, and getting to watch not one but *SIX* of his 'friends' be forced into making the same choice Red did *might* be enough of a wakeup call. Especially since a majority of them made the same decision that Red did.
