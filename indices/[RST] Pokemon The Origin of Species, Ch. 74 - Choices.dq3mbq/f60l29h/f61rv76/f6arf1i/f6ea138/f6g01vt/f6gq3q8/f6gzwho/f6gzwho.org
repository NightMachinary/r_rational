I won't deny that Blue isn't thinking completely logically, just that he has a rather good point. He justifies his thinking with the fact that Oak dying isn't just a risk, it's practically a certainty due to the pressure. There is still a bit of hypocrisy but he is right about about that.

Moreover, Red and Blue are partners. He treats Red differently because they were supposed to fight together against the stormbringers. It's what they agreed on and a bit of a risk to ones life is implied, as opposed to Oak teleporting into a situation that could kill him just from the presence. Blue and Red are supposed to trust each other as battle partners, Red's decision doesn't just make Blue doubt that Red would die for him, it makes him wonder how much of a risk Red would take and how dangerous a situation would have to be before Blue can't rely on him.

As I said, I don't completely agree with Blue here. I'm also only speaking from Blue's perspective and obviously he doesn't actually know what Red thinks or feels.
