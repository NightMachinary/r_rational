I don't know how I feel about that. Isn't the irony of Blue's thought process clear?

#+begin_quote
  What he couldn't forgive was that Red didn't care for Aiko the way his grandfather cares for him. That he might not care for /Blue/ the way Blue cares for him. "

Blue would rather his grandfather stayed safe, rather than risking his life for him. Blue has no such feelings about Red, he would rather Red walked towards death for him. Doesn't that unambiguously mean /he/ doesn't care for Red the same way /he/ cares about his grandfather?...

The way I see it, if you decide you prefer somebody died for you, rather than not, well then you don't love them, do you.

If you think you would die for somebody, great! The second you demand the reverse, and “can't forgive” the suspicion that reverse is not true, you overstep. Love is a gift freely given, no strings attached, otherwise it's something else.

Aren't good guys supposed to make sure friends don't follow them off cliffs? I am just coming down from watching Fullmetal Alchemist, and the show is chock-full of people telling their loved ones to not die for them, on hopeless odds. Blue himself does exactly that, but only for his grandfather.\\
[SPOILERS FOR FMAB] spoiler One of the tensest scenes, Roy struggling against the decision, and when he says “All right” you think he broke. When he adds “All right, Lieutenant” and you realize he chose to hear Riza instead, it's just so powerful. I can't see Alfonse preferring Ed died for him, I can't see Ling preferring Fu and LanFan, his guards(!) died for him, even though it's literally in the job description.

  What sorts of things he expects of them, to ensure they're not just willing, but aware.

And to see the fic treat Blue's position as the noble one instead, I am struggling to accept it.
