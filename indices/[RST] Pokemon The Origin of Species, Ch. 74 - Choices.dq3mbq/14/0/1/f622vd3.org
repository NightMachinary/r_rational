  As for gender being treated as different species, it strikes me that you could explain it as a subjective, culturally-based distinction made for entirely practical purposes. For example, gender doesn't really matter if you have a Dunsparce, since there aren't even superficial differences between a male Dunsparce and a female Dunsparce. At the end of the day, male or female, you're going to be getting an inexplicably lucky snake-bumblebee critter. But with a Glalie and a Froslass, they not only have different learnsets and radically different appearances, they also have different typing as well. The difference isn't simply aesthetic, in terms of battling (the most important metric) they behave as differently as different species.

Hmm, true, but it doesn't apply to every Pokemon where the gender results in different gameplay. Meowstic for example. The females are geared towards combat while the males are geared towards support.

But if the Pokemon world simply didn't have consistent and objective standards for when precisely the male and female should be classified separately, I suppose that answers that question.
