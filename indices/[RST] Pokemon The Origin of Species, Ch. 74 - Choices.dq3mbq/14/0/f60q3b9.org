  Why should any lifeform just reaching the prime of its life suddenly become infertile?

I'm not Daystar, but this isn't a hard question. You see this in eusocial animals, like bees or naked mole rats. The “soldier” class doesn't breed, they simply increase the relative fitness of their family group, passing their genes on through close relatives instead. The family group acts as one superorganism, for evolutionary purposes.

As for gender being treated as different species, it strikes me that you could explain it as a subjective, culturally-based distinction made for entirely practical purposes. For example, gender doesn't really matter if you have a Dunsparce, since there aren't even superficial differences between a male Dunsparce and a female Dunsparce. At the end of the day, male or female, you're going to be getting an inexplicably lucky snake-bumblebee critter. But with a Glalie and a Froslass, they not only have different learnsets and radically different appearances, they also have different typing as well. The difference isn't simply aesthetic, in terms of battling (the most important metric) they behave as differently as different species.
