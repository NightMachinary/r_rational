I've read and re-read and I still don't understand the choice Vlad made nor how it is similar to Red's.

In Red's case, he chose between (A) heroically risking his life for a likely awful outcome, or (B) the rationally optimal but cowardly option.

Vlad chose between (A) running back out there to save his friend, likely with an awful outcome, or (B) staying put with his civilian to get a badge, the cowardly but selfishly-optimal option.

So that adds up, and I thought I got it. But then in-story it says that Vlad decided between running away with the civilian or helping his friend, as if him pedaling out there was a given. What is going on? That seems like there's no way for him to win, because if he leaves his friend to die, the dragonite just catches up and eats him too. It seems like it's not a good parallel to Red's situation at all.

[[/u/DaystarEld]] there are like 3+ separate comments in this thread from confused people. Could you clarify how the two scenes are supposed to be parallels? (Also as always, thanks for writing this story, it's consistently a source of delight.)
