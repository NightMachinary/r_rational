I don't think that Blue should want Red to treat him the way a grandparent treats a grandchild - or a parent treats a child. That relationship is inherently an unequal one, where the parent assumes temporary authority and corresponding responsibility for the child.

If Blue expects Red to sacrifice himself in an attempt to save Aiko, the way his grandfather would do for him, then he ought to also expect Aiko to listen to Red when he says /don't go in, it's too dangerous/ the way a child should listen to a parent. With great responsibility must come great power.
