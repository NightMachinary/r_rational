Criticism: you set up the 'Surge is preparing us for /war./' realization as if it were some big reveal for the readers, when it was clearly only a reveal for the character. It's not a twist to the readers, having experienced Surge's interlude.

This would be totally fine, if you had described Blue's emotions more after realizing it. He immediately goes back to looking at the challenge, and doesn't think much about the Zebstrika's strafing move as a war tactic either.

If you make it clear later that Blue didn't think much about it because he tends to hold in bad emotions until after the adrenaline leaves him, then this part becomes amazing writing rather than a problem. But it did feel unsatisfying to read.
