Can someone remind me why we're letting Akua out of her cage all the time now? From my perspective Cat just lost against the AI in a +box+ cloak. She's obviously manipulative, and in Thief's conversation with her we learned that there can be multiple layers to her manipulations. They're catching them now, but how long can they keep that up? Cat is already finding her likable.

Obviously she's a resource, but why don't they just allow her out when they need her? Is there something I'm missing, an advantage to having her out permanently or a limitation to storing and retrieving her from the cloak?
