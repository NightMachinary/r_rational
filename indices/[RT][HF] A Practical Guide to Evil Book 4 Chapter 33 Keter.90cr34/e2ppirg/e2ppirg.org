Fuck man, Dead King is so smart it's scary.

What's the easiest way to avoid rebellion and Hero creation among your subjects? Simple, just engineer your society to believe servitude is the most important cultural value, outside world is horrible and you're the only thing protecting /us/ from /them/.

The crazy thing is, much like Black didn't lie to Cat, I think the Dead King fulfills his end of the deal too. Keter is peaceful, doesn't suffer from disease or lack of resources and actually seems like a meritocracy. Why lie when the truth serves just as well and doesn't bite you in the ass later on?
