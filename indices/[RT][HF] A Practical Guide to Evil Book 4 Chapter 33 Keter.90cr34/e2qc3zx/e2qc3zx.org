I'm wondering what the limit is of the Dead King's power to control undead. I mean, with thousands of years to grow and learn, would his actual capacity just keep growing as well? Because if he can control limitless undead he's basically a god now. He doesn't even need to cull his human herds, he just needs to sit back and wait because they'll die eventually and then serve him in death. I suppose the same effect can be done through rituals and whatnot, but if he can do it all by his own will... whoa. That's definitely god-tier.

(Slight spoilers for The Gods Are Bastards): it reminds me of how the gods in TGAB are kept strong by the souls of the dead. "The afterlife" is basically just a big battery that captures souls when people die, which is then used to power divine magic and the gods. The gods hardly need to lift a finger, because everyone dies eventually so their power source keeps getting replenished automatically. The Dead King is basically doing the same thing here, but using dead bodies rather than souls. Heck, I wouldn't be surprised if The Dead King is keeping their souls too - we already know that a gestalt can be created, and frankly it would be a pretty big oversight if TDK didn't set up one of his own. Especially since his information is seemingly so strong, I bet he's known for ages about how The Watch is powered.

And while it's obviously horrific that TDK set up a dystopian society that will serve him willingly for eternity, I can't really say that it's any worse than what the actual Gods are doing/have done. They set society up the same way, just globally rather than in a hell. Humanity is stuck in their cosmic game, specifically designed to have limited life spans (after the Gods realized the Fae were a failure and a possible danger), and societies have taught people that this is Good or just the way things are so long that none but a few such as Black even question it. In a weird way, TDK is kind of commendable when you compare his hell to Calernia. In both people are trapped by higher powers and brainwashed by society to act as their (mostly) unseen masters desire, but at least in "Serenity" people are happy, healthy, and at peace. Despite being just as trapped, you can't say the same about Creation!
