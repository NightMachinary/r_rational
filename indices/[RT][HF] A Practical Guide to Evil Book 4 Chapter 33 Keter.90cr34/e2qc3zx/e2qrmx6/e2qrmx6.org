Uuh, where is the souls = divine magic thing come from in TGAB? I really don't recall that. I thought it was just magical energy from the Infinite Order gods that were no longer around, that the current pantheon merged into something they could use (like fae magic is Naiya's, infernal is Scyllith's, and arcane is whichever other hidden old god).

Do you have a chapter that backs that up?
