Hmmm, I might actually be remembering incorrectly. I believe I made the assumption based on Scion 4:

  “The afterlife,” the valkyrie began, “is a dimensional plane like the prime material plane upon which you were born. The Elder Gods set it aside for the purpose of...well, power. You know, I'm sure, that magic requires a sapience to be initiated?”

  “She's one of the best theoretical arcanists of her era,” Tellwyrn said. “You can skip the review.”

  Evaine made a wry face at her before turning back to Cyria. “Very well. That, doctor, is the reason the Elders began harvesting and storing souls. In the suspended state which is normal there, they have no will as such. They can be used to create magical workings on a scale no mortal caster could even dream. And now, that vast soul battery is under the control of the Pantheon.”

  “Why,” Aradidjad asked faintly, “is every new thing I learn more horrific than the last?”

But that chapter says that the soul battery, while still up and running, isn't being used by the Pantheon. Divine magic was formed from the energy released by the Old Gods when they were destroyed (14-11), which I took to mean was the magic they had harvested from the souls of the dead. But you're right, it doesn't say that directly, so it's definitely an assumption on my part.
