True. I am sure Cat will figure it out and walk away with another amazing victory. I wouldnt have lasted 5 minutes through the stuff Cat has experienced.

Still, if it were me, I would be trying to set up Akua with a "spared final death by her enemy, she came to love her and changed her wicked ways" kind of story arc. It is one of the few "safe" ways it looks like this could end.
