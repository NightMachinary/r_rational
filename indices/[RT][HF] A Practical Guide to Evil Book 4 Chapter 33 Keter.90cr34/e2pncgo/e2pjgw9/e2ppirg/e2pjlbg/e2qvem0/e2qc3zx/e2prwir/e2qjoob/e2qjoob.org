Anyone else think that Cat and Neshamah are gonna have a /thing/?

She's had impressive necromantic control from very early on as just part of her Name, without any particular aspect. She's used it repeatedly, and most notably did things with it that Masego said should not be possible even before she mixed Winter into everything.

She's one of the only other villains out there who have given themselves a form of immortality without having an Aspected name.

Cat has always thrived on chaos. Neshamah is about order, long plans that have no exploitable points of failure.

Taken together, Cat is similar enough to Neshamah to be familiar, but different enough to be useful or interesting.

Cat is currently /romantically unattached./ The fanbase has also noted she can have trouble keeping it in her pants.

All of this together suggests strongly to me that the Dead King and the Black Queen are gonna bump unliving uglies.
