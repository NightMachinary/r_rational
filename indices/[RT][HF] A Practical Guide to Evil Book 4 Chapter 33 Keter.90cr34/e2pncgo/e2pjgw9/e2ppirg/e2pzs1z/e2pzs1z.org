A big lie is a plot hook for a story. The truth, even coloured to make it more mundane lacks that power. The kingdom is built like a glass sphere to the powers of good. Yes you could, in theory smash it, but there are no cracks to exploit, or corner to work on.

Its about the best defence against the powers of good as can be envisioned.
