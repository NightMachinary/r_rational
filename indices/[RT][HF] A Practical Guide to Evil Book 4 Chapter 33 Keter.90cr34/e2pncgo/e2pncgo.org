You know, Keter doesn't sound half bad. It's designed by a very talented architect with exquisite tastes, kept tidy by the most dilligent police out there (which is also stylish) and is ruled by a monarch that masterfully balances caring for his people with avoiding internal strife. There's that slight problem about free will and stuff but by the standards of Evil dictatorships kept together by dark magic, it's beautiful.

All those haters are probably just jealous, because it makes the rest of Calernia look like a bunch of failed states. Which it is, for the most part.
