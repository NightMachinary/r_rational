Gotta love how despite finding out that Dead King is so old he predates the chessboard everyone else is playing on Cat is still planning on throwing him under the cart.

Never change Cat, never change. Only she could make such an insane plan and pull victory from it (See: The whole winter court fiasco, the part where she mugged a choir of angels, and the many many points where she used Necromancy to hold her body together)
