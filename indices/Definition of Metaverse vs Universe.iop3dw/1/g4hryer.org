for me, I would focus on the prefix. uni- meaning single, a universe is a single, enclosed space containing matter. in a literary sense, it is the stage where things happen in a story and would contain all the things related to that story.

meta- is less simple, meaning something transcending the base concept, existing on a higher level, or contemplating the nature of the base word. metacognition is thinking about thinking, for example. thus, to me, a metaverse is a container collecting similar or related universes. I would say that Harry Potter, the canon stories, would constitute a literary universe, but that plus all related fan fiction would be the Harry Potter metaverse. depending on your selection criteria, you could define an almost unlimited number of metaverses from this one - the HPMOR metaverse, for example. for me, the defining feature of a metaverse is that events in one story do not directly affect any other beyond being ancestors, descendants, or otherwise being inspiration for. I would suggest that stories which do affect one another in more direct ways could be better described as a shared universe (or a multiverse if they are mostly separate, but intersect occasionally though special circumstances).

again, all of this is my own personal head-canon, and may or may not intersect with commonly accepted definitions of the terms.
