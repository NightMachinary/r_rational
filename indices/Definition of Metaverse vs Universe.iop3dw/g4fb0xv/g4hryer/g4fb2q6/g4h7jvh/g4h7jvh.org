It's probably a different sense than the one you're using and the one EY is using, but the term "metaverse" has [[https://www.cbr.com/doomsday-clock-superman-metaverse/][recently been used in the DC limited series "Doomsday Clock"]], to denote a specific universe within a multiverse, which has a disproportionate effect on the other universes within the multiverse.

In the Doomsday Clock event, the primary DC universe which we, the readers, have been observing through comics, is called a "metaverse" because all of the other universes seem to define themselves in reaction to that universe.

A similar concept is found in Steven King's /The Dark Tower/, where there are two "keystone" worlds (our Earth, and All-world where the Dark Tower itself lies) in which time only flows one way and things done are done permanently. The ending notwithstanding.
