Fictional universes(/multiverses) and their alternate timelines, I'm guessing. As an example, in Transformers, Transformers Prime, War for Cybertron, Fall of Cybertron, and The Covenant of Primus, a few other media, and their fanfics form a metaverse.

I think (emphasis on "I") it's also intransitive. HPMOR would be within the Harry Potter metaverse, but the main HP universe isn't in the HPMOR metaverse.
