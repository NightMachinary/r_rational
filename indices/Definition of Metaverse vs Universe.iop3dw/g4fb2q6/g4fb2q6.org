In the comment, EY basically said that the universe hosting HPMOR is detached from the OG universe, so it shouldn't be expected to follow or rely on things that would or have applied for the canon story.

If I had to make an all encompassing definition by those standards, metaverse would be a universe detached from any and all factors that would influence narrative, as it pertains to other versions of the story.

Ie. In canon, John, Chris and Mary are a team of adventurers who fight monsters together, due to a childhood dream.

In metaverse A, Chris and Mary went the political route due to their childhoods being different from canon, and John, for one reason or another, is not in the picture.

In metaverse B, John and Mary are employees in a coffeeshop, Chris is a friendly regular. There are no monsters.

In metaverse C, John and Chris are werewolves. Mary is a doctor who helps them while keeping their secret.

In metaverse D, John, Chris and Mary are a team of adventurers who fight monsters with /technology/.

Point being, you can designate any metaverse to mean "informed by canon, but not influenced by it"
