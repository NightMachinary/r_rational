I wouldn't call them rational, but the Sideways Stories from Wayside School series often had elements of trying to think through a problem rationally, usually with irrational results. There was also a book of lateral thinking math puzzles, which encouraged that kind of thought.

Of course, Star Trek is full of those kinds of stories, you might be able to condense something there.

There are lots of great science series that encouraged that kind of thought for me as a kid. Bill Nye, Magic Schoolbus.

You're right though, that can be hard to find.
