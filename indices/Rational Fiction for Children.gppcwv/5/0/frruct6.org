Just checked some infos about the book and they all seem pretty great, specially Big Life Journal. I would love to use it with my 7-8 year olds. It's a shame they don't have a translation to Portuguese. Short stories can be translated, and longer ones can be retelled, but this kind of content is really hard to transpose to another language.
