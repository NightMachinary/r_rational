On the same note, the netflix animated show [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCojP2Ubuto][Hilda]] is also pretty great, it's one of the few kid's shows that I think could rival Avatar in quality, depending on the quality of the second season(due this year!).

It has less of a focus on relationships and character arcs, instead focusing on plot and setting, and it knocks it out of the park on wit and charm and wonder and whimsy.

edit: the source material is a [[https://www.amazon.ca/Hilda-Troll-Book-Luke-Pearson/dp/1909263788][graphic novel]] that is also unusually good.
