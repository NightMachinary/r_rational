That was my request as prize for I-forget-what :D

If interested: [[/r/errantry]] isn't very active, but the author's [[https://ebooks.direct/collections/this-weeks-bestsellers/products/the-i-want-everything-youve-got-package][/give me everything you've got/]] package is 50% off at the moment and the best books for the money I know of anywhere.

*Highly* recommended.
