I'm already halfway through it, and what a great book! It's kind of a rationalist version of Alice in Wonderland. There's even a translation to Portuguese, although I'm skeptical about the quality of the translation, since the book relies so much on language specific idioms. But I'm already in love with it. Great recommendation!
