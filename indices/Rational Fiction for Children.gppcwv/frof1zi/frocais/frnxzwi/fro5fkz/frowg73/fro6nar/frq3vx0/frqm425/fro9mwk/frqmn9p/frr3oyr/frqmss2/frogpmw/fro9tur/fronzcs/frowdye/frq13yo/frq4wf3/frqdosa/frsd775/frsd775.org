Hmm, I think a lot of the things on this sub are fine for children, they're smarter than people give them credit for and a lot of stuff on this sub is dumber than we like to admit. I think something on the lines of morality tales but the morals are usually "it depends". Off the top of my head there's The Sword Of Good or the whispering earing. [[https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3p2yup/the_whispering_earing/]] "Cordyceps: Too smart for their own good" Would be effective but probably also give them nightmares.

Brave New World is not a short story but it is philosophically interesting with the setting being simultaneously a utopia and distopia, it also doesn't have "sides" or "answers" a world is described and within it people do things, whether these are good or bad things is something left up to the reader to judge. Though it does have themes some might not consider apropriate for children. Although it might not really be relevant I find Bogleech's story competitions attract stories that aren't so much horrific as thoughtful and deeply strange.
