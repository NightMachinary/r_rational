Thanks! Kudos to us. Teaching is a very demanding job. If you are interested in the subject, there are some interesting authors that make exactly this apology of philosophy with kids. Most notably, Matthew Lipman. He talks about creating a "thinking community" in the classroom. I don't like his writing style very much, but his ideas are great, and they were very influential in the field.
