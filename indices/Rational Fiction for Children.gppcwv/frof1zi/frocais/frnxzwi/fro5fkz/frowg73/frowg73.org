It's a bit long, but the animated series "Avatar, the last airbender" has many elements of rationality. The characters have internal lives and motivations, which guide their behavior throughout. While there isn't so much scientific-based reasoning the way there are in some rational stories, both protagonist and antagonist characters are forced to reevaluate their beliefs and actions as the story progresses and many challenging philosophical questions are touched on in a way that does them a surprising amount of credit while still being accessible to children.
