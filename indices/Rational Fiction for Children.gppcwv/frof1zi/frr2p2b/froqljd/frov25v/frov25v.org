Give it another read some time! I love finding old books I forgot about and diving in for a re-read for nostalgia and new perspectives on the characters and settings and whatnot. Sometimes there's even a sequel waiting for you when you finish.

Honestly the only part of SYWTBAW that I remember wearing on me the last time I read books a handful of years ago was the YA romance stuff. All in all it's a fantastic series for kids/teens, much better written than /some other/ magic-fantasy series that swept me up as a kid in the 00's.
