Oddly enough there is a translation to Portuguese, which I have not yet read. I'm half way through the original and really excited about the story. Also, thinking a lot about how to create something similar with Portuguese thinking-idioms. We say things like "with the head on the clouds" to mean someone is not paying attention, and "stop to think" to mean simply "think about it!"
