Debatable. They operate using an internal governance structure that is literally, /mathematically/, impossible, and as soon as they encounter meaningful obstacles (late in the first book) all of them - though also everyone around them - start behaving idiotically for no apparent reason.

The specific result it violates is a theorem of mechanism design that a nontrivial decision mechanism cannot be incentive-compatible and have a balanced budget, i.e. no currency flows in or out. It is impossible to make a mechanism incentive-compatible if the participants have an incentive to /make the other participants spend more/, and it is impossible to remove that incentive if the mechanism is the only source and sink of currency. You must either have an external subsidizer pumping money in, or an external taxer pumping money out. Crystal instead has the auction be circular; the more strength is spent, the more is distributed to all participants. This means that Face has an incentive to, for example, make Dream pay dearly for the ability to say "Insufficient Data For Meaningful Answer", even though Face does not actually care very much and neither do their other 'siblings'. This breaks the entire structure of their internal mind, principally by entailing that all the personalities are either very stupid or engage in submodeling their sibling personalities to better predict how they will bid.
