  If the system worked as mechanism design says it must, there would be almost no reason for Face to be created since every component of Socrates's mind would already have a "theory of mind" submodule.

It's been awhile since I read it, but it seemed implied to me that the other facets DID have the basic ability to model each other, they just didn't have Face's interest in humans specifically. You could argue the thought processes are similar enough that it should translate, but even if that were the case, there's still enough about humanity that's different for them for it to have arguably been warranted.

  None of the facets appear to misrepresent themselves to the others at any point, and they appear to take for granted that the others are representing themselves honestly as well.
#+end_quote

Again, it's been awhile since I read it, but I seem to recall at least some degree of hiding of goals.

  Face certainly does, and Face is the one with the least excuse for failing to model the others, since her entire reason for existence is to model other minds.
#+end_quote

Face explicitly only cares about modelling and impressing humans, not minds in general, as revealed when dealing with the aliens towards the end of the first book. This could also explain the lack of attention to the internal politics, as if I recall, Face doesn't care much about the other facets except insofar as they're relevant to impressing humans, which explains its lack of prevalence in the story since we mostly only see Face's perspective. You could say it should still be a greater priority, but at that point it's less stupidity and more a lack of perfection.
