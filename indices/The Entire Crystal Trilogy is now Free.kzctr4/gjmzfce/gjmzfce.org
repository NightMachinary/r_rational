It's also available on [[https://gumroad.com/raelifin][Gumroad]] as well for those who would prefer it as their source for copies.

There is a Spanish [[https://artifacs.webcindario.com/obras2021.html#cristal1][translation]] of Crystal Society written by David (Artifacs) as well. Mentality and Eternity will also be eventually produced in Spanish.

For those who don't know what the series is about, here's a summary:

#+begin_quote
  The year is 2039, and the world is much like ours. Massive automation has disrupted and improved nearly every industry, putting hundreds of millions of people out of jobs, and denying upward mobility for the vast majority of humans. Wealth and technology repair the bodies of the rich while famine and poverty sweep the world. Privately operated ventures carried humans to the moon and beyond, but space stations have become nothing but government trophies and hiding places for extremists. First contact did not bring advanced culture and wisdom, as the aliens were too strange, lacking even mouths or normal language.

  Face is an artificial intelligence created to understand and gain the adoration of all humans. She and her siblings control the robot named Socrates, using a crystal computer that seems too advanced to be made by human hands. She is learning and growing every second of every day, but the world and the humans on it are fragile. Can it survive her destiny?

It's a story with very well-written AI characters who genuinely come across as being non-human in their thinking and priorities, but are still relatable in spite of their inhumanity. The AIs are reasonably balanced and grow slowly enough to have challenges instead of a FOOM event where the AIs have won and taken over the world within an eye-blink. Oh, and there are some cool aliens as well I guess.
