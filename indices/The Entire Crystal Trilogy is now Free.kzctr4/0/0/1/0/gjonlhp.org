It is a criticism of the characterization, since the characterization is incoherent. If you're trying to write nonhuman minds that arise from odd preconditions, you have to actually think through the preconditions.

- If the system worked as mechanism design says it must, there would be almost no reason for Face to be created since every component of Socrates's mind would already have a "theory of mind" submodule.

- It is irrelevant whether they're working as intended, since the incoherent mechanism is /how they believe the system works/. Not how the system was /intended/ to work, how it /does/ work. And the system /cannot/ work that way. If they have not noticed this, despite it being the most crucial and fundamental part of their environment imaginable, they are very, very stupid.

  - Literally, understanding this is the most important thing in the world for them. This is the system that limits their ability to take any action that forwards their utility function.

- They spend no time on relevant internal politics in the first book. I have not, and probably will not, read the others, but in the first book, none. None of the facets appear to misrepresent themselves to the others at any point, and they appear to take for granted that the others are representing themselves honestly as well. Face certainly does, and Face is the one with the least excuse for failing to model the others, since her entire reason for existence is to model other minds.
