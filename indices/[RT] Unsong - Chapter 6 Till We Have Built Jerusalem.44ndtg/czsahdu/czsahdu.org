I have an idea on how to make this safer, but it's based on some assumptions that I'm not 100% sure are correct.

1. If you don't know that something's a name, then you get the vision of what the name does and the name doesn't activate. This is true even if someone else has used the name before.

2. If you know that something is a name, then the name activates without the vision even if it's the first time you used the name.

Based on 1 and 2, the current system is that Llull is outputting a name without activating it, and then Aaron, knowing that it's a name, activates it without knowing what it does. This seems so obviously dangerous that I don't understand how Aaron and Ana don't see it.

My idea is to have Llull output a list of, say, nine dud names and one real name. If Aaron reads this list, will the real name give him a vision and not activate? Does knowing that one of the names is real sufficient to activate the name without a vision?
