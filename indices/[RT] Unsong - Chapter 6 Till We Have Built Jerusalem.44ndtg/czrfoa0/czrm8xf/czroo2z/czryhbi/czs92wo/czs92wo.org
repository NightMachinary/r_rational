It started with hisses.

"Hank," Terry said, "did you hear that?"

They were slowly panning the city in a black unmarked van. Hank's coffee sloshed slightly as he turned a corner - Terry had no idea why the man drank it, it wasn't like anyone would bring him in for speaking the Wakening Name - probably the taste, as odd as that sounded, Terry couldn't stand the taste himsel - /hiss/.

"Hank," Terry said, again, "did you hear that?"

Hank turned his head. "What, you mean /hiss/ those hisses?" He shrugged, pulled up to a stoplight. "Yeah, I- there's one."

Terry hadn't heard a hiss.

/hiss/

"Probably nothing," Hank said. "Tinnitus, or something."

/hiss/ /hiss/

Terry stared out the window.

/hiss/

That couldn't be right. If it was right, the hisses would disappear if they started driving right now. And so it was probably noise from the radio.

The radio was off.

Solar flares, Terry thought, desperately, it's solar flares directly inducing current in the speakers.

Uriel had debugged solar flares last year.

And Hank was hearing them at different times.

/hiss/ /hiss/ /hisssisis/

Terry turned his head and stared at Hank, and he said thus:

"/Hank, trust me, we need to get the FUCK out of the city/"

"-but-"

"*DRIVE!*"

Hank drove.

/hiss/ /hisssisis/ /hisssss/ /hiss/

The sky turned black behind them, and the sun burnt red.
