And they could be able to track it.

  “Whenever you use a protected Name of God,” I continued “UNSONG agents with the Sentinel Name tattooed above their ear, and the Names involve tattooed on their foreheads, can track your location. In practice they rarely do, because a million people do that every day and they don't have a million agents or a million jail cells to put people in. But if a dozen people use all sorts of Names in the same spot every day, they know it's a place where singers hang out and then if they're bored then they come and raid you. This is probably what happened in Colorado.”

  (“We have no idea who UNSONG can and can't track,” I said in my imagination. “The Coloradans weren't stupid enough to consistently use Names in their hideout because no one is that stupid. So something else went wrong. We could do everything by the book and all get arrested tomorrow.”)
