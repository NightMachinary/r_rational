Well, this is a different sort of value-alignment problem. Most of the time it's basically "how do we build something that shares human values, even after it has (figuratively) god-like powers?" while this one is "how do I ensure that /my/ values become like humanity's shared values, because I will soon have (literally) god-like powers?"
