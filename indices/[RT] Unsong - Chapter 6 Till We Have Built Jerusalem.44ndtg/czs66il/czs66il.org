So, at the end of this chapter, we have Ana left alone with Llull running on Apple.

/Ana/ is suspiciously similar to /Eve/ passed through easy (but not /so/ easy as Caesar) substitution cipher. And /LLull/ is similar to /Lilith/, as someone pointed in comments.

Unfortunately, I have no idea how to get /Adam/ out of /Aaron/, so it could be a coincidence.
