Thank you for your input. I'm sorry you've had such a negative takeaway from the chapter.

I must admit I am bewildered by the notion that including ethically dubious behaviour is inherently equivalent to condoning it.

I should also mention that "teenage boys attempt to peep on girls at the hot springs and receive their just comeuppance" is a well-known manga/anime trope, and nobody familiar with the medium of the original series would assume that that its presentation is intended to validate the boys' actions.

While I'm here, this is in no way a comment on you personally, but I'd like to mention cultural double standards. This is a work in which violence, from comical to attempted murder, features repeatedly, yet I believe this is my first serious call for censorship.
