Sorry, this might sound a bit condescending, but explaining this entirely will require crossing too large of an inferential distance for a single conversation to suffice. I will say that its not a mere matter of the inclusion of the questionable content itself, its a matter of how its presented and narrated. Most readers take context and tone and presentation and style into account too, not just the literal meaning of what is being said and shown. You really need to learn to understand how things look to readers and how to present things in a way that will come across the way you intend them to come across.

As a skilled writer, you ought to be using Presentation mindset a bit better. Presentation mindset is made of communication mindset and facilitation mindset. Facilitation is made of tactics and strategy, which is good if you're trying to write something that maximizes the chances that readers will interpret the writing the way you want them to and minimize the risk of misunderstandings. Communication is made of semantics (scripted analytical communication) and empathy (unscripted spontaneous/creative communication). You need to improve your skill at using empathy mindset and then apply that to improve your presentation mindset.

The mindsets are the fundamental building blocks/similarity clusters that all skills are made of/fall into, and at their core they are made of bayesian probability stuff, even if it's not always immediately clear how.

Hope that helps at least a little bit.

There's not much else I can tell you that will be understandable until extradimensionalcephalopod writes and posts more of his lesswrong sequence.
