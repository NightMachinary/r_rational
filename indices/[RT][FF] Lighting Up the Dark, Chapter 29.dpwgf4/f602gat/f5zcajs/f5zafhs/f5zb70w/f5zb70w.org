If only naruto was a little older and aware of certain kinds of things, he might have called out his elders for raping drunk civilians and then joking about it.

I really wish that part had been treated more sensitively. I know it goes over naruto's head, but the mission he was just tricked into by those older ninja was esssentially to commit sexual harrassment.

Most readers who read this chapter who arent already familiar with velorien will assume, however rightly or wrongly, that the author is okay with rape and sexual harrassment and that he thinks it's something worth joking about. This is not something to take lightly. Velorien I urge you to retract this chapter and edit it. At the very least put some foreshadowing in that what these ninja are doing is dangerously unethical, even if naruto is too young to understand the implications of what hes being told to do. make the humor look like it's meant to feel uncomfortable and meant to not really be funny, rather than just being presented/treated as straight up light hearted fun. Seriously you are a good writer and you can do better than this.
