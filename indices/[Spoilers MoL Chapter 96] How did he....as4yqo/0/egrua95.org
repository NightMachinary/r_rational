I think its through the use of the black room, he maybe wanted to help Veyers better control his magic, as such he only needed time ->blackrooms -> very close to the sovereign gate. Veyers then returned to the classroom with new control telling zach about this as they are in similar positions. Zach meeting Jornak. Or searching for him in a new restart to get in on the time in the balckroom (maybe over multiple restarts, again zach struggling with his contorls in the beginning of the loop). Jornak got some good connections and in chapter 54 it is said that the royals regularly checked up on the sovereign gate (connection to dagger). So after letting Zach entering the black room a couple times, Panaxeth contacts Jornak, because he sees an opening. And Panaxeth helping Jornak getting a stable marker is not that far fetched.

Or zach told him about the gate and the items stolen from him and they checked up on it based on that. But i think it was because of the blackroom project.
