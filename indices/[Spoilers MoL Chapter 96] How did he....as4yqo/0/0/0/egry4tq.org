I dont think it was Zach helping him with that, i think it was Panaxeth, after all panaxeth is even powerfull enough to create new bodies in the real world and transport their souls there , should be easy to take one soul and merge the marker into it... or just remerge it into the new body at the start of every restart. But Jornak needed the marker to leave and bare the gate that way... so most likely Panaxeth merging the marker into his soul. Except that its a kind of deus ex machina , so something we just dont know yet. Maybe Jornak has some connection to one of the other immortals, someone very skilled in divine magic etc... but i doubt that.
