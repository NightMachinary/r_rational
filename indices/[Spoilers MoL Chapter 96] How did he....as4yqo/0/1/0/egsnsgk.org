That is not the case! The stabilizing frame is used to stabilize his magic pool which got doubled, through it. Not to help him contol it. Zorian remembered Zach in the beginning as a poor student because of his issues with his control. This wouldnt be the case if the frame also helped him with his shaping. An Quatach-Ichl who got the same kind of blessing, describes the stabilizing frames structure and functionality in Chapter 81, but doesnt talk about any effects on the shaping skills. Just that doubling his mana reservoirs dwarfs any other kind of natural mana pool enhancement.
