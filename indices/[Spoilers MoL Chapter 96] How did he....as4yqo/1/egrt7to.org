What Jornak said about how Zach "just wouldn't understand" seems to imply that they had already spent some time together, so Zach likely already knew how to give people the ability to retain continuity. But why would Zach use such an ability when he knows that he would eventually have to take it away or kill them? I guess if he wanted to do some legal prep for his court case, he might give Jornak a temporary marker. But that still doesn't explain how Jornak could modify his marker or contact Panaxeth.

And I don't think Jornak accepted Panaxeth's deal until he already became frustrated with Zach, which would likely take longer than a month. The only explanation that I can think of is that Jornak already had some way of maintaining continuity between restarts before betraying Zach.

I suppose out of everyone in the story, Jornak would be in the best position to become Red Robe. But there's still a lot of things that need explaining.
