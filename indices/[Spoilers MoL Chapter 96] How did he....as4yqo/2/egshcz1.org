Maybe QI had once been in a time loop himself. He has a divine blessing for his mana reserves and was very quick to sacrifice himself when he learned about the time loop which maybe suggests that he was already familiar with the concept.

If this is true then maybe QI explained to Jornak how the time loop works and QI lended him the crown to get a temporary marker. Then he tried to leave the loop before the the end of his last temporary loop, but that didn't work because he is not the controller. But Panaxeth used this chance to tell him how to get a longer lasting marker in exchange for freeing it.
