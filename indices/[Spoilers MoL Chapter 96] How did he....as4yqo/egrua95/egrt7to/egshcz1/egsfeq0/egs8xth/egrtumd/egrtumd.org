If Panaxeth did the contacting in (2), that would explain (1). (3) is easy if we assume Quatach-Ichl cooperated because of his cult connections. Remains (4), which might be through Panaxeth's help.

Did Panaxeth state it never contacted anyone before? I'd have to re-read that, but if so it could also be a lie.

Also, how much useful knowledge could have been obtained from Quatach-Ichl? He was the one who used the Sovereign Gate before, so knowledge about the crown's function could have come through him.
