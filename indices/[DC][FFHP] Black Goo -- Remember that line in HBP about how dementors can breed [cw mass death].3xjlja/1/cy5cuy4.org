There's a very interesting fanfiction out there (found the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7539141/1/Incorruptible-The-Dementor-s-Stigma][link]] ), in which the world is besieged by a zombie virus spawned by dementor reproduction. It's an interesting read. Never thought I'd see HP mixed with zombie apocalype.
