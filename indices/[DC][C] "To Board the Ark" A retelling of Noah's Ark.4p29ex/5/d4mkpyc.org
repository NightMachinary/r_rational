Seriously? In the Christian version of Noah's ark only him, his wife, his kids and their spouses could get on the ark?

Not wanting to get into a religious war here, but as a Muslim, I keep getting shocked at how horribly the prophets are portrayed in Christianity. We believe in all the same prophets and I used to think we told the same stories about them, but that really isn't the case.
