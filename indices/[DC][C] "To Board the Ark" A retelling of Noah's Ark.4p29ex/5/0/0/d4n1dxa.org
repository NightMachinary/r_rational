Wow, any chance the bible also contains verses that say something like "All of Noah's followers were allowed to join him on the ark"? (which would be more in line with the Muslim version of the story, where Noah keeps asking people to join him but the evil doers refuse, thinking they could take care of themselves)

Or in the bible version does Noah have no followers?
