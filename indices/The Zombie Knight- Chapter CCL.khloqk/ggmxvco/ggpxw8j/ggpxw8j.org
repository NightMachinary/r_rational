I second OP's recommendation. The Zombie Knight has previously been posted on here and agreed to be rational. As for the rational content:

- Characters munchkin their abilities in clever and creative ways. It's been a while, but off the top of my head, the main character uses his ability to >! create iron to create platforms for aerial mobility, form armor, weapons, and projectiles, form around enemies to bind their limbs, and form support struts to temporarily prevent a building from collapsing !<
- Characters do act in line with their motivations, without any plot contrivance.
- The worldbuilding is detailed, well thought-out (in my opinion), and consistent. Nothing has broken my suspension of disbelief so far.
