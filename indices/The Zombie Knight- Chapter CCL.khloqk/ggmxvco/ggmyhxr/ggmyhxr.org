It's been a while since I've been active in this sub tbh, so maybe norms about stories being rationalist got stricter, but it's more of just a good web novel I think this sub would like.

It essentially follows super powered people in a fantasy world. There's a sizable amount of use of chemistry and physics in the super powers, doing things like summoning super cold iron iron in extremely hot temperatures to cause explosions. There's also a sizable amount of decently nuanced real politic in negotiation between politicians.

No one's ever really holding the idiot ball or making really dumb decisions, there aren't any Mary Sue flawless characters.
