It seems more like a question of how to trick the computer as opposed to a game theory issue. You want to convince the computer you are going to take 1 and actually take 2, but the computer being right 100% of the time by definition makes this impossible.

Heads I take 1 box, tails I take 2. I will get 2 boxes rewards 25% of the time unless the computer simulates reality or something. I feel like this is a gordian knot answer, but it's an easy personal answer.
