I strongly precommited to box 2 as soon as the dude explained the original scenario. I wasn't even aware that I could take both boxes, but since the nature of strong precommitment is that it must be strong, I've decided that I would only open one box even if I found that box to be empty.

That being said, this depends strongly on the marginal utility that each quantity of money would give me-- there are scenarios in which I'd strongly precommit to only opening the $1,000 box, and then only open the second box in case of a major emergency. Then I'd carry the second box off, and then if I ever opened it, I'd know how desperate the computer expected me to get versus the power of my own precommitment.
