Presumably, the godlings become empowered at the same time and in the atmosphere of a planet. Assuming I have first mover advantage (if I don't, I've already lost), I simply apply as close to infinite momentum to each atom within one meter of their head as I can, on a vector which intersects the center of mass of their head. It's a simple enough attack that I could absolutely understand how to apply it without first having a PHD in physics and it obliterates my foe in less time than it takes for the nerve impulses to be interpreted by their consciousness.
