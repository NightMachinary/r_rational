For defense, a white hole event horizon. They can't create anything in the volume of my body, and so surrounding that volume with a horizon means nothing they create can ever affect me in any way. I no longer exist in the same axis of time as they do. Either of us might choose to count this as a win, as this effectively causes solipsism to be true.

And on the off chance that my opponent for some reason doesn't immediately do that as well, I simultaneously make a black hole horizon around his volume, and solipsism doesn't have to be true.
