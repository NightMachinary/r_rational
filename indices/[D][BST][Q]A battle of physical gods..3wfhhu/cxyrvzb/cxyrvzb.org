Run away. As far as possible, faster than light if I can do that. The enemy can't kill what they can't find, unless they're willing to destroy the universe to stop me. If they are... well, I'll only have to worry about that particular problem once.

Once I'm far enough that I think I haven't been followed, settle down on a quiet planet in a randomly selected galaxy and try not to do anything that can't be explained away as perfectly normal aliens playing with Kardashev Level II technology.

Settle down for some hardcore research, like I'm writing a PhD thesis in godhood. Test my powers, see if I can reshape my body or back myself up or make tools that tap into my divine powers. Do some physics experiments, invent some new weapons, check if there's any possibility of tapping into time travel or parallel universes or FTL signalling (if I don't already have those). Maybe track down some actual aliens or a helpful Singularity and ask them for more ideas.

Edit: Oh, and learn how to make food. Starch and water are easy enough, but they'll get boring very fast. It would be very embarrassing for a god to die of malnutrition.
