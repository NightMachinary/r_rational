Yudkowsy suggests the secret to this is to only explain the relevant rules which you intend to exploit in your clever solutions, to mention them repeatedly through the story so we know they aren't offhand comments, and then do the grand reveal. Any rules you aren't planning to use in the course of the great exploit itself can be shown rather than said outright.
