I'm walking a bit of a fine line; if I do a full game design document and detail every single mechanic, it'll satisfy hardcore gamers that want to know how it works, but it'll turn off casual readers who just need those scenes to convey action and explain character through action. So far each game scene (there are more coming up) has a point about a character's motivation to express, and too many mechanics get in the way of that. So, I'll likely take a balanced approach, where the OVERALL strategy is sound even if the specific nuts and bolts aren't detailed.

For general research I've watched a hell of a lot of Smite and DOTA 2 streams. (For some reason I can't get into LoL... visually it's a chaotic mess.) I'm figuring Challenge of Champions is like 65% smite (action and skill based combat, since avatars have freedom of movement) and 35% DOTA (item and role based tactics).

As for the murder, trust me, that part will make sense. Next week I have a blogpost from Tracer which explains how weaponry and death work in this world. We're only one week in, after all, and this isn't even a full chapter! I think once it's all in place it'll lock together. But these are good questions to ask, because some of them point to larger mysteries. Much as Verity asked... WHY would an avatar ever need a belly button?
