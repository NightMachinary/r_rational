I actually tried that (leaving a lot unsaid, letting extrapolation take over) but a majority of my prereaders were completely baffled by the game mechanics as a result. This is the opening scene so I need to be SURE it grabs people and they completely understand how it works, so I had to err on the side of caution and explain as much as I could.

I did some googling to determine a good MOBA-esque game title, and Challenge of Champions is only shared by a mixed martial arts tournament, so there's no real overlap. Still, I can change it at any time.
