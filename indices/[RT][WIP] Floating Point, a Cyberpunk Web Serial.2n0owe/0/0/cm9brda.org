huh, cool. if you don't mind me asking, how do you plan to address the problem of recursive self-improvement? reading the first chapter, it looks like agents modifying themselves is quite pedestrian.

minor gripes: i'm like 70% sure that "CoC" is already an acronym for a game. probably should check that. also, it broke my immersion a little when the ostensibly-professional players started explicitly stating parts of the game -- i'd like it better if it were left unsaid and to be extrapolated (unless, i guess, the structure of mobas is going to become plot-relevant at some point).

other than that, i like it. enjoyed CoA, too, so i'll definitely be watching.
