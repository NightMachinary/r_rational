Hey there. I'm the guy who wrote [[http://stefangagne.com/cityofangles][City of Angles]], which has been linked to here and there in [[/r/rational]].

I'm starting up a new web serial novel series called Floating Point, taking place in a digital world populated by sapient Programs (descended by evolution from Apps), which I think you guys might be interested in.

I'll admit I'm new to rationalfic, having only found out this subreddit existed when someone here linked to me, but I'm quite fascinated with it. I'm hoping to work in some rationalist themes into my story as I go along.

New draft chapter updates go live every Friday, so if you like what you see, pop by each week! Thanks so much.
