Soooo, I've been trying to find words to describe just how this news makes me feel.

I can't find those words. There's a fair bit of "Yaaaay!" and a whole lot of "MUAHAHAHAHAAAA!", and also the kind of noises I used to make at Christmas when unwrapping a Lego box larger than me. (Now I got a job and I can buy those boxes whenever I want. Hah!).

There may or may not be silly dance moves.

Also, "I'm the guy who wrote City of Angles"? You're Stefan Gagne. Stefan Gagne! You wrote City of Angles and Anachronauts and Unreal Estate and Sailor Nothing and also the best Slayers fics that were ever written. Among many other things (but those are the ones I keep on my ereader on a permanent basis). You're the first one whose works I've read online and thought "I wish he'd publish that", and then you did, so I bought them.

And I /think/ I'm fanboying just a little and I'll go away now...
