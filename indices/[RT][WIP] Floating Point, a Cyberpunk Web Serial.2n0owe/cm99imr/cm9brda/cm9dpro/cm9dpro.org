Oh, I forgot to address the first part:

This will be discussed later in this very chapter, next week in fact, but there are hard limitations on upgrading one's self. The bulkier your code is the more runtime you need on a server, eating up more than your fair share of resources compared to other Programs. Moderators may show you the door if you cause lag in their home. Still, if you have full rights to the server you can be as augmented as you like up to the limit of what the server can handle.

(This is also a disadvantage to un-augmented Programs who are simply very old... their memories eat up, well, memory. Homeless old folks are scorned by society as wastes of resources that could be going to leaner, meaner hot young Programs. Free shelter servers are often packed with large, old Programs who can't afford modular memory backups or data cleaning medical services.)

There are downsides to installing hundreds of patches in yourself, though. The bulkier your code, the more interdependent libraries you install, the crazier your patches are... the more likely you are to coredump and die. Imagine a runaway Linux box with eleven billion packages installed, all conflicting with each other in strange and terrible ways, and that's why you want to be choosy with how much you upgrade and optimize yourself. If done with skill it's theoretically possible to fill the limit of your server... but odds are whatever black market clinic you used to get 'em installed doesn't think long term.
