That's my approach, too. I plant a LOT of Chekov's Guns in my text; basically whenever I need a rule to play a critical role I be sure to introduce it early and reenforce it now and then. So, for the game, the IMPORTANT aspects (the creeps, the stuns, the items) are explained, but every exact item or power is not.

My goal is to express motivation through how the character plays the game. For example, Lumberjacker's rage and inability to accept his situation end up screwing him over, and that speaks to his character and to Spark's ability to recognize that rage and play into it for the win. And only as much of the game as I need is deployed for that.
