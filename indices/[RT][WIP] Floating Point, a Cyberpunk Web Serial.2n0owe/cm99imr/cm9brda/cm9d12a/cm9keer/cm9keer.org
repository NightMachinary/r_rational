I was about to raise the same point about game mechanic knowledge, before you answered it here. I have played ~2k hours of DotA 2 and some untracked but extremely high number of hours of DotA 1, and just finished watching pro tournament games of same as I often do, so my knowledge base here is probably way off the far end of the curve of what you could expect in readers... I suppose it's a necessary evil to explain this stuff if you intend to make it a major part of the story. It was quite interesting to read about a fictional game in that vein - it was also amusing and interesting. Do you have some sort of worked-out original understanding of the fictional game and mechanics which attentive readers could follow, or is it taken from a MOBA I haven't played much such as Smite, or is it just spur-of-the-moment stuff?

I have a little background in programming also. A lot of the major parts of the setting and plot are already starting to feel a little silly, but I have hopes based on my experience with your other work that you'll find some reasonably clever idea to work around the problems. For example, I wonder if the 'murder' at the end of this chapter to be taken at face value when we're talking about digital entities, or if the 'murder mystery' is going to end up like the murder mystery in Dan Simmon's Hyperion Cantos Detective's Tale: trying to work out who 'murdered' an AI controlling an android, at that AI's request, because it's reset from backups lost a couple days of memories and data? (Note: don't answer this question, please, mr. author, I prefer to find out by reading without spoilers).

I hope there turns out to be a lot of clever explanations and ideas behind the weirder parts of the presented world.

If you happen to be fairly familiar with the DotA pro scene, there's a very hilarious [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tNwDtX3UmWYzfVzQTCIJ5eUCfBMYDf1xDmTgn9IPWJ8/edit][HP fic by Ken Chen, aka Hotbid, the guy behind Esportsexpress.com]] you might quite enjoy (he's planning ~15 chapters total, of which this is the first). If you don't have the background knowledge, of course, the entire thing is bizarre and pointless.
