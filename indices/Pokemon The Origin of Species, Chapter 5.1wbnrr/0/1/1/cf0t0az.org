I wonder how his opinion will shift as he meets some of the pokemon with language or human / better-than-human levels of intelligence...(as in, is he just favoring his own species, or does he basing his judgement off some other attribute?)

Except I suppose that interaction won't happen unless they are wild, since you've said that the pokeballs will dumb them down to human-toddler level? (Shit, I wonder if that gives trainers who don't use pokeballs a huge edge with respect to pokemon which are smarter than toddlers...)
