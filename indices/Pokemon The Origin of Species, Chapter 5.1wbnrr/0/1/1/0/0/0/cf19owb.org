  On the other hand, the pokedex says all sorts of weird things, so you could just say the pokedex is wrong and people were anthropomorphizing when they wrote that...

Bingo.

Despite the pokedex's many mentions of incredibly intelligent pokemon, we never really get any evidence of this intelligence in the games from pokemon other than legendaries. Furthermore, that intelligence almost certainly gets blunted after being caught, since the pokemon become so docile and suggestible that, for the most part, a child can order them around like a plaything.
