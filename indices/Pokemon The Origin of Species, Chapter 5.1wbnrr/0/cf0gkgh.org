Red's argument for humans being more important assumes its conclusion in its premises. If you're going by the effect the death has on others, why are they rating the deaths of both groups by their effects on humans, rather than rating the affect on a pokemon of the death of another pokemon? Also, the argument defines value of a life solely as its effects on other lives, so in that system it wouldn't be immoral to kill a homeless person with no friends, or kill someone and trick everyone into thinking they aren't dead.

Obviously you can have him be wrong if you want, but it annoyed me.

Typo: "Keep laughing when after I catch one" When or after, pick one.
