  It's jarring to see humans and pokemon referred to as "the two species". That's definitely not the right word, but I can't think of anything better... I'd probably just go with "the two" or "they" until I thought of something.

It gets a bit complicated because on our planet, "species" are defined as being all capable of interbreeding within the same classification, but in Pokemon, the way they can interbreed is very unorganized. So you could for example say "bug species," but many bugs can also breed with water pokemon or field pokemon, who themselves are made up of practically every type in the game. But ultimately all pokemon are part of the same species, while humans are distinct from them.

  I certainly wasn't expecting Leaf to be a Plasma sympathizer! I see why you made her a native of Unova. That's a very good way to inject some philosophical discussion into the story, and I applaud you for it.

  I also really like the little traces of color you're sprinkling around. Sit-down restaurant, dogs welcome. Birds the size of an ultralight landing on the street, whatever. Please help yourself to the ficus. Keep it up!

Thanks!
