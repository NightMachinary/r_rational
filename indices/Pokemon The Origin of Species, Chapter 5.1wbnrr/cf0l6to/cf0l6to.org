It's jarring to see humans and pokemon referred to as "the two species". That's definitely not the right word, but I can't think of anything better... I'd probably just go with "the two" or "they" until I thought of something.

I certainly wasn't expecting Leaf to be a Plasma sympathizer! I see why you made her a native of Unova. That's a very good way to inject some philosophical discussion into the story, and I applaud you for it.

I also really like the little traces of color you're sprinkling around. Sit-down restaurant, dogs welcome. Birds the size of an ultralight landing on the street, whatever. Please help yourself to the ficus. Keep it up!
