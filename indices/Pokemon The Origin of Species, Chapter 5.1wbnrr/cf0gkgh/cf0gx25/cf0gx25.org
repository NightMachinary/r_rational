  If you're going by the effect the death has on others, why are they rating the deaths of both groups by their effects on humans, rather than rating the affect on a pokemon of the death of another pokemon?

Yes, that's part of the hierarchy of his values: human suffering is more important than pokemon suffering, so it would take quite a lot of pokemon suffering to be an equivalent exchange for some human suffering. Just how much is something Red hasn't really had to explore, yet.

  Also, the argument defines value of a life solely as its effects on other lives, so in that system it wouldn't be immoral to kill a homeless person with no friends, or kill someone and trick everyone into thinking they aren't dead.

Not the value of a life: just the impact of a death. There is a distinction, and as the argument is specifically about the death of a human vs a pokemon, killing homeless people or tricking people into thinking someone isn't dead is not really relevant.

There are, rest assured, many other reasons why Red would be against those activities.

  Obviously you can have him be wrong if you want, but it annoyed me.

Oh yeah, I don't expect this to be a popular opinion :P

Fixed, thanks!
