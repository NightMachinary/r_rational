Premise one is not a premise, but an observation. The situation is not a hypothetical. He has empirically observed this experiment, and the fact is that human deaths make him sadder than pokemon deaths. Our morality is a black box we examine through a game of twenty questions. Sometimes we can notice patterns very strongly and be confident in what we feel is right. Other times we find to our surprise that we aren't bothered by things we expected to be bothered by, and have to search for why, or the reverse. But the observational fact of it remains, and tells us something about the flaws in our hypothesis, and the nature of the box.
