He gives it as a justification for why he wouldn't care about experiments being done on his charmander.\\
It seems like the argument is:

1) People are more sad when people die than when pokemon die.

2) Therefore human deaths are more important than pokemon deaths.

But premise one assumes that human suffering is more important than pokemon suffering by only considering how humans feel about the deaths. Do you see what I mean? You can't have the premise and conclusion of an argument be the same?
