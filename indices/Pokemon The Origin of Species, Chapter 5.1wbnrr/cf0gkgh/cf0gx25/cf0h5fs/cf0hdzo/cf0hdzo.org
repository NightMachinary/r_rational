Red cares more about people than about pokemon for emotional reasons; he hasn't had any close relationships with pokemon before. Like Leaf said, that will probably change when he gets to know his own pokemon better, but even then he will still care more about strangers than about their pokemon, unless perhaps those strangers are assholes.
