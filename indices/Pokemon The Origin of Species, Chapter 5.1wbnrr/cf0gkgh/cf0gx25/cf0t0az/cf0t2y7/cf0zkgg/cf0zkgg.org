the game pokedex says alakazam's IQ is 5000, that dragonite is kindhearted and its intelligence matches that of a human, and Yamask retains all the memories of when it was human... though you could just stick to the previous generations and decide that alakazam's intelligence is too domain specific to be useful, and that dragonite matches a human in the sense that dolphins probably "match" humans, but with a different structure (which in my opinion still qualifies them for ethical concerns)...

On the other hand, the pokedex says all sorts of weird things, so you could just say the pokedex is wrong and people were anthropomorphizing when they wrote that...
