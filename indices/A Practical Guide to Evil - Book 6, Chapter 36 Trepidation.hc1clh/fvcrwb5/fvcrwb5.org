I have to assume Cordelia has some form of insight provided by the Augur. The Augur is still in play, right? I'm a little surprised by how little of her we've seen lately.

Also, if it's true Augur can't see angels, any insight she provides must be based on how other entities (the alliance, the empire, the kingdom under, etc.) would respond.
