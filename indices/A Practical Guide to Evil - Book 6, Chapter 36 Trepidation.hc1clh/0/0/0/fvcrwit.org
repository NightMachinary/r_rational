That makes sense from a rational game-theoretic standpoint.

What /doesn't/, in any way immediately obvious to me, is to show her hand so forcefully. She didn't brush Catherine off with a "sure, we can talk about that later sometime," or take any other number of routes available to hold onto the weapon tightly while acting diplomatic about it. She's not letting it go, and she's sending a crystal clear message to Catherine both that she's not letting it go and that she's not even going to pretend that there could ever be any possibility that she lets it go.

That's what I meant when I said it weakens her in their power dynamic-- she has just signaled something very strongly about her own intentions and motivations, and I don't know what she hopes to gain by sending that signal.

I wonder what the Augur's been up to?
