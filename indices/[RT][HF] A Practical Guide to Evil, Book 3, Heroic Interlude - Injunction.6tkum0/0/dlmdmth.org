That's...a lot of interludes in a row.

The author seems to be veering more and more into interlude territory. Not counting prologues/epilogues, the Chapter:Interlude ratios per book are on the rise:

- Book I - 28 Chapters, 0 Interludes (0% Interlude)
- Book II - 49 Chapters, 11 Interludes (18% Interlude)
- Book III (in progress) - 23 Chapters, 10 Interludes (30% Interlude)

As a reader with little authorial experience, I have to wonder what's behind this uptick. Are fans clamoring for more interludes? Has the author always planned for this section of the story to involve a lot of different perspectives? Has the author slowly changed in their writing style and preference? Or are they now just bored of writing from Cat's perspective?

While I do enjoy the occasional interlude, Cat's chapters are what drew me to the series in the first place (not to mention, they tend to drive the plot forward the most). I'm wondering if this constant rise in interludes is a trend we should expect more of going forward...
