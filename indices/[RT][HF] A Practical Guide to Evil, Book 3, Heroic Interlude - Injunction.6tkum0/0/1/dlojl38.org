I think it's more that as Squire has progressively risen up the power ladder, she becomes more and more concerned with and affected by larger goings on around the world, and without these interludes, having different armies or plotlines horn into the story would seem like they came out of nowhere.

That was my central complaint about the fae storyline, but everything else regarding Procer, Diabolist, the Free Cities, etc. seems to be building toward a larger conflict involving them all, so I think the interludes are appropriate.
