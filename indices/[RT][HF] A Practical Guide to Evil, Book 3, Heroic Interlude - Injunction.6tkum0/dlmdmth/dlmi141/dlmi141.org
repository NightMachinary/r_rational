That's a great observation you've made and with some data to back it up too. Just the way I like it. :)

I expect that we're about halfway through Book 3 based on the example from Book 2 and my feel for the story so far in Book 3. It's quite possible that the final ratio for Book 3 will end up to be quite similar to Book 2.

  Has the author always planned for this section of the story to involve a lot of different perspectives?

In comparison to Book 1 it seems to be that there have been a lot more significant characters introduced. And the previously existing characters have also needed (not-Cat) exposition as well.

I think clearly true given the increasing chapter counts and the total lack of interludes in Book 1. Beyond that, I'm not sure.

I love Cat's perspective too and wish we had more of it. However, some of the interludes have been just as enjoyable for me. Such as Robber meeting Thief, the Heroes destroying the Tyrants floating fortresses and the recent one with Akua battling the Summer Court.

I'm enjoying the increased complexity of the plots and counter plots and can't wait to see the final battle for Leisse(sp?).
