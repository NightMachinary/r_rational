Looking at it from a purely mercenary point of view though, surely the population of patrons isn't static, and the derivative of more patrons is probably pretty correlated with Royalroad ranking or whatever? I can't imagine missing a weekly update is going to help with that.

Personally, I might not even bother with looking at the update in two weeks, and signal-boosty things like this reddit post might stop going up too with a pause.

The patrons will certainly be epsilon happier to remain eight chapters ahead instead of seven for the foreseeable future, but does that outweigh the loss in future patrons from the community becoming different-epsilon more disinterested after the two weeks? I don't think the answer is as clear as it appears at first glance.
