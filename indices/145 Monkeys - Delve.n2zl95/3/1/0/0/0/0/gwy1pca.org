Oh, absolutely free readers aren't without value. I should have been more clear on that, I agree with you completely.

I probably ought to go take down some of my older author's notes. But I also probably ought to go fix a few dozen typos. There's a whole other reason for why the motivation on that is lacking, though, that's not relevant here.

I think the biggest thing that turns a new reader into a patron at the end of the archive is actually how big the archive is. The longer someone gets to read through for, before hitting the end, the more they become accustomed to having that "next chapter" button waiting for them, and the more it stings to have to wait until next Saturday to get it. Time, and my increasingly caffeinated writing habits, will continue to build up a larger and larger free repository of story. And a new reader coming into that, if they make it all the way to the end, is more likely to want to see more than someone who's not as in-the-moment committed.

Also, while I love my public readers and their sometimes-great comments and more-amusing discord interactions, I don't really want to treat them as a marketing department. Mostly because, and I say this with love, /nerds are bad at word of mouth/. Not that it doesn't work out sometimes, but more that it's not exactly a reliable payment of that elusive quantity of exposure.
