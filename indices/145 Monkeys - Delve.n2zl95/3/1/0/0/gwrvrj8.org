Eh. In business, it's generally better to maintain good relations with the audience that has shown a willingness to work with you, rather than try to court a potential new audience. Some people are already paying you, and keeping them happy means they keep paying you. The people who /aren't/ paying you, especially in the world of webfiction, probably aren't going to start.

The majority of my patrons joined when the offer to read ahead was first made. I get a small trickle of new patrons every month, but those don't tend to line up to new chapter releases. Instead, they're usually people who already were reading, and have hit the end of the archive. Or who were already followers, but now have the money to be patrons. Bringing in a new audience just isn't a thing that happens easily. And even if it was, doing it at the cost of the goodwill for people who have already proven that they will be loyal patrons is kinda foolish.

You know that trope where the villain promises a prisoner something, and then the prisoner is like, "alright, sure" and the villain goes "you fool!" and murders them? And, okay, that establishes to the audience that the villain sucks. But it also establishes in universe to everyone who knows about this, and everyone they'll ever talk to, that the villain cannot be trusted and you should never make deals with him. Short term gain for long term instability, basically.

As for this subreddit being a signal booster? Well, it isn't. Maybe it is for Delve, what with all the drama around it, and it certainly is for new stories when they first get started, but for basically anything else, it's more a place for people who are already reading to have more specific conversations. There aren't an appreciable number of people on here aren't seeing Worth The Candle posts and thinking "I should start that". People are coming here because they want to talk about Worth The Candle. If that makes sense.

That said, maybe I should start some kind of subreddit drama. Drive the engagement numbers of my own work. No such thing as bad press, right?
