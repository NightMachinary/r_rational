My largest issue with people who complain about this story is that the complainers are so disingenuous about it. It's like they're not even interested in saying anything near the truth and just trying to turn away people who don't read the story with whatever word combinations they think might work.

For example, a group going into the depths with the specific goal to hunt blues to level and taking the slow and methodical approach because of the danger, gets twisted into going on vacation without a purpose, but really the complainer just barely skims the occasional chapter to collect buzzwords.
