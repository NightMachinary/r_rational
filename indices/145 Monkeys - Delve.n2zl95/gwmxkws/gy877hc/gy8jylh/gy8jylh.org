I made this complaint, and it is barely a complaint at all, based upon my vibe from the next six or so chapters of the story. Delve has never been paced that quickly, and that's not a bad thing on its own. But here, it gives the impression that the party doesn't actually care about what they're doing. Which raises the question of why they're bothering, in a sort of meta way, that makes me as a reader ask why /I'm/ bothering.

My criticism is not some deep literary analysis, no. But neither is it fake. It's just based off the emotional resonance I have with the chapters, and not pretending that I can reach objective reality if I dress up my critique with enough long words.
