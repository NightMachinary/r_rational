As someone who writes with a backlog... well, the backlog is for patrons. And the patrons actually pay for me to write. Specifically, they encourage me to write at the pace that is comfortable and helpful to me.

I do get it; public readers enjoy the story, and I enjoy their feedback. I'm not making things because I /don't/ want to share them, after all. But at the end of the day, the people I give stuff to for free just aren't entitled to anything. Non-patrons are welcome to enjoy my work at the pace that I decide to release it, but there's really no reason to actually put in extra effort to make those people happy.

It kinda sucks, honestly. But hey, that's just one of the many downsides of living in a capitalist hellscape.
