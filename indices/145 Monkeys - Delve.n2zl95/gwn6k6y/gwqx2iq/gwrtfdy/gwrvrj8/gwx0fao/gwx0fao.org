As someone who very frequently goes on / off as a Patreon, for your work as well as Delve, I would argue that maintaining consistency is important on both ends; every reader has value even if they are not directly paying you. They are still reading your work, thinking about it, discussing it, rating it, and sharing it. This drives new business, so to speak, and there is definitely a positive correlation between free viewership and paid viewership.

Free readers are certainly less valuable than Patreons, but their value is not zero by default.

There's a line that needs to be drawn here where /being paid in exposure/ is an equitable trade for /work that does not have any additional cost to duplicate or distribute/.

A big part of why I decide to pay any particular author, aside from interest in their story and access to a backlog, is their competency; which to me includes among other things having a good relationship with free readers.

Keep in mind that *the first interaction any reader has with a web serial is as a free reader*. God knows RR authors /rarely/ take down old notes, and new viewers do read those. I really recommend either removing them or just being disgustingly positive. Passive aggressive author notes are just blergh. But anyway...

You've maintained that good free reader relationship well enough.

Some authors have not--like one whose story was premised around a naked mage--and have done very poorly as a result; despite strong early viewership and ratings. And my $5. Fuck that guy.
