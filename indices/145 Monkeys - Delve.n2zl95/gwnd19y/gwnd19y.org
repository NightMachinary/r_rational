I can't believe there was really a part that lasted several paragraphs that consisted solely of Rain and then Amelia making noises like and acting like monkeys. I didn't mind Rain's awkward references and memes /too/ much, but this just feels ridiculous. Aren't they also on a super important mission to power Rain up in the very dangerous depths?
