It makes sense to me. Right now they're dealing with the easy part of the delve. Exploring the area and scouting the local monsters. Even if they stumble on a blue unprepared, it's still not going to be a difficult fight, because it'll be high bronze at best which is nearly trivial for Ameliah and Tallheart to take care of.

So being goofy and relaxed after the stress of moving a lot of people to Vestvall in a short time makes perfect sense to me in this context.
