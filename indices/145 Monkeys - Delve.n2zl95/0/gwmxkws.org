My largest issue with this depths arc begins in force here and will continue for a while, which is, they don't seem very objective-minded.

I know, I know. I am aware of my own writing style. Thank you.

But seriously, they're going into the most dangerous places in the world, and why? Nominally, it is to find blues and kill them so they can all level up and become even more problematically powerful. But they're treating it like a vacation almost. Even Tallheart! And he's actually been fairly smart through most of the story!

It's not that every chapter needs a sense of urgency, but there is a lot to be said for showing more of the group progressing toward their goals and less of them hanging out, when the hanging out isn't the focus of the narrative.
