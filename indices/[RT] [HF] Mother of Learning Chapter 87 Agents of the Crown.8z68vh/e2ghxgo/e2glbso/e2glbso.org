Like clinical research in reality, I suspect that animal experimentation can only go so far before you have to switch to human experimentation. Even with human experimental subjects, there are no guarentees since they only have 1 chance to modify themselves.

In regards to detecting divine energy, I feel that studying the non-human spell formula of the Filigree Sages is the best bet. Ilsa did say that structured magic (chanting & gestures) just limits the full potential of magic. If anyone could learn to sense divine magic, it would be someone not limited to Ikosian-Style magic.
