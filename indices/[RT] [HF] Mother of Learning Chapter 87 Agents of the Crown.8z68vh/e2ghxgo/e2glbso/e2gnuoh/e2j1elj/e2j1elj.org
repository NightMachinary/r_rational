I was just thinking that maybe the Ikosian language itself limited mages in what magic they could perform. For example, aranea spell formula seems to be highly compressed compared to human spell formula. In particular, the Filigree Sages use their own unique glyphs for their spell formula & anchor them to spider webs rather than sturdier materials.

Non-human perspectives may introduce a deeper understanding of magic that wasn't obvious from the start. Like how the aranea use mind magic in ways that human mind mages can barely imagine. Just because its possible, it doesn't mean that someone had already thought of it.

That said, it doesn't have to be non-human. The search for knowledge & tricks across Altazia & Koth might also produce similar results. I am just hoping that all of this search for "/low/-/hanging fruit/" (whether its non-human magic or human magic) crystallizes into something revolutionary.
