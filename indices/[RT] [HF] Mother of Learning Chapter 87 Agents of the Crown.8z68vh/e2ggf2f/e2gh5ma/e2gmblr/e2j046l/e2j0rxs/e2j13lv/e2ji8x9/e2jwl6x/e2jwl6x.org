Admittedly, Zorian's reaction in 1 was due to equating soul magic with necromancy. After Kael told him what it was about, he changed his mind (point 2) in the course of the same conversation. Same goes for blood magic.

I agree with you on everything else though. Zach has always been the picky learner, which is a pity since he could probably become a natural mind mage with blood magic (among other things).
