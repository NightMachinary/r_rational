The title of the chapter made me think that they'd manage to get the royal family's support. However, this is actually better! While this was a set up chapter in many ways, a lot of stuff that ZZ had been leading towards, happened. Enjoyable and important, but not seat of pants on edge enjoyable.

Also interesting to see that Zach acknowledges that they have lost the moral high ground, and now it's the time to take what they want, hang morality. (the restart didn't end, so we have 17.x still left).
