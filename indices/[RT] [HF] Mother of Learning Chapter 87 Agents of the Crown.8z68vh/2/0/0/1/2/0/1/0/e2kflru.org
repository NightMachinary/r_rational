What's important about the loop isn't time, but the ability to survive your death and steal information without other people knowing. This means that the time loop would let Silverlake do dangerous things like making experimental potions and searching for alchemical ingredients in uncharted areas.

I can see three very strong motives for Silverlake to stay behind: first, her main goal is to make a potion of youth, which requires the grey hunter eggs and a super old salamander. Z&Z is unlikely to help her get those ingredients outside the loop (since they could die fighting the grey hunter, or get killed in the fight against Red Robe before helping her), so she would have to get it herself. A time loop makes learning how to get these ingredients far easier than being ageless, since she can try all kinds of risky plans to get them. Being alone in the time loop makes this even easier since she doesn't have to deal with all the ripple effects from the other time loopers and doesn't have to bother with troublesome requests from Z&Z.

Second: one of the biggest advantages of a time loop is secrecy, as shown by Z&Z extracting information from countless people without anyone finding out. But you can't have this secrecy unless you're alone in the time loop. For example, one of the things Z&Z have been doing is employing countless researchers to research stuff for them, and keeping the knowledge across restarts to advance their research further. Z&Z plan to gift these researchers outside the loop, but definitely wouldn't tell them all about the research. Silverlake could want to do the same thing secretly, without anyone (including Z&Z) knowing what she is researching. But she can't while Z&Z are in the loop: Z&Z are already using up all the researchers, and there's a possibility that whatever researchers she employs may betray her to Z&Z and give them her secret research.

Third, and this is far more evil: so she can stab Z&Z in the back. She is used to being an ancient unrivaled archmage who can defeat or hide from just about everyone else, and here there are suddenly two new archmages who may be as strong as or stronger than her, and know her incredibly well thanks to their time looping shenanigans. Wouldn't she want some kind of leverage over them to at the very least ensure her own safety? Being alone in the time loop is a priceless opportunity for her to get this leverage by attacking the "original" Z&Z copies, who are mere academy students with no skills to defend themselves against her. She can then mind magic the hell out of each loop iteration's "original" Z&Z copies, learning everything about who they were before the time loop. Their goals, their personalities, their principles, the way they view the world, etc. Even if the time loop changes these, the information still gives her a much better understanding of Z&Z than she could ever get through any method other than remaining alone in the time loop.
