Wasn't there a line a while ago, when ZZ were first proving the loop to Silverlake where she had a complete 180 in terms of sass when she actually started taking the idea seriously? I don't remember what it was, but while most people seem to think along the lines of "Well, there's nothing I can really do about this, I guess I'll just go with the flow," Silverlake took the loop as someone killing her over and over again, and took that very personally. I think that all of the reasons she'd be such an old and accomplished mage are also reasons she'd want to try to escape the loop, even the mini-loop ZZ took her into. She's probably afraid of death, she's incredibly driven, and she's very confident in herself. I absolutely think that if she's given the option to sacrifice everything to escape the loop dimension she will take it in an instant, just so that she doesn't die. Also, if she gets out in a way that means there's two Silverlakes, that probably isn't much of a negative to her. Either she avoids her other self or she cooperates with her, but either way, it won't really matter since she doesn't have much contact with the outside world. If that's impossible (I don't remember if it was established or not), and she has to fight her original soul for control of the body, she seems like the type to slaughter her doppelganger in a heartbeat.

All in all, I think she's got nothing to lose and everything to gain, as well as every reason to try to escape the loop. Of course she's nice and helpful for now, she's got a whole roomful of people chasing the same goal as her, but as soon as they stand in her way I think ZZ will find her to be as big a threat as QI.
