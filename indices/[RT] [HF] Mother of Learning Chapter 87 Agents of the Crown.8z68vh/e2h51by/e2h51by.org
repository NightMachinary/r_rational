Xvim is already 'complaining' about students making the same mistakes, but his professional pride won't let him simply quit teaching, so why doesn't he do the same thing Xorian did with Kiri and Taiven and experiment with the most effective way of teaching the material

(you could argue he already had enough experience to know, but now maybe he can be more radical with his experiments or simply more tailored to these specific students)
