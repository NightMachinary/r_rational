Along with the question why QI didn't figure it out, it took quite a bit of time for QI to figure out the divine tracker when they robbed the treasury. QI hasn't taken that amount of time with Zach's soul. Secondly, we can assume that RR had 6 restarts to get QI to help him (without arousing his suspicions).... And especially is RR is Veyers (or even that lawyer) then they are super young and will raise his suspicions. I'm not sure if getting his help, and convincing QI to place a divine compulsion on a random teen is possible in that amount of time.

Mind blank is pretty damn powerful on its own though. And, RR had shitty mind magic from the POV of Zorian, who is ridiculously powerful. RR was able to mind probe Zach in Ch 26, that tells you he's no slouch in mind magic (compared to non-Zorian psychics)
