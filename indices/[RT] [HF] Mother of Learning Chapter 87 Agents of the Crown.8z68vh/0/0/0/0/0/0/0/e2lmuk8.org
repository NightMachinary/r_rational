  we can assume that RR had 6 restarts to get QI to help him (without arousing his suspicions).... And especially is RR is Veyers (or even that lawyer) then they are super young and will raise his suspicions. I'm not sure if getting his help, and convincing QI to place a divine compulsion on a random teen is possible in that amount of time.

From those six months, he only needs QI's help. After his marker is modified he has however many restarts to talk QI into messing with Zach.
