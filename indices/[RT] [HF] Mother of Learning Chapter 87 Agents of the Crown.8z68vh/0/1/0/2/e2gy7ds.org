Maybe we're thinking of the wrong incidence of soul damage. Maybe a swap or.. something happened during the initial incident that gave Zorian the marker. We don't know how long he stayed comatose for, after all. He recovered earlier than Zach but there is no guarantee he didn't sleep through a few restarts.
