This seems a stretch. ZZ's presence isn't likely to get in the way of any credible research plans that she might have for an extra year or so. She's ageless, so she doesn't need the time, and although they would impose some ethical limitations on their own research, I doubt they'd block her from doing as she pleased within the loop.

I just don't see her needing to hide.
