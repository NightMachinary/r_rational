please tell me we're going to get a 3rd part for this restart. there's way too much remaining to just handwave away

- +wait, how did they get knife? presumably with QI's help offscreen and then not betraying him, because being able to do it themselves would be worth of mention+

- is ectoplasm new for zorian?

- The hydra didn't understand human speech but knew to kneel

- if he had command of the hydra (kneel, don't attack zorian), why did he have to coax it to return to the orb?

- that the cranium rats weren't able to warn QI about Zorian reveals a couple interesting limitations. 1) they don't have any way of instantly contacting him and 2) they don't have any way of leaving him a message

- zach wasn't willing to let zorian poke around his mind but was ok with spiders doing it? Will the spider say anything if he sees something? Maybe zorian could ask the spider to check some things on the downlow?

- if QI helped red robe permanently join loop, why didn't he just do it to himself too? (unless the help was modifying a temp marker as opposed to creating one from scratch)

- are they attempting to convert the orb to a black room so they have their own personal black room or something else? Even if they create their own personal black room, how are they going to power it up? The recharge time on the others is already substantial and this one should be even longer
