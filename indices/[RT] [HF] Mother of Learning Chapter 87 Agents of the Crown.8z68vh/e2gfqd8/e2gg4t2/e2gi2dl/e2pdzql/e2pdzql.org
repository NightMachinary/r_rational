Evil!Zack is a certainty in my mind at this point.

Here's the narrative as I see it with Red Robe as Zack:

Zack grows up resentful of his family's betrayal by the nobility of Eldemar. His guardian gives away various treasures to placate the royal family, including the Dagger. The reason Red Robe could access the Dagger is he is the rightful owner and could have used political pressure to reclaim it.

Zack and a certain like-minded friend get in with the planned invasion, which already involves numerous high-ranking individuals resentful of Eldemar.

Zack puts on a fake persona at school.

Zack starts the loop a month before the invasion, to ensure it's victory. He uses a simulacrum to trigger the Gate, allowing him to start safe in his room every loop and avoid suspicion. Side effect: The simulacrum exists at the start of every loop and technically has the marker. The simulacrum starts looping alongside Zack.

SimuZack deviates from the original. We've been shown how even a day old Zorian clone will play pranks and get annoyed with the original, and that's with the increased mental connection allowing them to partially remerge afterwards. SimuZack is just as selfish as original Zack and has no hope of surviving even as a memory, so he decides to make sure he's the one out of the loop. He ambushes original Zack and uses his limited mind magic to program him. Unfortunately, he can't exactly soulkill his mana source. So instead he forces new!Zack to play along in the same role he's always played at school, makes sure no-one but him can access Zack's mind, and orders Zack to focus all his efforts on unsubtle power-building magics rather then anything tricky or subtle. I think we've seen this programming slowly decaying, but it was built by someone with plenty of time and an intimate knowledge of the person being edited to make up for magic skill limitations.

The end result is one brainwashed, actual Zack and one unchanged Simulacrum Zack. Simulacrum Zack then discovers there are others looping. He panics, then panics more when, on checking the original's mind finds they're complete unknowns to Zack. With no idea how this is even possible, he bails, confusing the Loop. Zack has now both left and not left the Loop.

Endgame: Zorian and Zack both escape, with Zack and simulacrum Zack being merged in the original body, removing all compulsions and editings applied to him. Who knows how he'll react at that point.
