I expect the solution will ned up being a modified shifter ritual.

It's been established that shifters are a human soul and an animal soul in one body, that a modified ritual can reverse that and make a wolf into a human-shifter, that the guardian's objection to letting more than one soul out is that it doesn't have ethically sourced bodies for the extra soul and displacing a soul from outside the loop would be murder, and that the main risk of being a shifter is that there's soem cross-talk between the souls.

So, Zack becomes a Zoian shifter, shifter-Zack leaves the loop with both souls. Then shifter Zack tracks down original Zorian and makes original Zorian a loop-Zorian-shifter. least effective result is Zoinan resets to pre-loop except now he has a power-up form with the shaping skills he learns inside the loop, best case scenario the similarity of the souls makes for a clean merge and Zoian gets to exit the loop complication-free. Most likely scenario both loop and original Zorian's personalities co-exist for a bit while loop Zorian's soul overpowers the original. The souls are very similar so this mostly manifests as original Zoian judging loop Zoian for being too reckless and amoral.
