That's fair. However:

that seems a ridiculous method of defence - to only improve in mind magic if you are consistently interacting with a powerful mind mage. If mind magic is THE danger, then it strikes me as rather naive to accept conventional wisdom re safety. It only takes one mind mage that can overpower Zach (tbf, not very many can do so) but Zach accepts drinks from everyone and anyone. It's not like Zach can identify mind mages on sight, like Zorian can.

Also, subverting the iron beaks was easier because quite a few of them were not big fans of Sudomir. How much of their initiative was because they really really hated Sudomir and the invaders?
