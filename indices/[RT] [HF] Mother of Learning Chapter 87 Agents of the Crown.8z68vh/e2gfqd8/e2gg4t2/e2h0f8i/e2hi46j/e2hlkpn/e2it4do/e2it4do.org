Not actually proof, because he faithfully followed what most mages consider to be the most practical method of mental defence. Conventional wisdom says, get some basic mind shields and then focus on whacking the other guy before he gets through them.

So, if it was the kind of compulsion where you follow a command to your own best efforts, which we've seen before with Zorian dominating the iron beaks, then it would be logical to see Zach's defenses plateauing when he thought they were good enough, and escalating again now that he's working with a powerful mind mage.

This isn't the first time he's sought more defence training since meeting Zorian, either. He reluctantly agreed to let Xvim tutor him. Xvim isn't psychic, so there's no way he can peek by accident.
