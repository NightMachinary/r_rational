Doesn't it kinda lend more support to the whole "Zach's being mind controlled" theory tho? QI knows a fair bit about divine magic, while RR does not. RR had shitty mind magic (considering he had a plain old mind blank, instead of a proper active defense), and so far we havent seen QI demonstrate any decent mind magic abilities (as far as I can remember). If Zorian develops some sort of divine sight, he could potentially figure out if Zach is being altered in some way, tho that does leave the question of why QI didn't figure the same out.
