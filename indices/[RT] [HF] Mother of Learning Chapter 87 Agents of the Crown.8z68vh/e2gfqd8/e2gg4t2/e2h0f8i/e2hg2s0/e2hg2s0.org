That's a pretty good point! Add to that the fact that Zorian is trying to figure out divine energies... So you have Zorian trying to solve a different problem which gives him the tools to solve this problem as well.

At the same time, I still think mind magic compulsion is a better story, because we've been leading up to it for so long (Zorian is unfairly amazing at it) and so Zorian using his mind magic powers to solve a problem has more in-story support. Divine energies and compulsions are extremely recent.
