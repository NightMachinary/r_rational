True true, but if you thought dealing with /one/ night-immortal supermage was tough when the other party was trying to be as honest and upfront as they could, imagine how it'd be when they're both paranoid farts!

Only way I can imagine that kind of deal working out is if QI can do either a memory (or even soul?) packet, while also giving silverlake some slow-acting soul poison so she has to keep up her end of the deal to give the packet back...

The more that I think about this the more possible it seems.
