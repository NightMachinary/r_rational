There is a good reason actually: if she tells ZZ that she plans to stay, then naturally ZZ would know that she knows a way to stay in the loop. And for ZZ, that would give them the option of forcing Silverlake to fix the temporary markers for everyone else, so they can all stay in the loop longer to come up with more reliable plans for exiting the loop, rather than trying to rush it in 6 iterations. This would reduce the number of remaining loop iterations that Silverlake has to freely abuse after everyone else leaves.
