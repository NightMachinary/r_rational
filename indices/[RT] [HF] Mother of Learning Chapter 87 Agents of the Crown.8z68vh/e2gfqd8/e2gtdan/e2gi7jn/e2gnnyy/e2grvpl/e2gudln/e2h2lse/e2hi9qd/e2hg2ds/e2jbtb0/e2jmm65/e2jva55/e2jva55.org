You're absolutely right, but they don't know if the loop will end after Zach leaves, which sounds pretty likely to me.

Silverlake isn't being monitored; she has almost free reign right now, plus Z&Z covering for them all (dead cranium rat swarms, distracting the authorities, blank checks for materials and money, etc). We know when she acts on her own she can attract attention (the time Quatach visited Z&Z), and she isn't a scrapper (she is more like Zorian in that sense), so I think it's in her benefit to keep everyone in there as long as possible.

Would she risk not leaving at all and losing those perks /just/ so she can be alone a few months?
