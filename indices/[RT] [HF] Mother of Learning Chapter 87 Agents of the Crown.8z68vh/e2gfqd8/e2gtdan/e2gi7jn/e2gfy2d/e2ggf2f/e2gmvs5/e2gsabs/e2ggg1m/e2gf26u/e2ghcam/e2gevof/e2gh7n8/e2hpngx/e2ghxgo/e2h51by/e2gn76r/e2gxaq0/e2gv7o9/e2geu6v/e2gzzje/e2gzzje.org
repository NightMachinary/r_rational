I spent the start of this chapter baffled about how Z&Z had already managed to get the dagger from the royal vault. Only realize now after looking at the comments that it was the dagger they got along with the orb a long time ago (that Zorian couldn't figure out).

I think I might need to start rereading chapters before each newer chapter arrives. This chapter makes so much more sense now that I remember that one fact.

Other notes: Silverlake is definitely up to something.
