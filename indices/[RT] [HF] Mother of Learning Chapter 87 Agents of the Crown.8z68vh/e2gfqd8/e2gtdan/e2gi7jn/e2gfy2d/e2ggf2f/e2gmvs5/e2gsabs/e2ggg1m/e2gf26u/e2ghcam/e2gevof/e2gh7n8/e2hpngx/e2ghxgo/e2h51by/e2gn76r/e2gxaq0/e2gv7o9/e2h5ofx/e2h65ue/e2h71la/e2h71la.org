Ok, it was awhile back and yep, I might have forgotten this/didn't read far enough. But there's definitely something fishy with that cavern. They are most likely guarding the cavern for with the secret (and that's why Yellow Cavern Guardian Matriarch refused his help when he offered it to fight the monster).

My current theory is that is related to Ishmali Reservoirs we've learned about on latest chapter. Since they were created somewhere in the desert, one of the problems is getting the water into them. And there are additional pocket dimensions/exits to Reservoirs to fill the with water from different continent/whatever. One of those reservoirs is filled from the underground where Yellow Cavern Guardians are living in. That's how the toad appeared in the neighborhood and there are some other relics in the cavern left by the creators of reservoirs.
