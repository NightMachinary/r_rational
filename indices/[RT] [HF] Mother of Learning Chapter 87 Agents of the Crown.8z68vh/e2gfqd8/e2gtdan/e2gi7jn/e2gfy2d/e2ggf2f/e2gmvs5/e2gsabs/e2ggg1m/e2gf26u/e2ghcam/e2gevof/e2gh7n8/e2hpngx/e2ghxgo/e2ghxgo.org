It would be interesting if it's possible to perform blood enhancement rituals with animals. It could potentially speed up their rate of improvement in the field due to the inherent risk of mutilating their bodies. This necessitates the ritual being used only at the end of each restart.

For example, like clinical research in reality, performing blood enhancement rituals on rodents, and then moving on to creatures more similar to humans, like apes.

As for detecting divine energy, maybe asking the clergy would help? Or ransacking libraries of other churches as Alanic would probably be not so pleased at the idea of Z&Z attacking the Triumvirate Church.
