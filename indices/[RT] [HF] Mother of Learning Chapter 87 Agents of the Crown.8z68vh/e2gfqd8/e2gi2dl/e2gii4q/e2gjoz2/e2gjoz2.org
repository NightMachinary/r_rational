More likely the former rather than latter, honestly. Zach is a pretty cool guy, and if he wanted Zorian gone he'd.... huh. He hasn't actually had a chance to get rid of him yet, has he? Sure he could beat him in a fight, but never permanently. He didn't /used/ to have the skills to do any damage to Zorian's mind or soul, so he was a stuck in a "if he attacks me, I'm fucked, but if I attack him, he'll just reset and /I'll/ be fucked" situation.
