I hadn't caught that before, but even with word of god that doesn't seem doable.

Assuming the update rate doesn't pick up substantially that only leaves us 7 or 8 chapters away from the end then. It seems like you'd be hard pressed to wrap up just getting out of the loop even if you do things at a crazy pace for all those chapters, let alone solving things in the real world and wrapping up the dangling threads with the family and all the side characters we've gotten to know.

More power to the author if there's a plan in place and they can pull it off, it just seems like it would be too hasty from the outside at least.
