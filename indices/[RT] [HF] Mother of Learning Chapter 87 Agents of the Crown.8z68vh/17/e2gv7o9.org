The black rooms are much more useful for new agents (they would at least double the time they are spending in loop) - looks like they will get to know each other very well in the dull environments of black rooms.

Converting orb into black room is just nice extra. Looks like the main purpose is to milk government institutions dry. By initiating this particular project and throwing a lot of weight/resources behind it - they get and extra teachers with little effort. Krantin seems like a very experienced researcher/geek into dimensionalism - so ZZ should reap some ( a lot of) knowledge in there.

I wonder how they will reap what they saw. While the government will analyze the stuff they seeded around (as per suggestion from Silverlake), the rebels/cult/Ibasa should get hands on the intel as well. It may be hard to get the additional research done by various organizations, but hey - at least it provides enough distractions.

Zorian should stab hydra with dagger ( to see the effect). This is to verify if they need to kill the sulrothum high priest or it is just enough to steal the other knife (besides ring) to control the sand worm. Also Zach to allow borrowing hydra for one cycle (to allow Zorian one month of a very close interaction with hydra / learning the stuff). Not allowing for that would be just author artificially limiting Zorians grow rate.

The mind magic and Zach/ aranea is interesting topic as well. After Zach bullies them into teaching him, I'm pretty sure the teacher would take a peek at his mind and discover/remove that compulsion/anything else left at his mind without asking Zach first to unravel some hidden memory/plot advancement.

what are the chances that the frog he defeated in chapter 37 to assist/rescue Yellow Cavern Guardians is the toad they are looking for? Coming back to it and revisiting the fungus plantation would possibly reveal another secret behind it. IIRC, the web just killed Zorian after he defeated the monster - there's some shady secret in cavern/location.

Too bad it's another 3 weeks (if the chapter is light) or 4 for the next chapter to come up. So much stuff going on in background, so little covered. So much ground to cover... This is going to take awhile.
