As first brought up in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3psp59/im_planning_an_rmlp_fic_how_can_i_draw_readers/][this post]], this is my stab at a rational(ist) My Little Pony fanfiction. No prior canon knowledge is (intended to be) required.

The main goals here are to explore an MLP with

- a more complicated non-"magic" magic system, with rules and consistency
- characters that don't click together so nicely out of the gate
- a quite troubled protagonist.

I would very much value feedback of any sort! I've never written any fiction before. I'm very interested to hear from canon fans and non-fans alike. Another concern of mine is chapter length: Right now, the story is segmented into quite small chapters (1.5-3k words). This fits much more naturally with my schedule than longer, less frequent chapters, but I'm unsure whether the average reader would be okay with reading in chunks of that size. I write pretty slowly, since I'm coming at this with zero experience, and I'd really prefer to get feedback as I go, for the same reason. I do expect the segments to get naturally longer, like it seems most serial fictions do, as the story progresses and I become more purposeful as a writer. It baffles me to this day how Wildbow keeps up such an insane output. But I'm willing to conform to a spikier writing schedule if that would be widely preferred (if there's any audience at all!).

I realize it's pretty hard to judge a story so small, so I'll probably be pretty generous with the content I have so far. So far, I've written about 15k words, which I'll post staggered for a while while I continue writing. I'll most likely post the second chapter tomorrow, and then every two days after that until I catch up. After that, Celestia only knows. =p
