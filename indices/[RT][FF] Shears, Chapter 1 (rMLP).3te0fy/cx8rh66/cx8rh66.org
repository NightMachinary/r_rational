As your history book mentions Wendigos, it is interesting to point out that where I am, "wendigo" is a local word that translates into Engligh as "paperclip maximizer", although it's a bit more general as it refers to all dangerous optimizers, not necessarily transistorized or superintelligent. Although is is commonly ussed to describe insane people who act this way, the word also commonly refers to dangerous feedback systems that can occur in human interactions (as an example, Wendigo is one of the trnslations of "corporation", dut to the legal obligation to maximize profit for shareholders), or any other kind of optimizing system that poses a threat to its surrounding life forms, on any scale. This definition could make for some very interesting plot points.
