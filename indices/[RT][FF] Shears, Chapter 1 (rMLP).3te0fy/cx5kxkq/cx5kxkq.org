I usually mostly lurk, but since you're a new author, I'd like to express my support explicitly for a change. So far seems interesting, and sufficiently authentic for the book Twilight was reading. It's already evident that your try to patch holes (and blank spots) in the worldbuilding, and I approve. Would follow/read more.

P.S. [[#s][Elements Change]]
