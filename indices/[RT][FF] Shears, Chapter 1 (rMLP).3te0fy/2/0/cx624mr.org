Thanks for the feedback! The idea was to replace the canon intro of the show; the fic also opens with Twilight reading a history book by a river, it's just a drastically different history book. That said, I do think maybe some paragraphs could be chopped off and added later... But this is the only planned expo-dump for quite a while.
