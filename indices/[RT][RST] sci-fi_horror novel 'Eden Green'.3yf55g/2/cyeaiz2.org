Finished your book, it was good. I really enjoyed that all three of the main characters felt real and like they were making the best decision from /their/ point of view, which leads to fucked up conflicts and situations.

Reading your book reminded me of the same mental beating that reading Blindsight or Echopraxia gave me, and I'm starting to think I might be an intellectual masochist.

I look forward to reading a sequel if you end up writing one!
