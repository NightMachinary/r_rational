50% of the way through. I'm liking that Veronica's secret isn't actually stated (so far), but it's not exactly hard to figure out, either, unless I'm making a hilarious mistake. I also like that she's a shitty person regardless, I expect no special treatment from RT authors.

The mock murder was agony, even worse than Ted's bowels being turned to soup. There's something about teeth caving in and/or breaking that seems so much more horrifying to me.
