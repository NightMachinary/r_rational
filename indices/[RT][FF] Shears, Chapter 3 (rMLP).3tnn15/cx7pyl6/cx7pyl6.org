I like the way you've written Twilight's thoughts, interactions with others, and the interactions between those two processes.

The way she thinks reminds me of someone I was once close to, and brings back nostalgia.

The way she acts, however, and the way the other characters treat her, are reminiscent of the story /Asylum,/ by Daemon of Decay.

Biggest visibility typo in this chapter:

#+begin_quote
  You know /that value/ your vigilance and dedication to your studies and your kingdom.
#+end_quote

I think you're missing a pronoun.

I would love to read more, but the vast majority of my reading is on my phone(the rest is physical copies of a book), and using the stock browser compared to my preferred [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apps.webreader][fanfiction reader]] is like switching /to/ viscera-covered, freshly-removed animal hide(with patches of coarse fur still attached!) pants /from/ silk pants.
