  Then, an illusion is cast on the loose sheet, rendering it considerably less opaque.
#+end_quote

An illusion that renders something /less/ opaque? Could this be used to see through walls, or even produce invisibility?

If she makes the original paper less opaque (but not the ink) instead of making the ink glow and adds a constant light source below, she can invert the ink on the copy. If she both makes the paper less opaque and makes the ink glow, and adds another sheet with glowing ink below, she can combine two sheets using pointwise OR. If her spell is precise enough, this is already enough to build a parallel computer of parallel power dependent on the ink's precision (but trivially in quadruple digits), with serial time proportional to mana & effort spent. (Combine results from different points by... moving the sheets.)
