To think of it, the magic here could be replaced by a device with the complexity of a weaving loom: Arrange a few thousand vertical 5-inch pins in a grid (say, 40x60 on a DIN A4 page of checkered paper), separated by a solid mantle on the second and fourth inch. The bottom of each pin is to be in the shape used in hole punchers. The top of each pin is to have a hole in it, so that they can all be held in place by a comblike shape.

Insert the comb, lift the entire device three inches, lift the pins three more inches. Insert a DIN A4 page of checkered paper, with some holes in it. Release the comb, some pins fall through for six inches, the rest falls only one inch to the paper. Insert the comb into the rest, lift it one inch, replace the page with another, punch the pins through the paper, there's your NOT operation. (Release the comb, remove the page, and lower the mantles three inches to reset.)

Stacking holed pages is either OR or AND, depending on which way you see the bits.
