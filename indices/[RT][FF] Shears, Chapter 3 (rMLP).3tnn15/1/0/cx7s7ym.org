Does that app take epubs or other ebook formats? I recommend trying out [[http://calibre-ebook.com/][Calibre]]'s "FanFicFare" plugin, it can download and convert fanfiction from over a hundred different sites - including Fimfiction. I use it to collect and organize all of the fanfic I follow, and transfer stuff to my Kobo to read.
