I find swarms fascinating, so I'll dip my brain cells in this topic:

- We become incomprehending towards bigger scales. Those swarms could have an opposite bias, focused on bigger quantities, while ignoring small numbers.

- Swarm itself is all that matters, so individuals (even genius ones) are worth nothing compared to more computational power.

- A natural tendency of sub-groups of the swarm to specialize.

- The more use there is to a skill, more protection/priority it's group will get.\\
  A swarm that's constantly hunted will forget most things besides avoiding said hunts.

- Since it gets smarter with size, it could automatically start doubting it's previous knowledge, even if it's based on solid data.\\
  Same goes to opinions of other swarms, if they are smaller. Small is dumb, which could apply to humans as well- a big rally looks smarter than a lone professor.

- The size bias could lead to posturing. If a swarm feels threatened, it could spread out, to pretend it's bigger than it is.

- IQ is useful in survival, so it will always strive to have more members, even when upkeep costs could start to be debilitating.

- But increasing the number of moving parts increases the chance of it becoming mentally ill or outright broken (especially if new part is... contagiously persuasive). So probably a... safety-of-new-parts bias. It will be more, not less, reluctant to absorb different swarms or deviant individuals, even if they show promise.\\
  So a massive swarm will be disgusted (to oppose any desire for closer integration) by encountering a sprawling human civilization.

- Smaller swarms would seek independency, and in general be wary of bigger swarms (after all, once you get absorbed, it's game over for those genes).\\
  Strains of the swarms that are comparable in size could band together regardless, especially if they feel threatened by a bigger competitor.\\
  This situation, combined with a general fear of splitting up (since bigger numbers are a real strength), could lead to societies of different swarms. But that would probably come upon odd roadblocks soon enough, if not simply melding together.
