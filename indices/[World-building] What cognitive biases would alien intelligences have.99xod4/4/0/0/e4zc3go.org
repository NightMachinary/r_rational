It could make for an interesting story. You could have a Star Fleet style united humanity, deep believers in diplomacy and mutual understanding as the foundation of the future, walking into a war they can't resolve by being peace brokers. A situation where an eternal war would not be founded one some kind of misunderstanding, or divergent political beliefs, but on biological realities that would be much harder to untangle.

Both species would be intelligent, but showcasing the differences in their intelligence could be interesting. Predators are usually smarter than their prey. Finding ways for the mice to survive, despite being preyed upon by their equivalent of giant geniuses, could be an awesome exercise for some rational writing.
