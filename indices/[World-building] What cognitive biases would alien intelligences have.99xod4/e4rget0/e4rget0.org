It's best if it comes organically out of their evolutionary origins. A lot of human biases and instinct come from our social/tribal nature, ingroup/outgroup dynamics, and natural apophenia/pareidolia.

So if your aliens' ancestors were solo predatory hunters, for example, they might have a bias towards instinctive attacking of perceived weakness, or an over-inflated sense of their own correctness.

Herd ancestors might lead to instinctive group consensus, where regardless of the correctness of the argument, you can't convince one unless you convince all.
