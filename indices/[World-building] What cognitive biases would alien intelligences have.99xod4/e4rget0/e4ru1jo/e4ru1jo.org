I'd ask the question "What is so often true for these aliens that considering it is a waste of time?", or, "What situation is extraordinary for these creatures?"

Sounds fun. Let's go down the list.

Classical fae might have a bias against even attempting to understand the goals of others; goals are always inscrutable, so why would they ever learn to understand each other's machinations? Communication isn't about conveying information, it's about pulling levers. RPGs and alcoholics anonymous aren't going to make sense to this species (How does talking help? What use is acknowledged fiction?) They won't be offended by misleading statements like humans are, since they expect that sort of thing, and if you mislead one it won't trust you any less than before. Quiet individuals are stupid individuals to the Fae, and the chatty are intelligent or trying to give that impression.

Singletons won't invent battle tactics or weapons for use against rival intelligence. Game theory for them might be as difficult as keeping track of thousands of body parts would be for us. Imagine trying to explain the difference between socialism and capitalism to such a creature: natural order for the individual and... what even?! Won't the smartest one kill or enslave dumber animals invariably? It's going to have a massive bias against any work that requires multiple entities. Having another entity to work with isn't something it's experienced--expect it to forget to inform you of its intentions, even if it joins your fleet.

For the biases of swarm intelligence, see [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game][Ender's Game]]. Even if it conceptualizes that intelligence can occupy a single body, it might not (for example) get why a human freaks out about losing a limb when it has three good ones remaining. The status-quo bias will be absent in this species; a fatal risk doesn't cost it all of its reproductive capacity, so it will be more adventurous than humans. It might also be biased to respect others that are physically larger, even more than humans; for it, size is the most direct measure of power in every sense. When it sees a clothing store, it will think the mannequins are a deception about strength or popularity, not a mere device for displaying clothes.

I'd expect more folks in UNSONG to be good at programming. Invoking a function is a fundamental property of their universe. They might identify with roles and persona more strongly than people of our world; the spelling of the word determines its effects, the title of person determines who they are, that sort of thing.

Nature spirits... depends on the specifics, but when was the last time you tried talking to a fly in your room to get it to leave? Cooperation and communication could be the first solution in use by a nature spirit, and if an obstacle won't move itself it might as well be immovable. I don't think they'll have the stereotypical bias against technology, however. Tech to them is like rocks to us; so irrelevant that it takes deliberate effort to notice it. Will the threat of technology be salient to them? Well, people still live near Yellowstone.
