A lot of discrimination ostensibly about color is greatly influenced by cultural markers, such as accent, clothing, etc. There are plenty of racist blind people IRL.

Cultural biases among RL blind people seem to include things like it being considered rude to enter a room without identifying yourself, trouble with snow and obstructive headgear (they greatly dampen echoes), perplexion over the obsession the sighted have with faces. When everyone uses canes, single-file is necessary, for all practical purposes, while those who don't are more likely to cluster together. I remember something about blind babies consistently hating certain positions due to how they interfere with acoustics. I recall a case where a blind couple was arrested for having sex in public, because they assumed that since they couldn't hear anyone, no one could see them. IRL Braille is politicized, between the people who don't learn it well and the abismal state of the relevant technology and general low availability (compare how things would go if everyone suddenly stopped learning to read print). Blind neatfreaks are way more anal about it than their sighted counterparts, since a lot of things too small or transparent to see are still large enough to feel on smooth surfaces. At the same time, visible stains and mars that cannot be felt would be missed.

Some of that wouldn't make sense for a whole civilization, but I expect some of it might.
