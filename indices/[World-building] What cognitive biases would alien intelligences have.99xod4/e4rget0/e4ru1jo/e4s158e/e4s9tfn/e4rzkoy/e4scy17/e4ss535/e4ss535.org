Modern branches of science, where single person can not encompass most of scientific knowledge of the branch is classical swarm intelligence. Latency is high and instead of neurotransmission transactions whole papers are send between elements, but still the system is at least order of magnitude more intelligent then single scientist. What kind of cognitive bios modern branches of science have? Very weak if not take into account less-developed branches like medicine and pseudo-sciences like psychology(no offence, but psychology don't use scientific method much) We can make educated guess that for powerful intelligence (> 10*human) cognitive bias is not significant.
