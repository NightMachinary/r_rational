I think you read a lot more into a thirty second comment than I ever meant.

Just because I said they were overconfident does not mean they don't know how to back down.

I was thinking specifically of sentient online communication, absent our normal in-person sensorium.

Of course they'd back down, unless they didn't. Maybe they're an r-type strategy in which perma-death is not detrimental to the overall species. A semi-hive mind with individual volition, but overall synchronicity of purpose.

Basically, I was thinking what if Reddit were cats.

They hunt solo, but congregate in groups. An individual cat will step up and get his ass kicked in public, and yet that doesn't really stop him from doing it again and again. There's no great harm other than to reputation, and every now and then you can win an otherwise pointless conflict for great societal success, but mostly you're just ignored.

No worries. It's all in fun.
