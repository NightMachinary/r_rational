  Perhaps at some point in the past the race as a whole made a magical pact to enforce honesty?

Well, sure, if you're using /magic/ then anything can be made to sound plausible. I was just thinking evolutionarily.

  If you think about it, us humans being so horrible at predicting task completion time is absolutely ridiculous - it's not that difficult if you know how to - and yet we have that problem, as a species.

It's not very hard to come up with an evolutionary path where "estimating completion time" isn't important at all.

It's a lot harder to come up with an evolutionary path that favors intelligence but not lying, I think.
