I think it's all in the execution. If it's part of their alienness, I don't really mind it. And the Fae are typically depicted as being bound to the truth by their very nature. Perhaps at some point in the past the race as a whole made a magical pact to enforce honesty?

Also, the way I imagine it, it's not so much them not figuring out lying as having an unconscious bias to not take it into consideration. If you think about it, us humans being so horrible at predicting task completion time is absolutely ridiculous - it's not that difficult if you know how to - and yet we have that problem, as a species.
