Which is why subverting or altering these needs results in some amazing alternate morality and points of view.

The buggers in Enders game for example with their views on murdering scores of humans (no more amoral from their point of view then disarming an enemy).

In another book (can't remember the title), the main aliens have had faster than light travel for generations, a part of their 'self' is stored in an organ which even after death can travel a specific distance in a sort of astral projection. FTL spaceships literally use ancestor relay to communicate. Every first contact they have ever experienced has consisted of the other aliens trying to murder them and their ancestors! (ie, radio communication being seen as an attack instead of communication).

Just off the top of my head, some great alternate needs:

- Memory is stored in dna and can be consumed and exchanged relatively easily. Fights of dominance, child rearing, etc all result in sharing less or more of these memories...by eating the flesh of the other being. The conflicts this would cause at first contact are obvious.

- An ecosystem where radiation is so high and so constant, but importantly something that slowly rose over the evolutionary history, that all life on this planet has multiple sexes beyond the two since it's needed for the redundant error correction. this results in more than just the 'fight and nurture' specialisations of our genders. You could have fight, feed/clean, educate, protect, etc etc splits and the social and political roles which develop from that.

- Vastly split time scales for two species interacting. One species is essentially formed through the gestalt reaction of mosses and slimes and so focuses entirely on food gathering and harvesting, long term goals for this species might be converting dry plains into swamps. this would be seen as something they do for the their 'day' but the other species 'year'. Their sense of time is just so long that days are mostly ignored. the other species might experience something closer to our time sense, the conflict there is easy to see.

in general, if you want a blue/orange morality instead of a white/black morality (as we know it), you /need/ a significantly different biological/structural/social system with a bias towards the more fundamental structural changes (biological/life cycle) side.
