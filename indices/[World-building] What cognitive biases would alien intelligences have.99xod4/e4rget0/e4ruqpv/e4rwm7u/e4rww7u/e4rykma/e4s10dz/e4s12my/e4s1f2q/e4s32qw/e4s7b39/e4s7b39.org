It's evolutionary, not rational. Our ancestors were not acutely aware of anything but their local environment and their base judgement. Our hypothetical sapient predator evolved in a similar environment.

You're the one who decided to turn a conversation about sentient species' cognitive biases into a nitpickery over your imagined evolutionary minutiae.

I disagree, and you're wrong, because I'm the one who came up with this imaginary species first, and thus I get to declare what is correct about them.

Why did you decide they're fighting to the death? I just said they're solitary predators and the sapient version is overconfident.
