  Why did you decide they're fighting to the death? I just said they're solitary predators and the sapient version is overconfident.

If they're not fighting until death or grievous injury then eventually one of them has to decide they've been beat, which is exactly my point; that competitive species all still know their own abilities accurately enough to know when to quit and try something else.

  I disagree, and you're wrong, because I'm the one who came up with this imaginary species first, and thus I get to declare what is correct about them.

When an idea is based upon the assumption of a particular evolutionary path being plausible then it /can/ actually be wrong, since evolution is still an orderly process that follows high level emergent rules. For instance barring some very particular circumstances (like social insects or gender changing animals) species will have gender parity due to Fisher's principle.
