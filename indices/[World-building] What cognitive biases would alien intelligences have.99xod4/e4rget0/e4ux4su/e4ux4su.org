ok but what about ancestors that were solo predatory hunters? :P

just cuz, i feel like these are biases that people tend to have already. so what would the solo thing look like. a tendency to look for ways to win through competition rather than cooperation? or even a bias against cooperation in general? inverse tribalness where you try to avoid people that look like you because they're mentally viewed as competition?
