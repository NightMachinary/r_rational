Status posturing is one thing, but if you're a solitary species you'll want to be acutely aware of your actual abilities, because males in the sorts of species we're talking about adopt a different strategy if they can't do well in combat. Also importantly getting yourself killed or injured here is not an acceptable outcome because you'd always be better off cutting your losses at some point and either fighting competitors elsewhere or being sneaky.

Basically the point I'm making is that actual real world animals like deer, elephant seals, etc know when to admit they've been beaten and try something else.
