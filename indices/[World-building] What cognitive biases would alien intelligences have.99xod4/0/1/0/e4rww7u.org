Eh, off the cuff. I was thinking of predator status fights. They're solitary, but they can't be permanently solitary. So they come together occasionally for mating and fighting. As they evolved, this became posturing and posing, which becomes superiority and inflated self-worth. Think that kind of domineering boss with the 'my way or the highway' attitude. As long as it's good enough, things will generally be ok.
