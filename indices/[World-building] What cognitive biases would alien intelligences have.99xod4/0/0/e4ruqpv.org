Most of our biases are useful - in a caveman environment. They're only now harmful because our society advanced faster than we evolved. Many are vestigial heuristics.

So the simplest way to imagine new ones is to create a relatively sudden change in the alien society, and see how tools that used to fit well are now sub-optimal or harmful.

Considering the fae for a moment:

- Perhaps they only recently (oh, a few millennia ago) encountered humans, and are still caught off-guard by their willingness to lie and break their word. Say this results in something like the planning fallacy that applies when considering what others will do. Maybe they're consciously aware of it, but it can sneak up on them.

- Ruled by a Great Fae King for untold aeons, he has recently disappeared. They have since learned to cope, but a lack of initiative remains - they're more susceptible to suggestion than you might expect from a human. Something like an inverse bystander effect - they're /really/ easy to command in groups, which has good and bad sides.

I'm not feeling very creative at the moment, but I think I made the idea clear enough. Some aspect of the world used to be one way, and it's now different - but the aliens have not fully adapted to that change. Maybe it's resource scarcity (hi, obesity epidemic!), or a parasitic species turned symbiotic but still causes distaste... etc.
