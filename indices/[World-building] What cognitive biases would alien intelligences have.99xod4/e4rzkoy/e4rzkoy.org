Aliens that have an evolutionary background as solo predatory hunters might have a strong bias towards respecting bigger, stronger people, to the point of instant deference. If two tigers fight in the wild, the bigger, stronger one often wins; for a sentient species evolving from such a situation, unused to doing things like working in groups to take out otherwise un-killable opponents, the idea of doing anything but flee in the face of a stronger opponent might provoke instinctive, crippling fear, and the idea of trying to outsmart or gang up on them might not be obvious.

Or interestingly, you could have a situation where a sentient species evolved intelligence, while still being preyed upon by a similarly smart predator that was specialized in hunting them. A cat and mouse situation, only both the cat and the mice are sentient. This could result in a species whose Us vs. Them instinct is always stuck on maximum, the out-group always completely de-humanised. It wouldn't matter to a Mouse species if humans were sentient or not; the Cats were sentient as well and they still killed the mice in droves. The idea of things like the Holocaust or slavery being bad would take a long time for the Mice to understand, as they would have literally started off in what was essentially a war of eradication; their culture would have begun with the genocide of the Cats. Tribalism, to them, would be the only true philosophy.

Or you could have the Cats be the winners of the conflict, and have an even more interesting situation; humans encountering a species whose survival was literally based upon their ability to de-humanise other sentient beings, with massive cognitive bias surrounding any activity that requires working with an out-group, or cross-species empathy. They would have an incredibly hard time understanding the concept of pets, and, again, wouldn't understand why things like slavery or the holocaust was wrong, as they would have evolved in a situation where exploiting and murdering other sentient beings was their main cultural norm.
