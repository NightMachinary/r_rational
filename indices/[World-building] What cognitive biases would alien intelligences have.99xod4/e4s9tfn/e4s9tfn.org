Look at common behavioral pathologies in the animal kingdom if you want it to be realistic.

Whales breaching, birds plucking out all their feathers, dogs scratching way too much, birds feeding cuckoo chicks, insects laying their eggs on any shiny surface, ants getting trapped in spirals, insects flying incessantly towards the light.

The interesting thing is that humans share some of these (e.g. picking at skin) but not others, so you get a smooth gradation from familiar biases to complex ones. And then there's some biases that you might imagine are near universal e.g [[https://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Skinner/Pigeon/]]
