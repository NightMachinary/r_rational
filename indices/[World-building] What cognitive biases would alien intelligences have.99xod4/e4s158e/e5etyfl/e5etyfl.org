Seems to me that a swarm species, after conquering it's natural predators and environment, would massively overpopulate. In a primitive environment, more is always better, because their environment would naturally trim their numbers. In the future, you would see repeating patterns of starvation and disease as their need to be more leads to them massively over exploiting their environment.
