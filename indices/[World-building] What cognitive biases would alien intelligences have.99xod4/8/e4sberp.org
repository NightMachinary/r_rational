For singletons, I guess they'd probably not have a habit of dealing with other minds. So they'd probably have some kind of "inanimate bias", where they tend to underestimate the amount of complexity that can be introduced by intelligent agents in a system, and think even of artificial stuff like it's just some sort of rule of nature - the opposite of our tendency to anthropomorphize everything, basically.
