Yeah the decision to give some flying pokemon Gust/Whirlwind but not Defog always struck me as weird, but I figured that Blue teaching his pokemon how to effectively mimic it with a similar move would be interesting. Instead I might just say fuck it and declare that "Defog" is the name of the same sort of attack that's directed at objects instead of other pokemon.
