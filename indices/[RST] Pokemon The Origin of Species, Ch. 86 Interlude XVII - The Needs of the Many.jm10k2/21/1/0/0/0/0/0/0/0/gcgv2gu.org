Sorry, having trouble following the comment. Are you saying you're not sure that being put to sleep with a single inhale of powder is sufficiently dangerous, or something? When I said high risk I mean high risk to the person doing it, since if it misses it's a wasted "turn" and it's much easier to evade in a real setting than in the game.
