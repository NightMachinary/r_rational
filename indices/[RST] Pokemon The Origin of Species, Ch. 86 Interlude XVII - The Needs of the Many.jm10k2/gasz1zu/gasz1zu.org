Erika's perspective was interesting. That beginning bit from when she was a child struck a chord with me. Something tells me she never changed her mind about time spent with Grandma. I hate the tendency people have to treat the feelings of children as invalid or irrelevant. The argument of "when you're older" especially annoys me.

I think it is a shame she is working with Giovanni. Even if she's not inducted into his deep secrets like Sabrina, it is still a black mark against her. To make matters worse she is allowing him to continue to operate despite what happened and can't even claim any sort of ignorance anymore.

Good to see Blue get back into things, even if Erika really didn't want him to win. She abused her position in that match in my opinion.

Anyway she is a deeply flawed person, but I enjoyed her perspective. I do look forward to getting back to Red and seeing how he's coping though.
