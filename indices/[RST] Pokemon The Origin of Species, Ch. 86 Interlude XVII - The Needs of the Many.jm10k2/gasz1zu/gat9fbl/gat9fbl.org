Yeah, I agree. Erika was really pushing every advantage she had in that match, with the coin flip thing (is that even allowed???) and trying to call a draw at the end. I like her character though, she's pretty cunning for a character who's always been portrayed as peaceful and chill in other media (I think. Never read the manga).
