There's something about Erika that I have like a guttural kind of unease about. Like that somehow she's wrong and I'm not sure why like she's totally got this set up for ease of communications beyond current societal norms, she's working kinda around the system rather than arguably the intended way, but I think the thing that I have the most issue with is that she's not really a gym leader for the sake of being a gym leader.

Like it's a position that you're supposed to hold in order to protect the people of your city and region and like Erika kinda just didn't and like for petty personal power reasons which I find less forgivable than the more megalomaniac tendencies of Giovanni who is almost certainly an antagonist if not an outright villain. But Erika kinda just puts people in danger by being the leader both by not striving to be the strongest in a time where personal strength can and does save lives, but is also not enough in comparison to the known and feared threats that are expected. Like i dunno i wouldn't have a problem with her "leading" an apartment somewhere doing mostly the same things, but like there are expectations on her that she's not even trying to live up to.

Also that like if her Third is the battling part of her leadership qualifications of Gym Leadership what happens if/when she dies, which we've seen happen to you know full Gym Leaders in the face of crisis(s?) or like if Erika dies and her little you know rationalist coven isn't seen as something the next Gym Leader wants?

More pedantically the Ferrothorn being returned out of ingrain is wierd. Also i'm not sure that the dramatic finish holds up when Golbat absent any conscious pokemon threatening his(her?) master is just able to wake up given time which considering all of the opposing pokemon are knocked but they are just asleep well... I mean sure in like anime sometimes was considered a knock out in the Indigo League but like that part feels kind of questionable like the enemy was defeated all he has to do wait and his golbat should just wake up.
