I kind of imagined that Leaders pick their teams for lower badge challengers on the fly. That wouldn't fit with how you portrayed it in the story, but would give them absolute control over who wins and loses.

Afterall, if a challenger shows impressive skills but the Leader has "misjudged" a good counter team to them, the challenger gets punished for nothing.

Of course that only makes sense for lower badges like first and maybe second.
