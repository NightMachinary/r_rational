Well damn, if Erika brought a team of five fully evolved pokemon, all dual-typed for a fourth-badge challenger, what the hell would she use against an eighth-badge challenger?

Got the same feeling with Amy's challenge against Misty. I don't quite understand how the scaling works, considering there are no levels.

Though given that there are no levels, it also means, that a fully evolved pokemon doesn't necessarily get much stronger than another one of its species....
