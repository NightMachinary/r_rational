This was a great chapter, definitely unexpected to see from Erika's perspective a badge match but still great. Definitely felt like an organic way to move the story on from the Hoenn story without completely ignoring its impacts. Love that my boy Looker showed up and I'm intrigued as to how much Erika knows about Giovanni's scheming. Also bit sad the Casino pokemon never got revealed, maybe later it will, but still a great chapter!

Also, I wonder how close to the 'official' timeline this is, and if Hoenn has a new champion now or not...
