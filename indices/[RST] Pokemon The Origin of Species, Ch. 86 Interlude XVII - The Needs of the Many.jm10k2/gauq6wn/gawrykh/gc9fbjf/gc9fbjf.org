She decides the tactic won't be effective because pidgeot's whirlwind-back attack clears them out of the field. Not sure if that was in there originally or edited in to clarify, but that seems to be her reasoning. Once pidgeot is out she starts using status moves again but by that point the fight is nearly over.
