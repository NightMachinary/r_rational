Here's something I've been thinking about, and I think I'm seeing a theme here: in the Erika vs Blue match, Erika gets stymied by Blue's use of poison/toxic status moves.

A /status/ move. Erika is all about status, and in the start of the chapter we see her unhappy with Looker, Lance and Giovanni because her position is being undermined...or perhaps poisoned.

Okay, what does Erika think about Koga then?
