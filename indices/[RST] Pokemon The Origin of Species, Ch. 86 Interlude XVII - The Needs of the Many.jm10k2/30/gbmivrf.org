Great chapter, though I'm not a fan of what Erika suggested to simulate the chance of Blue escaping with his Breloom. Guessing fingers is something too easy for her to fake and decide how the challenge ends. If the intended implication is that she's that blatantly abusive of her status, then it works and I like it, but if it was meant as a genuine attempt to give him a coin flip there are definitely better ways imo.

Off the top of my head, she could grab a spare pokeball from nearby and have Blue guess whether it contains one of two species.

That last bit with Soul roaring was great though, super awesome!
