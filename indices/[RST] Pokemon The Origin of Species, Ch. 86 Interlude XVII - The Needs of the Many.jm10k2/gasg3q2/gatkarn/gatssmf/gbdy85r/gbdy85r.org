Reminds me of the Betan earrings from the Vorkosigan Saga novels, signaling relationship status and sexual preferences from "not interested at all" to "active but in a committed relationship" to "interested in sex with anything capable of consent". This one has some other possible messages that can be conveyed, though, like "Do not disturb unless it's really important".
