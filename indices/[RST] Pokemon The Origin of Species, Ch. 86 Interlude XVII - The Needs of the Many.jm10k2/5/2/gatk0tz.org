Meh.... what's wrong with working with Giovanni from her perspective?[who was instrumental in her becoming leader in the first place, as we learnt this chapter]

Yes, allowing renegades in the basement is illegal, but since there's some kind of corporate shadow-war behind the scenes, it's not unreasonable.Kanto has rule of law of sorts, but leaders, champions, elites and mega-corporations and other high-status people all sorta run around and do their own thing..... for what we've seen so far, good reasons.Are the more civilian, less warlord-equivalent elected mayors any better? Maybe, but Leaf suspects that a conspiracy of mayors might have been behind the Mt. Moon catastrophe.

Bill openly admitted he sabotaged other AI research. Which might mean anything between hacking and deleting/falsifying data, doxxing, blackmail to straight-up murder.Or whatever a super-rich person could pull off to make you stop doing things. Maybe he just gave all promising AI researchers a lucrative scholarships in unrelated fields.

[we also have no good read on what Silph is up to, besides union-busting]

Kanto is kind of a morally grey place, unlike in the games.Giovanni is not a mobster. The Silph Co president is not a hapless victim.

The whole region is a conspiracy theorist's paradise, because there's so many absurdly competent players, that actually pull of conspiracies.

But yeah, that battle vs Blue was some unfair shenanigans.
