Power is always in the hands of the few and it is always defended. Sometimes with force of arms, sure. Mostly challenges to it don't require that, though.\\
I would judge any leader's moral worth not by from how their power is derived (or what the popular narrative is, how it's supposedly derived), but by how it is used.
