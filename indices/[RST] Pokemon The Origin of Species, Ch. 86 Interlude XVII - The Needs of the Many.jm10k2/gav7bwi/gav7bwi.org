Since I didn't see any other comments on this, I will just note how great the literary trick was to set up Blue to reject a victory on chance midway through the fight, in a way that made him just a bit bitter but knew was the right call - then reverse course at the end & openly stake everything on luck, but in a way that was much more "him" (belief in his Pok√©mon over pure chance). Its one of those quasi-subtle set-ups leading to payoff that is the hallmark of good structure, and I appreciate how often individual chapters have those kind of structural components over just being a literal sequence-of-events.
