The gym battles in this story are so goddamn entertaining. Every single one I'm on the edge of my seat, because I know you aren't afraid to have Blue lose, or have a Stormbringer attack the city mid-battle. I really thought for a second that it was going to be a draw, but that last scene was so...epic, for lack of a better word!

Also, I had a sneaking suspicion Erika was in on the Renegade thing. The way she was acting with Looker really gave off the idea that she wants to brush this whole thing under the rug as soon as possible. Also, looks like she might be onto Red about the whole uh, murder thing.

...God I cannot wait for the next Red-centric chapter.
