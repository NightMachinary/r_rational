Dragon Ascent drops the target after flying to high altitude. There's mention in the Titans III chapter of a "red shape detach[ing]" from Rayquaza and falling back to earth. Presumably the high-speed impact with water killed Groudon (and if not, it probably drowned while asleep and weakened), and they were able to recover its body in the same manner as they scavenged Kyogre's body off the ocean floor.
