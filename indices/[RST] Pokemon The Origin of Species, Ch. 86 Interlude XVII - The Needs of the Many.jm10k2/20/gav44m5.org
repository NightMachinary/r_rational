Great writing, as always.

I'm enjoying the nods to competitive Pokemon strategy, by the way, with its hazards and pivots, and I can think of a couple old competitive movesets that Breloom might be building towards. This series has always been good at sneaking in some niche pokemon lore in a way that won't alienate people who don't get the references, and I think this is a neat instance of that.
