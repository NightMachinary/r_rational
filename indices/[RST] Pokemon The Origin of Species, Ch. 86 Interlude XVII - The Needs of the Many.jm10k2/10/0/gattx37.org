Yeah levels are hard to translate to a world like this. None of the pokemon she uses need a high level to evolve except Cradily and Ferrothorn at 40, which feels justified to have as her strongest pokemon given how important they are to her team. In the games, when she's your 4th gym battle her pokemon are usually in the mid-30s.
