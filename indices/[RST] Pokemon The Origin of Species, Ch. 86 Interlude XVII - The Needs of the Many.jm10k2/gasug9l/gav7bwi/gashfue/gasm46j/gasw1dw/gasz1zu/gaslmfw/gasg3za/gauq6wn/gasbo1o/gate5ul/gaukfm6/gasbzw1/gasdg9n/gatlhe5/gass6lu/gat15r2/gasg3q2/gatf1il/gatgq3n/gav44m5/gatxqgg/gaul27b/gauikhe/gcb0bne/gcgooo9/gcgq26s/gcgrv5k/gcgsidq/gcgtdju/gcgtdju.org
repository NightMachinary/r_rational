I'm just not convinced that sleep is high risk is the thing and that in comparison to most if not all other moves in a the League Matches as you said it only needs to land once and that pokemon is knocked out regardless if the opposing pokemon can like even damage them any further if given the chance which is weird. Also that it makes like the move Rest not a thing and while you have shown the like real world consequences of people being drowned in puddles previously like i'm not sure that the overall threat of said pokemon is portrayed accurately if that's the interpretation that you're going to consistently use.
