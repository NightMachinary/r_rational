Yeah, but from Rakim's perspective we know that there was a kill-order for sub basement 3. Anyone above those levels would simply be turned around and thrown out. Lizzy didn't see anything apart from generators, which weren't a secret (as far as we know). Rakim was in sub basement 3 and could not reach anybody for guidance on that and decided to apply that rule, thinking that Archer could still be able to hide or spin the existence of the lower levels, if there are no witnesses left alive to contradict that his account. Rakim that got knocked out by Joy was also in sub basement 3 (I think?). So he either reasoned in the same way or he and Roark coordinated at some point.

The generators are in sub basement 1 (that was my conclusion, last I read this, anyway). No kill order there. So the third renegade Maddie would have to have been extremely ruthless and very cool-headed, thinking that she can't allow the girl asking where the generators are, to fix them.Quite the psycho, considering that this would help in digging out her own colleagues and friends (and their Fantasy Indigo League!).

More likely that she got the order from Archer (or maybe even Giovanni), who presumably survived and left Celadon. [or has already been captured by Looker]

---re: weregildYeah, I suppose. It's a risk, I think. Something that Looker might end up looking into :)
