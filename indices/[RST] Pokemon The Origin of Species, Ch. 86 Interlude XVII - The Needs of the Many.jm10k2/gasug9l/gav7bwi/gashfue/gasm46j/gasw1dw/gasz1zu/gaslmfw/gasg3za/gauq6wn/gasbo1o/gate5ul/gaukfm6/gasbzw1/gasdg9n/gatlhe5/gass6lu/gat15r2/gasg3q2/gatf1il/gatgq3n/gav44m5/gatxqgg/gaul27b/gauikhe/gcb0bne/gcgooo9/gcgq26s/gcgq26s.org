It's a knock-out in the sense that it needs trainer intervention for them to wake up, and trainers aren't allowed to intervene in League matches. This rule I basically made up because otherwise people would just be spamming potions on their pokemon, because why not? So it's just one of the ways that trainer battles are less realistic than wild battles, but everyone accepts this for the sake of having a reasonable competitive framework.
