All true, but I'm impressed just by the fact that you know about Ferrothorn, the fact that its ability is iron barbs, and leading with Spikes, the fact that some breloom don't get poisoned, etc. That's a fair bit of trivia to know for someone who doesn't play, and I think the ferrothorn bit is even relevant in the current meta.

(Though, I'm always amused when powerful people keep using Water Gun in this story! Pretty sure it is strictly overshadowed by hydro pump, surf, and scald / my impression was that some moves like water gun and ember are more for the sake of move progression in game in the low levels)
