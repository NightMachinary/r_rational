Like for sure you're portraying the actual being put asleep in the like non-league battles as being potentially lethal but like i'm not sure that the pokemon that are able to do so are being not feared necesarrily but given the threat ratings that they should be if that makes sense.

Conversely like what Erika did with her Vileplume traded her losing matchup into what seemed to her like a tie. Like I'm not sure how to describe it but like if sleep is that impactful it seems like she's incentivized to use that to the best effect possible and we haven't seen like implementation of such a thing. Like it's one thing for the pokemon anime to mostly treat sleep as a knock out and for us not to see teams set up as like mostly like battlefield control with the ability to put down flying pokemon in order to force the opponent into not being able to dodge sleep powder or hypnosis or like yawn or whatever. As an aside the fact that a trainer like wouldn't necesarrily be able to handle the Stormbringer tier opponents is kind of beside the point. Like if there's an optimal strategy to win pokemon League Battles and that it's not necesarrily one that makes you a strong overall trainer if anything that disincentives the rules that separate it from battles against wild pokemon. Like it feels like low hanging fruit for someone who's goal is like just to be the best League Battler in a way that bothers me in a way that should kind of be obvious from this continued back and forth. Which isn't to say I think there's like something terribly wrong but it feels like inconsistent in a way that i'm having trouble putting into words.
