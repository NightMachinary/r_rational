  Red sees where Leaf is going. "Oh, shit. What happens if that physical object becomes a pokemon, like beldum?"

  Professor Oak told him about that: the interregional panic during his school days, when a library in Hoenn was destroyed overnight from within by a swarm of the new pokemon. Investigations showed that the computers in their lab were all gone without a trace, and endless steps were taken worldwide to try and find out what happened, either to replicate it, or avoid having the same thing happen elsewhere. Efforts on both sides met with limited success.

I did somehow misremember "library computer lab" as "elementary school computer lab" though.
