Leaf thinks that, but she is out of the loop on a lot. Given the present info I would wager a guess that it is more likely the work of Giovanni's organization.

What is wrong is that one of the core Leader duties is passing judgement on Renegades. Very few others can do it. And in exchange for sparing some, they are reaping the rewards of them as labour for illegal activities. Well-meaning, maybe. But it is still flagrant corruption and incredibly anti-democratic.
