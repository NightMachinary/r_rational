Completely unrelated question to this chapter; in Chapter 59, there's a renegade programmer Giovanni interviews that his personal psychic finds untrustworthy:

  /Sincere/, he sends, the wait already having gone on for a few seconds longer than customary. /But there's something about him that seems inherently hard to pin down. I would not trust him./

Did you have a specific mental disorder in mind when you wrote that renegade? Or just a vague antisocial/emotional detachment mix?
