Yes. That all falls under heroic responsibility ;)

In the real world, we almost never see bad things done on a massive scale for good reasons.\\
And certainly we never see conspiracies of that scale work at all.

But in-universe it makes perfect sense.\\
And yeah, if Giovanni's plan is so sensible and the world is more rationalist and more hardcore survivalist in general, the secrecy/murder stuff doesn't quite fit in, but this fiction has to work under the constraints of Giovanni being an elegantly dressed mobster wearing an expensive Italian suit..... so I dunno, I just have no trouble rolling with it.

Samuel Oak alludes to Giovanni being extremely driven, but ultimately getting in the way of his own noble goals, because he just can't help being a cold fucking sociopath with trust issues. [or something along those lines, don't quite remember]\\
I hope that will be explored more, at some point.\\
Fits neatly into Blue's arc about wanting to become "the right Champion". He's probably going to be a little bit disillusioned with Erika, after the stunts she pulled.
