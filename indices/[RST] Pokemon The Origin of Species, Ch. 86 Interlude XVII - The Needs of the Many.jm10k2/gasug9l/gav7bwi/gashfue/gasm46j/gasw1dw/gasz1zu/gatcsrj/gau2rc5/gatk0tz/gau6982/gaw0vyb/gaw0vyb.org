re: Mt MoonYeah, I'm pretty sure I have figured out, who killed Yuuta and who Palmer's source was. But I have no good idea, who ordered/commissioned the Mt. Moon robbery, in the first place. Maybe I'm missing some context from other games (maybe the Unova ones). But I don't think it was Giovanni himself. What would he get out of it? I have a possible motive, but it's a bit far-fetched.

---re: Erika being corrupt and anti-democratic

Kanto isn't exactly a democratic society, though.

It's more like a confederation of free city states, that are locally democratic.I think that the mayors might be elected, but the closest to a federal government would be the Indigo League and CorrNet.Corrnet is like.... a volunteer-run FEMA with local chapter everywhere. Or maybe a large-scale volunteer firefighter organization.And the Indigo league is half corporate wrestling franchise, half semi-professional militia except almost never directed against human threats.... actually, I struggle to find a good real world equivalent for the Indigo league.Their local chapters, the gyms, are more or less in harmony (and often in tension) with the local democratic/civilian elements.

Together this all forms something like the Hanseatic league.And the democracy element is implied to be somewhat recent as pokeball tech used to not exist in living memory, meaning it was probably more warlord- and or psychic-dominated even back then.

So what Erika has been doing is not anti-democratic. She's not acting against democracy/the civvies, she just considered the shady Giovanni/Silph-war to be none of their concern and hides it from them.

I wouldn't call it corrupt or ethically misguided.[maybe it is, but since I have no idea how good the civic/democratic institutions actually are I'm not assuming it]
