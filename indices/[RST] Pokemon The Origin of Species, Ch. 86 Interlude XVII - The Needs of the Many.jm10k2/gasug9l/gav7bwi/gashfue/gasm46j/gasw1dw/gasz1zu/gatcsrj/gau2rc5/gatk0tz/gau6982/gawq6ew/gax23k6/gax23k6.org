  I would judge any leader's moral worth not by from how their power is derived (or what the popular narrative is, how it's supposedly derived), but by how it is used.

Ahh.... now I'm thinking of a spin-off with a "heroic irresponsibility"-theme.

Mewto turns against Giovanni and Sabrina and goes on a rampage.

Aeosis evolves into a Steelix and he loses control of it.\\
Bill unleashes Stuxnet to hinder Rocket-Casino AI research and creates Porygon, which starts a war against humanity and destroying the internet and box system.

Groudon and Kyogre kill each other, but Wallace didn't notice this in time (the sky pillar is far away, after all) and he unleashes the titans for nothing. Surge's preparation for war succeeds too well, and Kanto starts preemptive strikes against Unova using hundreds of Abras (thanks Red!).\\
Aiko survives, accidentally reveals Sakki to Rei and she leads the surviving gym members to form a psychic clan and conquer Saffron and from there Lavender town.

And Erika.... accidentally gets herself and all her people addicted to her Bayleaf's tea. (turns out it was too good!)
