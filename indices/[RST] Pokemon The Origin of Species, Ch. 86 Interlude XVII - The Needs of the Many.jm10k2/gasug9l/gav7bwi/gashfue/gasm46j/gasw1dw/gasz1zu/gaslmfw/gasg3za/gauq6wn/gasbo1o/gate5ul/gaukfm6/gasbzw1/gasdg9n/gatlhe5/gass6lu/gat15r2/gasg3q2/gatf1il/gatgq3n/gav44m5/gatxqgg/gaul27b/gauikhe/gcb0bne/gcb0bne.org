Sorry about that ;) It just seemed like a weird limitation... sure it would stop a pokemon from being blown away by Whirlwind or running away from Roar, but why would it stop a pokeball from working? The roots are still part of them, if being underground stops them from being withdrawn then a diglett wouldn't be able to be withdrawn unless its whole body was above ground.
