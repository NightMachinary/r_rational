I initially thought that this will be a Red focused chapter as it has been 8 chapters since the last one. I was very surprised at seeing another interlude, but it blew my expectations away and I found myself really enjoying the chapter. I especially loved the small teases to the actions of Red and Leaf as it shows that they both have something to hide since the incident in Hoenn. Looking forward to the next chapter and hopefully it is a Red focused chapter as I want to see how the tulpa has grown and Red's POV of the casino incident.
