Surge likes to be prepared, but he also is far too involved in his city to risk it by allowing Renegades in the basement. Plus, when Blue brought up the idea of a Renegade attack, his reaction was [[http://daystareld.com/pokemon-73/][genuine confusion]]

Plus, I suspect the only Gym Leaders in on it are the cities where the games have a significant or implied significant Rocket presence: Viridian, Saffron, Celadon, and Cinnabar (and Lavender but there's no gym there). That would make the Gym Leaders have an even 4/4 split on being in on the conspiracy.
