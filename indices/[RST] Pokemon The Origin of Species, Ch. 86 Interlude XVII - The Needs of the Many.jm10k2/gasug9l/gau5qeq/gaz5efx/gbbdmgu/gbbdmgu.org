I'm pretty sure it is, except that you don't become renegade when you do. The whole point of being made an outlaw is that the law no longer protects you. So while you can certainly be killed, legally you can't be murdered.

Of course if you are in legitimate custody there are other rules, which would make breaking into a cell to kill a detained renegade definitely illegal, just not quite on grounds as straightforward as murder.

Red's problem is more that if such a use of /sakki/ should get out it would jeopardise Leaf's work and potentially empower renegades everywhere, not to mention annihilate any deniability Red might have about anything unpleasant that goes on around him, justifiably or not. Also, he likely does not want to be known as a killer, nor does he want Blue's friends to know that he psychically transformed their beloved Pok√©mon into lethal weapons.
