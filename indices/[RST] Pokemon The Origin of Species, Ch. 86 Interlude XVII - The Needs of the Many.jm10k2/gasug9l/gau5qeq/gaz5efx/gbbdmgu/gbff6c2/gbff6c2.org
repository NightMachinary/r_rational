I think it's only MG whose vulpix he subverted for the killing - Lizzy's story that the pokemon the renegede sent after her turned on its own trainer doesn't have any elements contradicting it, yet.

That said, I hope Red's able to find /some/ way of appeasing MG's anxiety. Erika mentions this chapter that MG was visibly trembling as she accepted the medals for herself and Glen, and I suspect that's a good part caused by fear of someone finding out her vulpix killed a man (and possibly even wondering where she went wrong in training it) as it is caused by stage fright and imposter syndrome.
