Using Whirlwind to remove spikes was basically just the Flying-type status move Defog, which is likely performed in much the same way anyway. Since you don't seem to be imposing a strict move limit I'd say it's fine, though it seems odd that Erika would consider it a use of Whirlwind unless Blue has actually just invented Defog.
