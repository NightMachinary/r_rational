Even then wasn't the challenge to beat her five which happened regardless of whether or not Blue's Arcanine was able to stand? I guess you could make the argument that it's not enough to be able to be the only living thing conscious regardless and it's admittedly a very well petty thing to be confused about, but like it feels within the constraints of the challenge he had won even before his Arcanine was proven still able to battle.

But also if sleep is generally considered a knock out aren't you at least a little incentivized to teach your pokemon to use like Sleep talk? Or like winning your mastery challenge by putting all of your opponent's to sleep seems well possible and within the rules as written which seems like something someone intelligent could exploit.
