Blue points out that technically he did defeat all her pokemon, but the generally accepted winner has to still have a pokemon left capable of fighting at the end.

I don't think Sleep Talk is a legal move in my world, even if it exists as a TM that pokemon can learn there's still no way for a sleeping pokemon to discriminate who it's attacking even if it could be given orders like "use body slam directly in front of you." And yes putting opponents to sleep is a common tactic, it's just high-risk-high-reward. The only one that's not legal in League matches are indiscriminate sleep attacks like Sing.
