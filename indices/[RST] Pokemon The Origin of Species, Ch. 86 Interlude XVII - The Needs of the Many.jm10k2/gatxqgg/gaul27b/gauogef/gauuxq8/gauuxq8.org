Well, considering a large bird is creating enough wind to blow away an entire field's worth of metal caltrops, i think its safe to assume there's some wind magic shenanigans going on. So it could be argued that its wind vs mind magic stuff, and a sufficiently powerful blast of air could diffuse a force field or something. Idk, game mechanics arent going to translate 1:1. It could go either way.
