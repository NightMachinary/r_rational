Anyway... as someone who doesn't pay much attention to the world, I'm wondering, why do gym leaders ever lose? Shouldn't they easily defeat any kid? Is it because they have pokemon of one type? (Really realistic story, by the way, enjoying Red and Mewtwo, I hope Giovanni is stored in a pokeball at some point...)
