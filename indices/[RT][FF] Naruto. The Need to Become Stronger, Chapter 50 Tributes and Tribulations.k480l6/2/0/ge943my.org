Nope, no resurrections for me. I always hated it as a kid when authors would chicken out like that - the threat of death is what makes action scenes (and stories like this in general) so tense and exciting. Whenever I read stories in which there's a huge battle and nobody important dies it breaks all suspension of disbelief for me.

Still, I'm getting a bit worried that I might have made the story feel too dark because of it. Gotta be careful with that stuff. :d
