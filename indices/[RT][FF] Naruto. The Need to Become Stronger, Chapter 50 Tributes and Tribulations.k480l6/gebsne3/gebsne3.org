    “Naruto.” Sasuke touched his shoulder and turned him around until the two of them were facing each other. There was a strange sheen to his grey eyes, as if they still held onto some of their power even when his Sharingan was deactivated. “She's not dead.”

Look, [[/u/Sophronius][u/Sophronius]]. I'm not asking for you to send me a literal gold metal. I'm only asking for credit for reading your entire work, and understanding that Sasuke is the exact kind of person who would casually genjutsu Naruto here.

I'm really happy that you're back btw. This was a story that got me through quarantine this year. Even if there were no chapters from here on out, I'm happy for these.
