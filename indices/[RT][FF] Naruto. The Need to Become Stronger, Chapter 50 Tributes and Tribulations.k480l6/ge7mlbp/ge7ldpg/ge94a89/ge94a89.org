Huh, well you're not the only person saying this so I doubt it's your intelligence that's the problem. Is there anything in particular where you went "argh this is too much stuff to take in right now"? Or is it more everything taken together?

I'm thinking of removing the Kabuto scene entirely tbh, also because I feel like it might make the chapter too frustrating to readers due to dramatic irony etc.
