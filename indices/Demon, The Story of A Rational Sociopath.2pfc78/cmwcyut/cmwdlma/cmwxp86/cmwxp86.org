Having re-read all the panels in that sequence I now agree with your "fairly gross" comments. Entirely (in my view) due to the blood running out of eyeballs, the pools of blood, the decapitation, and the many, many bodies. I still take issue with your original comment that there's a "very disgusting" method of suicide. In my view the murder of NPCs is much worse than that. It's just that society is more open about murder than masturbation.
