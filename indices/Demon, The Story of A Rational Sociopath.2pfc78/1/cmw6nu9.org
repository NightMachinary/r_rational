Like some of Shiga's other work, in a lot of ways it's about problem solving, or taking the exploration of an idea to its limits. And in that respect, I think that it would appeal to people who visit this subreddit.

But even given Jimmy's complete disregard for human life, there are some problems with "because plot", namely with the organization tasked with bringing Jimmy in. I can forgive a lot of that, especially if I read in bursts instead of one page at a time, but it might bug some people, and it means that the story doesn't really stand up to too much scrutiny.

Jimmy doesn't quite meet all the criteria for sociopathy, but it's not just that he's willing to do anything to achieve his goals - it's that he simply does not take other peoples' lives into consideration. Like, there's a scene in one of the recent panels where he murders a man rather than going through the trouble of walking five feet. There's absolutely no question that he's evil, he just happens to be the protagonist.
