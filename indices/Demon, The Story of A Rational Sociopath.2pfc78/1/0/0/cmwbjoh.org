I think they understand, they've just demonstrated some supreme incompetence in putting their plans into motion. What they want to do is get him in a position where he can't kill himself (or anyone else), presumably so that they can negotiate some kind of arrangement with him, though I have no idea what that would entail. I believe that there's quite a bit that we, the viewers, don't know about the organizations goals and purpose.

Anyway, there was one big moment of failure right near the beginning when Jimmy was trapped (and bleeding out) in a cell. Hunter tells him that he's going to die there and possess the guy in the next cell. /And then Hunter leaves/. In fact, everyone leaves. Jimmy is all alone, with no one watching him. More importantly, the guy in the next cell over - the one that Jimmy is supposed to possess when he dies - /hasn't been tranquilized by the OSS/. It's a mistake that I can understand them making, but that was the moment that it became clear Jimmy wasn't going up against intellectual champions.

So I enjoy the story, and I enjoy the puzzle aspects of it, but I don't look too closely, because the adversary is a little too incompetent.
