You are right.

When I made my original post, I was only thinking in terms of visuals, but I apologize if I unintentionally trivialized murder and methods of suicide. No matter how someone dies, it's a tragedy and a horrible thing to be prevented from ever happening again.

Still, thank you for taking the time to read my post and pointing out my insensitive writing.
