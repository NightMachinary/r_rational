Ha, ha, ha, ha... You're right about that possible interpretation, but I can easily deal with reading about faceless NPCs being killed off in the background of the story. However, the artwork for the scene in question looks more gory than the scenes for all of the murders Jimmy commits. So even though murder is a worse action to commit, we certainly are more likely to read "The bullet went through his head." than a "His skull shattered as the grey matter of his brain oozed out of the bullet hole." Writers and drawers are rarely so vivid with gruesome scenes unless they are writing/drawing for that specific genre.
