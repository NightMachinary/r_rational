That is my intention, they might do stupid things but not to advance the plot, but because people are prone to errors not just jumping in a volcano because reasons to advance the plot.

The characters all have their own goals and personalities and I do my best to keep them in line with who they are. The world also keeps going without the characters, if someone decides to spend 1 week inside their room the world is still going and things will be happening.

I can't promise it will be 100% rational/ perfect in that regard, because I can end up making mistakes. but I will do my best to keep it as rational as possible.
