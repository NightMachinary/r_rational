Thank you for the feedback!

I do have some plans on how the world is affected by the presence of magic and magical items, but I was worried about overwhelming the reader with worldbuilding lore and making them lose interest.\\
As time goes by (and the number of chapters goes up) I intend to show some more "mundane" use of magic items and how the levels affect the overall workforce and civilian life.

The closest one I can give a tease of will be on her first day off from training, it's time for the Olympics!

Right now, the world feels more mundane because of the low number of explorers. This translates to a low rate of magic items being available to general audiences.

With all that said, the novel will have a really slow pace so it will take some time to show those things. If you feel like this story is too basic, simple or just uninteresting I completely understand if you decide to drop it. But I do appreciate from the bottom of my heart you taking your time to read ang tell me your toughts about it!
