I believe it does, Yes its a LitRPG, but I take a more grounded approach. You can't get a skill by only reading a book you have to actually practice long enough for it to become a skill.

That's just one example, I'm trying to make a novel that doesn't get away with everything and have a more realistic approach.

Being honest part of the reason to post here was so you guys could bite my ear off if I don't manage to do it hahaha
