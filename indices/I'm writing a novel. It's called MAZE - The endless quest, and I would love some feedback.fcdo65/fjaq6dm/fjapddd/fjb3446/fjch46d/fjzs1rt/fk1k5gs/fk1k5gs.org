I gotta say, this is the first critic that made me confused. Not about your point. I get what you are saying.\\
My sentences are a bit too... sticky. I just don't know how to go about improving it. I tried to redo the first five paragraphs but there were very few possible changes.\\
Still, I will keep that in mind for the next chapters. Hopefully I can improve with time.

Thanks for the help!
