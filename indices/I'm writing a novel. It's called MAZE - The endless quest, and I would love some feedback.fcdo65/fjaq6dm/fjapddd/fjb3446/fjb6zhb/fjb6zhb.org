The MAZE is not actually a physical space in the world. It is not like one specific city/country.

Each room is a pocked dimension and together they form the big dimension called MAZE. So bypass it is not possible.

Again this will be explained a bit later on during the training but in broad strokes, the door/portal/gate is a form of teleportation magic.
