Seems fairly generic so far, which is a common failing of the genre. Sure, you've told us that it's a LitRPG setting where everyone has stats and such, and the characters certainly talk like that, but I didn't see any signs of it being a magical world beyond the closed circle of explorers... or indeed, anything that would indicate that the civilian world is anything but perfectly mundane.

If you want to stand out, do something interesting with the premise. Show us what the widespread availability of magic does for the economy. Show us extreme daredevils doing crazy things to level up. Show us crafting powers being used to create an alternative to factories. Show us magically boosted competence outside the traditional adventuring circles. Show us adventurers working in law enforcement, who have to be able to handle magical criminals. Generally, show us why people who aren't adventurers care about adventuring, since if the Maze's effects aren't relevant to the wider mundane world, exploring it is just a weird hobby.
