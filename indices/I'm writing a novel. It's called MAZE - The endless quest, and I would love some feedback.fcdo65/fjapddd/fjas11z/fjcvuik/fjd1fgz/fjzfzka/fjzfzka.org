Wildbow, in Worm, kept notes and then made the changes some time after the last chapter came out. Then he did it again a few weeks before starting the sequel, Ward, to plug up continuity issues.

Some RR stories I follow did it just in the middle of things. In each case the author announced the changes where current readers would be likely to see it.

I wouldn't do it frequently but I've never thought it was a big deal when an author changed things.

APGTE had some reader speculation that whole chunks of the story were going to be removed because a creature that can erase history frim having ever existed became a likely future opponent for the MC.
