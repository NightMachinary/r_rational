That may be true for some serial webnovels & their communities, but I think you'll find [[/r/rational]] much more forgiving. The authors of both r!Animorphs and The Elemental Arena recently made major changes to published chapters, and were universally applauded for it on here. This sub appreciates quality content; I don't think anyone would complain about you putting in effort to improve the quality of your story so long as you make note of it so folks know to go back and reread.
