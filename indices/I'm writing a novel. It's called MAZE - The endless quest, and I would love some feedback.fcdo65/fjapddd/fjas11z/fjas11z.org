Thank you so much for the feedback.

I know my grammar is subpar and I will do my best to improve it. Even if English is not my first language that is no excuse. I just hope everyone can understand the story even with some mistakes.

The reason she quit her job before going there was more an "I'm removing the safety net so I can't give up" mentality. It's an impulse decision and she still needs to realize how much of a risk it was.

Hera is very timid and tries to avoid confrontation. However she never consciously fighting thought about fighint the bouncer. She wanted to stop from being escorted out and call out Helena but her skill activated by accident and that led up to the "fight". But yes, all the options you mentioned were valid things to do, but again in that that she is a bit too hyper to have good judgment. I might have not made this clear enough but since it's a novel sadly I can't go change previous chapters. I will try to make her mindset more transparent to the reader going forward.

For the world-building, question. It's about weapon enchantment and how stats affect the world. If your strenght is high you can deal more damage with melee weapons. But that doesn't translate to firearms.\\
Enchantment and such can change that but they are rare and more expensive. All this will be explained e a bit more details during the training

Thank you very much for the feedback, I will do my best to make the whole world as grounded as possible, even if we are dealing with magic and such.
