I'm kind of leaning toward the homonculi or something tbh. my first thought was that it's definitely related either to Tau's vocation or Egress, but I'm 65% sure Tau isn't in the know (from his darkness in paragon comment, but also it seems like Egress is heavily related to the spirit block), and I don't know how a Praxis vocation would help you resurrect somebody... maybe he took the Oakes from some other reality on the other side of the Spirit Block????? Like Max's dreams.
