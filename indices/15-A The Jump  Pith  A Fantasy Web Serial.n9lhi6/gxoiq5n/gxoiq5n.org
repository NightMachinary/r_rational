  I spent the second night awake, too. Everything felt uncomfortable. The bed, the rocking motion of the ship, my body -- everything. I was still getting used to this new, old form, its obscenely smooth skin, and its new proportions. /Doesn't normally take me this long./

I really appreciate that not only has the story consistently portrayed Nell as having gender dysphoria (and Wes as having gender euphoria, for that matter), it's also been consistent in having her not /recognize/ her gender dysphoria. It's a nice counterpoint to Ana, whose dysphoria was portrayed in a very visceral way and served as her driving motivation. It does a good job of demonstrating how there isn't a singular "trans experience," and I think that's a pretty rare thing to see.

  “Your engagement to the Pakhems is the future of this family. They possess money and influence, and their older children are also fighting in the field. Which means if they die, Samuel will become the sole heir to their fortune and influence.”

Can somebody please just murder this psycho? The world would be a much better place without Admiral Ebbridge in it.

  A tall, broad-shouldered attractive man, with a thick brown beard and biceps that looked ready to burst all his clothes.

  The last time I'd seen that body, it had been blackened, burnt to a shriveled, crispy mess by the Pyre Witch, its hand still clutching a pitch-black rapier.

  “Professor Oakes?” I half-shouted. “/You're alive?/”

I don't trust this for a fucking second. I have no idea what's going on, but I refuse to believe that Oakes survived, I refuse to believe they'd let the senile headmaster come to the battlefront, I refuse to believe they'd let Oakes have a picnic in plain sight of any wandering soldier when his survival is supposed to be a top secret, and I refuse to believe they'd let Nell go without mindwiping her. Any one of those things in isolation you could probably explain away, but all of them? Nope. No way.
