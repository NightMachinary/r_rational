A little late, but the thing that bothers me most about pith is the complete inability of characters to consider body swapping despite it occurring so often. Anabelle swapped in the beginning, Radio Man was forcefully swapped, Ana and Wes saw the collection of glass brains, Maxine Clive apparently lives for body swapping (even though she isn't a projector), Jun swapped with his father, Grace was going to swap with Ana to fake her death, Commonwealth swapped to get an infiltrator into Paragon, etc. And yet everyone is always astonished!!! Even though it can be initiated forcefully!

Furthermore, how do you even tell people apart when they're in the same designer bodies?

It feels unrealistic without any limits on it and nobody having secret signals or codes to prevent infiltration, other than the secret, rare pith signatures of Paragon.

Queen Sulpher constantly feels like a group of punchers in a world controlled by mentalists and it's hard to believe some whisper specialist hasn't casually mind controlled them yet.

Anyway, I agree that the whole Sebastian survived thing is ridiculous, but I'm taking it at face value for now because it fits with how body swapping has been treated in this series as a whole.

I still read it, though, because the quality and mysteries are so much better than the average serial I check out.
