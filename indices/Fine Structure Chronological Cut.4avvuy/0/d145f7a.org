I haven't reread /Fine Structure/ in far too long, but it stands as maybe one of the most enjoyable things I ever remember reading. (Maybe because I happened to read it alongside the Sequences, but I digress.) Very much looking forward to this edit!

And hell, maybe this has motivated me to finish Ra tonight. It's only 11:50, and school starts at 7:30 tomorrow ... I have time.
