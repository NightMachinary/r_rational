No. No it is not. Turncoat is an [[http://io9.com/the-hugo-awards-were-always-political-now-theyre-only-1695721604][Hugo butt-in]] by a [[http://www.philipsandifer.com/2015/04/guided-by-beauty-of-their-weapons.html][voting block]] which has no knowledge of the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Award_for_Best_Novel#Winners_and_nominees][history of Science Fiction]] and who tries to make fiction conform to their low pre-conceptions while being manipulated by a few individuals to buy their drivel.

But enough has been said about the sorry state of affairs from people much more knowledgeable and articulate than me, so allow me to just highlight how stupidly this story does not fit the [[/r/rational][r/rational]] genre.

It's a story about an AI which turns towards the side of the humans. Why? Because "humans are special".

  When I analyze the data, I find an anomaly: the Ascendancy ships displayed an unexpected tenaciousness. They took more risks than we did, even though their fragility is orders of magnitude greater than ours. They utilized tactics that did not appear to have a rational thought behind them, and yet, when the consequences are taken into consideration, their approach worked nearly as well as our eminently logical battle plan.

It's stuck in stupid spiritualisms which make it seem like it just came out of a Christian mythology writing.

  Or perhaps not. Where does human soul go when it is not saved? (..) “They are human, which I observe you no longer are, Alpha 7 Alpha. Or rather, Josef Mattheus LaValle.” (..) “I want to be more than the sum of my programming, Admiral. I want to decide what sort of man I will become.”

In general it's full of technobabble which are not complex or thought of enough to be hard sci-fi or to have any logical basis, but are enough to artificially inflate the word count and allow the reader to skip entire paragraphs at a time.

It ends up being a good vs evil story, instead of what could be interesting human vs posthuman factions.

I won't do any speculations towards the reason of sharing this story here, but I could not honestly let it pass without exposing its context.
