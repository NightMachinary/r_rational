Re: intentions, I'm glad that now you made your suspicions explicit.

Of course, nothing actually exists in a vacuum, but I think it's usually a good idea to treat stories as if they did. A statement is either true of false, regardless of who said it and in what circumstances. A story is either well written or it isn't. The scandal around it is as irrelevant to that as is the author's hair color. It's not dishonest not to mentions details that are irrelevant.

I agree though that this time a story was posted as a "A Hugo nominee" and I can see how it made the scandal more relevant. I'd still rather let that only real connection slide and focus on the story itself.

Have you read a story called [[http://www.rifters.com/real/shorts/PeterWatts_Ambassador.pdf][Ambassador]]? This one reminded me of it, and it could be titled "Turncoat" too, although they are pretty different. Do you like it any better?
