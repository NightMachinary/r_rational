I for one find the mention of the scandal important, withholding information from other possible readers regarding the social surrounding of this story would have been dishonest from my part.

Regarding my final phrase, actually it was a way of saying that while not seeing anything that would allow me to take a conclusion regarding the reason of the posting of the story, the way it was suddenly posted raises concerns which although not definite are suspect for someone like me who has seen a lot of spam regarding this across the last few weeks.

Regarding a "story is just a story", that hardly applies when stories do not exist in a vacuum but in a cultural context, and especially here when it was posted as "A Hugo nominee". If a story has the right of presenting itself by the associated cultural points which it considers as positive, then I as a reader have a right to criticize within those same points or other similar ones.
