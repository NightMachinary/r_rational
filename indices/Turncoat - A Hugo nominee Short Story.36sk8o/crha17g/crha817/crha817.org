I agree with your criticism of the story and I am not a big fan of it (I think it's ok with some annoying bits), but I think it was unnecessary to mention the scandal around it.

Well then, in that case don't do any speculations. Simply don't say a word about them. Saying "I won't do any speculations, but..." is like saying "I won't call you a liar, but..." It's a way to accuse while pretending not to, to have your cake and eat it, too.

A story is just a story. Let it stand or fall on its own merits. I think it's not that great. The fact that it got nominated for bad (?) reasons is not relevant and doesn't make it worse.
