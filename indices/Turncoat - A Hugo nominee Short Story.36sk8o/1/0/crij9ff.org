Ignoring the politics, I was underwhelmed. I suspect that both MacLeod and Weber could have done a much better job writing the same story.

The whole thing was written fairly mediocrily- the AI's awkward, stilted descriptions ("The weapons techs are dutiful in their diligence."), the hamfisted "the uploaded claim to be better than humanity but they're really just jerks", odd numbering schemes to stand out ("30 decasecs", instead of 3 kilosecs, only halfway through the story they switch to kiloseconds), plot inconsistencies (this is a 42nd generation AI, so why do the AIs and uploaded not understand how the other thinks? AIs have refused orders before, so why would the idea that this one did so shocking?)

Un-ignoring politics, it seems this story got nominated because "ra-ra humanity", rather than its merits. I'd be disappointed if I read it in one of those gigantic "Best SF of 2014" anthologies.
