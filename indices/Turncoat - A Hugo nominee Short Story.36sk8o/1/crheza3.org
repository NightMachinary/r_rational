Fifty years ago this story would have been a marvel, but these days you can't just write a story that looks like a pastiche of Ken MacLeod and David Weber and expect people to be wowed. The writing craft was also weak in several places - we almost get introduced to a bunch of humans who it turns out we don't care about, the protagonist's artificialness is conveyed incredibly clumsily, there's too much technobabbly explosions and not enough examination of the consequences of technological gaps, etc.

Normally I'd hold my tongue, but I feel like something is going wrong if this is somewhat up voted on this sub.

EDIT: reading other comments, is it politics? Or did people just enjoy the Ken MacLeod - David Weber mishmash and upvote based on that? I hope for the latter but fear the former.
