Thanks, the articles you linked to were a good skim. That doesn't devalue the works, but if I was more aware of the issue, I probably wouldn't have included the 'Hugo nominee' part of the title.

Anyway, I don't think the work was as spiritual as you make it sound. It is pointed out that the posthumans kept a lot of garbage from their human roots, and thus weren't as rational/efficient as they could've been, which explains everything else for me.
