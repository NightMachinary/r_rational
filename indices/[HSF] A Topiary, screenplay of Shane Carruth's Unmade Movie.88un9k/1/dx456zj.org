Just finished it. Took me a while to read, it's pretty long, but holy *shit*. I'm so sad it's on pause--here's hoping he gets the money for it someday. The movie in my mind's eye was breathtaking, I feel like I could see every single detail. WARNING: Spoilers ahead.

What was the connection between the two parts? Acre and Amanda constructed an image of the kids in the forest, but what was the link between the glints/Apologue/amber liquid and the flowers/Choruses? They didn't seem to be part of the same alien life cycle--maybe the glints were another alien race trying to warn humanity about the Choruses?

The adult campers weren't supposed to be the group from the first part, were they? I assume they were deaf because of repeated amputation of flower fingers, reinforcing that they weren't as clever (a recurring word/theme) or inventive as the kids.

Even if there aren't answers, that was fucking spectacular. I'm firmly convinced he's up there with the best filmmakers of all time.
