Very glad that you read it and enjoyed it so.

I think the first Flower made on earth came from the structure traced out by the Apologue.

My thinking of it was that the glints /were/ the Choruses, just in a latent, mere patterned, unformed state. I saw the whole series of steps from glints to bifurcations to poems to the apologue to the flowers to petals, funnels, choruses etc all as part of the same "life"cycle (if you will) of this alien yet universal structure / tendency in the universe. Something closer to entropy. Why warn humanity with the glints if the glints are literally the instruction set to make the choruses?

I think you're right on, the adult group at the end is very likely some offshoot of the original group, and yes they are very likely deaf from repeated flower finger amputation. It's interesting, this relationship with following the pattern and letting its structure determine your actions (which may not in fact align with your best interests, as the repeated icing of civilizations across the universe reveals) versus constraining the behavior of the pattern with the black box or the ape's black cylinders, which keeps them in check, and though it appears inelegant, has forethought in it that is absent in the blind following of pattern.

You should definitely post some of these thoughts to [[/r/atopiary]] or [[/r/shanecarruth]], I know there are people there who, if they see your post, would love to engage.

This script is so beautiful to me and I'm glad that you've found that beauty too.
