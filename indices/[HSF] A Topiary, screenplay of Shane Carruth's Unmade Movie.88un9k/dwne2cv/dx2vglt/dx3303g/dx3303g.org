Honestly it's very difficult to get people to read screenplays, any screenplay. For some reason there is a barrier there. In my experience even people who are regular readers are reluctant to read them. The only people who seem to read them routinely are people in the industry, or people who aspire to be in the industry.

The only success I've had is is you can tell the person that it's an unmade film from an author or director they are a fan of. So in this case if they are fans of /Primer/ or /Upstream Color/ your battle is half won. Just tell them this is the Carruth film they haven't seen and the only way they are going to get to see it is to read this. If they haven't seen those then just get them to see them first, it's much easier to convince someone to watch a movie.
