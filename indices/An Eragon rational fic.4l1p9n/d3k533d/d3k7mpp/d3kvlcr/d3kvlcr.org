Reading the last book felt like a prison sentence, and it was only out of some newly-discovered masochism that I gritted my teeth and pressed forward to the ending, which was like a small dollop of shit at the bottom of a mug of dishwater -- one final insult that you suddenly realize has been tainting the previous experience all along, but makes said experience even worse in retrospect.
