Oh man, I would read the heck out of something like that.

Also, I'm glad someone else shares my utter disillusionment with the last book or 2 of that series. So many threads not just left untied, but totally ignored and ruined. FOr one example: Lets build up Roran as the leader of the people over and over again, and clearly groom him to be the next king, and then... nothing.

I tell my friends "Just don't read the last book, and imagine that the series was just never finished. you'd be happier that way." Similar to my advice to all dune books after the first (besides for the good scene in the third where he's struck blind).
