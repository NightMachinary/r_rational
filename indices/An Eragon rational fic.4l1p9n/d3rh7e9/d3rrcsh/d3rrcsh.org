This was extremely interesting and helpful. I'm worldbuilding at the moment, and I have to confess I'm encountering some difficulties:

-Shaping believable conflict when you can force people to tell the truth, or even do things, is extremely difficult. Torturing the truth out of people would be exceedingly simple, because you would always know when they tell you the truth and how much they know, so secrets would be more valuable than loyalty, and would be reasonably used as an exchange value.

-Nobody sensible would use the truth-language as everyday language, I think (tell me if you find a way to make this work in any believable society).

-You could bound people easily against their will, and a moderately moral ruler would use this ability to compel citizens to respect the law, or at least to behave in a way that they truly believe to be moral. Most people would not even understand how they are bound. If you make them recite it forcibly as a prayer, or an oath, in a generation you'd achieve a good approximation of a somewhat utopian society, or incredibly distopian, whatever. It's not believable that nobody would use such a technique. I'll have to make it run somehow.

-If raiders are mostly moral and righteous people (at the moment of the hatching, since the dragonling chooses the rider) there is no reasonable way that they would be anything but a power of good, and both conflict and the whole "Galbatorix thinks they are corrupt" story are thrown out of the window. Maybe I've managed to figure this one out, though.

-Dragons that know a lot about physics, that have spent years meditating about things and more power than everyone around, sided by knowledgeable warriors with decades of experience get defeated by the new guy who's gone crazy and his twelve EVIL!lackeys? Improbable. Maybe something can be managed though, we'll see.

-In the Eragon universe it's not just easy to cheat, there is a spreadsheet with cheat-codes ready for anyone to grab.

  The "Galbatorix is good because he keeps humanity on top" is another option, but there's not much struggle there, since in regular canon the only thing stopping him from destroying all of his enemies (aside from because plot) is I believe hubris.

I'll try to avoid plot-powered behaviour when possible.
