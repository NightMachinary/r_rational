Since it sounds like you're interested in writing a fic, here's what I thought of while reading over this thread:

The problem Paolini ran into (which I'm okay with considering he started writing the story at like 13) is that Galbatorix was the ultimate badass who by the rules of canon couldn't really be defeated. There's no way for that fight to end with Eragon defeating Galbatorix without a deus ex machina. Yeah, it's Star Wars, but at least in SW the power difference could be overcome by in-system rules: Luke was trained by the best, and he was a Skywalker. Not the case in a system where power grows with age and power can be stored.

So if I were going to go rational I'd do this: from the moment Galbatorix' first dragon was slain, he was living on borrowed time. /Everyone/ knows he's going to die, and the factions are preparing for the wars that follow. This would be the first one or two arcs.

I would make Eragon the capable student of the rationalist Brom, who learned rationalism (it would be called something else, of course,) as the philosophy of the dragon riders. Because magic is what you say is what you get, "[whatever they call rationalism]" was necessary for optimal spellcasting. Murtagh would be the thematically and canonically appropriate successor for Galbatorix, and I'd remove familial connections, cuz they were shoehorned in not to mention terribly cliche.

I'd also buff regular spellcasters, probably by making them capable of pulling energy out of the environment. I don't know physics, so there could be even better ways for a non-Dragon Rider spellcaster to keep their energy stores high. I'd probably make Roran such a spellcaster.

But none of that is essential except for in my opinion Galbatorix' impending death and everyone knowing he's about to die. The "Galbatorix is good because he keeps humanity on top" is another option, but there's not much struggle there, since in regular canon the only thing stopping him from destroying all of his enemies (aside from because plot) is I believe hubris.
