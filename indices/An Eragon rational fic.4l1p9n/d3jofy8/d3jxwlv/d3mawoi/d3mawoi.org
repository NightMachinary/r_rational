That's my exact point; is it really wise to kill the immortal god-emperor keeping your race on top, and then not replace him? In the books Eragon kills Galbatorix and then just bounces, and I can't see that ending well for humans if he doesn't come back soon, especially considering your other points about the Urgals.
