Humans aren't that badly off. Elves are tied to dragons, and therefore had a massive, glaring vulnerability (considering that dragons, while powerful, would be incredibly vulnerable to more modern weaponry) and as such their birth rates were incredibly low. Dwarves were doing pretty well for themselves, but would still be out-bred and out-fought in a war. Urgals and humans are similarly pretty equal; Urgals are stronger, but humans seem to have better mages.
