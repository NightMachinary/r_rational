Elves have barely any children. Humanity could repopulate after a massive war that wipes out most of the men of fighting age in under a century - look at WW1 and WW2, for example - while elves would lose due to long-term attrition.

Dwarves seem to suffer from a lack of mobility. If I were fighting against them I'd just lay siege and keep them trapped in their mountain fortresses. They don't have cavalry or dragon riders, so they can't launch fast assaults, and they aren't that fast on foot either. As per canon, a whole Dwarven clan was almost wiped out due to a single dragon attack.

Humans have more to worry about from Urgals, who can keep even in numbers and are physically stronger. They're weak due to infighting during the main story, but (to use examples from real-world history) the Mongols were a bunch of small tribes that fought each other until they were united, and then proceeded to conquer lands from [[http://i.stack.imgur.com/lvi3p.jpg][Russia to the Middle East to China]] once a strong leader rose up and stopped the interclan wars.

Note that I don't necessarily think that human supremacy would be a good thing - any species' elimination would be very bad, but I don't think humans are the most likely victims.
