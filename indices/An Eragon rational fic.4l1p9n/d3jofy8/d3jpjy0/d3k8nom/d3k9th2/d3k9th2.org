Depends. I want to try doing a small gedanken. Suppose people find a way to prevent certain combinations of genes from occurring, as a way of preventing autism (as a hypothetical example here). Would you want to stop people from using it? In this example people with autism share some distinctive combinations of genes. Is preserving those combinations a terminal value? What about schizophrenia? What about low IQ? Where do you draw the line and say "I don't care that this combination of genes leads to suboptimal outcomes for carriers, I value it for its own sake and want it to continue being present in the gene pool"?

Personally, I don't really value how parts of DNA are arranged. I don't even care whether the minds are instantiated on a biological computer or not. I'd want to preserve the parts of human culture I care about, certainly, but I don't really give a damn about preserving the species in any real biological sense.
