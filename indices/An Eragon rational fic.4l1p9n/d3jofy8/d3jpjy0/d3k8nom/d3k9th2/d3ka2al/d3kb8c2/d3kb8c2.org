  The real value, I guess, is increasing diversity.
#+end_quote

I care way more about cultural diversity than biological one. For me, biological diversity only matters insofar as it is needed for minimising certain risks and opening new avenues for cultural diversity, so it's not a terminal value. But let's leave that (and also the morality of forcing future minds to run on comparatively worse hardware) aside for a moment.

I don't think that preserving the poorly performing hardware/wetware configurations is good way to increase diversity in the first place. I'd rather look to create new and exciting offshoots that perform better than their ancestors. So if we're talking about positive-value genes, then I'd say I wouldn't mind to see them preserved, but I'd much rather see them replaced by new and even better-performing combinations. I mean, suppose you eliminate all the "negative-value" combinations (it's a poorly defined thing, but you get my meaning). Sooner or later a new mutation comes along, that's just so good, that some of the old "positive-value" combinations perform poorly compared to it and become "negative-value". Do you remove them from gene-pool now? If so, then you're basically already genetically engineering your way forward. It's pretty much an inevitable consequence of "negative-value" and "positive-value" being comparative based on performance in real world. There is no other objective marker that says which combinations are worthy of being preserved and which ones are not.

I don't rightly know why I've typed all of that out, but it's there now, so I might as well post it. I guess I just wanted to keep playing with the thought experiment.
