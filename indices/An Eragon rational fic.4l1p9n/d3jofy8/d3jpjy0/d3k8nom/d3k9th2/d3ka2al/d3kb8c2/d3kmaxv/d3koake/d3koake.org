Well, there is simply a difference in values then. For me, biodiversity is useful instrumentally, for the sake of lowering the damage a single pandemic could inflict, for example, but I don't really see it as the goal in itself. I also agree that it's useful instrumentally in increasing cultural variation as well. I just don't see the appeal of biodiversity for its own sake. Hell, even cultural diversity is mostly instrumental for me.

It's been a while since I read Eragon, so I don't actually remember that much of what the cultures/societies of elves and dwarves look live. But if, hypothetically, humans were likely to be outcompeted into extinction/irrelevance, and the resulting elvish and dwarfish society would then simply stagnate until some existential catastrophe takes them out, then I'd surely be all for helping humans even at the expense of elves and dwarves. If, on the other hand, elves and dwarves are psychologically similar to humans, but perform better because they're smarter, or more conscientious, or more magically gifted, then I wouldn't particularly care about humans loosing out.

A separate issue here is that I don't really see a likely way for a whole human race (in the books) to go extinct/irrelevant in a painless way (I guess some kind of Amish scenario maybe?). If we're talking about the last of the race starving in privation or being hunted down and killed, then I'd want to put a stop to that for reasons entirely unrelated to any kind of diversity.
