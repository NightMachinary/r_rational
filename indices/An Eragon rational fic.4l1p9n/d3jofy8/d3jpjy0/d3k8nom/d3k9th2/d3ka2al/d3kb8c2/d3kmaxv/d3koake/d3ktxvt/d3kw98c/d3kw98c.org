Pretty much the same way biological one is. As one epidemic can cripple a very homogeneous population, one complex of memes can cripple a homogeneous culture. The benefits are inherent in any diversification: not putting all eggs in one basket, so to speak.

If your values involve avoiding stagnation, decline and extinction of intelligent species, then diversification will be instrumentally valuable to some degree simply because it minimises some of the risks.
