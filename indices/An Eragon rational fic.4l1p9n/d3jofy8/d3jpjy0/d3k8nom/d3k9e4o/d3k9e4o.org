For the sake of diversity alone, I suppose there could be some utility in keeping a test tube somewhere. But even environmentalists don't generally go so far as to sabotage other species to save a species that is legitimately out-competed in its own ecosystem. It really, really is just natural selection (to the extent that anything having to do with sentients is really "natural").
