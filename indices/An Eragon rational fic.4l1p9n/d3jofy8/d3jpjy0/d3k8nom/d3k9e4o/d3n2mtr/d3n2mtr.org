  But even environmentalists don't generally go so far as to sabotage other species to save a species that is legitimately out-competed in its own ecosystem.

Oh you'd be surprised. Or at least by how some environmentalists would define "legitimate competition in an ecosystem".

Edit: Couldn't find that article I remember from years ago that had environmentalists call for the shooting on sight of grizzly-polar bear hybrids in order to preserve the local ecosystem and protect the original grizzly bears. But [[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/07/140717-spotted-owls-barred-shooting-logging-endangered-species-science/][this article]] about shooting a species of better adapted owls in order to protect an endangered one essentially also shows what I'm on about.
