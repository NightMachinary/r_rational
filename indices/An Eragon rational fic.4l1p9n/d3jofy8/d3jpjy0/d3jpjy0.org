  This is perfect, not only because of the ideas already presented, but also because of this; in a world where basically every other race seems to do everything better than plain bland humans (dwarves make better weapons and armour and are stocky and strong and have tons of bad ass stuff and elves are immortal and better) and you were a rational human hero who had to consider the future of your race against other races who, in a rational fic, would have to have proper rational reasons against not just outcompeting humanity until we were stuck on the worst pitches of land (basically confined to villages like the one Eragon comes from)... would it really be wise to get rid of the guy keeping your species on top, and not replace him?

  Rational Eragon should end with the hero finding someway to stop humans from getting curb stomped in the future, or should start with the races a bit more... balanced.

Reformatted for readability.

Personally, I don't and wouldn't really care about humanity as such all that much. Most of the people I actually like are humans, and I don't want anything bad to happen to them, but I have no particular fondness for their great-great-grandchildren in preference to someone else's great-great-grandchildren. In the long term, I see nothing wrong with replacing humanity with something better. A world full of people objectively superior in every way to modern humans is a better outcome than an otherwise identical world containing humans but proportionally fewer superior beings. The preservation of humanity for it's own sake rather than for any particular valuable quality it possesses just seems kind of racist (speciest?).
