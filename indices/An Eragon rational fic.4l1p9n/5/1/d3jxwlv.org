Humans stayed on top because they got the first immortal god-emperor with no scruples. Elves have immortal nobility, but they were very much sane and unwilling to kill indsicriminately (due to their memories of the dragon war). Dwarves aren't immortal, are slightly agoraphobic, don't have nearly as much magic, and see no reason to leave their mountains. While stronger than humans, they are also slower due to their stature, so they do lose out in battle for the most part. Both elves and dwarves also reproduce more slowly than humans, meaning that they must pick their battles.

No, the real question is why the urgals didn't conquer everything. They wouldn't be able to penetrate the elven forests, but they are faster and stronger than humans and reproduce at a similar clip. They don't seem any less intelligent, but they do lack organization, so that could be it.
