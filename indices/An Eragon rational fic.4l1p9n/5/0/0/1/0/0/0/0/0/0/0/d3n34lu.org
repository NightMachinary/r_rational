  If your values involve avoiding stagnation, decline and extinction of intelligent species, then diversification will be instrumentally valuable to some degree simply because it minimises some of the risks.

But if you don't value the preservation of any one intelligent species then why would that matter? Or did you consider elves/dwarves/humans to all be one species for the sake of your argument?

One way or the other it seems that we should keep the human species in Eragon alive and competitive just on the off-chance that someone manages to cast a "kill-all-elves" spell or some such.
