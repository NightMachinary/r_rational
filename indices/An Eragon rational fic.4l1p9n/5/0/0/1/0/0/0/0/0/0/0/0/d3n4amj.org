  But if you don't value the preservation of any one intelligent species then why would that matter? Or did you consider elves/dwarves/humans to all be one species for the sake of your argument?
#+end_quote

I don't really care about any particular species surviving. What I do care about is that at least one of them survives and continues to advance. Doesn't particularly matter which one, as long as they have sufficiently palatable culture. Having several different ones is useful so that at least one is more likely to survive.

  One way or the other it seems that we should keep the human species in Eragon alive and competitive just on the off-chance that someone manages to cast a "kill-all-elves" spell or some such.

Depends on how costly that will be and how likely someone non-human is to invent a "kill-all-elves" spell. Hypothetically, if keeping humans competitive eats up so much resources that it cripples the development of dwarves, and the risk of sudden species-wide extinction is sufficiently small, then it might not be worth it. There is really no one general high-level rule that tells you whether it's worthwhile to pay diversification costs or not. You just have to calculate the risks and costs on case-by-case basis and make decisions that way.

In this particular case, I'd probably settle on keeping a smallish population of humans alive and healthy if they're being outcompeted, just in case. Not that I've really given it enough thought to actually make such decisions, since I don't remember the situation in Eragon all that well.
