  I don't rightly know why I've typed all of that out, but it's there now, so I might as well post it. I guess I just wanted to keep playing with the thought experiment.

It's fun anyway, so I'm in. One objection that could be made to your reasoning is that you must be at least somewhat in disagreement with the majority of the human race, since they pretty much unanimously concur that the loss of a specie is a bad thing. Biodiversity is a value to increase, to refine my statement further. If this value is good enough for animals, there's no reason why it shouldn't also apply to more complex beings as humans/elves/dwarves/dragons. In a way, I think it may depend from the fact that the "randomisation of the cognitive pattern" implied in natural reproduction (excluding nurturing for a minute) is a very good way to ensure cultural diversity. Or point-of-view diversity, whatever. You could possibly reproduce such randomisation in a lab, but you would be engineering whole minds then, and if by that point you haven't your ethics already figured out...
