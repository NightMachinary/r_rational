I thought canon Animorphs had a reasonably engaging plot and characters, ignoring the shitty filler books. The real problems (which The Reckoning largely addresses) are the stupidity of the antagonists and the abuse of every scifi trope out there(time travel, Atlantis, space gods, etc) when the only ones needed to tell the story are aliens, FTL, and morphing.

I really enjoy The Reckoning, but I'm not sure even it goes far enough on how effective the Yeerks should really be. Every person you infest infests their entire family the next night while they're sleeping. You infest the president by infesting friends of Secret Service agents' children, inviting the children over for sleepovers and infesting them, infest the agents, then they infest the president. I can't think of a way the Yeerks don't win inside of six months, with no convoluted plans for the Animorphs to sabotage.
