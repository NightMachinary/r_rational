Hmm. I wouldn't call it a Chekhov's gun, because its usefulness was recognised as soon as it was discovered, and it was deliberately carried along for that purpose.

If someone's hunting rifle is hanging on the wall, but not being used, then we can expect an attack from a bear, which needs to be shot, or a horrible accident where someone shoots themselves; to me, that's what Chekhov's Gun is about. If someone deliberately takes a gun from the wall in chapter 1 to go hunting, that's just a regular gun.
