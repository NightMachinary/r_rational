Man, I had many long discussions with a friend about the world of Eragon. It's... actually pretty coherent. You can amass power and store it in containers to be used at will, so the world is dominated by a tyrant who has amassed ALL the magic. Wizard themselves are extremely powerful, but vulnerable to concentrated assault, so they avoid fighting alone and stay behind legions of soldiers. You can make people swear binding oaths by having a wizard find their true name, so the Empire's legions are made of sworn conscripts.

Pity the actual story is a re-hash of Star Wars with a dumb protagonist, under-exploited side characters and a villain so powerful he could not be plausibly defeated without a deus ex machina. Also, prophecies. Stories with prophecies all suck, or at least would be better off without any prophecy (Methods of Rationality being the one exception). Eragon in particular had prophecies that came out of nowhere, acted as significant spoilers for the intrigue, and didn't have any actual impact on the story.

I agree that there's probably some potential for a rational fic here.
