It's been years but the Eragon fanfiction written by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/908750/Opifex-the-Singer][this author]] were pretty decent. Most of them follow each other and focus on OC dragons and King Galby which, in my opinion, makes them all the more compelling. Not particularly rational, but they are intelligently written, from what I remember.

In particular, the story /From White to Black/, which is longer than the others it relates to, tells Galbatorix's backstory pretty much from childhood to where he ended up in the books. It's not canon compliant (as most of the works were written before book 3 came out) but it is very entertaining and really makes you understand just how Galbatorix could possibly have become what he was in the novels. Especially considering that most of what we know of him in canon in the first two books is filtered through what is essentially propaganda. This author's work really highlights that.
