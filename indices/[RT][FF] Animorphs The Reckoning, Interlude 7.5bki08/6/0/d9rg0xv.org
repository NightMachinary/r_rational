Hi, Erek! It's been an honor to be your ghost-autobiography-writer.

The first element you're curious about is likely to appear at some point, but possibly it'll be someone else. The Taxxons will certainly reappear, but probably not in a huge way (I'm imagining more like they'll get a big spotlight in one or two chapters).
