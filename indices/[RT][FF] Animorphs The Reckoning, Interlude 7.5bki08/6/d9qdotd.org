I registered a reddit account just now for the sole purpose of saying that the Chee were one of the things I liked a lot about the original books, and that I strongly endorse what you are doing with them in this story. There are a couple of other elements I'm happy to see and am assuming you are going to continue to use, such as the stuff with the Arn, so the main other element I am looking to find out more about is whether [[#s][sp]], and also whether the Taxxons get any sort of big role because I'm not sure I've seen more than one good Taxxon fanfic.
