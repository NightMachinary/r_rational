Yeah, I think Chee are mostly deontological.

If you have definite knowledge of a specific act of violence, you must act to prevent it, as long as preventing it would not involve greater violence. If you have vague knowledge that violence is /probably/ happening somewhere over there, there's no such imperative. (IIRC Erek has mentioned this distinction.) Heck, you'll probably /avoid/ that area to avoid being forced into a fight.

Chee aren't violence-minimisers. They're more like humans, with (it looks like in this interlude) a Censor bolted on that derails their train of thought and/or revert them to a backup if they even consider breaking The Rules.

Think a cross between HPMOR's Unbreakable Vow and [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/8o6/the_gift_we_give_tomorrow_spoken_word_finished/5d9f][the contract-drafting em song]].
