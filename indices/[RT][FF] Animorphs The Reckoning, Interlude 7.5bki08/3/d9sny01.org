Chee are going further and further into blue/orange morality territory, not just hyper pacifist. I wonder if a blackmail situation like in the last book of canon is feasible, probably not given they are so smart.

The "censor" and other parts of their internal dialogue reminds me a lot of the way the minds worked in Max Harm's excellent "Crystal Society."

Their limiting of information makes a big difference. We cannot be sure of anything they have been saying to the protagonists that has not been explicitly confirmed in their internal monologue. Its very possible they know far more than they are letting on.

Given their tech it would be easy for them to have people on the yeerk ships. And I wouldn't be surprised given the canon connection with ellimist if they know more about the war in heaven than any of the characters. Elfanger and V3 were able to notice it in only one lifetime, they've been active for thousands of years and seem to be exponentially more intelligent. Maybe a twist like in [[#s][spoiler for a Vernor Vinge book]]
