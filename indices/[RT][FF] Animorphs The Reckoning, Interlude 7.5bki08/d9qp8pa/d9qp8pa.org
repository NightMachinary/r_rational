I like that the Chee have disagreements with each other, and are less collectivist than Andalite or Yeerks, though this is an odd choice for AIs given that Aumann's Agreement Theorem exists. It can be rationalized, though. I'm imagining a system where each Chee is assigned a random number that corresponds to the position they should argue for, allowing them to effectively explore all regions of argument-possibility space at least approximately. That doesn't quite fit with what we were shown in this chapter, but can be reconciled with it if the values are assigned at "birth" and correspond to the individual Chee's personality, or something like personality. All possible coherent dog lovers are given their fair say in the parliament of Chee (provided their values and methods are acceptably narrowly similar to the restraints imposed by their creators).
