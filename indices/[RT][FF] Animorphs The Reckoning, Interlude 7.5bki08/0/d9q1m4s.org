  Chee #1: Maybe we should accept his offer?

  Chee #2: WTF? He almost killed three hundred thousand dogs!

Also, I find this part interesting:

  [Erek] and [Rictic] are dissatisfied, but they agree.

I already noticed that Chee interacting with humans displayed a better sense of priorities, tactics, and awareness of the outside world than Chee communicating with each other. I'm starting to wonder if maybe Chee that stay in a human social setting could start "imprinting" on humans, and notice they have moral relevance the same way the Yeerks did? Erek did say something about his understanding of human suffering being learned. On the other hand, maybe I'm just pattern-matching human psychology to alien minds.
