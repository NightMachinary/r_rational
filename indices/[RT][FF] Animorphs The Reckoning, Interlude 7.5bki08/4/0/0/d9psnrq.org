I think it's also flawed xenopsychology to think that honesty is associated with respect for life. Yes, that's true for humans, but why should it be true in general?

For instance, do you think vegetarians are more honest than meat eaters? Should the Chee trust the word of humans from dog-loving cultures more than dog-eating cultures?

Well, on second thought, maybe vegetarians /would/ more honest than meat eaters if they were speaking to the source of their meat. I suppose you might view honesty as on a highly general "tendency to cooperate/defect" spectrum.
