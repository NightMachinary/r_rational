I gave up on it partway through. He started off being deliberately offensive in order to make a point, then immediately showed that it wasn't just a literary device by saying:

  Now, let me be frank; I'm probably more experienced than most people who speak regularly around here with making arguments, and arguing, whether it's to dismantle the other's points, to show them points they did not consider, to try and have a dialogue, or just to win by "points". I may be smarter than most people, but I'm not smart or experienced enough to teach all of you how to actually have a discussion.

He then goes off on a long ramble in which he tries to teach us how to have a discussion, but there's no framing -- I don't know where he's going, although it seems like he's restating his initial, deliberately offensive, point in wordier and less directly offensive but more patronizing language.

After a few paragraphs I gave up. Did he eventually get to a point, or did it just boil down to "if you want to have a productive discussion you need to be nice to each other, willing to really listen, and willing to admit that you're wrong"?
