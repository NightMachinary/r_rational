While he's apparently smarter than that person he is also abysmal at writing long posts and has a lot of irrational arguments dotted around here and there.

Let's summarize, paragraph by paragraph.

1.  I am smarter than you.

2.  This is relative, in that you are more stupid and I am more smart.

3.  The typical exchange is a smarter person explains stuff to a stupider person who can't reason through stuff.

4.  If the gap is too large you can't educate.

5.  I deliberately riled you up.

6.  This is what I imagine goes through people's mind when others explain stuff.

7.  This is why people like appeals to authorities, because it makes them feel good,and why people hate them, because they can't attack them.

8.  I can't teach you how to have a discussion despite being smarter, it took my entire life (first really iffy proposition, you can certainly pass on tips...)

9.  Why am I doing this? I've had bad discussions on this subreddit.

10. Discussing stuff to sharpen your wits indicates you are immature. (as a mod of [[/r/changemyview]] I disagree, immaturity is independent from your purpose in a discussion, I haven't seen any real correlation).

11. Devils advocates are bad. People who believe conversation is for consensus are bad.

12. They are uneducated as research shows that arguments just entrench your position (not really a full and accurate view of the research. [[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1551-6709.2011.01210.x/abstract;jsessionid=8923C5D3BA24331DCE7025FC9F05406E.f03t02?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&userIsAuthenticated=false]] [[http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1981-01285-001]] people can be and are persuaded by strong arguments when they have personal involvement and time to consider. They don't change their mind on short timescales though without emotional involvement.

13. People are clueless because you can't have debates while arguing over semantics.

14. Discussions are there to express your view, not to win or lose arguments. (this varies massively from person to person, the whole next part of the discussion is mostly personal view).

15. Devil's advocate viewers are cheating as they aren't expressing their view and he doesn't like this.

16. Devil's advocate viewers use imaginary internet points to win and so are frustrating as they just try to find the best argument to win imaginary internet points and massage their ego.

17. Err... what is he trying to say here? Something about discourse helping you? He doesn't really define his terms despite his self admitted purpose of sharing experiences.

18. Devil's advocate arguers are young and frustrating and get mad easily and eventually get bored and stop being devil's advocate arguers. They also don't address your arguments.

19. They are shitty to debate with because they are selfish and lack empathy.

20. To be a devil's advocate person requires empathy and knowledge.

21. To change views ask questions rather than imparting knowledge and respect people (yeah, that's vague)

22. Agree to disagree is good because you don't waste your precious resources of time and will.

23. Why write this? Hope springs eternal.

24. I hope this improves things.

A long rambling and disorganized post that is mostly focused along a stereotyped view of devil's advocate people as young, annoying, lacking empathy and knowledge and some false research.
