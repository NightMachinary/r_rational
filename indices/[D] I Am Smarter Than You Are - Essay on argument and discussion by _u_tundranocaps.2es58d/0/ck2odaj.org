In general, this was an awful read. I am writing this post because I want people to not waste their time as I did. This guy may well be very intelligent and good at discussion, but I can't imagine how cruddy the discourse must be on that subreddit that this post actually improves things.

Here's a summary of what he says, as far as I can tell:

1. If you disagree with people, they don't like that.
2. If you have a discussion that's about asking questions and sharing ideas, it makes people less mad, which is good.
3. By asking questions instead of disagreeing, you learn more about the other person's ideas, which is good.
4. If, after learning someone's position, you still disagree with them, you can agree to disagree, which is good.
