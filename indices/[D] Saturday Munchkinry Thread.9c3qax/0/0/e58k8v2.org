I think my choice is greatly dependant on my goals, though there is one essential option: Infinite branching bypasses the limitations of having to reset all the way, effectively allowing you to set arbitrary checkpoints. This is useful regardless of objective: you can use it to repeat specific events over and over to brute force a solution and then save the result by branching.

Objective: progress humanity:

Essentials: Branching loop -1, more branching -1, branching loop+ -1, chaos loop -0 (you want variation between loops so that new developments are made), object permanence -3 (Heckin' OP if you can take technology to the past, especially to any savestate), anti-gambling +1, Time machine +4 (After we resolve legalities of having no identity, it doesn't really affect us, so free points) for a total of -1.

12 points:

We're going straight for immortality here, so Tree(3) years -10. locked loop +2 and cooldown +2 (no need to leave the loop as branches count as in-loop and the loop will last for eternity). Memory permanence -2, sound mind -1. The last two points are free choice.

6 points:

Tree(3) years -10, locked loop +2, cooldown +2, sound mind -1, [nothing odd here or limitless memory] -1 and Be careful +3. Make a ridiculous number of safety precautions and lots of save states, check twice before crossing the road. The extra points are necessary to achieve the immortal loop

3 points:

We can't afford looping eternally, so we'd likely develop until we are satisfied with the maximum achievable in 10 years and break out. 10 years -8 and One-time use +6. Plurality bypasses many of the weakness of one-time use, so its main limitation is <= 10 years. For additional risk we can take Be careful +3, Memory permanence -2 and sound mind -1

OR if we want to keep our ability to make multiple loops:

1 week -5 and Be Careful +3 is all we can afford. Not nearly as useful, as convincing people and making progress is only barely possible and will quickly hit a limit.

0 points:

10 years -8, One-time use +6, Be Careful +3. Losing sound mind is a bummer, but the rest are too useful together and no more maluses are acceptable

Conclusion: "There were starting points!?"

EDIT: added in cooldown (+2) so I rearranged the text and changed the set ups to match.
