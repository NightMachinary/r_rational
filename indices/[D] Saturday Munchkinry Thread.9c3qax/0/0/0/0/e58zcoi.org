My bad, I choose poor words. In all my options I chose grahams number of loops, what I meant by 'inifinite' is infinite length. With the goal of progressing humanity, it'd be nice to be able to live in that future humanity that is created. In the first two options I made sure I could get it, but the 10 point cost was too steep for the 3 point or 0 point challenge. Actually, we could get it with 3 points if we ditch object permanence, but then goals become much harder and we need to play the long game on every run
