Three points?

Take a one-minute loop length, but Graham's Number of loops. (0 points so far). Digital permanence (one point). Bubble loop (2 points). Outside the Loop (2 points) to allow me to create loops that I am not inside of. Since I don't actually plan to ever be inside these loops, I can take Locked Loop, All The Way, Static Length, No Reset Control and Be Careful (giving me eight extra points) without penalty.

Now, I've still got six points to spare (I've used -3 points out of 3 so far) and I already have my aim - near-infinite time computing. I can create a bubble that contains a computer and its near surroundings (and only those) and run a carefully designed piece of software that will have Graham's number of minutes of runtime (with no user interaction) within one minute of time (as far as anything outside the room is concerned). I can start out by finding large prime numbers using a desktop computer and claiming the prizes for said discoveries, and then put my incredible computing power to work solving other problems...
