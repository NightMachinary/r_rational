I think that any number of timelines (-2) with any number of loops within loops (-2) breaks the game in terms of loop iterations (+8), locked loop (+2), and reset control (+1) for a total of *+7*.

With an infinite number of loops of any length within the main loop, you can have an infinite number of loops /the length of the original loop/. You can repeat each one as many times as you like, hopping back and forth casually between those infinite tries, and while "only one can be made real" so far as continuing forward from that point, that's one /of each internally created loop/.

You can "reset" without resetting by simply abandoning one of your infinite timelines. The final, "real" iteration must be the full length but any other one is whatever length you need it to be. You can also go back to abandoned timelines if you change your mind, which is handy.

If you don't mind sacrificing some marginal flexibility, feel free to take static loops for an additional +1, and if you understand what All the Way means when it talks about loops in loops you can get +1 there too. Without knowing the rules, I wouldn't risk it.

Regardless, the three points is a minimum of ten with infinite repeats up to whatever maximum length you set.
