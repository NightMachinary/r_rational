Yeah 12 points is too easy. With 6 points, I would take 100 year loop, repeat at most 100 times, and the one time use and anti gambling maluses. Perks would be digital permanence, sound mood, limitless memory, and memory permanence. I'll have to read the perks more to see if any are worth the cost.

Edit: can't take one time use with 100 years. I'll take locked loop and all the way, so that should put me at a balance of 0 points.

If I only had 3 points, I would go for 10 years instead and get one time use, not take locked loop or all the way, and invest any spare points into number of loops.

I feel like anti gambling might as well be a free point. There are tons of ways to make money that don't involve gambling or anything like that. You could easily sell tons of secrets that you get a decade or century in the future, and use that money to trade for other secrets that you sell in subsequent iterations.

Digital permanence is a must have, along with unlimited memory. You presumably want to gain something of value from those loops.
