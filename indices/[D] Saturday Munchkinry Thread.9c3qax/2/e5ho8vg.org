Someone trying to munchkin Pinocchio:

I'm actually of the second guy's opinion - the nose thing is meant to be a punishment for intentional lies, not a general falsehood detector. But If it was the former, there would be so much potential!

In less cosmic-shattering uses, there's a Pinocchio Vampire Slayer comic where he uses his nose as an endless supply of stakes.
