I can see you attempting to prevent infinite energy shenanigans with gravity, but I think we can still get away with it via electrical charge or magnets.

Object 1: some sort of object that we can fill with positive charge and insulate to keep it charged.

Object 2: some sort of object that we can fill with negative charge and insulate to keep it charged

Then you fuse the objects, and stick them in a strong electrical field. It will apply force in one direction of the field or the other based on its current charge, which you can harness to generate energy, and then swap to the other charged object once it reaches the edge of the field.
