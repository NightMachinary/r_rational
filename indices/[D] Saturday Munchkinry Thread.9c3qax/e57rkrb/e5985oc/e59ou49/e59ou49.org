  What two items do you pair, and what do you do with the combined object?
#+end_quote

Any two items, and I use them to claim the James Randi prize. I then have a million dollars. Also, to choose what items to pair, I go to [[/r/rational]] and make the following post:

  You have the ability to pair two items, once. When items become paired, only one of them exists at a time. You may switch them with a thought, as long as you are touching them and the item being switched to would be unobstructed. When the items become paired, their massed are combined, with both items having the same mass as the two of them together had before the pairing. The paired items also have a fixed orientation towards each-other, with their centers of mass always being the same point, and have a moment of inertia as though the two objects were overlayed each-other in that orientation. Once you've paired two items, they can never be unpaired, and you ability has been used up.
