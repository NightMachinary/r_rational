I'm going to call it "live my normal life but make money on roulette", since some of the bonuses look good in general.

Cooldown (+2)

No reset (+1)

Limitless Memory (-1)

Sound Mind (-1)

Nothing Odd Here (-1)

One minute time loop, win at roulette, net 0 points.

I can also use it if I end up in a dangerous situation to try to save my life (admittedly only for a minute). If I have to take 3 points I'll increase my max loop to 4 hours, and constantly have the loop "on" but just decline to reset it unless I die.

Yeah my thing isn't optimised to within an inch to its life, but with 0 points I can make money, not need to work again, and apparently none of the casino owners will realise I'm "cheating" at roulette.
