I assumed it meant any one piece of looped time. So if you have a loop in a loop each loop repeats once.

#+begin_quote
  Going back to another branch is most definitely iterating over a previous piece of time
#+end_quote

And yet, that's how the rules stand as written; you have multiple branches and they're 'paused". Also: you're not necessarily just straightforwardly looping; a branch can be ahead or behind other branches or the main loop.
