Free points:

Always take 1 Iteration(+8) points and take Braching Loop(-1) and More Branches(-1). The two branches gives you in effect an infinite number of loops since time only passes in the branch you are currently in and gives you a net +6.

Take either Locket Loop(+2) or all the way+static length (+2). They do essentially the same, are a minor inconvinience but there's too much need for points if you start with 3. All the way+Static Length synergizes well with the branches since if you end up in a life threatening circumstance you can shift to another branch.

Anti Gambling(+1) is a must take. There's plenty of ways of gaining money that doesn't involve gamling or stocks.

Point taxes:

Sound mind(-1) is a point tax that you just have to take. Whatever your goals are they will be corrupted if you go insane.

Good choices:

Expanded years. 100(-9) gets you that immortality thing rolling

Digital performance(-1). Cheaper than Memory Performance and does the same and more after uploading. You want it to cause world domination or quicken the new enlightenment. Though you should probably also take Object Permanence(-3) so you don't have to go looking for your fancy USB or your friends brain upload.

Automation(-2) is pretty great if you are paranoid(which you should with this power). Set contingency plans for anyone tinkering with your brain and such.
