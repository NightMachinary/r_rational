Fair, the rules are a little hacky. I might say that, 'switching' the two objects is actually, like, a high-speed 4d rotation, and that switching costs you some small amount of energy. Under ordinary circumstances, that energy is just used to move air out of the way, but in this case that energy would also go into your generator, and if the charges are so great that energy cost of completing the rotation is greater than the 'strength' of your rotation, then the object counts as 'obstructed' and the switch fails.
