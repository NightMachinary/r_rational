Hmm. In that case, aside from exploiting the magic nature of the ability for profit rather than any particular combination of items, maybe self defense? Always keep a knife on you, even when it looks like a pen.

I'm hesitant to pick any piece of technology, because it would become outdated fairly quickly, and I'm assuming that the items can still break through normal use. Because being able to swap a really nice laptop and my phone would be handy.

I suppose if you could convince the US government of your ability before ever using it, all the radioactive material that requires disposal could be fused into a single object, turned into a pebble or something, then be forgotten about.

For a boring answer, you could choose two objects of greatly differing volumes, and then use air displacement to run a generator.

People might complain if you turned the Earth into a grain of sand that collapses into a black hole.

You could make launching a really complicated satellite much easier by turning it into something that doesn't need to worry about surviving launch. The James Webb Space Telescope comes to mind. It's super complicated, and part of that is because it needs to unfold once launched into it's full configuration which is far too big to fit into a fairing. If a telescope was designed with the ability in mind, you could put a really fancy one into space, as the mass of the telescope would be the only thing constraining it's size.

I could buy as dense a storage medium as I can, and then save all the backups of my data on to it before storing it as a ring or something. It would be the ultimate form of loss prevention, because the data wouldn't be physically vulnerable to anything. I would probably wait on doing so, because hard drive space is continually increasing, so I wouldn't want to be stuck with the equivalent of a 256 MB flash drive in the era of terabyte hard drives.
