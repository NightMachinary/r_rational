Increased density marginally increases the durability for some materials, I think. I'm not sure though.

IIRC the earth still wouldn't be a black hole even if it were the size of a grain of sand.

Aiding in satellite launches sounds interesting, but it'd still be tricky since you need to be skin-contact with the object to switch its forms.

Secure storage of data also sounds reasonable. I wonder whether there's anything else you could extract disproportionate benefit from rendering functionally immune to outside wear and tear?
