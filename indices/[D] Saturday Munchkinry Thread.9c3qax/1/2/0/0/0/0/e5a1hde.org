There's lots of things that can fail in electronics even if they are physically more durable. Processors wear out over time, and electrical shorts occasionally happen, for example.

[[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_radius?wprov=sfla1][Schwarzschild radius of the Earth]] is ~9 millimeters across. It would form a black hole.

I think sending a single human on an orbital flight that should only last a few hours would be easier than designing a huge satellite that can survive launch. You wouldn't necessarily even need life support, just a space suit with maybe some extra air.

Not sure. Backups for data seem the logical choice for personal use. Various emergency supplies would have similar utility but be more boring and usually require non-replenishable resources stored with them.
