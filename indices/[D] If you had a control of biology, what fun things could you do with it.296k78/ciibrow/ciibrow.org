A few ideas from a book I read a while back (Copernick's Rebellion, Leo Frankowski - not a very good book in many ways, and one I can't really recommend, but it had some ideas about people exploiting a higher level of genetic understanding and technological modification)

- Tree houses: True-replicating trees of various sizes between small apartment to big multiperson family units that grow independently and can replace entire construction industry and possibly agricultural industry if they grow food (possessing room/furniture shaped internal structures)
- Improved efficiency in plants: Augment transpiration process with a heart pushing sap around for vast efficiency gains over basic transpiration.
- Insanely optimized fast-growing crops to feed world?
- Carrot for negotiating with Government (esp. US gov't) - majority of politicians are old people, offer to reset politicians internal biology to mid-twenties to ward off heart disease, cancers, etc for another 50 years. Can't fix brain stuff e.g. Alzheimers, apparantly, but fixing everything from arthritis to cancer to impotency is a pretty big negotiating carrot. currently 60 of US Senate is over 60, a majority, so it might be quite feasible to block legislation at the very least.
- Can you get something which can metabolize metals and extract from deep underground or filter metals out of ocean for initial wealth generation? Can you get an organism to shape carbon into diamond?
- Ludicrously scary negotiating stick (probably best not to even mention and hope they don't realize you could wipe out the human race on accident by tinkering with virii and/or bacteria - otherwise any sensible government will probably assassinate them).

There was a bunch of other stuff that seemed really implausible or outright fantasy of course, and a bunch of stuff involving creating sentients designed to be subservient which is super morally problematic and also extremely dangerous when they started messing around with sentients smarter than baseline humans.
