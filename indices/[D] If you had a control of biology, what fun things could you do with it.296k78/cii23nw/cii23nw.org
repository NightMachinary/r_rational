Recursive self-improvement. That's... probably not going to be allowed.

If making heritable changes is possible, I think an easy route to power is agribusiness. Become Monsanto but bigger. One business model is to create crop that has extreme disease resistance, yield, nutritional value, but then to make it sterile in only a few generations so farmers buy seed from me, grow it, sell the product, and buy more seed. Alternate business model is to create a "lock and key" system, where a special fertilizer, pesticide, herbicide, or food source is needed for good yields, which I then sell. This would be good for livestock, e.g. modern chickens but more hardy, docile, and disease-resistant.

For third-world markets, selling non-sterile but not-quite-as-good seed would be a good way to encourage the spread of a green revolution.

This would lead to me making approximately all of the money, I'd probably need an island fortress of living oak, guarded by ferocious yet adorable capybaras.

Also, the massive displacement of farmers and concentration of capital caused by less labor-intensive crops would cause workers revolts worldwide. I could probably take advantage of the chaos to, like, buy England.
