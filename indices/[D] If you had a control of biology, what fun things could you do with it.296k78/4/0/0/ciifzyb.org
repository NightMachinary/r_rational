I know that. -_-\\
I meant making one that would be more effective at it, a la [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosequestration#Enhanced_photosynthesis][this]]. I may have worded it poorly but by "helping prevent" it, I meat that it would at least decrease the concentration by a large amount. Also, at least in the Disney movie, the story takes place during the industrial revolution. There would be much less carbon in the air at that period of time. (Though I have no idea if they were aware of climate change at that period of time, so that may be a moot point.)
