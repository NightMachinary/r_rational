So. Many. Exploits.\\
Here are a few I thought of.

- Resource mining plants\\
  Have plants that extract various elements from the ground. Rare earths especially. Could also grow balloons of various gasses. (Hindenburg plant anyone?)

- Carbon sequestration\\
  Make a plant that sequesters carbon from the atmosphere. Would help prevent, or solve climate change.

- Fuel generation\\
  Could combine this with the carbon plant. Generate various hydrocarbons.

- Biolumenescent trees\\
  Would replace streetlamps. Would also be useful in areas with no electricity.

- Retroviral engineering\\
  Modify viruses to produce large scale genetic modification such as nitrogen fixation, anti-aging, repair genetic diseases, modify immune systems to fight various cancers, etc. An encryption failsafe is a must to prevent unwanted mutations.

- Brain modification\\
  Increasing brain size would likely be the easiest. Harder, but far more powerful would be overclocking.

- Ambrosia/Soylent\\
  A tasty plant that that contains all a human needs to survive. Make it grow like a weed, and you've solved world hunger.

- Water plant\\
  Have it capture water from the air, but also have a root system that will pump from the watertable. You could also just have it make water from the hydrogen and oxygen in the air.

- Housing\\
  Grows into a living space with various amenities.

- Molecular manufacturing\\
  Now that you have control over the original nanotechnology, you should be able to bootstrap molecular manufacturing.

A couple more I thought of.

- Organic robots\\
  Modify a species for repetitive tasks, and you can replace most menial labor. The best species to do this with would be humans, as they would be a direct replacemet. You'd make them mindless and to have a low upkeep (could run them off of soylent). You can further modify them for any specific tasks if needed. Growing them might be a bit of an issue. Best bet would be to create some sort of grow pods, and seed them with modified stem cells.

- Purifiers\\
  Easy to create since a few plants already do this. Removes polution to get clean water and air.
