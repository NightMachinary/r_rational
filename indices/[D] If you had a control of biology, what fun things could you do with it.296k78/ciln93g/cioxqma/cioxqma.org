(Author of Symbiote here) I had a great deal of fun writing Symbiote. There's surely a lot of stuff you can do with biology control! Symbiote went beyond body control into fundamental matter and even quantum control, but it started with biology control and there was a lot of conflict around it.

One suggestion. Tarzan's ability (or willingness) to control biology should be carefully matched with his his ability to understand the changes. This gives you an obvious point of non-physical conflict with Jane, where they can both demonstrate superior knowledge to the other. Hers scientific, his systemic / natural / mystical / experience / wisdom.

Bob (human) had Frank (symbiote) to control the molecular and eventually quantum construction that they were able to perform. Some of the ability bleeds over as Bob becomes more transhuman due to his and Frank's becoming more closely intertwined.

Tarzan might be doing it in a more mystical way (so I would assume anyway) and have less of an understanding of how the science part works. That being said, Jane might be able to teach him a great deal and help him learn to do more. Will Tarzan WANT to do more though? If he's happy healing bones, curing cancers, strengthening trees and improving fruit yields for his animal buddies, what is his reaction going to be to being asked to actually /change/ things?

Even better, what is his reaction going to be when his animal buddies start killing off all the rest of the apes and animals in the jungle because his activities allow them to breed far more prolifically due to increased food and health?

If he ever has experimented outside nature, one of the first experiments he might have tried beyond the obvious is to try to create primates that can communicate with speech and have more complex thoughts. This might be something that happens before he encounters Jane, and it might have been something that went terribly wrong, causing him to be extremely unwilling to "play creator" and do more than work with what is already there. This could allow for there to be some residual conflict between himself and other jungle primates too, even if they aren't quite so smart anymore. They might remember that they were once...

Tarzan might, in time, even show Jane the remnants of his past failures to play god. More juicy conflict.

Lots of different ways to go with this idea!
