Eh.. Starting with Tarzan makes.. limited.. sense If you want a character with control of biology, isn't this Poison Ivy's stichk?

That said, obvious uses : Step one: Personal Safety: In remote locations, have patches of super-photosynthetic wine send down roots. Way down. No, further. Have the roots start operating of geothermal heat gradients, spread out and grow networked redundant backups of your brain. Archival only. Not actively running. Also grow neural nodes that are basically a non-volitional computer system. Protocol: If not updated for a month, send up root vine to grow new you. Sub protocol. If you meet yourself, retreat to the depths, preform merge. (branching identity is a bad, bad, bad no-good idea)

Step 2: Optimized to heck and gone crops. Standard photosynthesis is not very good, a directed effort should be able to improve on them. Add in atmospheric nitrogen harvesting.. Dont make these seed-bearing, or you just hit reset on the entire ecosystem. Perennials that only reproduce via cuttings are the way to go -super banana's, basically. Step 3: Cook up a mod for human biology that stops senescence improves healing mechanisms in general and puts reproduction under positive volitional control for both genders. As a package deal. Make this into a fruit of a tree (see earlier comment about seedless and cuttings) Yes, I did pick a tree just to mess with people.

Things not to do: Mods to own brain. This would be a really good way to die. Or go into vegetative blissout.
