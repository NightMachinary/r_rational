Lots of dying. And larger animals do have built in limiters to fertility- what do you think the point of "heat" periods or the fact that breastfeeding dramatically limits fertility was? Unrestricted fertility is a loosing evolutionary strategy. Animals that manage to outbreed capacity end up dead. Which is actually a fairly likely outcome for anyone taking up unrestricted brancing. "Everyone starts shooting you on sight, then pass a ban on self-copying" is a non-apocalyptic limiter. Its no fun for you, however. See original point about "no good bad idea".
