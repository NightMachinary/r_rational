Not really, no. Each branch is a person, and as such has the ability to procure resources. If making branches is fantastically expensive -as in "the equivalent of several billion dollars". that might mitigate things, but otherwise there is a very strong selection effect favoring the creation of branches that are insane about making more branches.

And since in this case, the cost is "sunlight, and a couple bags worth of compost"...

The attitude one sees in a lot of science fiction of "shoot copies on sight" is necessary self-defense to have any kind of livable society.
