Two cases: General availability. Do you dispute that some people are just crazy? No? Then you see the problem? A single individual: Identity isn't nearly as constant as we would like to believe. Given initial forking to an significant number of concurrent identities and any significant span of time (anything above a dozen or so) some of the forks absolutely will diverge from your present values. The ones that diverge in the direction of less restraint about further forking.. Rinse, repeat. As I said, for a single individual, disaster will probably take time. couple of centuries, even. It is extremely likely to happen, however. Self-reinforcing feedback loops are very dangerous, and usually only stop due to outside limits being imposed. See, earlier comments about lead population control.
