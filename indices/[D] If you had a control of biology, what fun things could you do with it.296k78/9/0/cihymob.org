It'll probably be a while. I need to finish up my Superman fic, reread at least the first few books, draw up a general outline that works on a narrative level, and then set up a custom dictionary to write in the period properly. But unless the ideas all fall apart when I prod them, this will probably be the next thing that I work on. Luckily, Tarzan is in the public domain, so I could potentially sell it on Amazon for a dollar as well as putting it on ff.net.

I've always liked the themes of Tarzan - the tension of animalistic nature against upright British society, for one.
