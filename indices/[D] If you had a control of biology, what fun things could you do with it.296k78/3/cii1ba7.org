Intelligence explosion.

Experiment to discover exactly how the brain works, enhance neural connections, trigger rapid growth in neurons throughout the body for backup brains, upgrade twitch reflexes and perception of time to basically overclock yourself, leading to a sort of biological [[http://shadowrun.wikia.com/wiki/Wired_reflexes][wired reflexes]].

Absorb more biomass through consumption or absorption (give yourself this ability), do it more. Program biological nanites to do basically whatever you need them to do.

Duplicate yourself entirely, as a backup or as a partner guaranteed to share your values (Note - Do not do this unless you are able to implicitly accept any duplicates of yourself as independent beings with right to life - if you consider them expendable, they will consider you expendable.).

Win. Everything, likely forever.
