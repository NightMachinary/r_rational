Assuming from "any living creature that he /touches/" that each creature must be an individual (i.e., no bacteria or virus modding, because I can think of a bunch of ways to +break+ use that just off the top of my head), the first thing I would do is determine if I was included in that definition. This power gets broken if I'm allowed to, say, tie myself into an existing tree and exert influence on anything that tree is touching as well (possibly causing some cascading issues as I spread to everything that touches, and so on.). Also try to define "touch" - if I can make hairs grow and use contact through hair to alter something, I don't really need to move around - having flies carry strands of ever lengthening hair to spread my will across the jungle would work out well for me.

The next main focus is what process you can influence without actual knowledge of what they do. For instance, can you cause flies to develop the chemical system that would allow them to utilize bioluminescence without knowing how that system works? That could be a major limiter of his power - he only understands systems he has had contact with (and the understanding can be limited, as in the case of brains). So no "optimized" crops, just crops that can utilize strengths of different plant species when he modifies them.

That being said, random ideas: 1) I like the resource plants mentioned by a poster above. I was thinking something along the lines of plants that intake salt water and exhale fresh water and salt. Boom, easy water purification.

2) Population control of endangered species - depending on control over reproductive systems, can help raise the numbers of dying species, as well as fixing any ecological damage to their habitats

3) Speaking of repairing ecological damage, creating something that can process waste oil (both in water and on land) and either turn it into something useful or just transport it and excrete it somewhere it can be dealt with more appropriately.

4) Algae biofuel. It's already a thing, one good push and it can replace petroleum.

5) Species editing. The cattle population in Western civilization is facing increasing problems from artificial selection. They have been bred to be larger and larger, which causes many more deaths during childbirth as the calves are much larger than they should be. This is probably not the only species with these or similar problems, but it's the only one I can think of off the top of my head.

6) Landfill destroyers. Probably several different species to handle plastic, glass, metal, etc.

7) Worms that can improve soil quality, both for existing cropland and to convert useless soil into usable soil. Probably going to need specialized diets to excrete the proper chemicals, but that can be taken care of.

8) Insect control - bye bye killer bees and giant hornets.
