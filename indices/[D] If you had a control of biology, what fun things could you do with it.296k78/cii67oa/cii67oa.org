Not sure how direct the touch needs to be but:

1. It should be possible to create totipotent stem cells from adult somatic cells if you can directly modify genetics and cell structure with 100% accuracy.
2. Similarly, cloning humans or anything else would be easy since you could easily reset all the epigenetics and do the transfer of the nucleus to the zygote without causing cell damage.
3. Undo some of the better-understood symptoms of ageing such as DNA damage to slow your ageing.
4. Make yourself and others immune to diseases by producing the relevant antibodies within their bodies.
5. Destroy pathogens from the bodies of people you come in contact with.
6. Eliminate the well-understood genetic diseases from the people you come in contact with.
7. For combat purposes, modify insects to have extremely deadly poisons and switch their scent receptors so that they perceive the smell of your enemy, or the smell of a chemical that you will tag your enemy with as a threat. Make yourself immune to the poisons. Sterilize any animals you genetically modify so that they can't reproduce.
8. Obviously, healing yourself and others of injuries and reviving dead people before they've started to decompose should be possible depending on the cause of death and how much time and knowledge of anatomy, medicine, etc. you have.
