I'm wondering if [[/r/rational]] should have a rule explicitly outlawing answering any hypothetical question with "intelligence enhancement/explosion". It's not that it isn't a /genuine/ answer, but it's just so damned /easy/ to come up with in this community that it doesn't really get into the spirit of the creative-thinking game.

This would be kind of like how Polandball has a joke-life preserve.
