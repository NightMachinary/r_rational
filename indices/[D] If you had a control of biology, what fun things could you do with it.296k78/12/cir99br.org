Your first literary challenge will be to make all of these munchkinings too hard. Two things I would try is the R-brain driving the changes. Panacea wasn't a gamebreaker because her issues prevented here from using here power optimally. If you are going to have a rationalist apply this power you should either gimp it, or make it a threat: what if the modified organisms are more prone to reversion because the DNA only affects some not all of the organism, or worse, they gain some amount of the power, and mutate optimally in single generations, mutate for their own reproduction a la potential grey goo scenarios.
