The limit on messing with brains will probably be a lack of knowledge. Brains are hella complex, and have a lot of variation. Even if you could theoretically alter how the neurons connect to each other, you wouldn't necessarily know what changing those connections would actually accomplish. If there's no ability to have a "save state" so that you can set things back to the way you found them, changing around a person's brain would be far more likely to leave them with brain damage than to accomplish anything useful.

At least, that's my first pass at limiting the power. I think as far as brains go, I'll limit myself to what can be done with modern medical science and technology (or maybe what's projected to be possible in the next twenty years or so). So you'd be able to replicate the effects of any drugs or surgery, plus a few other things we can't currently do because they're additive, but you wouldn't be able to just reach into someone's head and rearrange their mind.
