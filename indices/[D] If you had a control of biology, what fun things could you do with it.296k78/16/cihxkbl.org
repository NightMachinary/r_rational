Well, I suppose I would conquer the world with:

1. An army of mind slaved/trained/something(can I even do something like that?) creatures. Possibly get them from Australia.

2. Force people to obey me or I'll mess with them or something.

3. If the mind slaving portion of 1. is viable, I might not even bother with animals and just take over people.

After that, I would self modify myself and continue to do so throughout my life in order to make myself effectively immortal.
