Oooh, I love these.

The key here is to make yourself as effectively smart as possible, obviously. Even if there's all sorts of limits, there are always more indirect ways. Cant change your brain? Duplicate it and wire many together. Cant do that? Grow/merge extra "slaved" brains from your spine. That not allowed either? You can still get huge mileage out of non-neural processing and storage, like stuff based of the immune system, or computer-like networks of reflexes. Reached the limit of that? Have huge amounts of sensory apparatus and limbs optimized for embodied cognition. Reached the limit of that? Optimize some for operating tools like writing or abacuses (or technological computers when they come around.

This, as well as some other stuff, will require tons of biomass, literally. It follows a similar progression. Covering the planet with a thick layer of flesh to ecologically impactful? Just put brains in all the trees and wire them together Avatar style. That out of reach? Make a transport network and have really HUGE trees bunched and merged together where there is range. Some weird must-be-like-real organism-rule? The biggest creatures around are fungi that can cover similar areas, or tree species that naturally form networks of the same individual connected by the roots. More bunching required? Fine, even single trees can get petty huge. The very bottom of making sense, having to be somewhat like a real animal? Take a cue from elephants, blue whales, and sauropods.
