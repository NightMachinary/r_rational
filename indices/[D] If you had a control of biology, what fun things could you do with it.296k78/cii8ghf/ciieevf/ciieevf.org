These are called "plants"; the problem is the sheer mass you need. Let's imagine that all you need to do is buy time, so merely cancelling all 21^{st} century emissions will do.

That's going to be (assuming business-as-usual, which we /really/ shouldn't do) about 3,000 GT, or... 3 Zetagrams, 3 x 10^{18} Kg. That's a lot. So much that I had to look up prefixes, which in an era trending toward peta/exa in computing is crazy.

I'm just going to note that the formal estimates say that Australia is unlikely to be able to sequester more than 100 MT per year, which is one three-hundred-millionth of what's required.

TL;DR, */way/ too much carbon*
