As I understand it: Sucrose is a asymmetric molecule. The mirror image version of sugar tastes sweet but can't be digested by our enzymes so it's basically perfect dieting sugar. However, there may be health effects from this sort of thing related to e.g. internal bacteria digesting it or not, so it may not be a perfect silver bullet. It's interesting to speculate about, anyways. Yes, this is related to chirality - as I understand it, the d variant of both glucose and fructose is required for the body to digest sucrose, and the presence of mirror-imaged l-variant of one, the other, or both makes it indigestible.
