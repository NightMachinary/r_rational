I think the physical side of this power is most precisely expressed as "changing a living creature in a way that isn't allowed by physics; but with an end product which is subject to physics."

A lot of uses will depend on the /mental/ side of the power. In how much detail must I visualize the changes I'm making? Can I visualize pieces and then store them for modular use in larger visualizations? If not, the power probably won't be useful for much more than a single, unexpected assassination (or multiple assassinations of lower-profile targets), curing cancer, and "optimizing" people by eliminating their mutational load.
