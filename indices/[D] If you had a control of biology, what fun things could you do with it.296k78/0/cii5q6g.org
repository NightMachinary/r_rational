I would be very, very cautious.

No inheritable changes. No mental self-editing, ever, and physical only after years of testing. Nothing infectious. Extreme caution in anything with an ecological impact. (incidentally, this should be standard for research on replicators or biomanipulation)

Things I would want to try:

- elimination of diseases - can I heal the sick? Create swarms of sterile mosquitoes? Vaccinate against everything with a touch?

- agriculture is an obvious route: if set before ~1950, replicate the work of Borglaug in the Green Revolution (primarily dwarfism for higher yield, some pest resistance). Pest resistance. Laugh at the idea that herbicide resistance is an optimal use of this power (ie Monsanto's monopoly-enabled strategy). More nutrition from staples. Mention concerns about crop diversity and resilience.

- creation of custom things: eg 1000kg tuna are absurdly valuable, can I touch a tree and grow a shelter, turn a cow into 100% prime steaks, etc. Something like a tropical rainforest or those clonal forests would become a /genius loci/ in this scenario.

Tarzan basically looks like Panacea-lite, limited by (head-pre-canon) a genuine desire to avoid any ecological harm and lack of education in arcane possibilities. He may also be offended by the basic concept of agricultural monocultures (character tension!).

Is the power somehow innate to his identity? Body? Lifestyle? Dependant on a code of conduct? Only usable for applications that fit some theme? It could also remain unexplained, with Tarzan not knowing if some actions could lead to losing the power and unwilling to take the risk (best limiter, IMO).
