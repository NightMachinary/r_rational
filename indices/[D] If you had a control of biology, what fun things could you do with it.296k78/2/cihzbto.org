Compress/optimize every system in the body, to start. This means:

- Your organs don't need to be in the same places
- Every organ is much less prone to failure
- Every organ is stronger (superhuman strength, vision, hearing, fortitude)
- There's room for redundancy organs, for increased survivability
- Immunity to every disease/poison

I would probably relocate my brain from an easy target to something like the middle of my chest surrounded by bone made of layered graphene. Without even changing the brain's structure, there are studies that intelligence is largely how fast you can think, and how fast you can think is largely determined by how fast electricity goes through your neurons, so if you compress everything to a much smaller size, chances are you just made yourself extremely intelligent without even needing to understand the neuron paths. This above anything else is the largest increase in the ability to get the things that you want.

Retractable wings - you can fly. Gills/webbed hands - you can live underwater. Removal of digestion system in place of chlorophyll in cells letting you survive (or even just help survive) via photosynthesis. Wallclimbing, rapid shape changing, color changing, and extreme tunneling are options too. With the extra room from compressing your organs you can hold all the changes without even looking different.

Removal of sleep, more production of energy/motivation chemicals. Healing and recovery factor off the charts, you could set your attention exactly as you need.

You'd have to be careful not to touch the pleasure center of my brain, because you'd quickly reduce yourself to a gibbering idiot where you did nothing but expand and stimulate it.

And this is just for day to day. When you go "sense-mode" there's also stuff like filia that are extremely tough and extend around you for miles, giving you an extreme sense of the world. More eyeballs would also help, to see behind you. You could make your skin more effective sandpaper than a sharks by a few orders of magnitude, making every rope or restraint worthless against you.

You could create clones, minions, or pets that you control directly and do exactly as you want. It would be biological warfare on a macro scale, something we've never seen. No existing tech could stand to it. You could make 'simple' animals for this, like bees that consider anything not wearing your clothing or your smell to be an enemy, fly at mach 2, sting with the poison of a blue ring octopus, and expire naturally after 10 minutes.

You could single handedly create the Zerg and everything good about them. Hives that produce more spawn for you, everything is 100% susceptible (and more than that, absolutely willing) to your command. World conquering is easy, you could /improve/ the world. Give everyone a pet that carries genes to manufacture antidotes to 99% of known diseases. Make it optimally cute and no one will resist getting one.

Panacea was so OP the author had to cripple her by making her unwilling to use her abilities.
