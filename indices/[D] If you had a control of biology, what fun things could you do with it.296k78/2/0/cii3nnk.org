In terms of flying, you're going to have difficulties if you keep your human weight. Look up the size of say hang gliders or paragliders. You need wings that big to glide. If you add power by flapping say you could reduce it a bit, but then huge amounts of body mass has to go into flight muscles. Unless your power allows you to break physics you'll have a hard time. (not that it can't be done, a hang glider only weighs 20kg and a paraglider even less, but getting ready for launch would take a couple of minutes as you unpack your wings.)

As to supersonic bees, I doubt it can be done they are simply too small. You could create a biological gun/launcher by using vacuum and pressure (youtube supersonic pingpong ball) and the bullet could have basic control, but it'd be more like a smart bullet than an independent plane.
