Direct mind control is probably one of the things that I'm going to have to nix in some way. /Indirect/ mind control is probably fine though; pheromones, changes to how various glands behave, partial lobotomy, etc. (It also goes without saying that you run into moral problems as soon as you start making modifications to people, especially without their consent. Even if it were possible to mind rape people and make a bunch of slaves, most people wouldn't, and the argument could be made that taking over the world in that manner is highly suboptimal, assuming that taking over the world actually satisfies values in the first place.)
