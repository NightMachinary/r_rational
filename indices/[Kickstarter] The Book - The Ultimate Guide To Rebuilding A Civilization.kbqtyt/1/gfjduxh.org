I'm posting about this Kickstarter project, because while there have been other rare books written about what a time traveler/post-apocalyptic survivor would need to know to construct this or that invention as part of rebuilding human civilization, I don't think there has been anything like this where it's reproduced as an amazing art book.

The example illustrations are amazing, and unlike many of the books where all of the focus is on the science/inventions, this book also covers music, society, and fashion. Sure, they aren't "essential" to building civilization, but they'll teach you how to charm people long enough to convince them you are worth listening to. I loved that novel twist on the concept.

The Kickstarter is doing amazingly well, and has raised nearly half a million to make this book within less than a week of starting!
