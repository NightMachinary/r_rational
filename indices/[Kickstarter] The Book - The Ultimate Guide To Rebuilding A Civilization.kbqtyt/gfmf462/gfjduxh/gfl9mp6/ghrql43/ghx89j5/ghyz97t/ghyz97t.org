Isn't 400 pages to short? In order to rebuild civilization you'd need to know a lot about agriculture, but also medicine. Like the making of vaccines, or at least how to make very simple ones, how to make the most important medicines like insulin and thyroid hormones and acetylsalicylic acid. How to make glasses and how to assist with child birth gone wrong. How much of a crop to plant in order to sustain a set number of people and best practice when it comes to agriculture based on different climates. This seems like it could be a really great work, but the paper probably needs to be as thin as that of the common bible and the writing as small and the pages more numerous.

I really really wish for this book to be as amazing as I'm picturing it, but I am worried it will just contain a very very small amount of the knowledge needed.
