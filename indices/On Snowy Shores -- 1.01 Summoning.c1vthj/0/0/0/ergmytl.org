On Snowy shores is a blend of high, low, and urban fantasy. Those that are given a coin from a druj have the ability to create a familiar, an implement, and cast a small selection of spells that are related to the familiar and/or implement through symbolic or literal meaning a person harbors for that particular object or familiar. The story follows Nathaniel Burns, a university student who's recently gone on Summer break and was planning on spending it playing video games and reading the days away. Mrs. Burns has a different plan, she is going to send him to a small town where he'll be doing a internship with a esteemed doctor. Unfortunately for Nathaniel, his mother isn't the only trouble in his life, because he's become a witness to an otherworldly beast, a creature so fearsome, a druj decides to pay Nathaniel a visit.

edit: Is low fantasy the same as urban fantasy?

edit: Not really, but there's overlap.
