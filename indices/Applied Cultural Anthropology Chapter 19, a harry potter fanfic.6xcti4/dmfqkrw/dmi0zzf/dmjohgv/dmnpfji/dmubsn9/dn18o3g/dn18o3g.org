It has been said that there are three topics guaranteed to provoke an argument with anyone. If one fails, one of the others will prevail: Sex, Religion, and Politics. I'm pretty sure we can pull off the hat-trick here. Instead, I'll give three other reasons:

1. MIRI
2. LessWrong
3. Transhumanism

To remain brief: I think he's intelligent and knowledgable, but also arrogant and misguided. That he has a disdain for viewpoints he doesn't comprehend, mistaking his own ignorance as the foolishness of others. While he's written much about intelligent characters, his behavior suggests that he believes the world itself is full of Level-0 intelligent people. In short, he exudes an aura of deep hypocrisy.

And if I sound a bit like Olivander, it's probably because Yudkowsky sounds to me like Voldemort.
