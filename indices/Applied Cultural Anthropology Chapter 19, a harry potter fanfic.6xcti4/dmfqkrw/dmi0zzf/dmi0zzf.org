Confused. Why would anybody choose Yudkowsky as a role model? For me, he falls into the large set of creators I despise, but whose works I enjoy. For the other part, it's not so much the 'rational fic' community that grates me wrong, as the Less Wrongers. I'm not even sure if I like "rational fiction" (which stills seems to be rather poorly defined); I just know I like a lot of the same things as other people in the community.

That is to say, I'm really just here for the recommendations, and I think I like this one.
