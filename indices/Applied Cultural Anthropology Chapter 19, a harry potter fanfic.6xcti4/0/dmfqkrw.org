Ha, saw a comment by this guy shitting on the rational fic community the other day on spacebattles (yet again) and now I see his fic being posted here. He wrote he'd have the urge to give the author of Worth the Candle a "swirly"if he ever met him in person and that he "chose a poor role model" in yudkowsy. Very condescendingly, too.
