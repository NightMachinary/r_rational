I don't like this trend of "haha I totally don't like Yudkowsky I'm just here for the stories honest." It's cowardly. This community would not exist without him. You know he reads these comments, right? Personal flaws notwithstanding, what reason is there to despise him? Did he kill a kitten while I wasn't watching?

Maybe some people might choose him as a role model because he is brilliant, charismatic, and has devoted his life to helping others?

Regarding the author: I like his story (I just finished reading it) but I don't think it's a coincidence that people who love writing about slytherin MCs also tend to be jerks. The Dark Lord Potter forums were the same way: Just a bunch of edgelords who get off on pushing others down, as far as I can tell.
