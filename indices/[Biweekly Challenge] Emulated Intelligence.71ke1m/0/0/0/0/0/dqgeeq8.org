  Thank you! It's really nice when people comment on stories I've written months ago. Feels like my time investment is paying dividends :)

I'm working my way back through the monthly post archive :P

I think the structure works best when the majority of each story is before the transition to the next one. Which makes the new story something of a conclusion for the previous, and allows for a cascading of conlusions at the end. The stories where I've found it more annoying have been where the split was roughly 50/50 so I had to try and recall what had been happening in the previous one
