I noticed the similarities with <spoilers> and wondered if it was deliberate. Liked it a lot.

The layered form of the story was intriguing, something i've ony really seen before in historical stories, or used as a gimmick in a way i find annoying, but worked well in this context as the various layers made sense to connect. Adds some interesting unreliable narrator questions.
