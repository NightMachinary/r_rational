Thank you! It's really nice when people comment on stories I've written months ago. Feels like my time investment is paying dividends :)

Among the various stories I've written for the challenges, this one won by the smallest margin. I wasn't quite sure whether it was just not interesting or whether the structure was not to everyone's taste. It's certainly nice to know that someone liked it :)
