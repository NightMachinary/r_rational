(I put this into a comment because it contains commentary of the story as well as *SPOILERS*.)

I have to give credit where credit is due for some of the ideas in /Matryoshka/. First off, the idea that the Machines use humans as computers was actually in a very early script of the Matrix. Executive meddling led to the "humans as batteries"-story we all know and love (to make fun of).

The story of John was heavily inspired by [[https://web.archive.org/web/20000304044736fw_/http://whatisthematrix.com:80/cmp/neil_g.html][Goliath]], an officially licensed Matrix story by Neil Gaiman. This story is based on the earlier version of the script and serves as a nice example of what the Machines might use humans for.

Of course, my story is set in the Matrix as it was released, and is, in effect, an attempt at reconciling the early script, /Goliath/ and the final version.

Thank you for reading.
