I originally sent this as a submission to the MIRI "Intelligence in Fiction" call-out, but the theme of the story didn't quite capture what was sought after by MIRI - which was a fair assessment!

This story is more heavily /inspired/ by the concept of emulated intelligence than a story /about/ it, but I think once you read it, you'll hopefully see where I'm coming from :) EDIT: (okay, it's quite focused on emulated intelligence - just slightly... unorthodox.)

I hope you enjoy reading it - I definitely had fun writing it!
