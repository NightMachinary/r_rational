I /strongly/ recommend this series. Really well done, rational take on the Highlander universe. It doesn't mess with the underlying premises, it explores characters (canon and OC) and their interactions while being a great action / adventure / romance story.

It's a long series -- multiple novels worth, but divided up into reasonable sized chunks. There's some sex in later "episodes", but nothing terribly egregious. The one I've linked would be fine on US TV in prime time.
