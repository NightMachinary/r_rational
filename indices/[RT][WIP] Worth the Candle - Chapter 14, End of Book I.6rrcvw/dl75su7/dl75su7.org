[[/u/cthulhuraejepsen][u/cthulhuraejepsen]], I think you're balancing the main "realistic" fantasy plot, game mechanics, lyrical digressions, and flashbacks to tabletop role-playing sessions really well, creating a very unique narrative. The plot is rather interesting, as are the characters. Great work!
