At a recent public reading Ann Leckie of /Ancillary Justice/ fame mentioned something in that vein, an agent/editor she was introducing her book to was of the opinion she should get rid of the entire first third of it and throw the reader into the massacre. She however disagreed on grounds of the characterisation that necessarily needed to take place, to make clear how wrong that massacre was, even if it was done by as the in-universe archetypical expansionist empire, and how it affected the people enacting it.

I have to agree with her.

However, that doesn't man your opinion is without merit. Usually the first chapter should end on the inciting incident, so the main character's regular day can be experienced before the irregular day begins, so to speak.

Unrelatedly, [[/u/cthulhuraejepsen]], let me tell I immensely enjoy /Worth the Candle/. It is a refreshing deviation from what I have come to expect from litRPG. Please drop me a message when you release a commercial version, I'll gladly buy it.
