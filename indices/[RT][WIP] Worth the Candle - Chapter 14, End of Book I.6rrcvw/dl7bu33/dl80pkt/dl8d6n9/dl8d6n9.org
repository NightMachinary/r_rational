I just thought I was reading a really cold open. After reading the first thirteen chapters, I definitely got that I was missing something, but it also taught me a lesson about how much you can infer based on limited data. I've seen people write works with an eye toward subversion before, and most of the time, the length means that even the creative moments are drowned out. However, I don't think I'll be forgetting that it's perfectly reasonable to open a chapter with ELEVATOR FACTS now that I've read this.
