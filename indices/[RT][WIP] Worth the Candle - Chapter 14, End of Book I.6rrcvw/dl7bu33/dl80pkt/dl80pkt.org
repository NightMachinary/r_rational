I have a definite weakness for the sort of story that drops you into things without explaining too much and hoping that you pick things up along the way. Most of [[https://qntm.org/fiction][qntm's]] stories do that, and I love them for it.

Also, there are two bits of advice given to aspiring writers quite often. The first is to start as close to the inciting incident as possible, and the second is to write the first chapter and then throw it out, because the real story always starts in chapter two. I sort of waffle on how correct this is, but there are instances where I'll write things and think "man, I could have just cut off the front chunk and been fine".

That said, this is a story that I intend to be read from chapter one. :)
