Really enjoying this so far. I like that Juniper is at least starting underpowered compared to everyone else, though the rate of power increase is a little concerning. Going from "this skin tattoo is a deadly and imminent threat that I can't understand or manipulate" to "able to shift it far enough and with enough control to avoid anything vital" in one chapter feels almost deus ex machina.

Being largely cut-off from civilization, without a peaceful environment to setup grinding/power-leveling, and skill caps tied to ability scores do a lot to mitigate power creep, but two of those are circumstantial and the last one is likely munchkinable.

I'm just worried we'll end up in the same place as The Games we Play, where by the end every fight scene was basically "Once Jaune had thrown 37 suns at the boss, opened up a rift into an alter-dimension he was the god of, and assembled 1600 copies of the world's deadliest legendary weapons, the fight *really* began!"
