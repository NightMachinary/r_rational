I mean, there's two poles to a particular part of game design: Introduce mechanics as a character levels up, so the player isn't overwhelmed with rules; and introduce everything at the start, which necessarily involves rapid initial learning.

Nothing saying you can't do both!

A usual mechanic for that is the there's an additional cost beyond the skill level up per additional skill category, or quantity-of-skill-category has a cap based on level, or....

I'm sure you've got something good planned!
