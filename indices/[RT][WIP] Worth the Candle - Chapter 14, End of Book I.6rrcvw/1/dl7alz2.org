Thanks for posting! If you're a first-time reader, [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249?view_full_work=true][here's the link to the entire work]] or the [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][first chapter]], and here's a brief synopsis:

#+begin_quote
  Worth the Candle is a self-insert litRPG portal fantasy, loosely based on my personal experience of falling into a portal to another world and discovering that I had a character sheet attached to my soul.

You can download the whole thing (Book I) from AO3 as well using the "Download" button, but it doesn't preserve some of the CSS in epub, mobi, pdf, etc. formats (a relatively minor issue).

I very much appreciate all the people who have given words of support over the past three weeks, and all of the people who have pressed the buttons to make the metrics for this story increase. I like seeing numbers become bigger numbers.

Book II starts in probably a day or two.
