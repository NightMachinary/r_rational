  though the rate of power increase is a little concerning. Going from "this skin tattoo is a deadly and imminent threat that I can't understand or manipulate" to "able to shift it far enough and with enough control to avoid anything vital" in one chapter feels almost deus ex machina.

I strongly disagree. Amaryllis was like "woah, what the hell is with your learning so quickly?", so Juniper basically spent every second he could trying to powerlevel his not-getting-killed-by-the-tattoo skill over a couple of days, because he knew there would be no way the party would expect it, and that he absolutely /had/ to circumvent it ASAP.
