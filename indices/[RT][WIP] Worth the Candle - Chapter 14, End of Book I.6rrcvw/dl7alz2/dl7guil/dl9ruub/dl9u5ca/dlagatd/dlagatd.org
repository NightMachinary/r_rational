It /was/ made in the span of hours, I'm not sure what [[/u/PM_ME_OS_DESIGN][u/PM_ME_OS_DESIGN]] is talking about. The Fool's Choker was placed at the end of Chapter 12, the party talked for a few minutes afterwards; Chapter 13 started "not long after that" and consisted of the party breaking into the castle then waiting "an hour and a half" under Time-Out; Chapter 14 started immediately afterwards, the elevator plan took no more than half-an-hour.
