As others suggested, 'solve it with magic'--I personally prefer the idea that imparting an acceptable grasp of the language (by this point more archaic than when the ritual was made, or updated if rituals are easier to alter?) as part of the summoning process, because if you're going to go to all the effort of tearing open a hole in reality and bringing a living being through it /safely/ then you might as well add a language-imprinting section to the summoning ritual so that you don't have to spend months or years reaching a young child's level of communication with every summoned being.

If that's undesirable because you don't want there to be an easy way to magically transfer large amounts of information from brain to brain (also avertable by difficulty of recreation/alteration), you can have the 'Universal Translator' approach of a magical interface which automatically translates everything (and somehow preserving all joke-equivalents et cetera) or the anthropic approach of only summoning people from the worlds where the same language happened to evolve naturally by coincidence. (This, if I understand correctly, would require either 'English is a language of power there, but not in some other universes like ours' or 'English is the common language there, but there's /also/ an ancient language of Words of Power that can be learnt in a montage or magically.')
