I agree that saying a concept the language doesn't have would obviously be another way, so I guess it's whether you believe that a language is more likely to have a concept unintelligible than it is to use a wordplay, be it song, phrase or pun.

I don't agree that just having a pun is a good enough translation, you see it in mangas (and sometimes anime) a lot translators will put an asterisk and explain the pun where there is a visual pun or a written one. Which is what you were talking about kind of but this is in addition to colloquial translation. Of course it is possible that you could just rename the tribe in your example to fit with whatever word but as you get into more complicated word play it quickly fails, you also better hope the tribe name is never brought up again.

If you listen to subbed stuff you can hear often the failures of translation for rhymes and such.

I mean that's apparent from how few songs get translated, it happens most commonly in Chinese, Korean and Japanese. And in many pop cases lyrics are almost irrelevant so if you can get it sorta close you'll be fine.
