Anime and manga and other similar amateur (in the purest sense, work done for love) translations are quite a different matter than colloquial translations. The translator and the intended audience are explicitly interested in the cultural and linguistic environment of the original work.

Colloquial translations are telling the story in a new language. Rewording and rephrasing the text to carry the sense and feel of the original is the norm. When the original language is itself imagined (and may not have been imagined beyond a handful of words and names) even trying for the kind of transliteration you're suggesting seems rather a high hurdle to leap.
