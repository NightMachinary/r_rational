if its not important for the plot and you don't want to use it as a tool for having a chance to convey the experience why not just solve it with magic? to be honest if its not central to the plot who cares how likely is it that its unlikely they speak English? or alternatively you could just say the MC studied some random language at the university\school because of Reasons and was lucky enough that their language is the same\similar enough not to be an issue?
