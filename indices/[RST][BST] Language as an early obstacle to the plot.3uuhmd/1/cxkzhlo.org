Take a look at [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-world-waits-on-evil-hivers-eoa-ww.274791/][The World Waits on Evil]] for an example of a writer narrating an entire story in a not-quite english style due to the natives not having words for all of the concepts and connectives. Note how it is interesting at first as a cool idea, but quickly becomes annoying and disruptive as you have to go back and re-read things to understand their meaning. The writer sacrifices eloquence for realism, and I think in the final counting he comes out worse off as a result of that deal. It would have been fine as an early problem that was swiftly resolved, but keeping it any longer than that becomes problematic.

Seems relevant, anyway.
