Frankly, though, there's a stock solution for this. When he gets pulled over, he picks up a magic Translation Convention. But because you want to use the different languages as a plot point, for whatever reason he notices that he's not "actually" speaking english (or whatever his native language is).

Then you also have an excuse for him to be able to speak Local both fluently (magic translation) and badly (what he's learned 'without' the magic translation).

Or you could just do the "make him a linguist" thing. Depends on what you want him to be capable of with his pulled-over knowledge.
