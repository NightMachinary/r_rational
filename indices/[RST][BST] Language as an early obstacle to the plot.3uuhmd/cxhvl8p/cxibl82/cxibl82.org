Except that modern english with all of its messiness and borrowed words and phrases didn't even exist for most of human history, right? Furthermore, how is it that the Time Patrol only cares about sapient beings that are capable of using audible speech? What about beings that communicate with flashing lights?

I suppose it could be explained with audible language being naturally much more common throughout the multiverse in the first place, though I have no idea why that would be. Maybe whoever's running the simulation is a native english speaker, or it runs on SQL instead of Hexidecimal or Binary...
