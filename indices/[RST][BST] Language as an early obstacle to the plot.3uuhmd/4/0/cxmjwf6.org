There are quite a number of rationalists here suggesting the plot device of a linguist if I were to further explore this field. This is definitely ripe in plot opportunities, but I'd have to take a closer look and study up on linguistics (since while I am a professional engineer and amateur mathematician/logician, I am no linguist) before I decide if going in this direction is feasible. I am rather keen on it if possible though.
