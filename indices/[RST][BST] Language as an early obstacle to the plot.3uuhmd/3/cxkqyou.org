Fantasy stories often work on [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationConvention][Translation Convention]]. And that works for language-specific things too. If the characters don't speak English, and are saying some kind of thing that only makes sense in English, the reader is supposed to assume that the characters are "really" saying something equivalent in their own language.
