I care because I want to minimize suspension of disbelief. Ie., reducing the parts of the worldbuilding which can be explained by "oh it's coincidence", and increasing the parts that can be logically deduced/explained.

However, I never really thought about solving it with magic (brain-fart moment). Perhaps there could be a sort of linguistic magic that translates ideas/intentions into understandable language.
