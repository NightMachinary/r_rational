Not all languages even have a concept of rhyme in poetry. Even English didn't really consider it notable until the 10th century. If you're thinking in a language like that, you wouldn't expect "bokomon" (plane) to rhyme with "pazmaga" (train).

Seriously, I think the first hint you'd get would be trying to express a concept that doesn't /exist/ in the new language (which is what happened to Dave). Particularly when moving from one society to another with a completely different technological base, as here.

As for /Asterix/, my point is that virtually all literary translations are colloquial, and good colloquial translators will insert the equivalent of puns and plays on words to carry the sense and feel of the dialog into the new language. I've helped translators out with this before, and they spend quite a bit of effort on it.

While occasionally you get narrators doing something like:

#+begin_quote
  "Well his nose was thoroughly bent, eh?"

  This was hilarious, because in Spodnusian "bent" sounded a lot like the word for Marflexian flu, so it sounded like his nose was full of green mucus...
#+end_quote

Normally this kind of exposition is restricted to situations where the /characters/ are learning or encountering new languages, so the details of translation matter. And even there it's going to be at a minimum and limited to humorous works (I think Keith Laumer used this schtick a couple of times). More common you get things like:

#+begin_quote
  "You will be picked up by a peasant from the Vaccinae tribe."

  "Really, I didn't know you had to be vaccinated to get into Spain."
#+end_quote

I have no idea what play on words Uderzo had in the French original, and of course it would make no sense at all in first century Gaul. It doesn't matter. There was a play on words in the original. There's a play on words now. The colloquial sense of the language is carried on.
