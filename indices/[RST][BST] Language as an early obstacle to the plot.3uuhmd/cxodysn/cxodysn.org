Your protagonist got pulled into a different world. Why is he so special? In fact, maybe he isn't. Maybe there were previous events of this happening, hell, maybe it's fairly common. But because people aren't typically well suited to being forced into an entirely new dimension most of the time not much change is had. Where interdimensional entities have made a significant impact on history, their supernatural origins are transmuted by the constant re-telling of their fables into something unrealistic enough to be dismissed as fiction out of hand.

What does that mean for your protagonist? Cross cultural contamination, for one. Maybe interdimensional travelers have contaminated each world's major languages' jargon, syntax, and even grammar. Now, you're not working with a completely alien language, but something much more similar, and therefore comprehensible. Make your character a polyglot to begin with, and while you still have to take time to let them parse the language, they're not starting from square one.

And if you're wondering, this is basically my anthropic principle of interdimensional travel-- we don't see an interdimensional traveler be successful because they're just that special, we explicitly choose one of the luckier interdimensional travelers, who have an even easier job because it's been done before to some extent or another, for whatever reason.
