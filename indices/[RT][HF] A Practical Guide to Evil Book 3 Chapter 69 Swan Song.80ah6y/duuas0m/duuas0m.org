It strikes me how appropriate Bard is for Cat's nemesis. Bard is a Hero, possibly one of the greatest, but she's definitely not a hero. She's essentially impervious to direct conflict and instead uses more subtle manipulation, something that has typically been Cat's weakness. Even though Cat's shown herself to be good at twisting narratives, Bard's the master at it. Can't wait to see these two duke it out later on
