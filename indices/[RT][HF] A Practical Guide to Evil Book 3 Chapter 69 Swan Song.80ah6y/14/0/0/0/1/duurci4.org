Black doesn't care if she rebels or not so long as the Empire comes out better for it. While one might immediately say it being independent is bad, if Callow continued to serve as a buffer against enemies, a trade partner, and a supplier of food that had its own army to protect itself from outside threats but with no intent to I vade the Empire, he would /definitely/ chalk it up as a win.
