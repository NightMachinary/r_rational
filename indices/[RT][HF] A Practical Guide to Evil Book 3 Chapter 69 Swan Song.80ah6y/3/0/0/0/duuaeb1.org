Cat did outright state that she would gain her kingdom "by Name and by right," but that can only happen as long as Malicia has a reason to grant her that kingdom. With the weapon destroyed, Cat doesn't have the bargaining chip required to force Malicia to hand over Callow, which likely means no transition for her. More likely in my opinion is that she's going to kill Black and finally become the Black Knight in true villain tradition, stepping over the corpse of her predecessor.
