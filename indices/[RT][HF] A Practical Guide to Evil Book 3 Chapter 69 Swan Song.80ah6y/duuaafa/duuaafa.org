So I need someone to walk me through how Cat lost access to her Name waaayyyy back in Book One. Something to do with not being in tune with her Role/Alignment/Name, right?

Because it seems to me that a Black Knight just took a stand against his Empress to destroy a super weapon meant to strike fear into the hearts of the rest of continent.

It seems to me that even after considering his own reasons, that act comes out on the heroic end of the spectrum.

Amadeus is alive, but can he continue on as the Black Knight?
