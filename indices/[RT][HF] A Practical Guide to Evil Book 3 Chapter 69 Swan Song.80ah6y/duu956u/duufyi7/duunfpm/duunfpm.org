Precisely. Take note Catherine's nature now is one who won't be subjugated. Her Fae title and Name refuses to be ruled (her entire schtick is "we do not kneel").

Look at the map of Calernia. Everytime Procer takes arms against The Empire they undoubtedly came through the Red Vales and met the Empire on Callowan ground and the large majority of the casualties in that exchange were always Callowans, a population notorious for their grudges.

There is no way she or her people can accept Callow being ruled by the First Prince as a vassal state. So peaceful integration is not a viable solution because as you said yourself, the Principate is notorious for it's civil wars.
