I think the biggest issue is the fact that doing so would cause callow to have a neigh unfixable war problem. As of now cat thinks she can at least keep callow relatively at peace given enough time but under the procer that would not be possible due to two things. First is that procer is always either in a civil war or on the verge of one which means that callow would almost certainly be drawn into more conflicts. Invasions by praes would also start up again which she really wants to avoid. Combine these with the fact that it has been said that it would take generations for callow to recover from procer invading and you get a future where callow is basically stuck in a hole as a poverty stricken nation unless something really unexpected happens.
