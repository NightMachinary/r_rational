1) Can it? Who does it have that can pull that out? The legions, as Cat pointed out, would probably side with her, at least enough of them that they can't burn everything down, a lot of Black loyalists are dead. Cat can probably stalemate Black, and the Woe can probably stalemate the Calamities, at least for long enough for the Princely legions to arrive. Warlock will be addressed in 4)

2) Assuming Cat goes semi-legitimate and works out a deal with Procer, those fantassins will be under very tight supervision. The Reforms will likely spread to the Principalities, and well, a lot of them will be dead anyway thanks to the crusade.

3) Now, Callow has, hypothetically, the might of the Principate behind it. Sure, now it's The Principalities of Summerholm, Liesse, and Daoine, or whatever they end up being called, and when the dead king attacks or the Chain of Hunger expands, hypothetically, the principate comes to its aid. Now, the Dread Empire will be another of the same.

4) Warlock. A fair point. His threat, however, is fairly mitigated. -a) He doesn't really care about the temporal conflict. Sure, he'll follow Black, but Hierophant is following Cat, so he'd be not so eager to break out the big stuff. -b) A lot of those doomsday protocols are too powerful, take too much setup, or are fairly obscure. And now that Cat's working with the light, she has access to a whole lot more counters. -c) Augar. Any attempt that Warlock has to come up with something big will be countered, as Augar will be on the lookout. And with Cat, Hierophant, and Archer, they can probably defuse these before they get out of hand.
