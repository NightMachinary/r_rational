I mean, this is assuming that Praes won't employ a "burn it all down" policy as soon as Callow breaks away. Praes still has Legions, Warlock and a whole host of potentially devastating rituals. In comparison, Callow has no real army, a lot of Cat's power base has strong ties to the Empire and it's occupied by enemy forces.

So in theory it might be the right move but in practice Praes would make a graveyard out of Callow before the crusade arrived. That wasn't stated in the text but I assume there is always an undercurrent of "or else" in any deals Cat makes with Malicia. They are the bad guys after all.
