As I pointed out below, that's not so clear-cut. The Legions, as pointed out in-chapter, may not be so willing to take orders from The Tower, especially if Cat promises the High Lord's heads on a pike. Warlock is a big threat, but Augar, plus Cat's mobility, Hierophant, and Archer mean the threat is reduced somewhat. And rituals are the same deal.

This is, of course, dependant on good cooperation with Procer, but Cordelia seems reasonable enough. I'd love a Malicia/Amadeus relationship between Cordelia and Cat, for instance.
