  Convince me that Callow shouldn't open the godsdamned Vales to the Principate
#+end_quote

I am honesty not convinced this isn't the best strategy here? I mean, I'm biased, as I'm unironically rooting for the Principate, but higher taxes and less genocide seems like a good deal. And the whole â€˜a fresh new principate' bit I feel is weak because the prinicipates are not a homogenous culture. If Callow can have separate cultures to the extent it did, despite decades (centuries?) of the unifying force of a common enemy, I think the principates of new Procer could maintain a lot of their identity.
