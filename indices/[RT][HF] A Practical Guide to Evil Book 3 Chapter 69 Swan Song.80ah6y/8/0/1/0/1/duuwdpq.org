Cat is there. Also one of the problems Black mentioned was that the device is not really theirs, so it's use is greatly stunted without having the Named Mage in question to which it is keyed to. That's a serious stumbling block for any would be successor. If they went through with the plan Cat would also have powerful men under her command there which would further hamper any would be succesor's use of the weapon.

But all of this is moot since Black already destroyed the Gestalt or its bindings.
