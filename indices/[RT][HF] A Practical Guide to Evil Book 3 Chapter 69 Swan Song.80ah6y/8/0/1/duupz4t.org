No. To quote her "We've seen our forbears USE these types of things and fail." She had absolutely no intention of using it at all. Just to have it there so the other guys know not to fuck with her.

And I find it perfectly laughable that a goddamn Warlock with decades of experience in the fullness of his power and a Hierophant with eyes that can perceive and deconstruct miracles can't create a suitable place to contain such a thing? I mean by the gods people it's not Impossible! Just look at Keter! The Dead King breaks Crusades like we break toothpicks. Why can't they emulate that success?

Oh, so now you're going to tell me that the Ranger easily enters such areas? Well buddy, how many Named of Ranger's calibre do you see running around?

Also the main benefit of Liesse is that it's COMPLETELY MOVABLE. So if Mario the Red Plumber and Luigi the Green Sorcerer come to destroy the array, poof. Sorry Mario, you're array is in another dimension.

Hell,if you get the thing that allows you to map all of the hells and Arcadia you could hide the bloody thing any place. Shit you could probably orchestrate a randomized rotation shift every 3 days or so. Heroes can't destroy it if they can't get to it.

Black was way too rash here.
