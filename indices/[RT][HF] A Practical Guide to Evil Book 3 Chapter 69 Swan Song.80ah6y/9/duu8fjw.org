Jeez, the outcome was already bittersweet. Now it's just shitty for everyone.

Malicia loses her superweapon deterrent and is left with half an army. She doesn't have any particular reason to not let Callow be basically independent at this point - as Cat pointed out, the choice between Praes and Procer is starting to look almost cosmetic, and Malicia needs that goodwill desperately.

Cat has tens of thousands of wights roaming around an exploded city. Did Black destroy the weapon or the Daoine souls? Hopefully the former, for the sake of the Watch.

Also, Black and Cat just got blown up, so there's that.
