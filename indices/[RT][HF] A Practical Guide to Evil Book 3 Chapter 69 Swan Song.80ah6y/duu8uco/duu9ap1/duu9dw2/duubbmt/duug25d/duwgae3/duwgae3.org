That's just one hypothesis by Black. He noticed that Bard's existence meant that the Gods Below had a comparable "F U Card" in their hand. He then wondered if they squandered it on Triumphant (who achieved nothing on the long term) or the Dead King (who's ultimately a contained threat).

One commenter on EE's website wondered if they had kept that ace in reserve and blew it on Catherine's existence. While improbable, it's not impossible considering that Cat had a couple moments that felt like divine providence. Most notably in Liesse the first time (Chider should have killed her) and the second time (a post-transition Heiress really shouldn't have lost to the Squire).
