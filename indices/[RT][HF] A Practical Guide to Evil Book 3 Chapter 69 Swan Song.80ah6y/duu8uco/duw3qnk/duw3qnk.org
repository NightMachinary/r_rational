I think it was pretty much a win-win situation for bard though.

If the weapon stays, it's hero bait, just like black said. More heroes = more opportunities for bard to influence the narrative.

The weapon getting destroyed by Black means he's lost Malicia's trust and could end up with him either getting killed or going rogue or something else unpredictable, but in most cases his power and influence is reduced.

In terms of overall victory I feel like this is a lesser win for the bard, but in terms of crushing black it's certainly an overwhelming victory.
