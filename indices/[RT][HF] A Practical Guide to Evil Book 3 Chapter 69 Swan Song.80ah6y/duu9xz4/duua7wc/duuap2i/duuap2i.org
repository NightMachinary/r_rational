Assassinating Fae Cat would be very /difficult/ for Malicia to do.

The other Legions are gutted, as mentioned, her assassin's are currently very busy with their enemies rising up, Cat can both detect /and/ know of a way to permakill Assassin, Black won't let Malicia go through with it, and Hierophant can convince his dad that its better to follow Cat and Black than Malicia, not that he needs much since he does his own thing and doesn't care about politics. Captain's dead, Hunter is off doing her own thing, and the Diabolist just got owned, so there's very in little in the way of Name help the Empress could use.
