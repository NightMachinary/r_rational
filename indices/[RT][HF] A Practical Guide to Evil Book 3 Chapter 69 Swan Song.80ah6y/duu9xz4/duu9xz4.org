Yet another confirmation, if one was needed, that Catherine has no idea what she's doing.

The way she explicitely threatened both the Empress and Black with sedition in particular seems foolhardy to me. I mean, it's clearly an empty threat: she would get murdered 20 times before that happened. If she wanted to cross the Tower, announcing it to the Empress would be the most counter-productive course of action.
