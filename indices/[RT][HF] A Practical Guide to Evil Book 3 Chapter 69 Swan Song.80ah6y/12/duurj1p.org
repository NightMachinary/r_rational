Oof. I'm having a really tough time deciding which option was the smarter one here.

Keep the array: You gain a MAD deterrent that may frighten enough countries into pulling out of a Crusade. On the other hand, it may do the exact opposite - Good is sure to want to counter such an Evil device, which at the very least means Heroes rise from all over. If you're lucky, you can use the array as a beacon and slaughter them as they come. But Heaven is usually the lucky one, and Black's seen that the Calamities are starting to have trouble with Hero bands even before Good is boosting their power. And if Praes is /really/ unlucky, a Crusade might take place anyway if Good sends an angel to inspire it. And that's not even counting the issues at home; Daione would likely revolt (or at least pull out completely) as the souls of their Gestalt is taken over by Villains full time. And the rest of Callow isn't going to be super happy with Cat's actions; she's somewhat liked (and plenty feared) right now, but her siding with the Tower and endorsing the use of a superweapon built on the corpses of 100,000 Callowans and powered by millions of Deoraithe souls is probably enough to turn the country against her, even if it /did/ mean preventing a Crusade. At the very least the Order of the Broken Bells would likely desert.

Destroy the array: The obvious problem is that without a deterrent a Crusade is going to happen, almost for certain. Not due to ideological reasons ("We must fight to destroy this superweapon!") but for practical ones ("Lulz, let's invade because Praes has never been weaker"). The Crusade will be weaker without Good acting to counter the array, and Heroes will be fewer, but almost half the Legions are gone and Callow's already bleeding dry. Daione might still rebel or pull support entirely, depending on what happened when the array was destroyed. Callow will likely remain more pro-Cat, but they're still in no shape to fend off an invasion. The biggest reason I think this might be the worse option though is because /Bard seems to have wanted this to happen./ That's... not good. As a general rule of thumb, I think any time Bard's plan is working means it's bad news for our protagonist.

That said, it feels to me like the second option was the better one. Black's been influenced by Bard, sure, but Malicia's definitely been straying from their original plan. These kinds of superweapons were researched before by the Calamities and then sealed away because they knew they weren't worth the cost to even complete them. Malicia unilaterally decided to go back on that plan. The problem is that with Black now in rebellion (and Cat on Malicia's side), odds are that Praes is going to default back to old school villainy, which is how Malicia's been sliding for years. Black was the one pushing to destroy the narrative of Praes and Callow, while Malicia's been bogged down in politics. Without Black keeping her in check, I think she's going to go the way of most Dread Empresses... and Cat's willing to follow along, because she was only about breaking the narrative if it benefitted Callow and (erroneously, in my mind) thinks that following Malicia will do that best. Dang.

Edit: More random thinking... I wonder if Bard messed up here? She succeeded in breaking apart Black and Malicia, but in doing so she threw the traditional narrative out the window. Usually a Dread Empress gets a superweapon, Heroes get called, the Villain gets defeated, and the cycle resets. Now things continue on as they have been; a Crusade gets called, but it's more of a traditional conflict than a Named one. And Praes, even divided, still has an advantage in Names. A Crusade will be hard to repel, but it doesn't necessarily end with the Villains losing. The biggest issue is that after, Malicia gets to keep ruling (if she wins). She can still proceed with the Reforms and her and Black's original dream. That is, if she isn't backsliding like Black suspects. Still, I think Black acting as he did at least gives his vision a /chance/ of victory eventually, whereas Malicia's plan would eventually /guarantee/ defeat.
