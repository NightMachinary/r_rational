Did black accept it, or is Black acting against Malicia's picking up of the idiot ball, assuming you think keeping Liesse is idiot ball material for a dynasty of an evil empire founded by/for reforms focused on professional soldiery and civil improvements. This doesn't even have to be a hard break between Black and Malicia, thhis is a private conversation between Black, Malicia, and Cat; I think it will be a permanent break, because we've seen the trust between Malicia and Black eroding, and Malicia won't admit Black acted in the best interest of the empire as he saw it, or failing that she isn't willing to grant that much of a treat/autonomy/trust to her warlord.
