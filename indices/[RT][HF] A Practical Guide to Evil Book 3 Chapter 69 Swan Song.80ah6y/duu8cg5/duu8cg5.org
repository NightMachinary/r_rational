You know, Black's objections here actually felt more emotional than logical, which is /really/ weird to see. At best, he's leaning heavily into narrative logic.

Even more surprising was that Cat actually /agreed/ with Malicia, which I can only take as a very worrisome sign about her mental state. It makes a certain sense to keep the superweapon since the damage has already been done, but damn Cat is just ice cold now.
