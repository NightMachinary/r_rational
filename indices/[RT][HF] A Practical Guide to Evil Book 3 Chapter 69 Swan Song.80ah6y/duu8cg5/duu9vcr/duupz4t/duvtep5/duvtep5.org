  Oh, so now you're going to tell me that the Ranger easily enters such areas? Well buddy, how many Named of Ranger's calibre do you see running around?

Ranger is an old monster allied to evil (Black) and the Dead King has existed since the early days of sorcery. To me this implies you have people like White Knight (assuming his pre-life visions are as broken as Ranger's aspects) or an Elminster or Gandalf (wandering age of wonders wizard who is more eldrich incarnation of magical good than human) out there. In that light Black's argument that Liesse isn't just hero bait, but bait for boring invincible +plumbers+ hero's who will break the empire seems as plain sense as Quirrell's do not provoke powerful and vicious opponents.
