  To me Black was simply making the sensible observation that at some point in the future, there was pretty much guaranteed to be an Emperor / Empress who would use the fortress and Praes would suffer the consequences.

Absolutely. Keep in mind what happened regarding the Still Water project previously. From chapter 47:

#+begin_quote
  “Everyone involved was killed and their souls bound to prevent necromancy. Uncle said if it ever got out we could do that there would be a Crusade mobilized within the month.”
#+end_quote

Amadeus literally murdered and stole the souls of everyone who worked on the project so word of it could never get out. And then he found out Malicia was like "Nah, let's totally get news of AN EVEN WORSE PROJECT out in public. That'll be a deterrent!"

For 20 years Black has opposed even acknowledging any of the Dark Day Protocol projects. Malicia's known this, and went ahead with a plan to announce she has /two/ of them at her beck and call.
