From Black's point of view, Malicia's Name finally got to her and she's going down with a bad case of villainous madness. When Malicia talks, all he hears is "I have a superweapon, my plan cannot fail".

And that's how Bard fucked him over. By killing Sabah in a way he didn't see coming, she convinced Black that he needed to step up his game and be way better at manipulating stories. He will NOT go for the old and tired superweapon bullshit no matter what he's told, because that's how Praes starts collapsing in the stories.
