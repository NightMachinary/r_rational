Black has made his justification pretty clear. The thing is a hero magnet, and he is in a literal sense, doomed. He predicts he dies in 2 years, Captain is already gone, it was a close thing with the Hedge Mage and Warlock. The gambit by Bard convinced him he can't stand up to the wave of heroes that would follow the use of the weapon.

So now he has two choices, inevitable defeat to the heroes, or the one in a million vs the crusade.
