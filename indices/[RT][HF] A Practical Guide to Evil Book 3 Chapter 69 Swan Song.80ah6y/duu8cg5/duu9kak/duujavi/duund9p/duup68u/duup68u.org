But that Old Monster Schtick goes both ways. There's a certain Villain that many hope will never return as an example.

If the White Knight isn't the sharpest blade the Heavens can bare, why should the Black Knight be the any different for the Gods Below?

I'm all for a bunch of Old Monsters duking it out. Also this begs the question of why Ranger hasn't killed those "Old Monsters" yet? They seem like blokes that are right up her alley.
