I'm actually super disappointed by this chapter. Completely out of left field, Malacia becomes a trope villian. Her entire reason for existence is to /kill the fucking story/. It's implied it was her idea in the first place. She has said multiple times that there is a reason trying to take over the continent with a superweapon failed, because it's written in Creation. Yes, it's realistic to think "maybe just this once" - but she's been consistent with the position for /40 years/ against all other hardship and even the last time Cat talked to her drove home making the empire futureproof and stable. Magic nuclear deterrent does not stability make.

Seriously. This feels completely out of character to her. "Taking over the continent with an army of invisible tigers will never work also here is our flying city that can open permanent hell portals powered by the nascent god made of ten thousand dead souls we stole".

If this turns into another Wandering Bard "all according to plan" I'm shanking someone.
