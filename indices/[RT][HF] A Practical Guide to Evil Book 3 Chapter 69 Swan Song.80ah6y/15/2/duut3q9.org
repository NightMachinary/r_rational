I'm annoyed by it too, but I don't agree it's out of left field. Malicia and Black being on the outs because she keeps moving away from their original goal and closer to being like an old school villain has been a recurring theme in their interactions. Up until now Black has allowed it despite his reservations. Now she reveals that she planned to acquire a doomsday device, but not to use it, and for Black it was a bridge too far (especially since they had stopped research on these kinds of things before because they agreed even having them was too dangerous).

Granted, Black was manipulated by Bard to make this the pivot; but I don't think he was wrong. Malicia's way would almost certainly fall into the old school villain narrative of acquiring a super weapon and being taken down by Good. Giving into narrative to acquire power is not the way you break a narrative.
