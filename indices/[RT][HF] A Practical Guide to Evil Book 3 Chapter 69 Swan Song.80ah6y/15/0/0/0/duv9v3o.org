I think you've connected two things that don't necessarily connect. A lot of people think that MAD is a bad doctrine IRL.

And whatever protections you might be able to place around existing MAD weapon systems - which, given the propensity of humans for mistakes, aren't great even in relatively stable places like the US: United_States_military_nuclear_incident_terminology - the story will conjure up heroes and villains that could repurpose it.
