Liesse can't seem to catch a break. First it was converted into a Diabolist's paradise, them the vast majority of its populace were transformed into wights, then it got phased out of Creation and NOW it's going to become a "violently haunted" wasteland.

Damn, what the founders of Liesse do to piss fate off so much?
