There's an angel's corpse there for unspecified reasons. The murder of a purely “good” entity might have something to do with why Liesse seems to be cursed.

That, or maybe it's stuck in a rule of three with regards to Cat. The first was the fight with the Lone Swordsman. The second was the fight with Ubua. No idea who the third might be, but my money's on the Bard.

It even fits the convention so far, with the first being a win for Cat, and the second being a “draw” (She killed Ubua, but Liesse is fucked and her relationship with Black/Malicia is ruined)
