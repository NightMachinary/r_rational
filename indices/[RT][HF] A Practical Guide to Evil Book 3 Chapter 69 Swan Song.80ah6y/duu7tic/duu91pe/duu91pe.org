Holding onto the weapon, and by extension the mass of souls powering it probably makes a permanent enemy out of the Deoraithe. With it destroyed and the sould freed they might be a viable alliance moving forward, or it might even draw them closer in.

Not necessarily a good trade, especially if this interferes with the Watch's power, but it's better than nothing.
