This story seems promising. Out of curiosity, is Nerra based loosely on Kreia from KOTOR II? They both have white hair, brown robes, an affinity for force sight, and a philosophy of viewing the light and dark sides of the Force as two parts of a greater whole. If Nerra starts talking in cryptic, manipulative half-truths, I'm calling shenanigans.
