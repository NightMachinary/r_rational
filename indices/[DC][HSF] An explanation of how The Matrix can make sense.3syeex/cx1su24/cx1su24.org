I still believe that Zion and what is believed to be the real world, is another simulation from the same AI that run the Matrix. Basically, when they escape the Matrix, they just go to another simulation to make they feel like they outsmarted the AI and that they are free.

That would be a way for the machines to handle the few human outliers who might unravel the truth. This explain quite well why Neo has powers in the "real world" and why he can find himself in Mobil Ave (the train station)even though he is not plugged to anything (he would just have been switched to a third simulation).

Considering this hypothesis, the motive of the AI to use humans in a simulation is unknowable. Basically, my view is that everything that we see in the movie is a lie. The characters might not even exist at all in a real world, or might exist in a non human form, or might be human used by the machines for whatever purpose.
