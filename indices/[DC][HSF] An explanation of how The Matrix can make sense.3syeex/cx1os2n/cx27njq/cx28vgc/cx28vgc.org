Notice that very long dreams can be experienced in only a few minutes. Or at least it feels that way.

Could it be that our brains are very "underclocked" when we are awake and only work at full power when we are asleep, working for the machines?

Cue "we only use 10% of our brain" myth.

  It may feel like longer but that's because perception of time and coherence are part of what shuts down in a dream as well...

I bet you learned that in the Matrix ;)
