Makes sense. The rational for the Matrix was that people were not happy with the perfect world simulation that was originally created. The matrix was then a slightly grim simulation, and it would make sense that the world of Zion was a more grim simulation, for those who were not content with the amount of grimness in the Matrix.

Supporting evidence: the harvesting power from people theory is bollocks, and Neo can still use his powers in the world of Zion.
