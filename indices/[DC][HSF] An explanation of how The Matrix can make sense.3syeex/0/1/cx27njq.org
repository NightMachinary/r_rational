The problem with dreams is that while they don't make sense (not that TV makes all that much sense either, between the dumbed down plots and large fraction of gibberish called 'advertisements'), we don't spend much time dreaming. Total REM sleep makes up only a fraction of the 8 hours asleep, and dreams only make up a fraction of that. I think the estimate is that people spend maybe an hour total dreaming? (It may feel like longer but that's because perception of time and coherence are part of what shuts down in a dream as well; we've all had dreams that seemed to last for hours or years, but recordings and the lucid dream research show that most dreams last something ridiculously short like 10 minutes.) In contrast, the average American spends something gross like 5+ hours watching TV.

So creepy as it may seem, the Architect would get easily 5x more productivity out of hijacking TV rather than dreams.
