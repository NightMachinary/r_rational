First of all, despite this being a review of a nonfiction work, I'm going to approve it. When [[/u/seraphnb]] handed this subreddit to me, one of the requirements was that we /not/ toe the easy, dismissive, "Blue vs Green IS THE MINDKILLER" party line here.

HOWEVER! Ground rules:

- Is and ought are not allowed to mix without meta-ethical justification. You can state a position, but you must make explicit all your normative presuppositions for that position. For instance, "universal health care is affordable in every country and has a higher preference-utilitarian score than empirically-observed non-universal market-pricing systems for health-care, therefore we should prefer universal health care to market-pricing health-care" is acceptable. "Universal health-care must be prevented at all costs because it expands government" is *not* acceptable: you've sneaked in the normative /value/ that we must /minimize government/.

- Likewise, you /will/ end up posting something based on tribalistic loyalties. /You are human/; this is what humans do. Again: your tribalism must be explicitly noted rather than sneaked in under cover of night. "I oppose universal health-care because the rest of my Republican tribe does" /is/ an acceptable statement. "Solidarity against American imperialism in Syria!" is /not/ acceptable: you've failed to specify which tribe you belong to, and therefore have no grounds for demanding others join your tribe.

- For God's sake, /try/ to stay focused on the issue of rationality. If there's a core point here from the point of view of MIRI/CFAR/LW "rationalists", it's that social irrationality has grown from irritating AM-radio cancer to a strong causative factor in failing to address existential risks. Note the keywords: remember that Rationalists Care About Existential Risks, and /stay focused/.

These kinds of discussions should be considered a kind of rationalist weightlifting: we are attempting to be rational about things that are very hard to be rational about.

Have fun.
