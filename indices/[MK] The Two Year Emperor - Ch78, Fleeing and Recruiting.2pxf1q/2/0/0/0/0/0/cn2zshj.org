Nope, godly power is not physics-abiding. None of this is physical in any sense, it's all somewhere between magical/spiritual/metaphorical.

I picture the mantle of death (again, a metaphorical thing, not a physical thing) as belonging to the current owner of the portfolio. It fills the owner up with power, maintains their immortality, etc. All of those things are generated from the mantle and then imbued into the god in question. When the mantle switches owners, the new person gets filled with the same power that the old owner had, and all the new juice flows to the new owner.

Divine power does not obey any sort of physics.

Yes, when Suze got the mantle she was given a duplicate powerlevel / powerset to what Neklos had.

Yes, until Neklos actually dies there is a higher amount of "death god energy" in the world then there was before Suze took the mantle.

Yes, Neklos still has / had enough power to sustain himself against the black hole. Remember, from his perspective he was only in the black hole for one round. There wasn't enough time for the divine power to drain out of him before he stepped back into the universe at the end of time and promptly died.

Before you ask: Suze has no worshippers now. At the end of time, Neklos had no worshippers. The reason he died instantly and she didn't is because she is getting a minimal amount of charge just from the fact that undead exist, deaths are happening, etc. By the time Neklos escapes from the black hole absolutely everything is gone (yes, that includes the incorporeals -- statistically speaking, they were destroyed eons before he escaped), and there is nothing to provide him even a small amount of power.
