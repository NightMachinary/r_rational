So, at the instant the decision was made to turn Suze into a God, power starts transferring. Is godly power a physics-abiding object? If power is physically contained with Neklos, how does it escape the black hole?

If it is no with the god, it could be remotely stored. Does it abide light-laws? Will calling upon it have lightspeed lag? Can a spell leave a black hole, if you were shielded from time?

Also...

Once Suze gets her godly powers, is it a duplicate of what Neklos had. During the transfer, since Neklos could stillresist the black hole (great amount of power), does the total amount of death god power in the universe increase until it is removed from Neklos?

And... If Suze obtains a fraction of Neklos' power, does that mean that the amount remaining with Neklos is enough to allow him to resist a black hole?
