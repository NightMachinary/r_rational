- Right now, Suze doesn't have a specific agenda aside from "stop whatever it is that's hurting me" and "don't die."
- Right at the moment, Suze has exactly zero direct worshippers. She's starving to death, sustained only by "ambient" sources such as the existence of undead, which is enough to stave off [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalExistenceFailure][CriticalExistenceFailure]] for a while, but not forever.
- Jake is over in Flobovia trying to upgrade an entire country (and, later, an entire continent) through the Singularity in under a month. He would be happy to deal with Suze if she came to him, but he has no way to go to her.
- Weaker...yes and no. When she got the office, she was rank 20 because that was the level that it had just been at. She has no direct worshippers right now so she's losing ranks as time goes on. At the moment she's still got a boat-ton of power, but it's fading away pretty quickly. She doesn't know how to /use/ all of her power at the moment, but the power tends to take care of things for her (moving her around, killing people) when she wants something but isn't thinking about actually doing them...much the same way that you can catch a ball if you just reach for it, but not if you try to consciously think about how you need to move your arm. None of the other gods would like to tangle with her right now, but in a few more days / weeks they might be up for it.
- Suze /is/ on her power trip. She spent the first week learning how to handle the divine senses and such but since then she's been killing or torturing everyone who ever harmed her or anyone she cares about.
- In the Forgotten Realms setting (canon D&D), Cyric is the god of intrigue. The characters haven't told me whether there is one in 2YE or not, but I think the answer is no.
