A few questions:

-Is Suze trying to turn Death's agenda into something Lawful Good?

-Suze's hunger is overcoming her rational though and self-control. Is it something specific to Death? So far, we know that Gods gain power through the number of worshippers and their prayers directed towards them. This extra 'need' either adds a new layer of complexity or contradicts that theory.

-Where is Jake in all of this? He could grant her favors. Ultimately, Suze's agenda is in direct conflict with Jake's no-death-no-disease utopia project. I have a feeling Jake and Suze will have to form a contract of sorts, with Jake making concessions (as a God, she can take things from him).

-Suze is now evidently weaker than the other Gods. If her power is proportional to how many lives she takes and how many undead there are, she will have to kill a lot more to gain Neklos' rank among the Gods. On that Jake contract again, and limitation on the number of Deaths would mean a limitation on her power.

-Why has Suze not gone through her power trip? I mean, interactions with people you can kill with a flick of a finger will eventually turn relationships vile and dislikable. They know their life is in jeopardy when approaching you, and you know they can't touch you and you can escape all negative effects of your actions. She has to, at some point, consider humans as playthings until she either considers herself as a God and humans beneath her, or pulls her shit together and establishes some rules. She's done neither, but since Godhood doesn't grant Moral Integrity +10, it's bound to happen.

-Is there a God of Conspiracies and Secret Plans? If yes, what's (S)he up to?
