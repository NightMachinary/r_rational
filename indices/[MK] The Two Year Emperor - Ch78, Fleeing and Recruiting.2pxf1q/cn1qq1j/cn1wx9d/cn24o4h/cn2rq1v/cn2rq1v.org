The mantle was taken from Neklos, yes. After it transferred there would have been a small amount of inertia -- he would have kept his power for a few hours or maybe a day -- but it would have faded quickly. From his perspective, he was only in the black hole for one round so there was no perceptible amount of fading while he was in there. He then stepped out into a universe where even the protons had decayed away. He promtly died.
