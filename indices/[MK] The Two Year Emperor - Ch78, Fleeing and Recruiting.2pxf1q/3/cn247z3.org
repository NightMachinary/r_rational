I wasn't expecting to see Ellen again. She's important enough that we see what happens to her after her interactions with Suze? Her first reaction on seeing a murder is to run away, even with a witness to her innocence - a witness she knows is on the FLEA list and therefore easily identified. When accosted by a justiciar, she momentarily incapacitates him and escapes. That guy was there to keep order at the give-people-superpowers machine, so he's almost certainly been through it himself. Ellen's daughter is trained to know when to stay quiet. Upon escaping, Ellen immediately starts looking for resources (asking about a job). She weaves through shops and alleys and leaves obstacles behind her when she thinks she's picked up a tail. When a justiciar tries to arrest her, one of her first thoughts is "How does he know my name?" She ends up staying with a relative on a farm who is willing to provide shelter at a moment's notice without question.

None of that is too far out of the ordinary for a nervous quick-witted person in an abusive relationship, I suppose, but I'm not sure if I buy that. Pleased to meet you, Lady Shadow.
