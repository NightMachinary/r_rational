I'm reading the prologue right now, and there's something that really bugs me...

Is there a reason why in this world, Go is played on a 17x17 grid (instead of 19x19), with white starting first (instead of black) and with the stones being put on the squares (instead of the intersections) ? At first I thought the 17x17, white starting first part was a dig at older (15th century) customs (although the 17x17 part would still be dubious), but the squares thing still doesn't fit.
