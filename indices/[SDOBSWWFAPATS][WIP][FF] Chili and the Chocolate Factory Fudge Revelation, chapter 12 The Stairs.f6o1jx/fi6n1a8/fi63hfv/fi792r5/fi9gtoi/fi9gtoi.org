I really like how this story dials up the insanity just enough to really highlight it. Like, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory was /insane/, but we somehow rolled with it because Gene Wilder seems so amiable. The fat kid getting sucked up the chocolate pipes legit gave me nightmares as a kid. Honestly though, Wonka was a sociopath and Bucket is only just enough more blatant that it makes us actually question it.
