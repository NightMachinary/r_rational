Finally picked this up and this story is perfect and just as insane as it needs to be.

It's like that line from hitchhikers guide to the galaxy: "There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable." But instead of the universe it's the original chocolate factory story.

Also, I'm still dying from Don Quixote being described as "a scathing 17th century diatribe against the viability of wind power."
