This chapter was absolutely incredible, and certainly my favorite of the series thus far. The puns were incredible, and the wordplay was even better.

I really liked juror, and I'm very sad to see him go. That being said, I couldn't imagine a more dark yet hilarious way to see it happen.

Thank you for the incredible series, and I can't wait for more!
