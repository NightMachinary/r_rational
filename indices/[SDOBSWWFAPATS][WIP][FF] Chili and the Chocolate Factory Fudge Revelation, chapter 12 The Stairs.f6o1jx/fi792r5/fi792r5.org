You know, I though this fic was kind of moving away from the spirit of the original story, with all the violence and the dark humor...

And then I watched the 70s movies, and yeesh. I mean, it's kind of zany, but it still has scenes like Wonka making fun of a woman while she watches her son drown in a river of chocolate, and the Oompa Loompas sing about how he deserves it because he's so fat. Ouch.

Also that one scene where a cop tells a woman the terrorists will only release her husband if she gives them her stash of WonkaBars and she goes "... Shit. I need to think about this."
