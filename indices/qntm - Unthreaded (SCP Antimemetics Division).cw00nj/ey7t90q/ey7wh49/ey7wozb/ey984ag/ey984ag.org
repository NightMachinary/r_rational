This chapter is the continuation of two storylines: Marion Wheeler's and the one with the ghost foundation.

You can skip the ghost one. It's by a different author, and feels more gimmicky, less well-written than the mainline antimemetics series. It really doesn't have that inexplicable oppressing feeling that the qntm stories have.
