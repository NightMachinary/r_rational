How can you possibly mount any kind of defense when you don't even know you're under attack? Anyone who ever found out about SCP-3125's invasion either had their mind ripped out on the spot and their entire personal history and body of work erased, or wiped their own memories with amnestics to make it stop attacking them. You don't even have to know it exists, even suspicion that something like it /could/ exist is enough to draw its attention to you.

Even right up until the very second before SCP-3125 fully manifested, nobody had the faintest idea it was there. Marion Wheeler said it best:

  "Do you see? It's a defense mechanism. This information-swallowing behaviour is just the outer layer, the poison coating. It protects the entity from discovery while it infests our reality.

  "And as years pass, the manifestations will continue, growing denser and knitting together... until the whole world is drowning in them, and everybody will be screaming 'Why did nobody realise what was happening?' And nobody will answer, because everybody who realised was killed, by this system...
