That was good. Certainly Better than I expected. The worldbuilding fit better than I expected it to, or maybe I just got used to the style after the first couple chapters. Navigating through Red saying things without any or very little in-text indication can be a little strange, occasionally I lost track of who was talking right then.

Those were the only really glaring flaws I noticed while reading, though. I'd recommend it to people, with the addendum that if the details about the world didn't interest them to probably give it up.
