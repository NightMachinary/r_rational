I can't say I liked this one too much. The prose is good and the battles are exciting but the story is just a typical darker retelling of the game. I didn't really like the main character and his narration. He's very stoic and doesn't show much emotion so I couldn't really empathize with him. He doesn't come across as a nice person so I had a hard time rooting for him. At times it felt like the story was a bit too dark just for the sake of being dark. Your mileage may vary though, and I know [[/u/DaystarEld]] liked this one.
