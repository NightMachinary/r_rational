Thanks for the feedback :) I agree on all points: his writing style was very compelling once I got past the initial unfamiliarity with the tone, and his characters have very distinct voices. But yes, it's definitely much more comfortable with the world-as-it-is... there are some interesting attempts at explaining pokemon in realistic context, but not in treating them as "real," so to speak.
