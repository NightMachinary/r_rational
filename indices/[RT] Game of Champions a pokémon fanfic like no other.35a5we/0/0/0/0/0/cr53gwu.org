I'm up to chapter 6. With this story, I think if you examine each paragraph separately s/he's a much better writer than you in a strictly technical sense. The descriptions are more rich, the world is more vivid, and the "characterizations" are a lot stronger. (Yours has been rapidly growing chapter by chapter in this regard - I haven't seen your re-writes but the later chapters are markedly better.)

But I personally liked your story as a whole better. This one more or less playing everything straight, and it feels like I pretty much know exactly what I'm going to be getting from chapter to chapter. With yours I felt a flair of unpredictability and the characters were curious about things as I would be.

I also find it kind of jarring in this story how /all/ the pokemon are pretty much all sentient, even down to the little rats and butterflies, yet neither Red nor anyone else seems to really give a shit. (I'm sensing the potential for some amount of subversion with Red being able to Mime so this might be revoked later as his pokemon communication abilities grow, but right now it doesn't feel like the author is planning to fully cash in on that, since Red /already/ has enough information to know that most pokemon are sentient but doesn't seem to care.)

I suspect this is mostly a matter of me having more psychological common ground with you than with the GoC author, and with me having a stronger taste for subversion and unpredictability than most. (as we all do on [[/r/rational]])
