I thought this was very good, but still distinctly clunky/amateurish (mostly for reasons already called out - awkward language, power-fantasy hero, no reader fair play), and the sexual dynamic makes me distinctly uncomfortable. Wish it were paced better, or that I placed better than 5% subjective odds of it finishing within ten years.
