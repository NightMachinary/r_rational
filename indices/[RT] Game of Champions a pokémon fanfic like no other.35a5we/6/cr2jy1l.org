I read this and enjoyed it (mostly for the action scenes, decent writing and interesting 1st/2nd person perspective, occasional world-rebuilding, and somewhat masturbatory power-fantasy main characters). I remember it occasionally lapsing into science-y bullshit and that annoyed me slightly, but it wasn't any worse than what you'd see in a lot of fanfics featured on this sub. I'll probably follow it, but it updates so slowly that I might forget a bunch by the time the next chapter rolls around.
