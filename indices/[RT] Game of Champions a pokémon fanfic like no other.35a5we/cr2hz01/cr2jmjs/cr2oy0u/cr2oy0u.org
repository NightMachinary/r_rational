Have you ever read "Brave New World" by Ri2? It's not rational, and it was basically discontinued rather close to the end, but it is a really good epic pokemon fanfiction. The author has read tvtropes very extensively, and there are a lot of shoutouts to just about every well-known franchise imaginable and then some. Basically it's a sequel to the pokemon mystery dungeon rescue team games, except that the character you played as in those games is replaced with an amnesiac Lucario named Ash and his partner is a samurai pikachu who has yet to earn his name...

The very basic structure of the plot is actually based on Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door, although it's a LOT more complex and interesting than that.

Even though it's not complete, I highly recommend it. Maybe if we get enough people reading it, someone might be able to take a shot at completing it or doing a meta-fanfic reboot, or convince its author to come back and finish his work himself.

It's also kind-of a sequel to an earlier work he wrote called Latias' journey, but it's definitely not necessary to read that first, since it wasn't as good and Brave New World stands on its own just fine.
