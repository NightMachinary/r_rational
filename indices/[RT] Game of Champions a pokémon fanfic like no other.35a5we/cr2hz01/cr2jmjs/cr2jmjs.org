I do indeed: it's definitely the best Pokemon fanfic I've tried, of a sample size of about half a dozen. The others, often also attempting to be "dark and gritty," had too discordant of tones or the writing was just too bland. In this one the narration/protagonist was the main stumbling block I had at the beginning, but after a few chapters it didn't bother me as much and I got to really appreciate the world building, story and other characters around him.

That said, I don't particularly consider it "Rational" for a number of reasons, most specifically because he and Blue keep winning by exploiting things that only they're aware of at that moment (for example how he won against the Starmie: it was an amusing callback to a glitch in the first game where Toxic and Leech Seed combined to double the effectiveness of Leech Seed, but I had no way of knowing that this was how the world functioned, and the in-universe excuse was that he used some rare and specific toxin that was very obscure). This makes for very compelling and exciting storytelling, but I can see it getting old if it keeps happening.
