Well, we were recently reminded that he's supposed to be the actual "Seljun" or whatever due to his Bloodline. He just rejects it to do Pilgrim things. But it's also very likely that they need him against the Dead King, as he's probably the one guy who can handle massive amounts of Undead effectively.

The Saint of Swords, though, has been confirmed to kill them as well, and I can't remember if she's supposed to be royalty or blood, but even if she has no direct ties, it's still thematic /because/ she is a powerful Named. If a nation traces its royal lineage back to the blood of heroes, it stands to reason that a sufficiently powerful named (like Saint) is the equivalent of royalty. Plus, she's the one that Cat is building a magical nuke to defeat.

Most likely it will be Saint, although it's entirely possible *EE* could pull some trick on us and have Pilgrim sacrifice himself to save her and then her 'join' Cat's side. Highly unlikely, but sometimes writers like to make the story 'juke' like that.
