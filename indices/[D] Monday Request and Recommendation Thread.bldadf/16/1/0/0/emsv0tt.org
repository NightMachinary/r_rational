Yikes. That one flew right over your head then - it's pretty much set in stone that she's not going to actually betray them from the first meeting at the lair. Otherwise Wildbow wouldn't have wasted the time setting up a romance subplot with Grue or building a friendship with Rachel. The tension of that part of the story is waiting for her to realize that the Undersiders are her only real friends, regardless of whether they're genuinely bad people. I can understand being shocked by the story going that direction. The duplicity/spying justification for hanging out with them gets thrown out of the window after arc seven and replaced by something more straightforward.
