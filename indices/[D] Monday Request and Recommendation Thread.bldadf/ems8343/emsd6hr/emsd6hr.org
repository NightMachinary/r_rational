If you enjoy the Erogamer you might enjoy "The Sins of Cinnamon" (NSFW). It's an RPG world, and don't know how to hook you without possible spoilers but give it a few chapters. Heads up though I was personally disturbed by the first sex scene (masochism?) and a kind of incest one, but it's still a good read without the smut.
