I rather enjoy [[http://www.all-night-laundry.com/][All Night Laundry]] for its portrayal of LGBT characters. What I like is that while the main protagonists are a lesbian and a trans woman, these are not their defining characteristics, nor is the story centered around their sexuality and identity. The protagonists are trying to stop an eldritch thing from breaking into this world, and their recklessness/cautiousness are far more important to the plot.
