I really liked +Fitz+ Fool* in the [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77197.Assassin_s_Apprentice][Farseer trilogy]](though he's explored more as a character in the Tawny Man trilogy). It's unclear what his sex is(or if he even has one), and he seems to change genders several times. Or maybe he just lets people make whatever assumption they like, and just goes with it.

I like that it's not written as a major part of his character, but it's not ignored either. It's a subtle character trait that is nonetheless crucial to understanding his character. Hobb's writing as a whole tends to be very understated, and hugely into drawing out pathos.
