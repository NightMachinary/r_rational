I just finished arc 5 of worm, and I very much did not enjoy the way it seems like it is going, so I stopped reading it. I only read worm because it was the only story in the [[/r/HPMOR]] similar stories list that had an audiobook that was up-to-date/complete, and I much prefer audiobook format to text format. Are there any other rational stories like HPMOR that have a complete or up-to-date audiobook? Other things I prefer are that the main characters be kids, and that at least one of them is a girl.
