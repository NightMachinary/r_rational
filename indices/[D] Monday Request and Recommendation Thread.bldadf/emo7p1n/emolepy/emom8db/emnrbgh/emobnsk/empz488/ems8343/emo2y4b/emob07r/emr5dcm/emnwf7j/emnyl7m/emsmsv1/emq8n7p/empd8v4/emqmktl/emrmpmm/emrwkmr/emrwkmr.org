Haven't read it, though I'll be checking it out since I have read Lackey's stuff, but from the fanfic's description:

#+begin_quote
  Meta note: this fic is accessible regardless of whether you've read canon. It starts out a little slow, and book 1 is kind of a different genre from book 2 onward. Additional warning that book 2 onward gets /really grimdark/ and this doesn't really let up. I have between 9-11 volumes planned.
