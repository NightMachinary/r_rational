You're not going to find audiobooks of most online stories. Worm and HPMOR have huge cult followings, so they're the exception. I suggest finding a way to read text that suits you - I read a lot more than I used to thanks to my phone, for instance. Other people have sung praises for the e-ink kindle reader.

Where did you think Worm was going from Arc 5, out of curiosity? Because, while the tone doesn't change much over the course of the story, the greater context of what's going on changes quite a bit.
