A quick review of some of the Royal Road stuff I've read. Some of which has been posted before. Most of this is not exactly great fiction, but can definitely be fun if it is the type of thing that appeals to you. I happen to quite enjoy litrpg, portal fiction, and similar premises, but recognize they can fall into guilty pleasure territory easily.

  Set in the far future when humanity has reached the stars and finds it is not the first to do so. Alien technology has been left behind by a long dead race. Ancient cities, abandoned starships, temples and fortified bunkers all contain artefacts and devices far in advance of what humans have been able to produce. Technology that feels more akin to magic, so powerful it can allow a single person to dominate a star system. But these relics of another time have been left well-defended and behind bewildering and impenetrable security measures.

Fun. Competent grammar. A little slow to start with all the different perspectives. Pretty rational so far. Good world building, reasonably distinctive characters.

  Sery is a Source, born with immense magic but unable to use it. Enslaved for her power, her life is one of abuse and exploitation until one day, everything changes.

Mainly fluff. It's fairly fun though. Not really rational, but world building doesn't have any obvious stupid gaps.

#+begin_quote
  The realm is in shock. The princess has been kidnapped. The beautiful, kind, and extremely talented magician princess is gone. Woe to the wretched villains that took her away, screaming into the night. Their weight in gold to the one that rescues her. Ministrels sing with tears how the people miss their princess. The hope of the kingdom is gone. But maybe, just maybe, that was not the entire truth. What exactly happened to the princess?

Accidental bodyswap. Genderbend / dual mind taken fairly seriously. Summoned heroes are weapons of MAD, feared for their tendency to go murder hobo. Fairly loose rules, and situations are clearly set up just for humor / theme. Not really rational.

  Morgan Mackenzie had a very bad day. First at work, then at home, and then her bathtub fell through a portal to another world, with her in it. Now she's stuck thousands of miles from any sort of civilization with nothing but the bathtub and a lace puffball scrubby. But she learned magic, so that's sorta nice. Now if only she could find some clothes...

Rather entertaining despite the silly premise. Follows the 'protagonist levels up in the wilderness' litrpg trope, but does it pretty well. Power levels are handed out easily, but there isn't a lack of risk so far. Decent world building, follows the rules, but they tend to be somewhat vague rules.

  Emmet Laghaz loved puzzles.

  All day, all night, puzzles. Ever since he was a child, Emmet could turn anything into a puzzle.

Cultivation novel, but much more reasonable and sane than usual. MC is basically a magic engineer in a world focused on magic warriors. The rules about what formations are capable of are vague, but don't contradict themselves. Good stuff falls in protagonists lap pretty easily, and conflict is minimal so far. Still decently fun.

  A great race faces extinction and tries to leave a legacy for the future. Young races building on the ruins of the old. What happens when one of the old ones wakes up and finds the universe changed? Will she try to find new meaning? Will she try to help the younger races or will she punish the grave-robbers for their sacrilege? Or will the eternal servant of her people try and finally find some happiness of her own?

OP protagonist. So far its more about her effect on the world than her having actual risk or conflict. Pretty interesting world, with interesting (if a bit cliche) factions and conflicts the MC is disturbing.
