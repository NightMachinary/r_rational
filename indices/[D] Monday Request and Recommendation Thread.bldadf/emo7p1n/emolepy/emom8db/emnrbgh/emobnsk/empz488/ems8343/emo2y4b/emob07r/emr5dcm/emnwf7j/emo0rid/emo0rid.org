First, for HxH stuff, only two things spring to mind, as I haven't read much of them. First is /Myrmidon/, which is a very very good crossover with Naruto, where an adult Hinata and her team have a very limited entry point into HxH setting, and go there during the Chimera Ant arc to get a sample of the Queen. It's been very very good so far, the settings are meshed wonderfully, and the fights have been stellar. Second is a nice little fluffy shipping oneshot called /[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/364757][A 'Need to Know' Basis]]/, that one just kinda makes me smile.

As for timeloops, one thing that absolutely has to be mentioned is the anime /Tatami Galaxy/. In this one, the timeloop is gifted to the main character as a way for him to re-do his wasted college years and achieve the whirlwind of romance and fulfillment that he expected. He doesn't really have any memory of previous loops, at the beginning he chooses a different club to join and the two years proceed to play out. The cyclical nature of the show is executed very well, every character is shown from a variety of angles that reveal that they are more complex people than they appear, and it all leads up to an explosive finale. Not really a show where you wanna see the timeloop being exploited, here it is used to examine characters and explore its themes about life and grasping opportunities. It's one of the best shows I've ever seen.
