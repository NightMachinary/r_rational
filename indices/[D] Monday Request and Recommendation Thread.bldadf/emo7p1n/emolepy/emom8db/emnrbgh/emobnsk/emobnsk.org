Any fantasy stories (fanfiction included) in which Magic problems are translated into real-world math problems (whether that's recognized in-universe or not) and solved during the course of the story for a plausible execution of a 'prodigy main character does the impossible' plot point?

Basically talking about something like The Waves Arisen, wherein an infamous Elemental Manipulation problem is solved by Naruto with the clever use of topology. I'm adamant about it being a pure math thing exclusively, not physics or chemistry though. So, for instance, HPMOR's Partial Transfiguration doesn't count.
