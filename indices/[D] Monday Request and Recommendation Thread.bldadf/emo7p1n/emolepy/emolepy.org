Looking for recommendations.. Who would you say are the best depicted lgbt characters that you have come across in your reading? They don't necessarily have to be the protagonist of the story. The dearth of realistic, multidimensional gay characters in my reads have left me sorely disappointed so far.

I really loved the webcomic, [[https://m.webtoons.com/en/romance/always-human/1-i-guess-thats-why-i-admire-her/viewer?title_no=557&episode_no=1][Always Human]]. Non-dysfunctional relationships ftw!
