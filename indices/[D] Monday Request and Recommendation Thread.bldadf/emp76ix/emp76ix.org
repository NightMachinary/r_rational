Anyone know any good fics about humanitarian aid efforts in a sci-fi setting? The only two I know of are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3396972/1/Going-Native][Going Native]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9679648/1/Children-of-Nemesis][Children of Nemesis]](which barely even counts because the story dies before it really even starts).
