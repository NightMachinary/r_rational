I quite liked this: [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30279514-dreadnought]]

The premise is that a teenage transgender girl happens to be present when a villain kills someone who is essentially Superman, and his powers transfer to her. This includes changing her body to what it's supposed to be like. The plot is a combination of dealing with this and of "oops, guess I'm a superhero now".

I liked the second book a little less, but maybe only as much as expected when the novelty of a new series / setting / character has worn off. It was still enjoyable.
