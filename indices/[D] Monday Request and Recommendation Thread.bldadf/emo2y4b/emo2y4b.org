I recently watched all of Lucifer, a crime drama based on the Neil Gaiman graphic novel of the same name. Basic premise is Lucifer Morningstar, AKA the Devil, has gotten tired of playing along in God's game and is taking an indefinite vacation from Hell in LA. It's definitely not rational, but it hits a few of the same notes as UNSONG vis-a-vis religion jokes, so I thought I'd put my thoughts up here.

I think my primary interest in it is in exactly how charmingly unlikeable Lucifer is as a character. He isn't evil, not by a longshot, but he's consistently an asshole to everyone around him, friend and foe alike. What makes this charming is that most of the dickishness comes from being understandably maladjusted after having been kicked out of heaven and sent to rule a plane of the maladjusted for several thousand years. He gets shallow relationships, meaningless sex, and basic human desires, but he's completely lost when it comes to understanding positive human interactions, with predictable results. It's an interesting take on an alien perspective, one which is clearly based upon humanity and yet inhuman all the same.

If you enjoy mild mocking of Judeo-Christian mythology in your crime drama which plays itself for laughs and with seriousness, I'd check it out.
