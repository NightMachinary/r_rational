If you didn't know, Young Justice Season 3 is out, and it is excellent. Highly, highly recommended to anyone who's seen and enjoyed the first two seasons. To people who haven't seen the first two seasons, they're aimed at a younger demographic(seasons 1-2 are more age 8-14 where season three is more 16+ imo), but as far as children's super hero cartoons go it's one of the better ones.

It handles super heroes quite rationally, they essentially operating as special ops agents who do occasionally have to kill and/or be killed. The traditional problem of "why is Batman remotely relevant when Superman's there?" is dealt with fairly nicely, and the villains are very competent without going into absurd "exactly as planned!" levels of over-prepared foresight. It's fairly progressive with female/minority representation without shoving it down your throat at all. It also has essentially zero filler whatsoever, which is nice since they fit in a lot in just 13 episodes.

Also I recently saw Avengers Endgame, it's excellent. A bit fan servicey, but it was very satisfying fan service. If you've seen it, here are two interviews, one with the screen writers, one with the directors, that goes into a bit more detail about plot and lore details that couldn't fit into the movie that I enjoyed: [[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/29/movies/avengers-endgame-questions-and-answers.html][Screenwriters]] [[https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelStudiosSpoilers/comments/bj2c8s/end_game_qa_from_russo_brothers_in_china/][Directors]]
