Oh boy, its monday again.

I am currently making my way though [[https://tiraas.net/about/][The Gods are Bastards]] and have been following [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of learning]] for a while. I know i know, both aren't the most rational, but they come up here often enought to work as a reference for what I'd like to ask for.

Both somewhat feature the effect strong characters have on their worlds, like Tellwyrn or Zach and even Zorian in the later loops.

Are there any stories that feature how such characters handle their... aloofnes(?) over the common person? how they deal with their situations?

My thought train is: how do you even order a chicken sandwich when everyone knows your name? Especially when you are an immortal that has shaped history. How do you hide that you can trade blows with dragons when you are back in school? Thinking about this, how do even real life celebraties deal with this?

Anyway, this is what im searching for. Hit me with cheesy secret identies, badass OP characters and what not - just try make it about them trying to have a life!

Thanks!
