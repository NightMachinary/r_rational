Are their any good Hunter x Hunter fanfictions? I feel like that world and magic system is perfect for it whether it's about the main characters, or OC in that world.

Otherwise I'm really into timeloop/ multiple lives type fiction now and looking to scratch that itch. Mother of Learning is the best example of this, but I also enjoyed All You Need is Kill, Re:Zero,and to a certain extent, Time Braid. I've also ready some Harry Potter fanfiction doing it with mixed quality. It doesn't have to be a timeloop per se, but making death not the end of the story but a learning experience is an awesome mechanic in my opinion. Being able to try again, experiment with no long-term consequences when there's a critical failure, and have as much time as needed to improve skills and knowledge.

There's a new story on RR I like so far called The Perks of Immortality which has a twist on this. When the MC dies, he can unlock new "perks" which give him new abilities. However, (sort of spoiler) whenever he ends up reincarnated again, he is not in quite the same world, just similar. So he can't just re-do things exactly the same to save some individual person as they likely do not exist in the new world. This way there is learning and getting stronger with each life, but still new stuff constantly.

Any recommendations that meet this kind of fiction are highly appreciated.
