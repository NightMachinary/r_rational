Been on a Gamer-inspired story binge recently. I know I should watch what I eat, but I'm really enjoying the experience. In general, I like the humorous aspects of it - the contrast between what a game actually does and reality - above the dramatic aspects, so it's not like I'm disappointed when the protagonist makes everything a non-threat.

What are the best stories in this genre?
