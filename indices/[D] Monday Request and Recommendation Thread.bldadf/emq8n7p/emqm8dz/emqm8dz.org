I don't know many text stories, but I could recommend a few webcomics.

Starts out as gag-a-day style. It develops a plot and the art gets a lot better than the fairly crude first few strips. Mostly comedy, very little drama. Complete.

It's a stick figure comic in a world that runs on D&D 3.5 edition rules. Has both comedy and drama.

Gamer gets transported to a world that runs on Turn-Based Strategy rules. Mostly dramatic, occasional comic relief.
