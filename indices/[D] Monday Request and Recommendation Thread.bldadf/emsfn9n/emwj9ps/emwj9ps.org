A good story that fits all your criteria is [[https://www.amazon.ca/Red-Sister-First-Book-Ancestor/dp/B071NY4GV5/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Red+Sister&qid=1557392062&s=books&sr=1-1][Red Sister]] by Mark Lawrence. The story of a strange little girl in a dying world who joins a convent that teaches how to fight and use magic. I'm told the audiobook is also pretty good.

Another favourite of mine that you might like is [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/827.The_Diamond_Age][The Diamond Age]]. In a future that has undergone a nanotechnology revolution, a poor girl inadvertently acquires a state of the art and ruinously expensive interactive book meant to teach a smart, curious young girl like herself everything she needs to be a great person.
