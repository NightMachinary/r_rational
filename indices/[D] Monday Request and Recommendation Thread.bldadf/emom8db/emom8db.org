[[https://setinstonestory.wordpress.com/2015/10/08/backstory-revamped-into-prologue/][Set in Stone]] was immensely entertaining. Finished reading it about a week ago, I find myself time and time again impressed with its world building, plot development, characters, and prose. In that order. It's about a live of farmer under a tyranny of an insanity-proof AI. Some says the prologue is exposition too-heavy. But they're important exposition, written with enough poise I didn't feel the author shove unimportant facts down my throat. In fact, I like it. Greatly recommended.
