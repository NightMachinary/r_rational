I'm writing a Worm fanfic set in Seattle called [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/donjon-worm-oc-seattle.734914/][Donjon]] that has a trans lesbian protagonist. It's an almost entirely OC cast, the main character triggers when her emotionally abusive roommates escalate to physical intimidation. The manifestation of her powers twists her entire apartment complex into a death labyrinth filled with traps, forcing her to scramble to contain the damage. I post updates every Friday.
