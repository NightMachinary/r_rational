I got caugh up in a wild case of world building.

I can imagine a very powerful but not perfect god using Fairy land as:

*The Creator's dumpster.*

There He threw the remanents of the creation, the wacky magic, the freak accidents made during the molding of the world etc. He sealed them in a universe sized tin can paralel to the normal world. As all dumpsters do, it leaked and the normal reality was at risk of being overun. To stop them from finishing mankind he gave the humans an refuge.

He bind all the Fairy creatures with The Rules they had to respect the thresholds, they had to keep their bargains, but the fairies are subtle and wild and even that was not enough. He gave mankind a weapon and Fairies a weakness. /Iron/ with the weapon mankind was able to corner the fairies to the corners of the world, to the swamps, the hollows of trees and the bottom of the oceans. And there they remain to this day waiting and plotting.

i rather like this version, i may use it for some short stories,
