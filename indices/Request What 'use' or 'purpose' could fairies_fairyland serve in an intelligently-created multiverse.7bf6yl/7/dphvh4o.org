There's one webcomic which posits fae as a slave race to a now-extinct race of Precursors. As a slave race, they are explicitly unable to break their own (often obscure) rules; though they remain powerful, and some of them (the Unseleighe) take explicit pleasure in finding ways to /twist/ those rules in order to deal as much pain, suffering, and destruction as possible.
