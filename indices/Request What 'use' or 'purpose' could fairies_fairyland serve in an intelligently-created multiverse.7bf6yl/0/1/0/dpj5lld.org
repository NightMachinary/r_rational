I imagine the answer to that is "whatever the Creator designed" given that different world/universebuilding will lead to different things.

For example, I could see a world where the fae are created by melding human abstractions with concrete physical attributes of the multiverse. To use a huge stereotype, emotions associated with cold (ruthlessness, grief, despair) are represented by winter fae and the natural elements associated with that season. Thus, their "morality" would be based around inspiring all of those emotions. If a being wanted to bargain to cause a snowstorm (which requires manipulating natural laws of the universe), they have to be aware of what the fae want.

Of course, that particular implementation creates a natural conflict. If different groups of fae are trying to cause different things, balance is vital. The fae themselves may or may not be sensitive to it, and different types may care more or less about it.

This response brings me back to my original point about purpose. Why (in the circumstance above) do the fae exist? No particular reason, though scholars and philosophers might argue one interpretation or another. I could see spiritual humans believing that the fae are a divinely created middle ground between the abstract and the concrete, intended to help create understanding between the two. I could also see scientific humans looking for a process that explains the process of creating physical beings from human ideas. One, both, or neither could be true, but having groups pushing in multiple directions is the interesting bit.

Edit for clarity: It isn't about anything requiring personification. More like...these things are personified because that's how things are and different perspectives are going to assign different "purposes" to the fae based on point of view.
