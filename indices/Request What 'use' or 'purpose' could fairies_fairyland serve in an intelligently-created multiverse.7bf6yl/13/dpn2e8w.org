Hmm it doesn't quite meet all the criteria of the Fae are looking for but I figure there is some merit in explaining my WIP approach as a world building addict towards approaching fairies from a biological perspective as an intelligent yet not sentient(on an individual level) Eusocial insect based species. I wanted a species that was different in the orange blue morality system so to speak without sticking to rigid or anthropocentric rules where possible (nothing like bound contracts or bargains exists in universe nor are their anything that could definitively be called an elemental etc. those are assumed concepts born from human culture and imposed by their beliefs and imaginations onto other beings much the way as they have in the real world but in the context where things that are supernatural to use have been biologically evolved) The best fit to start this process for me was the order Hymenoptera where eusocial species have independently evolved multiple times. In particular I have been interested how simple relatively rigid rules on the individual level build into highly complex behavior but wanted to see if I could make something fairy like out of it.

Eventually I came to an approach somewhat inspired by the genetic incorporation abilities of Tyranid/Zerg based entities but without the concept of some overarching hive mind driving things. Instead the results are far more chance based focused around a drive to incorporate and experiment with anything interesting that might prove advantageous to their hive. In this context the hives are more or less the closest approximation to "individuals" that one could get to the hive.

Fae would have genetic memory but no more than what was needed for their tasks assigned as a larvae. Moreover they are instinctual acting for the best of the hive not themselves as they have no "self" to begin with. The hives as a whole may be sentient but the pieces though quiet complex are not as they are born with information and can not learn or adapt as individuals. Instead the fae adapt by planting new collected information and experiences into the next generation as deemed necessary by the hive.

With time and distance differing the fae in various environments have come to take different qualities that could be attributed to faeries (particularity the ideas of courts that embody a concept in a far loser manner) Most of these pressures have been driven by an ancient ongoing conflict between the Fae and the Wyrm race (led their "ascended" arcane lords the dragons)

That aside the result is they can be viewed through an external lens as innately alien in their interactions with others such as humans who like us have the tendency to project our emotions and preconceptions onto others not recognizing that they might not be universal. Humans see the Fae perform what could be deemed complex interactions efficiently with superb control comparable if not greater than their own that they automatically assume the fae they encounter must also be like them. Thus they are caught unaware and surprised when things go differently than they intended as the plans based on the assumption of their foes as individuals was flawed (Some fae my flee but only because the cost of making them is sufficient that fleeing rather than fighting

In short I like playing with what is fantasy and what is real in my fictional worlds rather than treating myths as absolutes it seems far easier and interesting if what the people and their scholars take to be true is unreliable. By not taking rules other than the physics of your world(which includes how magic spirits and other existent supernatural forces/entities work and interact)
