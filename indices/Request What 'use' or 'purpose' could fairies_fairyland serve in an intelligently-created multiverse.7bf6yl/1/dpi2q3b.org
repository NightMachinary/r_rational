Perhaps a testing ground for designing the rest of the universe? So the place is full of random, seemingly nonsensical mashups because they're purely design practice for the creator, like an artist sketching a bunch of different parts next to one another on a practice page. Similarly the fae don't entirely make sense or fit together for the same reason - their races/animals are essentially beta versions for "real world" races and creatures.
