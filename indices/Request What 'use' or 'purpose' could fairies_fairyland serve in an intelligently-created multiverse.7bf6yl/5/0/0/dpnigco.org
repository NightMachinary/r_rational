Winter is sadistic and basically incapable of sympathy. (Presumably because the Outsiders would take advantage of them if they weren't). Both courts have to be kept balanced in opposition with one another in order to keep Earth hospitable to life. If Summer gets too much of an edge then disease runs rampant, global warming increases and eventually the Earth becomes a desert. If Winter gets too much of an edge then monsters roam the Earth and the planet gets frozen.
