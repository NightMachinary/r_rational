Idle thought: If you have a reincarnation cycle (of 'souls' or amnesiac-perceptions-from-outside-a-Matrix or some other recyclable aspect), with generation and/or destruction/removal of reincarnatable individuals, you could have Fairyland as a sort of dustbin or recycle bin for those which have gradually gotten damaged/(gone insane) to the point that they would be a major threat to the normal functioning of things if they were all to be reincarnated normally, again and again. Hm, I note I'm influenced here by ideas in the 'The Death Mage Who Doesn't Want A Fourth Time'. The primary reason for that partitioning could be 'damage' in a sense of bugs, breaking of the normal rules, deemed-inappropriate inherent ability to display magical power, with mental instability being a side-effect exacerbation-of-the-issue symptom rather than the primary cause of partitioning. The difficulty-leaving, bound-to-bargains etc. restrictions could be external restraints (applied while classed as 'fairies') to hold them back from wreaking havoc on more-normally-functioning aspects of the multiverse. Not destroying them outright could be out of humane pity (as an asylum, pretty much, rather than destoying them outright), or as rehabilitation (certain qualities that make damage less likely, allowing gradual self-repair or gradual mastery of own powers to the point that inherent 'damage' is overcome, fixed, and the mind can be safely reincarnated as a mage with normally-developing power? self-fixing could also take the form of having power-removal as an inevitable result), but I somehow particularly like the image of Fairyland as a humane-pitying place where the broken reincarnated are thrown, everyone twisting the place into a crazy Hell of its own making of sorts, not immediately doomful to travelers to enter only because of the many restrictions present, in which minds cycle through reincarnation within Fairyland over again until they're eventually expected to break completely and cease to exist, while some of the more stable ones perhaps set up and maintain their own kingdoms for amusement/pleasure, optionally shoring up their own stability/lifespan through temporary measures which worsen/sacrifice others'. One could hypothetically have a story about a fairly-insane-but-quite-sympathisable (and rationally-thinking in parts?) Fairy/sprite who wants to understand more about what's going on, learns more about the external restrictions, and ends up bucking the trend and becoming more stable/powerful/(less externally-restrained) to the surprise of all. Come to think of it, there are a lot of stories which have fairies or demons working within the bound-by-bargains infrastructure, but it feels as though there aren't that many which show what it's like to subjectively experience that, and maybe want to understand and get out from under the entire system (like Durandal/an 'Anger'-Rampant AI in Marathon). More generally, I find it fun to think about and imagine 'bound' situations (this case, or AI boxes, or a certain recent paperclipper game) where the narrator/protagonist (has to trick others)/(gets to trick others) within the tight chains of a bargain/contract, rather than being a normal human-like mind being wary of having to try and sufficiently bind a bindable mind. (--Hmm, a little reminded now of 'The World As It Appears To Be' recently, some niceness about '/how to get out of the box/'.) Posting comment now, I'll continue to daydream about a fairy who can feel those external restrictions and wants a bone to pick with the System enforcing(/which implemented) them!

Edit: (...Eesh, that looks like an unpleasant wall of text once actually posted. Hm. Having written it, presently I lack sufficient motivation to put in time to break it into paragraphs, but breaking it into paragraphs in future is not impossible.)
