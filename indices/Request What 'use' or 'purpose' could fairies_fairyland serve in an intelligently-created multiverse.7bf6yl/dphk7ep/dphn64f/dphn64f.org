this is a good response.

First consider - "How did they come about?"

THEN you can think about what attributes they might have.

for me, the most likely state for a universe with such beings is one where the physical is not primary, but rather consciousness is. By this I mean the fundamental unit of the world is abstract consciousness, and objective materials and laws form as a consequence of logic or patterns of belief within this web of consciousness. In such a would it would be sensible for magical seeming spirits to exist, that embody or serve certain concepts or laws of nature. If the whole world is basically a big metaphor, then spritely embodiments of "love" or "autumn" make sense.
