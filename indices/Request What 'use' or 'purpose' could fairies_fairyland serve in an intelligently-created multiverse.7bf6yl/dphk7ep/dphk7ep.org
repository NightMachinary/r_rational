This might be a non-answer, but...

In a rational universe, creation comes first and then place/purpose is derived from their existence. From a storyteller's perspective they need a reason to be included in the narrative, but as far as building an intelligent multiverse having a clear purpose is optional. The only reason an entire species would feel driven by a common purpose was if they were created with intent by a being within the multiverse.

More on topic: When I think of the fae I usually think of forces of nature. Beings that humans can be interacted with, understood to varying degrees, but never completely predicted or controlled. I see the fae as personifications of (multi)universal laws, each bound to act according to their nature because existence demands it.

This naturally leads them to having great power within their own domain. They intuitively understand and interact with the governing laws of the multiverse, but are also bound by them and have little power outside that domain. Thus when they can't do something, they are forced to bargain. Over time, the bargain would become sacred and while they look to gain, fae who don't uphold their word would fast find their power imprisoned.
