If you've got a multiverse where every universe has access to fairyland, maybe they're remnants of wanderers who ended up in the fairyland and couldn't leave. Over millions of years, they've created their own society, and their own strange rules.

Maybe they're something like limbs of a narrative-based being, where each fairy is a pawn to make sure that the narrative(s) the being is bound to reoccur.
