A takes from the occasionally interestingly constructed world of darkness (specifically exalted, which runs on rule of cool more than sanity, but has some internal consistency): if you go with cosmology where creation is bounded by chaos fairies are something that evolve at the boundary between chaos as emotion eaters, if you have access to the books it might be worth skimming to see if it gives you any thoughts.

Another take I've seen (occasionally in [[http://www.missmab.com/][DMFA]] ) is fairy is the place between multiple worlds, which makes most fairy things fit really well, if it's a simulation universe, and they are fairly static software-agents in a hypervizer between various universe sandboxes.
