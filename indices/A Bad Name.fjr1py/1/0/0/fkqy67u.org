I thought that the first 25% of the fic was reasonably rational. The protagonist's INT/WIS were low, so it made sense that he often made bad decisions. Later on, however, when his INT/WIS were at least average, his decision making process became inconsistent. Sometimes he made good decisions while other times he made very bad decisions. Either I was missing something about the character that would explain these inconsistencies or it was just authorial fiat aka "the idiot ball".

Worse, other Worm characters -- Battery, Cauldron, Skidmark -- were often making decisions that I couldn't see them making given the information that they had and their stated goals.
