Well, in addition to what others have posted, there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8654967/1/Black-Cloaks-Red-Clouds][Black Cloaks, Red Clouds]]. It's not exactly super rational, but it's decent enough and contains some great world building which I've been inspired a bit by. It tends to update every month or two, and it's basically the only Naruto fanfic I'm decidedly following right now. IE, I always read updates whenever they come out.

A word of caution, though: it does contain the occasional adult scene. It's not a focus of the story at all, but it is there, so if you're not okay with that and don't want to just skip it, then best avoid the story.
