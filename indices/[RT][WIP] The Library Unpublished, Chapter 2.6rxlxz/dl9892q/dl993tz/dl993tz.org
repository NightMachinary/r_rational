Thank you :)

Regarding the neural networks, I did my research (for once), mostly by talking to a few CS students, though none of them were experts in neural networks specifically. If I understood them correctly, a neural network can theoretically solve a lot of problems (including writing a book) by applying what is basically pattern recognition. It's just not practically possible, mostly because a story is a very intricate and interconnected thing. The amounts of both training data and computing power required would be absurd. This is what Cio meant when she said "basically"; as a matter of theory, it's possible. Cio is studying mathematics, not computer science, which might explain her focus on the theoretical.

If there's anything factually wrong with what I said, please tell me. And if you still want to take issue, may I suggest blaming Cio's incomplete knowledge? While she's more tech-savvy than Mike, she's not really an expert :)
