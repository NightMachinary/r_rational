Well, theoretically, as the number of hidden neurons approaches infinite; a single-layer neural network can approximate any bounded function. And yes, one of those bounded functions is the map from a 100-dimensional vector to a story; but there are many practical obstacles to learning this mapping. There are fancier architectures that can do more things, but still.

Maybe you should say "theoretically" instead of "basically". I'm not a native English speaker so my experience of the word "basically" may not be common let alone universal; but it evokes in me that the concept is a simplification, yet still true in ordinary circumstances.
