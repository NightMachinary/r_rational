Good chapter! Also, I hadn't understood from the previous chapter that the mystery author was writing novels in the real world that appeared in other fictional works; although it was said. Bad reading comprehension.

I take an issue with "neural networks can basically do anything", though. As =cio_ci= says, they can't as of yet write a connected story :)
