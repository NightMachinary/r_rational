Fairly slow chapter today, but necessary set up for the coming offensive. The fact that they keep describing the details of the plan makes me very nervous that something is going to go terribly wrong. Now that everyone is together and the plan is laid out I'm fairly certain that next week we'll get into the actual offensive, and see what it looks like to march against the Hidden Horror.
