That's true! I was actually thinking that if they practised this before, they could have agreed upon a specific code that requires way fewer castings.

e.g. by varying the precise delay between castings you can convey much more information than by using a binary code, which seems like it would be worth it when each individual signal is costly. And since they're ninjas, Kankuro might well be able to figure out such a code even /without/ having practised it in advance.
