I'll be honest, I'm not even quite sure what a discord server is! It's a kind of chatroom, right? I'd be happy to start one but I kinda suspect that there's not enough dedicated NTBS commenters to sustain such a place. Maybe I could use the [[/r/rational][r/rational]] discord server for this purpose (which I've just noticed in the sidebar)?
