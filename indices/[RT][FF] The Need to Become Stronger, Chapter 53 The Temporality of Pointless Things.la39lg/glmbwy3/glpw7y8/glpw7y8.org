Hi, I'm waiting for new chapters.

I'd apply to beta-read, but I'm not responsible enough to keep up an indefinite commitment like that. I'm also probably not neurotypical enough to serve as a good beta reader anyways.

I quite enjoyed the chapter, using the summoning tug as morse code is the kind of cleverness I love to see.
