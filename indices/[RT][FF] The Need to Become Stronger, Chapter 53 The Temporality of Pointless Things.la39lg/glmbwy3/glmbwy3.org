Hey all! Sadly, I have lost my most excellent beta reader [[/u/4t0m]] to that most dreaded of all our enemies: real life. This is unfortunate because not only is it very helpful for me to have an idea of how people who are not me might react to a given scene, getting feedback also helps me to, uh, write. Which I tend to not do as much if people don't tell me to.

I mean sure, I realize on an intellectual level that people are probably waiting for new chapters even if nobody tells me, but it's still hard to keep focussed unless I'm actually talking to someone about the stuff that's coming up. So if anyone here wants to apply for the position, just send me a message or post a reply here! You'll get early access to new chapters for the small price of having to read them and then tell me what you think.

(There are no qualifications required for beta-reading other than the strangely-rare ability to resist the urge to filter observations through the standard socially accepted filter. It's literally better to just write down the first thing that pops in your head as you read rather than transcribing it into "constructive criticism." Seriously, you wouldn't have to read it any differently than you would normally. Stream of consciousness is the way to go.)
