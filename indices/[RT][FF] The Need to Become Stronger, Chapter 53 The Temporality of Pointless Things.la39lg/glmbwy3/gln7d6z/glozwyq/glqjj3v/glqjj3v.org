Yeah, the Morse doesn't really mean anything. I considered making it a meaningful message, but I figured it was more important to have it *look* like Morse code to casual readers by being recognizably long-short-long. Originally I was going to make the message "hi" but then I realized the code for that was "short short short short -pause- short short" and uh... that would've just been confusing.

If you can think of a short message that is both meaningful and easily recognizable as Morse, please do let me know!
