Does anyone know if there's any rationalist alt-history fiction out there? I find it a very fascinating idea, if well done, and even better if it digs into very geeky, not well known aspects of history rather than the really obvious ones, using turning points that were genuinely small random events that could have gone either way but had momentous effects (so more "What if Frederick Barbarossa had not drowned while swimming in a river on his way to the Crusade?" and less "What if the Nazis had won WW2?").

I'm also trying to write a different kind of historical fiction right now - Harry Potter historical fanfiction, exploring the way the magical world worked and changed in parallel with the history we know of. I'm not sure if something like that would belong in here, but if it sounds like something you'd enjoy, I can let you know here when it's out.
