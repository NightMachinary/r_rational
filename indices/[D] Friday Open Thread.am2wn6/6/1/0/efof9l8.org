Sounds encouraging! I'd like to make it a series, using the bits and pieces we know from the canon lore to tell small stories surrounding big events. The first one I'm writing is about the Goblin Rebellion of 1612. My only problem is right now I feel like I might not be giving the story enough room to breathe, but at the same time, I don't really feel like making it into a long fic.
