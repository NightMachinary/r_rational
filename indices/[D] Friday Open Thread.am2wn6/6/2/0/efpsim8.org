The Goblin Rebellion of 1612. It overlaps nicely enough with the reign of King James and the fiercest period of witch hunts in Scotland and Britain that I can build a meaningful connection. I've got the plot down and 3/4 of the first draft (though I'm wondering about whether I should do a more expansive rewrite. There's a lot of potential in that time! My biggest problem is that I don't think I can make the dialogue sound very natural for back then - it'll end up feeling more modern, probably).

Another character I've got in my sights is Herpo the Foul, the creator of the first Horcrux, supposedly dating back to Ancient Greece.
