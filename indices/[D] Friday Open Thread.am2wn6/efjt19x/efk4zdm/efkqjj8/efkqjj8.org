I know the struggle. Whenever I catch up to the fanfic/novel I am reading I spend countless hours of trying to find something new worth reading mainly on the sites you listed.

The quest of finding something new to read is kind of enjoyable due to the endless options those sites have available. But after the third hour of beta reading trash prologue chapters, fanfic after fanfic, you get really angsty and frustrated of not finding anything worthwhile to read so you go to bed early with a headache and your dopamine receptors teased into anger.

Not feeling tired you open your phone and once again browse [[/r/rational]], hoping one of the fics there updated. But, when you sort the subreddit by new, the latest thread was only some arbitrary request for a fic created about 2 hours ago. You click on the thread anyway hoping for it to pay dividends but you realized that all of the recommendations from other fellow redditors posted on the thread was the stuff you already read and reread multiple times. You came to another realization that you yourself created this thread on your alt account not wanting to be accused of annoyingly spamming the subreddit every hour.

You are starting to feel helpless and depressed that you couldn't find any good fanfics to read before your self appointed bedtime which is only tolerated as a necessary evil to not feel groggy and dead at your dead-end job. However, it is approaching fast. So you take a deep breath and hopefully try your luck on [[/r/fanfiction]].

You browse thread after thread on [[/r/fanfiction]] and immediately become confused. The only threads you see are people high fiving and patting each other on the back for their first like received on the fanfic they are writing. You felt like you awkwardly walked into an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.

You closely look at [[/r/fanfiction]] again and there is no threads about the supposed well-written fanfics you are desperately searching for. The only fanfic recommendations you see are countless shoddy self promotions contained in one thread like a quarantine keeping out a biohazard. You instinctively know browsing that thread will be a waste of your precious time of trying to appease your dopamine receptors. You begrudgingly enter the quarantine zone and read one of the fanfics in the thread and your suspicions are correct. It's self promoted garbage so bad that if you throw it away in your designated blue recyclable bin, you will get a letter in the mail the next day billing you for mixing trash with the recyclables. You realized it belonged in that landfill of a thread for a reason.

You started to remember the reason why you only browse [[/r/rational]] to find quality fanfics to read because [[/r/fanfiction]] is really no help at all. They are mainly about writing fanfiction and want nothing to do with your quest for dopamine by finding good fanfiction to read. They are an enigma. Reading and discussing quality fanfics are beyond them. You start to think how stupidly inane that is and somewhat ironic.

Your bedtime finally arrives and you give into the despair. You close your eyes and try to fall asleep just hoping that one of the many dead fanfics you follow miraculously revives. At least thats something to look forward to tomorrow. You set the alarm in your phone but, in an act of petty defiance, you once again check the thread you made on your alt account. Surprisingly someone commented and they recommended a fanfic you haven't read before!

You get excited instantly but your hopes are not that high after hours and hours of fruitless searching. However, after reading the prologue the fanfic seems extremely promising! The fanfic has over a million words and it can potentially last you weeks!

You are starting to fiend out reading the first 3 chapters. You are a dopamine fiend and you only obtain dopamine from reading quality fanfiction. The fanfic you are reading is remarkably good. Revolutionary even. You are on the biggest high in your young adult life. The new fanfic you are reading is so good you started to read it more slowly, savoring every word, not wanting it to end forever being cast out in endless limbo of waiting for another updated chapter. You are starting to worship the author of this fanfic, thanking him with all your heart for gracefully writing this masterpiece. He is the shepherd and you are the sheep. You graze on the words of his fanfic and fill your belly with unbridled dopamine. Baa.

However, after the fourth chapter something changed. While reading chapter 4 on your dopamine high, you were excited, then confused, then angry. Incomparably angry. You never felt so much anger in your life. The chapter you just read was bad. So bad, it left a disgusting taste in your mouth. You had such high hopes but it was all dashed away because one of the characters did something uncharacteristically. Or was it the major plot hole that was blatantly ignored? Well it was one of your pet peeves but, it was also one of your triggers. You became so triggered in fact, that you decided to write fanfiction yourself not wanting to trust your dopamine needs to other fanfic authors ever again. I mean how hard can it be?

You are tired. So tired. After 6 hours of brainstorming, editing, and do overs you have done it! You have created your first ever fanfic! In the second hour, the blind rage wore off and you honestly thought that this endeavor was hopeless. Writing fanfiction is way harder than it looks and you wanted to give up halfway through and finally call it a night. You were pleasantly suprised that [[/r/fanfiction]] was really helpful in that regard. They rallied to your cause and supported you to the end in answering your every literary question. You find that strangely ironic of them being so helpful but you couldn't figure out why being so tired for staying up for so long. The feeling of peaceful acceptance almost overrides the nagging anxiety of staying up so late. Almost.

You wake up feeling groggy and dead. You curse yourself, once again falling into the trap of reading your favorite fanfics before going to bed. You realize that the notepad app is running on your phone. After promptly reading what was written on it you hastily delete it in case anyone from work manages to accidentally read it and associate that garbage heap with you.

There is a skip in your step as you head to work as you noticed that many of your favorite fanfics were updated overnight and you can't wait to read it. You know you are going to get a lot of dopamine tonight and can't wait.
