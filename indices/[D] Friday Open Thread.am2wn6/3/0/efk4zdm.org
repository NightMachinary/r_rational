In my personal experience of 5+ years of digging through light novels, litrpgs, and fanfics, I've found lurking at Sufficient Velocity, Space Battles, RoyalRoadL (I know they dropped the L but I've been a regular there since they were originally translating that light novel), Alternate History, FanFiction, and ArchiveofOurOwn are pretty much there only places you can get fanfictions/webserials of any considerable length.

Sort by post count/word count and go down the list. Bookmark or follow the ones you like and after a while, you can have your own daily reading list. Mine can sustain me for about 2 or 3 hours every day but it's a constant battle to find reliable authors. Fanfics by their nature have very short half lives with only 2 or 3 lasting more than half a year out of the dozens that pop up every week. Hell, one of my consistent authors I've been following for over 2 years dropped off the internet a couple weeks back. Truly a shame and quite literally irreplaceable.

Anyone "off the grid" and not found here at [[/r/rational]] is practically impossible to find. They're essentially books at that point and a last ditch effort would be digging through goodreads to find fanfictions.
