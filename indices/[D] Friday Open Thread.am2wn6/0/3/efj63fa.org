It's because, if you're clever enough to make a joke like that, you're not likely to be dumb enough to make a rom-com. It takes a great margin more naivete to write a rom-com than it does to watch one. In practice, it's not /impossible/ to make an intelligent rom-com, but with the time you've invested in deconstructing the genre, you could have instead built something from the ground up with the intent of being comedic, or dramatic, or whatever you wanted from your parody. And that way, you don't look self-indulgent by poking fun at a genre that's mostly defined by cushy hallmark plot lines.
