A male character breaking a female characters ribs seems like it's a bit darker than the format allows. You also need a bit of a setup for why a girl who's old enough to star in a Rom Com is faking death for a kiss.

But, if you want to go that way, (and I'm riffing off [[/u/turtleswamp]]):

Alice has decided that she's not getting guys to commit because she's being too much of a "Miranda". So she makes a commitment to make guys wait, and not go further than a kiss on the first date.

Fast forward an act, and she's really, really missing any kind of physical contact. So, she's looking forward to date with a guy, and to dress up for it, borrows a swim suit from a bustier friend. To make up the difference, she uses silicone inserts in her bra.

Skip past the date. ALICE looks sheepish, and friend is trying to grill her for details about the date.

FRIEND: "Bob looked great? Did you get up close and personal?"

ALICE: "A little..."

(Flashback to wave crashing over ALICE, and Bob hauling her in. Camera notes that his hand is on her chest. She sighs and leans into him as he's swimming)

FRIEND: "Ok, but you kept the top on, right?"

ALICE: "Well..."

(Flashback to ALICE and BOB on shore. He's shouting, "I didn't feel a pulse! Grab the defib!". Her top gets torn open and the silicone inserts flop everywhere, in front of the lifeguards.)

FRIEND: "Ok, fine, maybe you went a bit too far, but was he a good kisser?"

ALICE: "I don't actually know."

(Flashback to BOB pulling out a rescue mask)

--------------

This way, the joke is that Alice has gotten her friends top destroyed, and is letting her friend have a mistaken impression about the date, instead of admitting she faked unconsciousness to get close to a lifeguard.
