I see what you mean and I can see the humor there, but it's not especially realistic. Or rather, the realistic result of this is Bob losing whatever certification he might have and possibly facing assault charges, depending on what the local good samaritan/duty to rescue laws look like. The very first step in real CPR is to to check the patient's pulse and breathing to see if CPR is necessary, to avoid this exact sort of thing.

On the other hand, some jurisdictions suggest compression-only CPR, especially for people with minimal or outdated training, on the theory that some people are not willing to perform rescue breaths and it is better to do something than nothing. So Alice might be even more the victim of her own ignorance.

(Also, chest compressions do not pump the patient's lungs, they pump the patient's heart. Hence */cardio/*pulmonary resuscitation.)
