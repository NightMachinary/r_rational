I'm amazed I haven't seen this as a gag yet in a rom-com:

Alice is in love with the comedically Alpha Chad Bob who's hyper fit and enthusiastic about stuff. They go to the beach/pool to go swimming, and Alice gets hit by a big wave and almost drowns. Bob pulls her out and lays her down on the beach. Alice decides to fake being unconscious to get mouth-to-mouth. So far this is very standard Rom-Com stuff seen a million times. The gag comes when Bob, instead of giving mouth to mouth, goes to break her ribs to pump her lungs like how real CPR works then Alice shoots up in pain.

Just feels like it'd work very well; faking drowning for CPR is a common trope already, and almost breaking a faker's ribs is funny, educational, and realistic.
