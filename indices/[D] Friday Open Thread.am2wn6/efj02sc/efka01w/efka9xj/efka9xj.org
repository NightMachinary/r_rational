  A male character breaking a female characters ribs seems like it's a bit darker than the format allows. You also need a bit of a setup for why a girl who's old enough to star in a Rom Com is faking death for a kiss.

It'd be almost. One hard compression than they shoot up in pain. I've mostly been watching anime lately so that's what I think it'd fit most perfectly, but if my memory is correct I think it'd fit well in children's sit coms and cartoons too. I know Gravity Falls had a similar gag except it was the male merman mouth-to-mouthing Dipper and then Mabel made fun of him for getting his first kiss that way.
