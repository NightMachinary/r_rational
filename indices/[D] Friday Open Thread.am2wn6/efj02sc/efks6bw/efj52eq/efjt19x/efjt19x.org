Are there ANY other webserials/fanfiction subreddits that are dedicated to quality webserials/fanfictions like [[/r/rational][r/rational]]?

The only reason I really like this subreddit is because the readers agree with me on what is quality for the most part.

I like LitRPGs but if you go over to [[/r/litRPGs][r/litRPGs]] the discussion is neutered by the prevalence of authors suggesting their own works and also the cut between readers who enjoy Harems and who do not. Some times when you ask for suggestions people will give you Harem builders and tell you its a "good" serial. Sometimes you will explicitly state that you do not want Harems and they will say it is only 'light' on the harem aspects. I am not saying that their is anything wrong with liking harems or anything, just not my thing.

Anyway, rant finished, what are other webserial book discussiony subreddits that I can browse through besides [[/r/rational][r/rational]] [[/r/litRPG][r/litRPG]] and [[/r/noveltranlations][r/noveltranlations]]. I tried [[/r/Fantasy][r/Fantasy]] but like [[/r/litRPG][r/litRPG]] I always feel like people are trying to sell me their books and not really caring about the discussion and suggestions.
