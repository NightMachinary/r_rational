  I mean, Frank's strategy starts working pretty well at the beginning, but given that in our current age, information systems ensure there's always some registry of a crime and backstabbings tend to be known by others at a much faster rate thanks to social networks, performing evil acts will give diminishing returns and always will come to bite back unless one gets to own the entire system or construct some design that prevents it from affecting you (like legal defenses).

Mild spoilers, but past the first season Frank frantically doing more unethical acts to cover up past unethical acts become commonplace.

That said, I think Frank's strategy could be considered rational when you consider his ambitions. He places an incredibly high weight on the goal of "becoming president" and relative low weights on everything else. If a casino offered a special deal "50% chance you become president, 50% chance you go to jail" I think he'd take it. By the beginning of the series, he's already fairly old(I expect 60+) and gotten about as far politically as he could hope without taking radical risks. Likewise, he's been committing immoral acts his whole life and has actually gotten quite far with them- Congress whip of the Democract party.

  In other notes, who here watches or reads news in the morning? I read that it's a good habit to be up to date on what happens in the world, but, unless it's a specific local event that affects us, we won't really have any way to affect outside events that are far away or that can only be impacted with effort given on a global scale.

  Furthermore, it may affect us negatively by making us feel impotent to change undesirable events and make us feel more pessimistic and inferior towards the world and our situation in general.

  Is there a more productive way to use the news we get daily? I thought, since I'm a member of a Toastmaster's club, to create an improvised speech based on the news I receive in the morning, thus learning of the event, becoming familiar and practicing my improv skills.

  But I wonder if there's something more productive that could be done with that time block and get more benefit from reading the newspaper.

I think the main benefit to being up to date about the world is that it makes for good conversation. There's a good chance your friends and random strangers are at least mildly affected by world events and stay up to date with them, so you can discuss world events with your friends. World events have a lot of depth to them and don't really run out as a conversation piece. The downside is that disagreements can create major rifts in friendships, but you can always just avoid discussing politics with people you disagree with politically.
