Conversely, do you think it would be possible to bypass these limitations?

I thought of a few:

- Drowning a call for action or a criminal video in a sea of information, using shock tactics to divert the attention of others from important topics towards utterly irrelevant ones. I think this one is already practiced by the media sometimes.

- Building fake videos/evidence to further cloud test results. This would be very time consuming and difficult due to the variety of tech we got. Like falsifying video, dna tests, and other data. Not to mention beating a highly reputable institute specializing in tests is not easy.
