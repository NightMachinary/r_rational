  Before the internet, dna testing, social networks and pocket videocameras, serial killers and criminals got away scott free due to lack of evidence that could be used against them, but in our current time's, any tweet, message or even private conversation can be monitored, analyzed using data mining and nlp algorithms and judged by thousands of people.
