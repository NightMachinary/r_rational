Hm, I don't know either of those so I wouldn't be able to tell. I mean, there are plenty of things on which there are /no/ major ratfics that I know of. The main fandoms I can think of that have established ratfics are (obviously) Harry Potter, DC comics, My Little Pony, Naruto, Pok√©mon, but not much more. Even on something like Star Wars I've seen only small pieces (one by EY, another on SSC) but no single long coherent rational narrative. Personally I know I've written on Dragon Ball and Bleach, and for either those fandoms I don't think there was anything pre-existing.

Marvel Comics and the MCU come to mind as a very vast universe that's not been touched much (I actually have the first chapter of a Spiderman ratfic that I may finish some day...), Game of Thrones is another vast world that would lend itself well (in fact I'd say the books are already pretty rational for the most part - the TV show, not so much...), and well, it's just too long to list, it depends really on what fandoms you know most. Filling a niche is nice, but I wouldn't worry too much if what you like best is something that's been done before already - you can still add your spin on it. Like, "Friendship is Optimal" is about the technological singularity, but it's not like there's no more possible interesting stories on the technological singularity left to tell.
