  Like, "Friendship is Optimal" is about the technological singularity, but it's not like there's no more possible interesting stories on the technological singularity left to tell.

Well of course, we totally agree there!

I guess what's going on is that I get kind of overwhelmed by too many ideas, so if I can artificially cull them by trying to aim for a specific niche, or some artificial amount of "originality"(whatever that means), or some other restriction, I can actually have an actionable idea.

I'm astonished that nobody in has done Marvel notably, though! Really? It seems like a low-hanging fruit. DC has Metropolitan Man, as far as I know, but hey, I have wanted to write a The Question fanfic for a while, so maybe I can marry those two ideas...
