Here is a list past-me made (translated, so the wording is a bit awkward):

- When you understand, you cannot understand how others do not understand.
- There is no difference between zero and something slightly greater than zero in practice.
- If you cannot differentiate between two things, they are equal.
- Most statements are either trivial or false.
- The concept of someone being at fault is irrelevant. Sanctions are for optimising the Nash Equilibrium.
- Authority is a heuristic.
- You should not rate decisions by their consequences.
- Difficulty is a combination of memorisation and understanding.
- You should not justify expenses after they have been made.
- A level-2 strategy does not always win against a level-1 strategy.
- If you cannot win, plan how to lose.
- Everything lies on a continuum.
- Something follows logically if and only if the negation of the conclusion disproves the premise.
