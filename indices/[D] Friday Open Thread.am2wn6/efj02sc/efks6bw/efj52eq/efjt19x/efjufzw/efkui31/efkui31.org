Do you have any short, pithy observations or principles for living/value statements that you consider worth sharing? I keep a commonplace book in the form of Notepad++ and about 140 different text files opened, and I started a collection of that sort of thing a while back.

I'm not taking about quotes, by the way (unless you're quoting yourself, that is). We all have google. It doesn't have to be original, either, though - one of the things in my text document is a slightly-more-extreme version of the common "What can be destroyed by the truth, should be." (Mine: Truth should be embraced at every cost.)

If your interested in mine - mostly unredacted - then it's [[https://www.reddit.com/r/LibraryofBabel/comments/ambbe3/rules_of_life_observations_to_remember/][here]].
