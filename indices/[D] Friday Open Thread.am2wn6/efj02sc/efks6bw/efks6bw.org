I tried to ask this monday, but I was late so no one replied, so attempt #2

Can anyone rec me novels (pref online) that are centered around management/being a leader/empire building.

Some novels that exemplify this that I've read; Practical Guide to Evil, Release that Witch, Dungeon Defense, The Girl Who Ate a Death God, The Amber Sword, I Am The Monarch, Dungeon Keeper Ami, Overlord,Tales of the Reincarnated Lord, Common Sense of a Duke's Daughter (too many shoujos to list actually)

Realist Kingdom was mostly about people being amazed at the MC for doing really unastonishing stuff, but I can see how that could apply to some of the stuff that I listed. The story just really bugged me in a way the other novels didn't, maybe because the side characters were really uninspired/flat

Slime Tensei was okay, but it was more of an "action" novel more than anything. But I did really like that slow progression of his city.
