It sounds like you explained your thoughts to your friend in a way that was way too complicated and verbose.

I would have said "In a isolated system, entropy can only increase. It can increase or decrease in non-isolated systems, but in isolated systems it always increases and that's it" and gone from there.

On the other hand... I dunno, that sounds about as minor and non-impactful a conversation as it gets, and you say your friend agreed with you in the end, so I don't think there's much for you to optimize here?
