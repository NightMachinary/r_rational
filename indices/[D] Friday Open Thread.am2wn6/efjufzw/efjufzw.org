First of all, thanks to [[/r/rational]] for all the great book recommendations and podcasts given the past Friday. For those interested, the thread is [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ajpw1d/d_friday_open_thread/eeyvoxg/][here]].

What does [[/r/rational]] think about [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Cards_(U.S._TV_series][House of Cards]])? I've watched a bit of it, but I've wondered how rational the actions of the protagonist are. I mean, Frank's strategy starts working pretty well at the beginning, but given that in our current age, information systems ensure there's always some registry of a crime and backstabbings tend to be known by others at a much faster rate thanks to social networks, performing evil acts will give diminishing returns and always will come to bite back unless one gets to own the entire system or construct some design that prevents it from affecting you (like legal defenses).

Before the internet, dna testing, social networks and pocket videocameras, serial killers and criminals got away scott free due to lack of evidence that could be used against them, but in our current time's, any tweet, message or even private conversation can be monitored, analyzed using data mining and nlp algorithms and judged by thousands of people. It's easier and easier to out corrupt individuals and, even if legally they can still escape, make their crimes known to everyone on a global scale and at a rate that would have been impossible in the age of paper letters and word of mouth messages.

Do you think there's still merit to Frank's strategy in our current environment? I mean, he achieved too little and was constantly hindered by the people he himself betrayed at the beginning of the series.

In other notes, who here watches or reads news in the morning? I read that it's a good habit to be up to date on what happens in the world, but, unless it's a specific local event that affects us, we won't really have any way to affect outside events that are far away or that can only be impacted with effort given on a global scale.

Furthermore, it may affect us negatively by making us feel impotent to change undesirable events and make us feel more pessimistic and inferior towards the world and our situation in general.

Is there a more productive way to use the news we get daily? I thought, since I'm a member of a Toastmaster's club, to create an improvised speech based on the news I receive in the morning, thus learning of the event, becoming familiar and practicing my improv skills.

But I wonder if there's something more productive that could be done with that time block and get more benefit from reading the newspaper.
