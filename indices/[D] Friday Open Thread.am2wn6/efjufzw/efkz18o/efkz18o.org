Note: I've only seen a few episodes, but I've watched the whole UK series.

Frank illustrates instrumental rationality, he wants to achieve his goals: power, prestige and legacy. He has a Machiavellian view of power. He never updates his beliefs (so he fails at epistemic rationality). In his views cooperation is only possible if people have the same goals as him (which is impossible, because most people don't care as much about Frank Underwood as he does). As a result, politics is war. Everything is an attack.

  Before the internet, dna testing, social networks and pocket videocameras, serial killers and criminals got away scott free due to lack of evidence that could be used against them, but in our current time's, any tweet, message or even private conversation can be monitored, analyzed using data mining and nlp algorithms and judged by thousands of people.

I've opted out of the news cycle a good couple years ago. If something truly important is happening it will find its way to me. Best decision I've ever made :)
