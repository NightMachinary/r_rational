I've been trying to work a philosophy into my life that everything can be optimised, I believe (without proof) that almost everything we do can be done in a better way, the biggest example that comes to mind are the so called 'Life Hacks'. Especially with Google I've been trying to search things that I take for granted and see if there is a better way. This includes everything from study techniques to how I cook my eggs. I'm hoping to use this weekly thread as the next step for things in my life where a new solution is not so easily googled.

Even if this particular interaction can't be optimised I'm hoping to find other small things in my life that can and I think it's worth making this attempt.
