#+begin_quote
  My question is, is there a better way to handle an argument like this?
#+end_quote

I don't know about "better", but I can offer you "different", and then you can try it and see if it works out for you.

#+begin_quote
  After saying this I still had to reargue my point several times before he understood and we then moved onto point 2.

  In the past when using this method, I have been accused of not understanding a problem, or grossly oversimplifying it.
#+end_quote

At this point - after you've given a single explanation and had it rejected - I'd recommend responding with something along the lines of "OK, if I don't understand it, then explain it to me."

This works on three different fronts:

- The person with whom you are arguing is preparing his arguments in his head while you talk. His arguments are convincing to him, and so until you're able to answer them (or at least /hear/ them) he's less likely to be persuaded by anything you say.
- Sometimes, when presenting his line of argument, an opposing debater might pause to check his logic and realise that he's made an error. (This is rare, and cannot be relied on, but it is possible.) Even if that does not happen, you will have a far better idea of how he got to his conclusion, and can argue against any holes in his argument.
- Sometimes, every now and then, the other person is right. Allowing them to present their point of view has a chance of preventing you both wasting your time due to your own error.
