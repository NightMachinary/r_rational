Very good. It's a classic ratfic in the sense that it makes characters in the source material more rational and extrapolates from there. Also, you have a short discussion of a related mathematical problem, which is also very [[/r/rational][r/rational]]. Very solid work.

I admire the many ways in which you chose to troll me. For example, you went with the "naval transport" choice of shipping, which is the troll choice -- and then, to troll me further, you added the slightest hint of an actual ship, and you chose to ship the only two characters with speaking roles in the original Oglaf strip, who (in the original) are as far from being a ship as they possibly could be. And you chose Oglaf of all things for a challenge which I wanted to remain SFW, and then you actually pulled off an SFW Oglaf fic? Got to respect that Chutzpah.
