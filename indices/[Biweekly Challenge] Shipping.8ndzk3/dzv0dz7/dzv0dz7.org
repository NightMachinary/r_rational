Honestly the entire thing is a combination of rational world/universe building, literal shipping and also "shipping" and also ways in which characters can misonstrue and ship and again attempts to play the characters rational to each other.

Honestly my story is essentially built on this premise right down to what I chose to make the acronym of the story.

The whole thing is a massive pun on the concept.
