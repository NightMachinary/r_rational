Set in Warhammer 40k universe, it's a shipping of Abaddon the Despoiler with a Grey Knight Brother-Captain Monroe.

For those not in the loop concerning Warhammer 40k lore and memes, here is the relevant dramatis personae, with pictures and wiki pages:

[[https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Abaddon][Abaddon the Despoiler]], Warmaster of Chaos. Current leader of chaos. Failed to conquer a single planet 12 times in a row.

[[https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Creed][Ursarkar E. Creed.]] Tactical genious. Possibly a giant MECHA in disguise.

[[https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Cadia][Cadia.]] Planet situated right in front of an enormous portal into hell. Creed commands the defenses there, Abaddon constantly fails to conquer it.

[[https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Grey_Knights][Grey knights.]] If you know what a "doublewitch" means in HPMOR, basically that. Take superhuman space warriors, hike them up to 11, and get double-super demon fighting space warriors.
