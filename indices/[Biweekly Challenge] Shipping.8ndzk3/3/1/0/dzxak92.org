I believe it's happened once or maybe twice. It's heavily discouraged, though there are some edge cases where I might allow it. The problem is that such works aren't actually responses to the prompts, and they're then put in competition with works that /were/ written for the prompt, usually over the course of a week or two.

I do encourage people to rewrite or revamp stories for the challenge, if this is the kick they needed, especially if those stories were non-winning entries for a different challenge. But the spirit of the challenge is sort of about getting people to write, and I don't think that purpose is served too well by allowing long-running stories with some amount of clout to come in.

(I'll leave your comment where it is, if you win by votes, I'll maybe figure out some sort of secondary prize or something.)
