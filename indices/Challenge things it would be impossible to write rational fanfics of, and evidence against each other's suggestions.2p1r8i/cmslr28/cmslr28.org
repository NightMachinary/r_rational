Poems, songs, and rhymes are easy pickings, mostly because they don't have enough of a skeleton to hang a story on - they're nearly impossible to make a rational fanfic of mostly because they're nearly impossible to elaborate on without inventing details wholesale. You can't make a rational fanfic because you can't really make a fanfic.

  There once was a man from Nantucket
  Who kept all his cash in a bucket.
  But his daughter, named Nan,
  Ran away with a man
  And as for the bucket, Nantucket.

I mean ... sure, you could spin some kind of lesson about diversifying your portfolio, but you'd get so far away from the limerick that there's hardly a point to it.

  But his daughter, named Nan,
  Came up with a plan
  And as for the bucket, she chucked it.

But I digress. If you really want to pick a story that /can't/ be converted, pick one that can't be changed to fit.
