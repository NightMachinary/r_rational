Could be done easily. Before the story opens, Emps dies and ascends to become a warp god. Big E loved reason, so his power forces things to make a little more sense, allowing a rational character to once again be effective.

On another level, the Great Crusade and the Emperor's conquest of earth are basically the story of a rational guy (with godlike powers) playing out his endgame.
