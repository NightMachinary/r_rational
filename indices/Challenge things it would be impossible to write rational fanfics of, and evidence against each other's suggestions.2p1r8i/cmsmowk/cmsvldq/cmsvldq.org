From what I've seen, the Eldar seem rational at times. You could probably write a rationalfic from the point of view of a craftworld Eldar.

You could even write a rationalfic from the point of view of a member of a lost human colony on a null-psionic world.

Of course, the WH40K universe being what it is, your rational character had best watch themselves closely if they ever think about leaving their craftworld or null-psionic world.
