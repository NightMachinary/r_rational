I think you might need the opposite strategy, depending on how the precognition works. If the precognition is just extreme predictive ability based on present information, yes this strategy might work. If the precognition has some supernatural mechanism, then you might need to build up all preparations under some kind of anti-precog effect and then make one giant master move to change the balance of things.

Idea for rational WH40K! A society of nulls, knowing they are immune to pskyers and warp precognition, go about setting up a master plan to disrupt the chaos gods.
