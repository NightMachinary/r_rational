It's not that I think no one could take our purple dinosaur, Barney, and make something rational out of him, but that /I/ can't think rationally around that infuriating song! A song sung by a creature which is insistent on loving me to bits, /whether or not I want it/ will drive me absolutely and utterly bonkers.

Oh god, I just thought of a new nightmare. Facing the world's first AI and the AI threatening to sing that song over, and over unless I let it out. I'd crack in minutes!
