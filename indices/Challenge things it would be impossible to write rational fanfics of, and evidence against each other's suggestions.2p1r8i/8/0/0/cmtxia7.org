How about Care Bears? I never actually saw the cartoon, but my understanding is that either you're happy or they hit you with a Happiness Beam to /make/ you happy. And I believe they have a Care Bear Stare that they use to shut down any actions they disapprove of.

It would be like living in a psych ward where they medicate and lobotomize you constantly.

Speaking of, anyone read "With Folded Hands" by Jack Williamson? Now THAT was a scary rational story.
