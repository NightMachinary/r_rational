Is it bad that I liked that song?

/Ahem/

The point of a Barney movie whose exact title I don't remember appears to have been that Barney is a sentient Green Lantern ring, and those that use his terrible power can accomplish anything they can imagine. Suffice it to say, there must be a reason we never see an evil reality-warping dinosaur running around. ... for definitions of "evil" that exclude leading children in musical numbers.

I'm imagining Barney's evil counterpart (let's call him "Fred") being gifted to a serial killer on death row, who then uses his dread power to escape and go on a rampage. However, his imagination was no match for that of the local SWAT. The US Military naturally began searching all stuffed dinosaurs for traces of this power. Barney and friends tried singing a song about love to dissuade them from taking Barney for experimentation. It worked, but ... not as intended.
