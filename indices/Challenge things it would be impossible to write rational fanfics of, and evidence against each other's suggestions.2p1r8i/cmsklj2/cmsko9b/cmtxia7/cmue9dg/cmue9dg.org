I almost brought up Care Bears, then decided I probably shouldn't, for reasons.

In general, I wouldn't say the Care Bears are pro-wireheading; they mostly just try talk-therapy and random adventures to help people cope with situations that are almost always #firstworldproblems. They mostly save the love-beams for enemies who are actively attacking people. The real question is how their system works: they live in a cloud-city (their cousins live in a forest), with cloud and anthropomorphic star-based technology, and have an enormous measuring device that detects sad children and uses an unspecified sorting algorithm to prioritize missions. Even if we ignore the whacky magic involved, one must wonder at how they choose missions (there's probably some Effective Altruism / Consequentialism parable just waiting to be written, there).

(I don't remember the Care Bears ever having to pick a mission from a list of options. The Caring Meter clearly has the ruthless decision-making process, so the Care Bears don't have to get caught in Trolley Problems.)
