Yeah no: There is an entire [[http://www.fimfiction.net/group/1418/lesswrong][group]] on fimfiction for rational fanfics, 15 approved as rationalist fanfiction, 40 nominated. A rationalist MLP doesn't even have to be AU. Canonically, Twilight Sparkle tries to be logical reasonable, and given that she frequently brings old lessons learned when dealing with the new problem of the week and the fact that she is becomes an Alicorn princess, I would even say she succeeds at being rational.
