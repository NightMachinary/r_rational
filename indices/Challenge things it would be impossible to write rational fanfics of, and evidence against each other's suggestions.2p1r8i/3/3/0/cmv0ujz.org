Good point- I hadn't thought of that possibility.

If we assume that the Starchild is actually the Emperor reincarnated, then there's probably room for a rational one of those running around, and it wouldn't hard to justify a lack of godlike causality-violating interference around them. Could be a whole lot of fun to have an end-game of "kill yourself to regain your godlike power", too.
