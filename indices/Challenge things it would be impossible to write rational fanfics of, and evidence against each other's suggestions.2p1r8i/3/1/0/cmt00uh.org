Lovecraft's stuff is particularly notable here because, although his works are legendary for sanity loss in characters, his protagonists tend to act in reasonable ways. Also, his higher powers are rarely actively malicious, which is something that many authors in his universe tend to forget. I've always wanted to expand on the "sane man in an insane universe" concept that he seems to be hinting at, but never have found a way I like to make it work.

I agree on the problem of malevolent higher powers in universes. Now that I think about it, it might be possible to write fiction where the rational character has to actively avoid catching their attention. That could lead to a really interesting story where the struggle is to make small changes that add up without disrupting the expected course of events enough to merit actual intervention. If it goes right, you could possibly have a story where the primary antagonist never actually does anything but still remains a massive challenge and threat, which would be interesting.
