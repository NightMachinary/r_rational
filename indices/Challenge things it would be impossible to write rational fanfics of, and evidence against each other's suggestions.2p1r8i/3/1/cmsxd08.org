Now that you bring up Warhammer 40K... I think any setting in with lots of malevolent higher powers would be difficult to write rational fanfiction for, because in universe any rational character who actually started winning would get smacked down by stuff they had no way to stop, or even see coming. Additionally, settings in which all the powerful abilities damage the user's sanity/ reasoning ability because this creates a tradeoff between epistemic and instrumental rationality. So Lovecraft's stuff, played straight also meets these requirements. Old World of Darkness does to some extent too I think.
