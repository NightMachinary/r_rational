This universe is not even particularly causal. There are events that have been changed to have never happened that still have an effect on reality (e.g. postcards of a cathedral that was never built due to time travel). If you examine the mechanics of Milliway's, there's decent evidence that you can run a successful restaurant by simply cycling through the same time period repeatedly and expect to get different customers on each repeat.

I'm frankly not even sure if it's rational to try to be rational in a universe that divorced from cause and effect and other basic assumptions we make.
