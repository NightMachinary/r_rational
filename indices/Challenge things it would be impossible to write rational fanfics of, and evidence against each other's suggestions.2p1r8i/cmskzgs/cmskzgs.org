Rational fanfic nursery rhymes.

Monday's child is fair of face,\\
Tuesday's child is full of grace.\\
Wednesday's child is full of woe,\\
Thursday's child has far to go.\\
Friday's child is loving and giving,\\
Saturday's child works hard for their living.\\
Sunday's child is happy to please,\\
And some days, my baby, you may be all of these.

Jack and Jill went up the hill\\
To fetch a pail of water.\\
Jack fell down, and broke his crown,\\
And Jill came tumbling after.

Well up Jack got and off did trot,\\
As fast as he could manage,\\
To old Dame Dob, who patched his nob\\
With soap and nice clean bandage.
