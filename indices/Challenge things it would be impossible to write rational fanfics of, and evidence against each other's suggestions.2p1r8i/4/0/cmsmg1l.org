That poem to me has always had a kind of zodiac ring to it. Like my depression is explained by being a child born on a Wednesday.

If I were to try to write a rational story based off of this poem, I would set it in a world where your birthday actually predicted your fate. The scientific method catches up with astrology and the protagonists struggle with the implications of their findings and what it means to be in a world where Fate is concretely real.
