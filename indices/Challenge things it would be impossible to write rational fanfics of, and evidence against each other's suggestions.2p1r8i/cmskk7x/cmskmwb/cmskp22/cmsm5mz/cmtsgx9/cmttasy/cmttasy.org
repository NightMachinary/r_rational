If you want more evidence of the current revolutionary technological progress, just look at Peter's arch-rival, Mary. Her agricultural exploits are even more impressive, ranging into the realm of growing /non-organic material/. No one is quite sure how she did it, but somehow she has managed to grow /silver bells/. Yes, really.

It was impressive enough when she was just growing cockle shells, but this will probably increase the nation's silver exports tenfold! Peter is trying hard to replicate the feat, much to Mary's chagrin. She's trying to get King Cole to pass a patent law. Only time will tell what the result will be.

(And they said she'd never amount to much! All those naysayers who said that her education would be disrupted by her strange fascination with sheep were *wrong*. Take that, naysayers!)

It is true that we're slightly behind in our legal system, and not just on patents. We actually don't have a minimum wage yet. For years there has been a lobby for one, but King Cole has yet to sign off on the proposed law. Until then, poor Johnny isn't going to get more than a single penny for a day's work.

Furthermore, the country's military expenses are generally considered extremely wasteful. We have ten thousand men under arms, yet all they do all day is climb up and down hills! That ridiculous Duke claims it's "training", but is that really how we want to spend taxpayer money?

So yes, our government isn't perfect, as you alluded. Nevertheless, I do believe we are making definite strides forwards.
