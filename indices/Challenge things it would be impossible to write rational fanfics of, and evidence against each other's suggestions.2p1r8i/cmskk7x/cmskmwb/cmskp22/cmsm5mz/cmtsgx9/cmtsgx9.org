There are plenty of productive society members: Just look at Peter Piper, whose new agricultural techniques for growing preprocessed food have put our food production /years/ ahead!

On the other hand, the current housing crisis is certainly a problem, and improved agricultural techniques don't really help with it. But by the power of recycling, that problem too is slowly but surely being solved: Yes, having to live in a makeshift house made out of what was formerly footwear isn't pleasant, but it sure beats being homeless!

(Furthermore, Peter's advanced horticultural techniques may eventually provide an alternative solution. Rumor has it that he secretly managed to grow a super-advanced proof-of-concept pumpkin house, which his wife is living in very happily.)
