[[http://sburbunofficial.proboards.com/thread/110/play-sburb-endgame-complete][It's been done.]] Not without pissing off everyone else in the setting (unilaterally munchkining a shared universe is not going to be well-received), but it does in fact exist.

For the record, I know of it because I was one of the people who helped establish the setting as a shared universe for fanfiction, and he walked all over the point of the thing (true, it was technically a setting about broken people becoming more broken, but it was also about emotional abuse and trauma, coping skills, and the value of establishing social connections in the face of repression, and even served as a rather effective improptu group therapy for a while). Somehow I am /still/ friends with the guy who did it (the pressure of 'belonging to the same group' is a powerful thing), although only after he grew up and realized that some stories are meant to fulfill other emotional needs and thus probably shouldn't be munchkinned - at least, not within earshot of the creators.
