You'd have to have John figure out the time loops or at least the crucial actions through all the tools available to him, as opposed to blind luck/predetermination. It'd be interesting to see that play out.

Other way around. Dave prototyped Cal, thus Dooming the timeline (since without a Cal to send back with Bro, Cal couldn't exist), while John was on his way to a long slog though the pipe, a talk with his Denizen, then a Choice that ended in his death and continued existence as opposed to erasure after four months. It's only implied otherwise early on to downplay Cal's importance.

Although I don't see why the proposed fanfic has to have a rationalist John as opposed to a rationalist anybody else, or that it can't make changes to the overall plot despite many aspects of Sburb drawing directly on the player's personality and mind set. Is there some specific definition of a Rational fanfic I've missed?
