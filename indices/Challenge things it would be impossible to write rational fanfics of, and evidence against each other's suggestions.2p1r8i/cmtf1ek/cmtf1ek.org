I'm pretty darn late to the party but I would say Homestuck. Changing the behaviors of one of the characters even slightly would just result in a doomed timeline.

Also, the plot is so heavily tangled with time travel shenanigans that you would have to basically rewrite the whole thing to change it significantly. At that point it will basically be a different work of fiction with similar elements.

Although now that I think about it, you might have a semi-rational actor who just sort of goes with the flow to avoid death by time travel.
