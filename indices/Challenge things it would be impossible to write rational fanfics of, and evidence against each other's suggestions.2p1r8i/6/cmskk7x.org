You could write a rational fic of anything if you're willing to change it enough.

Actually, according to wikipedia, this is a poem about mother goose:

#+begin_quote
  Old Mother Goose,

  When she wanted to wander,

  Would ride through the air

  On a very fine gander.

  Jack's mother came in,

  And caught the goose soon,

  And mounting its back,

  Flew up to the moon
#+end_quote

Clearly HJPEV got to Jack's mother. "Jack" is a slang term for "man" so Jack's mother is humanity's caretaker aka a humanist scientist or FAI depending on your perspective and the silvery white goose a Patronus representing the will to power, so to speak. It's really just an allegory for humanity's potential if they have the will and wisdom to make use of their powers.

So yeah someone could probably write mother goose rational fic.
