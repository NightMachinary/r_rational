I assume a rational fanfic involves at least most of the original characters and setting being recognizable; otherwise, it's not a fanfic so much as original content.

I do like the image of the king's sapient horses being talented medical professionals, though, who are stymied in their attempts to save Humpty because he hit his head and is unable to be saved by cryonic means.
