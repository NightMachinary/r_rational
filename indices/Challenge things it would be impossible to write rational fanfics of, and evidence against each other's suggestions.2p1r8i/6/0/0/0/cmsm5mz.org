Old King Coal was a merry old soul, but he did spend most of his time calling for more and more novel forms of entertainment. Do we suppose his budget is efficient enough that he can pull this off without unreasonably high taxes?

Then again, he does have a space program, if the cow that jumped over the moon can repeat that feat with a payload.

On the other hand, if your working class keeps going out to see, and taking your food/candle production with them, there might be a problem.

But Jack Sprat and his wife clearly contain valuable information for dietitians. I should hope someone's looking into that.

Also, pass some child labor laws, or at least establish mandatory workplace safety classes. Littles Bo Peep and Boy Blue do not bode well for the wool or mutton industries, and let's not even get into all the head injuries from simple water-fetching operations.

And spiders are clearly the oppressed underclass. After making it all the way out of that spout, against all the freak weather accidents and terrible plumbing, they can't even sit on tuffets without everyone running away!

Really, signs do not point to Old King Coal's popularity lasting for long. His healthcare system is in shambles, sheep plunder the countryside while children are left unattended and injured (their parents doubtless recruited to be King Coal's dancers and trumpeters), half the economy is emigrating, and it's only a matter of time before the spiders go on strike. All the while, King Coal is partying in his palace. Black Sheep seems to be the only leg of this society that can carry any weight, and a full third of their output goes to charity!
