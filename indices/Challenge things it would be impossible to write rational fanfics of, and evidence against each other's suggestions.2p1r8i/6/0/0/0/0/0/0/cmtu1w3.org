BREAKING NEWS: A school of biting fish has been sighted off the coast. If you happen to catch a fish alive, be careful to keep it away from your fingers. In the case where a fish bite does occur, seek medical help immediately. Do *not* let the fish go again, as some fishermen have been reported doing. It is vital that we obtain samples of this breed of fish, so that we can develop a cure for its deadly toxin.

In other fishing-related news, the three famed fishermen and explorers, Wynken, Blynken, and Nod, have arrived home again after a long and perilous journey. This journey was intended to test the new shoe-recycling technology, and in this aspect it was a tremendous success, paving the way for future development in the field of recycled giant footwear.
