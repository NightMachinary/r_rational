Codifying the actual laws of this universe might actually be possible, too. I think the biggest step here is allowing there to be multiple kinds of time travel.

One type of time travel is to have 2D time. Nothing (or very little) naturally moves in the second time dimension, and moving through that sends you backwards in the first. (Similar things are often phrased with creating alternate universes; the need to create a universe always seemed unnecessary to me.) This lets you handle the case of the cathedral that was never built but still has postcards - any postcards in time traveling vessels at the point where the cathedral was un-built still exist.

Most series only do one kind of time travel as a way of conserving detail, but you could have the above in addition to something else, like HP:MoR style always-stable time loops. You'd have to decide whether time loops happen in 2D time or 1D time or there's both available, but all of these are comprehensible (though at this point, challenging.)

I'm not sure what kind of time travel makes Milliways work. But for the rational HG universe, all that's necessary is that you find one, and that people use it for things other than just this restaurant.
