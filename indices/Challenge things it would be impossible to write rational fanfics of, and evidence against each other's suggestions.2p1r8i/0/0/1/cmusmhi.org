It seems you can still predict the results of your actions to a reasonable degree in the Hitchhiker's universe. There's a wildly larger chance of some black swan event throwing you off, what with infinite improbability drives running around, but most of the time things work normally. Rationality is still optimal.

A rational fanfic in the series is still probably no good, though. Either:

- The protagonist never gets access to the weird stuff - but then, why is this set in the HG universe?
- The protagonist gets access to time travel and improbability drives - presumably they rapidly become a god.
- The protagonist and antagonist get access to this nonsense and are both rational - now we need a consistent underlying behavior for the universe so we can mediate, but we don't have one.

I guess maybe a rational protagonist with no access to time travel and such versus a less competent antagonist who does have all the causality-busters would work, but it seems like this could easily succumb to solving problems via tecnobabble.
