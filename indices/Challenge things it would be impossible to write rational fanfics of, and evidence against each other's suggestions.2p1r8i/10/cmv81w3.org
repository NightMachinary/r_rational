Bujold's Vorkosigan Saga, Iain Banks's Culture, Walter John Williams's Aristoi, Jack Vance's Tschai: Planet of Adventure. These are either already rational (Vorkosigan Saga), or they're partially rational and the remaining irrationality is so deeply buried in the premise that you can't fix it without ripping apart the universe (Culture, Aristoi), or the protagonist is already Level 1-2 Intelligent and the rest of the book is so well-written that any attempt to change things would just make you look sad (Tschai).
