EY made a pretty good argument against Moby Dick.

I suspect any story based on a character collapsing into glorious madness wouldn't work as rationalfic: Through a Scanner Darkly, Don Quixote, Phantom of the Opera... For that matter, I don't see how One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest would work, despite the movement there being towards sanity.
