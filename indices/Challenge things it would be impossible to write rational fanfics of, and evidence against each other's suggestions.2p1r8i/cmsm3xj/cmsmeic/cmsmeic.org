It doesn't have to be the mad character who is changed to a rational character. Just have someone else in the story be given the rational upgrade, turn them loose on the mad character, and step back for the fireworks.

Alternately, write about how the mad character develops rationalist skills and learns to stop or work around his/her madness. Of course the second option is a lot harder than the first.
