That's true. But then, there are many time loops that the players have little to no knowledge of that they must complete to maintain loops. For example, in the first set of acts if John hadn't wandered into the lab where he mashed some buttons to create himself and his friends, it would have doomed the timeline. And since a rational player probably wouldn't go around mashing buttons like that, you'd need to make some major changes to have a rational John.

Also, if John hadn't killed himself via denizen, Dave would have prototyped lil' Cal, which would prevent it being used to create Doc. Scratch.

Basically, loop stability relies heavily on John being an idiot.
