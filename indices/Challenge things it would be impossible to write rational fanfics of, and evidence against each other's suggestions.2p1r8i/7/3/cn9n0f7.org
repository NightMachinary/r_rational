With a bit of imagination, a rational spinoff is most certainly possible. Let me elaborate on my ideas for a SBURB game thread which I never got around to:

- Sylladex inventory exploits. Seriously, being able to carry items without weight opens up entirely new echelons of crazy prepared.
- With a bit of ingenuity it is possible to design a system /like/ alchemization that actually is genuinely exploitable. I don't think I ever wrote mine down, but it worked on several characteristics of items like material, use, intent, durability and other abstract concepts. A ruleset can easily be made if you are willing to eschew Captchas/bit patters for the information storage.
- Set it in a novel world and have the characters be part of/involved with a plot to create SBURB in the first place.
- Make the incipisphere huge, and run off common tropes of getting pulled out of the ordinairy and into the fantastic, like Dungeon Keeper Ami does it. Actually, draw inspiration from that one a lot.
- Have the characters explore their worlds and their powers and the societies of Prospit and Derse. Plenty of room for interesting political play there.
- Make the whole world larger, disregard HS canon as you see fit. It is already a many-year trend to make novel characters and sessions, (like Altpower!Taylor fics is in worm) so create an incipisphere the size of a solar system.
- Explore the [[http://stormingtheivorytower.blogspot.dk/2014/07/hyperflexible-mythology-classpects.html][hyperflexible mythology]] and make your own set of classes and aspects.
- Fuck around with time travel, read [[http://qntm.org/excellent][this article]] and the relevant parts of HPMOR.

I could go on. My ideas for the session story I was:

- Main characters are veritable prodigies who founded SkaiaNet at a young age, after discovering the frog temple and reverse-engineering the tech within and subsequently relinquish power to boards of directors and CEO's and what not.
- They figure out that SBURB will destroy the world and tries to halt the development of it, but the board of directors want none of it, sending trained killers after them
- They sabotage what they can, and escape, subjecting themselves to mild age regression treatments, cosmetic surgery, and memory-wiping and then witness protection in order to hide, all with hypnotically induced passwords and layers of protection.
- The plot then starts when one of the main characters (an archaeologist) settles down near the now cleared out Frog Temple and finds it contains runes written in formal language describing how to create the program that is SBURB.
- At the same time the friendleader gets messages from an unknown party from the future, and her mind-blocks start unraveling. Notably, not five minutes after she decides on a time-travel password, does she receive a message coded with it. As should be the case.
- They start playing the came and the world starts ending, and it becomes apparent that it was a foregone conclusion.
- Then it turns out that the CEO of SkaiaNet who has been hunting them, is actually the time player come back from a doomed timeline that they mucked up in more ways than can be enumerated. Working from a really extensive list of things she has engineered the entire escapade, and promptly prototypes herself to become the guide for the time player. One really great twist was that the time player is non-binary and presents masculine, while the CEO presents as feminine.
- Finally getting into the incipisphere, my plot sort of ran out into extreme exploits of the system, armies of robots and the politics of Derse and Prospit and ensuring that the correct chain of events happen, the correct tech gets invented and stowed in the frog temple for SkaiaNet to harness, and ultimately they save Earth by minifying it and moving it through a portal window.

That was as far as I got. The actual society of Earth was a Sci-fi setting of some merit in itself, in the middle of an ice-age making the temperate regions all but uninhabitable, and being run on hydroponics and time-bending fields a la [[http://qntm.org/ground][The Ground Effect]]. An entire culture of post-scarcity, and the tragedy of it being snuffed out by meteors.

There is loads to be done in Homestuck. You just have to jump some bandwagons and mix it up. It will never be Homestuck fanfiction, but HS is not as character-driven a story as Worm, or Harry Potter, but it does have a hyperflexible mythology, and a set template of adventure.

Man, now I feel like writing this thing out.
