FLCL would be great -- almost /Puella Magi Madoka Magica/ style farming of teens for great power/giant brain robots. I could totally see that work as a rationally functioning world. I really want to see this fanfic now.

--------------

In Excel Saga, it isn't clear if those people were just crazy and had weird abilities, or if the entire world worked that way. I lean towards them being the odd ones, as a normal person (the foreign worker) is initial shown to have been dragged into the craziness and then reacts as one would logically expect (i.e. horror and fear). It seems to take place in the "real world", so just do the standard /world++/ thing when dealing with the oddities.

Having another normal (rational) person interface with those weird Excel Saga people would work, as would something like a rationalHyatt dealing with being (apparently) deathly ill as well as apparently now immortal. All it would need is strong causes for everything (even if they aren't explained) and well-worked out rules, something the setting doesn't preclude.
