Thanks for taking time to reply. Am I correct in interpreting your explanation as being consistent with the Copenhagen interpretation and not the MWI? i.e. in your above version observations cause a collapse of the wave function, unlike Many Worlds where each is a discrete history. I'm not trying to argue, just keeping things straight from a phyiscs & fiction POV. Thanks
