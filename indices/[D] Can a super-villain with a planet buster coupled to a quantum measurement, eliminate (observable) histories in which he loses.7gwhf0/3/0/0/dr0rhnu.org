Since the photon and the rest of the universe are independent (at least within the subset of the multiverse where that experiment is being performed), you can decompose it into the component for that photon and the component for anything else. The probability of finding the universe in a particular state is just the probability of finding the rest of the universe in that state times the probability of finding the photon in that state.

And for the photon, it's just like a ripple. It gets emitted and there's a continuum of possibilities where the photon heads in every direction and starting at every time. Most of the waveform gets blocked by walls, except for the two slits. The probability of a photon being just past the wall and not near the slits isn't zero, but it's pretty unlikely, so it's easier to think of what happens after as two separate ripples, even though really it's just two parts of the same ripple. From there they spread out and start to interfere with each other, and you end up with an interference pattern where parts of the far wall have bigger waves hitting them and parts are still. You can think of it as different histories diverging and then coming back to the same universe and interfering with each other, but it's not like there's discrete histories. It's all one giant ripple.
