The problem is that there are universes where he never existed and universes where he existed but never built that device. Those universes will have proportionately higher probability density as he destroys universes where he did build the device.

  I am unclear exactly what causes timelines to split i.e what constitutes a quantum measurement.

It's less like a tree and more like a ripple. If you had rocks and areas where waves went slower and that sort of thing in a pond, then when you make a ripple you can see it split into different paths, but that's just an approximation, and it's really going along every path continuously. Likewise, the universes aren't discrete. It's just a single waveform moving through world-space.
