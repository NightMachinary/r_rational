  The specifics of the electron collisions in your brain aren't usually going to change the decisions you make, for example.
#+end_quote

The quantum events that change your decisions now would be ones that happened minutes, hours, days, or years before, and the changes only butterflied out to the macro scale over time.

But there would still be many events in the brain of every person, every second, that would eventually result in macroscale differences. And it doesn't matter whether these events happened in the past or are happening now, because until they've amplified to the macroscale level every version of you will still be making the same macro decisions, so you can still usefully think about them as if they were happening now.
