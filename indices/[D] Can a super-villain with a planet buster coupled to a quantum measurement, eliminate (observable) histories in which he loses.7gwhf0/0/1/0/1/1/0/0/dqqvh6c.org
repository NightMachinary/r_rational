I suspect in the macro-case there are hard limits that make something like tunneling of an entire bullet not only improbable but physically impossible, even at the quantum level.

Quantum uncertainty doesn't eliminate physical constraints; it just provides wiggle room at the edges, allowing some events to violate certain classical assumptions. But the wavelength of a bullet is smaller than the size of the bullet; the envelope will not actually extend the width of a human body. I suspect there are some asymptotic probability considerations that actually do reduce to zero past a certain spacetime interval.
