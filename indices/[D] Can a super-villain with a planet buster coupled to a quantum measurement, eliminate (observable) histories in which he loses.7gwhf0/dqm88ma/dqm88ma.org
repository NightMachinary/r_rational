  I am unclear exactly what causes timelines to split i.e what constitutes a quantum measurement.

You and everyone in physics. But at the level you're talking about, there are a ridiculous number universe-splitting events on Earth alone at pretty much every conceivable moment.

If all the villain wants to do is create a dichotomy - every reality is either his, or Earth-free - he doesn't need any special quantum technology to do this. He makes his attempt, and in any universe where he is defeated, he activates his device.
