The action scenes were really confusing. Did Zira's spirit defeat all of those other spirit lions? By herself? How?

Why did Simba's dad save them? Was it because he took issue with his father possessing his son.

You might want to go over the action scene again and edit it so that it's easier for readers to follow it. That just went by in a big confusing blur for me for the most part. It was hard for me to keep track of who was attacking who and when and how etc.
