Cheers for the feedback. If it's confusing that's very important for me to know, as that detracts from the action. Of course, I am also getting reviews like this:

  Orphiex:Wow. Did not see that coming at all. /Fantastic/ ending. Wouldn't change a single thing if I could. Looking forward to the epilogue!

So I'm not sure if I should change it or not. Anyone else want to give a third/fourth/fifth opinion?

  Did Zira's spirit defeat all of those other spirit lions? By herself? How?

By being awesome. Or to put it in a less pithy way: She's always been a bloodthirsty hunter with an incredible single-minded focus towards destruction, which is why she became such a powerful destructive spirit after death. Most of the other kings were scruffy old men with not much fight in them, as you would expect from peacetime rulers. Ahadi however was both King and Captain during a constant war against hyenas, and so was spiritually powerful enough to beat her.

Also, he knew from Pokemon that water beats fire types, every time.
