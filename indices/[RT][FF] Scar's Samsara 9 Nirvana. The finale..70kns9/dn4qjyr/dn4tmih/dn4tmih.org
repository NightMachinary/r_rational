Whilst I'm not sure how I feel about the confusing-ness of the action, I don't think Mufasa's reasoning really needs to be spelt out here. It's enough that we were assuming all this time that he was ruining the land to spite Scar, and to have that assumption turned on its head. That it's open-ended whether he actually forgave Scar or whether he just wanted to help Simba isn't a weakness here, and I could happily see the epilogue going either way on spelling it out or letting the reader draw their own conclusions.
