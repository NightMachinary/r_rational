Heh, you're not the only one. I don't think it was really possible to see the final reveal coming, to be honest.

(Spoilers for this chapter ahead!)

The fact of the matter is that I didn't fully plan this story out ahead like I did with The Need to Become Stronger, and although I knew from the start that the Spirit Kings would be the final enemy (there was plenty of foreshadowing for that I think) it was only towards the end that I decided that they needed a face and a name to make it more personal, rather than just being "Nameless old dead kings possessing Simba". So I used Ahadi, who had been mentioned as being abusive towards Scar and playing a big role in his bitterness, as I thought it would fit.

I hope it didn't detract from the climax too much?
