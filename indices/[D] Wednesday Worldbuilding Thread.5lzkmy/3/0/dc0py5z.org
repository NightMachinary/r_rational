Bad things geopolitical. We have quite a few countries in that region with lots of weapons (some even with nukes) and lots of friends. It could easily get really really nasty. Lets say it works though and the territory is controlled. Occupying territory for a long time is hard. People get angry. They feel like they should have rights. People who in hard times doubly so. I think you'd see a large tick up of terrorists attacks especially aimed at Israel.
