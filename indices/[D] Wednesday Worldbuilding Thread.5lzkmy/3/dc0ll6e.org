I'm toying with the theme of "what is and isn't the right thing to do, when you're facing extinction". Specifically, I'm focusing on having a new Six Day War within the next twenty years, after which they created a selection of 'Israeli Defensive Buffer Territories' (eg, Sinai, Lebanon, Damascus), in which the IDF could do as they needed to keep Israel proper safe.

What further consequences and implications of such an arrangement occur to you?
