Hmmmm. Hurricane-built houses might be able to take it, I guess.

I wouldn't know. We don't get hurricanes here (or maybe once a generation, I guess). We also don't get much in the way of earthquakes, volcanoes, tornadoes... none of that stuff.

But... well, imagine a pair of Y-shaped sticks. Now stick them both in the ground, and balance a beam across them. This design will take quite a lot of downward force no problem - you could walk across it - but next to no /upward/ force. So, designs which will take no upward force exist, and (outside of hurricane country) I see absolutely no reason why an architect would bother about how much /upward/ force his roof can take

And if no-one will be walking on it (or if they'll be walking on the rafters) and you live someplace where it never snows, then you can simple have the rafters holding up the roof and simple thin plaster ceiling panels hiding the rafters from below - anyone who falls up and happens to miss the rafters will smash through the ceiling panel and into the roof at the very least.

Of course, this omly applies to single-storey dwellings. Multi-storey buildings, it only applies to the topmost floor (or the attic if there is one) - anyone below a floor that is intended to be walked on will probably face the greatest immediate danger, as you say, from their abrupt headfirst landing.

Next question. Let us assume I have somehow survived this apocalypse. I am wearing heavy lead-plate underwear and carrying a number of weights, allowing me to move about in a fairly normal fashion. I stand on a bathroom scale, and it reads 10kg (that is, my various weights weigh 10kg more than I do). I open my satchel (one of my weights) and eat a sandwich weighing 100g. I look at the scale again. What weight do I see? (That is to say, does the eaten but undigested sandwich pull me up or down?)
