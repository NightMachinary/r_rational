In the first world, I don't think it's that much of a problem. The bigger issue with the initial fall is that most people who aren't sleeping are going to be slamming into their ceiling headfirst, which can be deadly even at a height of 2.5" (average clearance in a home for someone standing). Also children/babies are going to have a rough time of it. And if you have high ceilings, you're much worse off.

But to my knowledge, most ceilings are designed to provide far more support toward upward force than a person falling could exert, mostly because for incidental reasons like tornado/hurricane stuff, or to support people walking on the roof. Even in those cases when the upward fall produces a puncture, the irregular shape of a person probably stops the who person from falling through (i.e. you end up with a leg or head sticking out from the ceiling).

Now, in the third world, or in second world slums, that's a different story.
