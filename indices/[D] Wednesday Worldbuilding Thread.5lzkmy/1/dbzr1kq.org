I am continuing on with [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5135483/chapters/11817437][Upsides]] (tl;dr: gravity reverses for every person on the planet, sending them to crash into their ceilings or die from asphyxia in the upper atmosphere).

First, a math/physics question. Let's say that you have a 180 pound man accelerating upwards at /g/, with 200 pounds of weights strapped to him accelerating downward at /g/. The math that I've been using for this is something like:

((200 pounds * /g/) - (180 pounds * /g/)) / 380 pounds

... which gives 0.05 /g/ acceleration for the overall mass. Is this correct? By analogy, it would be like two cars butting heads with each other, but one has more gas applied to it, which means that overall both cars are going to move in the direction of the car with more gas, at a much slower rate. I am really not sure that this maths out correctly though and feel like I'm just dividing by pounds to turn kilogram meters/second/second back into meters/second/second and not because that matches what would actually happen.

Second, let's suppose that billions of people died by being flung into the air, society is on the brink of crumbling, etc. and then rebuilding/adaptation actually goes surprisingly well. What new technologies would you expect to see thirty or forty years down the line? What would you expect to be true about the world given that humanity has survived this inexplicable worldwide curse?
