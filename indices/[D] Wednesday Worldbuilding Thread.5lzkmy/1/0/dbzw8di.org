Walking around in a 180-210-pound spacesuit is going to resemble our walking on the moon in a spacesuit, along with being able to drop ballast/drink water to increase jump length or go up, and cutting hair/pooping/vomiting or dropping helium balloons to go down.

Also, free energy. Do corpses drop back down? Did the chimps flip? Did neanderthal skeletons flip? Did HeLa cultures flip?
