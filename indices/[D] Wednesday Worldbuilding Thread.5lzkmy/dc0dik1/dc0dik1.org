How would one rationalize neo Battlestar Galactica?

Of particular interest is to me their economy.

It seems that they have an early 21st century living standard(first world), but with the space economy, their standard of living should be higher.

Another aspect is the lack of automation. With a robot uprising and the first cylon war, it means that robots are no longer heavily used in the economy, due to fear of AI uprising, and that jobs are mostly left to humans.
