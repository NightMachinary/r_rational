Garth nix is one of my favorite authors, and I just recent re-read the series, ostensibly in preperation for [[http://www.garthnix.com/books/the-old-kingdom/clariel/][the fourth book]] but really just because I enjoy reading them, so I feel qualified to respond :)

I think the writing is aimed at a younger audience, which is the reason for the "shallowness" you described. Regarding the lack of trade, I think you're falling into the trap of 'what would I have my protaganist do' versus 'how would this realistically play out'. And in reality, with a scary 'other' over there across teh wall which ocassionally has scary things break through it, is officially persona non grata by the government, and which the entire border is controlled by the military, which prevents any civilians from crossing, it's actually quite reasonable.

RE: Political organization: I think the first step is to establish the population we're dealing with. I believe in /Abhorsen/ it mentions that there is less than 200,000 people in the entire side of the wall. So we really are dealing with a feudal system (I think - I admit on not well versed on feudalism). Additionally, you're using the "Well, I grew up in a democracy (I'm assuming) so everything should be like that"-blinders (I'm sure there's a term for it) that misses the fact that monarchies were the dominant form of governance for a very long time. In fact, I'd potentially argue that its a natural state without the conveniences that we have nowadays. Gravitation towards a strong leader is basically hard-wired into humans. And trade would be negatively affected by wandering Dead, etc.

Just my thoughts.
