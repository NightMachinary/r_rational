Ancelstierre's inhabitants, by and large, do not /understand/ magic.

They recognise it - in the form of big scary monsters that come over the Wall on rare occasion. (And the only magic things that survive more than a dozen steps from the Wall /are/ the Big Scary Monsters, so...)

So there's not that much call for trade. Ancelstierre has machines - which stop working over the Wall (I assume this is because the presence of even a low level of Free Magic causes small-scale effects that mess up delicate mechanisms but have negligible effects on, say, a great big sword) while the Old Kingdom has magic - which stops working on the Ancelstierre side of the Wall. Sure, they could trade things like gold and cloth back and forth, but you'd need guards willing to face Big Scary Free-Magic Monsters in a place where guns won't work and where the monsters /learn/ which route the food takes and are intelligent enough to set up ambushes... so I can see why people might be reluctant to try.
