How do i handle a character with unique abilities and describing how they learned it? I have a character that is supposed to be able to cast Illusions, and i need a way to describe to the reader how they go from barely changing the color of some object to creating moving images of themselves when they grow more skilled.

First though, i need to nail dish the mechanics of how they are able to do this, and i have a couple of thoughts on that.

The illusions need to be able to activate in a subconscious state and a conscious one at the same time. Thus, my thought was that (since the character is furry) the power of their Illusions scales with their "ownership" of the area. Essentially the more they shed, and people breathe it in, the more power they have to cause Illusions on the various characters. The second thought is that they have two visual centers. One, which shows reality and one which shows reality + their Illusions. People or creatures under the most of their influence would be highlighted more or less based on how long they have been breathing the particles from the character's fur.

How could i handle, mechanically, the character's ability to create illusions from weak ones to detailed ones that look like they can move?
