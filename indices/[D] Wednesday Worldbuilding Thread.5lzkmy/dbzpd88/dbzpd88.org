Thoughts on the world of The Old Kingdom books. In general it's a series I like but after reading the latest there were a number of things that bothered me.

First if you aren't aware some brief outlines of the universe. There are two locations of real note. The Old Kingdom and Ancelstierre. Ancelstierre has no magic (magic doesn't work at all) except for a narrow strip net to the border with the Old Kingdom and has a tech based civilization on a par with maybe early 20th century earth. The two are connected at a wall and the strong implication though it's never explicitly said is that the two are located in separate universes which overlap at the wall.

The magic system is one of my favorites and in my opinion would make a great foundation for some sort of rationalist take on magic though I'm annoyed at some details. Keep in mind a lot of what I'll say is speculation based on the book and may not be exactly mind of god/canon. Basically there are are two systems. The first called free magic is less well defined in the books but appears mostly to be based on attempting to control usually malevolent entities of which the strongest would do a good impression of godhood. The problems with this are numerous but while the it may be a result of the lens the books put on it using this form basically dooms you to madness.

On the other hand there is the Charter which is imposed and organized. Again speculation but it appears to be the result of free magic spells. It functions for it's users as a general purpose magical language with photographic runes either being mentally conjured as needed or bound to physical objects. The scope of it's powers are varied but include, flying machines, magical semi sentient servants, shields, fireballs, and the like. One of the most interesting properties is that it's use does not work everywhere even free magic does. There are stones called charter stones which project some form of field allowing the magic to function. Users also must undergo a ritual of some kind giving themselves a mark that can be used to prove they are not in some way under the influence of free magic and giving them the use of the charter.

Anyway on to some criticisms. Beyond the writing which in most of the books has felt somehow shallow (don't really know how to describe it better), I can't seem to get over two basic facts. First there is no massive trade between the two sides of the wall. This is explained in the book by saying that machine made goods from Ancelstierre break down quickly in the Old Kingdom, but not only does this make no sense (how exactly does anything know it's machine made), but even so would not prevent some level of trade. Raw goods would still be valuable to the Old Kingdom and while ill defined at times I have to believe that some of the processes Old Kingdom magic could perform would valuable to Ancelstierre. If nothing else some spell work and the like seems to violate conservation of energy or at least entropy so set up on the border where magic starts failing and industry starts working some form of magical energy production facility turn a iron shaft or compress a fluid and use that to drive more tech oriented stuff on that side of the divide.

My second problem is with the political and social organization of the Old Kingdom. It's never wonderfully defined but it appears to be a monarchy with most of the population stuck in the middle ages, but without a lot of the features and reasons that actually made that time period make sense. It's got a monarchy but is neither feudal nor as far as we see constitutional or even a police state. Large scale economies don't function but there doesn't seem to be large scale starvation or lack of healthcare. Some of this can be explained by magic. With easy to use general purpose healing spells lots less people would die of the plague, but magic should if anything make trade even more widespread.

Anyway long rant and I'm curious what others might think.
