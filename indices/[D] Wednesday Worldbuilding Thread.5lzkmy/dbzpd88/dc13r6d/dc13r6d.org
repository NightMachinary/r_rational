I like the way Charter Magic and Free Magic have a different feel. Part of that's down to the narrative's requirements for good-guy magic and bad-guy magic, but it still works well.

Charter Magic seems safe, controllable, somewhat ethereal. People use it to light candles and send messages. You can turn yourself into an owl, and there's no hint of body-horror even if you mess the spell up. And you don't have to worry about the enchantment running out while you're flying high in the air - even if an enemy Charter Mage rips the spell apart, you'll probably make it to the ground in one piece. Its spells seem quite codified, and do no more than what they are meant to. Charter Magic can hurt and kill, if it has to, but even when weaponised it tends to focus on binding and imprisoning.

While Free Magic tells a different story. It's dark, forbidden, corruptive. Fatal if you get it wrong and often worse if you get it right. It's controlled through brute willpower, not carefully learned and practised spells - if you have enough raw power and bind the right servants, you can command anything you think of and it'll be done. It can't be a part of everyday life, because if Free Magic is everyday then your life won't last long. It never does anything small - it's life and death or nothing.

... and all that is nicely tied up by the explanation that Charter Magic is artificial, designed and built by ancient Free Magic demigods. It's intended in-story to be safe for humans, it's a semi-intelligent interface so people can get the benefits of magic without melting their brains. Magic user design.

This isn't the main focus of the books, but it's an excellent piece of worldbuilding and a theme I've seen in some rationalist stories.
