Yep I definitely think it has something to do with being intended for a YA audience and to be clear I did enjoy the series including the latest book nothing against the author. I just always had trouble getting into Garth's books.

  I think you're falling into the trap of 'what would I have my protaganist do' versus 'how would this realistically play out'.

Partially but the problem is that if it would be something I'd do than it would probably be something that plenty of other people would do too. Profit motives a huge motivation and can quite easily move government policy and even defeat some level of taboo. The military guard has to be incredibly expensive. I think I'd agree with you if Ancelstierre was also medieval superstitious hold over, but it doesn't appear to be. Despite the huge capital drain required for their defense of the wall it appears to be a quickly growing economy with as I mentioned development approaching about where we were at the start of the 20th century. Do you think oil barrens cared about superstition, security risks, or the government if there was lots of money to be made?

I think you make your best point when it comes to political organization. It has been a long time since I'd read some of the earlier books and I was picturing a population on the level of maybe me medieval England at 1.5 million. For such a small population a true dictatorship might work, but there are just fundamental problems with it. Basically you have to delegate somehow and unless your carefully you invite huge amounts of corruption when all the power comes from the top. Even states like China have some of these problems and they have a far more complicated governing structure than what is portrayed in The Old Kingdom. It might be worth watching [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rStL7niR7gs][CPGreys Rules for Rulers]]. I suspect it of falling into simpler explanations for complicated things, but it should make clear some of the problems with dictatorship.

Feudalism by the way is basically what they had in early medieval Europe. I suspect it's the natural result when you let war lords stay in power too long. Basically everyone of importance personally controls some land. Then they also have other people under them who they have essentially agreed to protect from outside threat in exchange for help fighting said outside threat and often taxes of some form. This arrangement is usually stack a few layers deep until you get to a king. The brake down seems to have happened as the individual nobles realized the King had too much power and set up formal constitutions among each other defining how the government would function. The king would be left with some power but over time this was stripped away until you get the figurehead kings of Modern Europe.

I think you also make a good case that the disaster prone nature of the Kingdom may hurt trade, but the impression I got from the books is that by the end of the last book that kind of thing has mostly been taken care of inside the border of the Kingdom and certainly in the prequel things had been quite stable for a long time to the point that the security apparatus was starting to fail due to atrophy. And again they are living right next to a modern civ. Some of the ideas should be spreading to them.
