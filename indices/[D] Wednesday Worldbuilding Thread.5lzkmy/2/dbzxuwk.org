Let's start with the premise:

--------------

The world has long since moved past the Xenocide Wars. Indeed, The sixty-two sapient species exist in an age of relative peace. In fact, now, in the year 812 A.E., magic and technology have advanced to the point where interdimensional portals of reasonable size can actually be created.

So, predictably, one is.

Observing mages are disappointed, but not overly surprised to find the other end of the portal is surrounded entirely by water.

To their pleasant surprise, however, a boat of some sort is noticed in the distance. At the hope of making contact with an extradimensional civilization, scouts are sent through the portal.

But even though they fly and fly, the boat doesn't seem to get any closer, even though it's obviously moving.

After a while, the scouts realize that this isn't a boat, but a ship of truly gargantuan proportions.

First contact is made in 2017 A.D. aboard the USS Gerald Ford.

So, way back in 2013/2014, I started on a worldbuilding project to culminate in a play-by-post forum roleplay. I kind of lost interest in the project, but recently I dusted it off and realized I put a /lot/ of cool stuff in there.

The conlang document doesn't really have a purpose except as a mental exercise, so I probably won't be updating it. The worldbuilding document, on the other hand, contains a number of contradictions and blatantly unscientific stuff I need to paper over somehow. I haven't decided on political borders for the map, but if you layer a Mercator projection directly over it, portal locations directly correspond to geographic locations.

Though while the worldbuilding on this isn't complete, I wanted to ask [[/r/rational]]: what kind of roleplay would you guys be interested in, given this premise?

Also, is anyone interested in helping me worldbuild?

Some notes:

- The incredible number of sapient species is because magic allows for a greater variety of ecological niches, leading to more speciation
- More honestly, there are that many species to allow players to make their own custom species.
- The restriction on crossbreeding was put there to prevent people going full "special snowflake" without at least adding something to the wordbuilding document.
