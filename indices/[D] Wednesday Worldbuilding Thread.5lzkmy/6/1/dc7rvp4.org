Definitely century-old Newts.

Look at the real world; lots of old rich politicians running things, not a lot of young wounded army vets.

(Although there is /some/ precedent for requiring military service in order to lead, it's usually associated with societies on a permanent war footing.)

Also, Salamanders are a minority and you mentioned that it's used as a punishment, which suggests to me there's probably a stigma of some kind. Especially since they have coloured skin, and class is denoted by pale/colourless skin. Probably not leadership material.

  The noblest Newts have no pigments at all making their skin and internal organs transparent. When coming to a battlefield most of those arrive covered with linen strips to protect their sensitive skin making them look like mummies. Some mages instead use arcane protections. Such practioners resemble moving statues of glass on the battlefield.

That's really cool.
