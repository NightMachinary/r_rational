Was designing a race of Olm-people.

Olm-Hulud is an amphibious race living in underwater caves. Most of the race is composed of Newts. Their body is skaven size supported by a masive tail. The tail is their main mean of locomotion making them similar to small nagas and freeing legs to function as an additional pair of arms. The use of 4 arms allows for interesting options in combat such as dual wielding spears. Their skin is white and extremely light sensitive. Olm-Hulud skin secrets hallucinogetic substances which they skilfully use. The have incredible regenerative powers allowing them to regrow entire limbs.

Newts reach sexual maturity at the age of 20 and usually live until death by old age around the 140s year. But some newts undergo a ritual called "the Shower" which triggers a metamorphosis. They turn in a more adult salamander form, their skin darkenss and thickens, decorative stripes and patterns developing on it. The regenerative properties are lost as well as gills. They grow bulkier, tougher and stronger. The process is extremely traumatic to the Newt and their remained life span is halfed as a result. Usualy the Shower is used when a colony is facing a danger and Newts sacrifice their lifespan and suffer great pain to be able to protect their home. Other times the Shower is used as a punishment for criminals.

You can tell a social standing of an Olm-Hulud by the whitness of their skin. The higher the status the less time they spend under the sun the paler the skin. The noblest Newts have no pigments at all making their skin and internal organs transparent. When coming to a battlefield most of those arrive covered with linen strips to protect their sensitive skin making them look like mummies. Some mages instead use arcane protections. Such practioners resemble moving statues of glass on the battlefield.

What would make sense about their rulers: 100 years old Newts with experience or Salamanders that proved they could sacrifce themselves for a greater good?
