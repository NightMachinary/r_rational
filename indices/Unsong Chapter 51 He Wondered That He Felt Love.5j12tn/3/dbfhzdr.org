I'm picking up on a bit of a theme here: rational utilitarians violating their principles because of love.

First the Comet King threatening to tear down the world to avenge Sohu; then Aaron selling out the world for Ana despite being genre-savvy enough to know it's wrong (although nothing seems to have come of that); and now Robin and the Comet King's romance despite them both knowing it's a bad idea.

Unlike the other two, though, this one actually bites them in the arse.
