The Comet King just said in the chapter that it will take more than a generation before he can take down Hell. Considering how rare it is for anyone to go to heaven, then all Thamiel needs to do is to simply wait and he'll get Robin sooner or later.

The question is whether or not the Comet King uses Robin as a pawn in his plan as a Trojan horse in Hell somehow.
