.... I'm a bit confused

Why is sohu there before they fall in love?

  Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you: Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires.

.... the comet king had children before falling in love and his "best" child came form a different mother then the one he loved most?

This isn't ending well is it?
