Having never read the series, I'm confused by the title. Is it supposed to be the opposite of a song? Like antimatter neutralizing matter and both disappearing, so therefore the unsong is something that neutralizes a song? Or is there a typo in the title and it should actually be "Unsung", as in, something that has never been sung before?
