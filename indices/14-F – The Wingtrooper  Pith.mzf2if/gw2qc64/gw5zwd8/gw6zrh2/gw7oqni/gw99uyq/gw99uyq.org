I don't mind grimdark, but I think a lot of problems I think people and myself have with it is when a novel is grimdark purely for the sake of being grimdark. That being said, even then some people just find it too depressing or numbing.

For example, Pact is a very grimdark story, but even though there are reasons for it, it will still bum people out because the MC is getting fucked for nearly 80% of the story. But I like it because it can lead to some really interesting characterizations with how they overcome their world.

Blake isn't my favorite character, but of all the books and series I have read, there are not many that I respect like him or well, the idea of him. He is sheer determination, refusing to give up in a world where everyone, including his family, friends, the universe, and even himself are out to fuck him.

I think that's the payoff. But it's not going to be everyone's cup of tea.
