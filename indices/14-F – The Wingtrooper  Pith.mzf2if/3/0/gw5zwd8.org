People don't like grimdark necessarily. They appreciate a realistic take on existence, where everyone is doomed to die, no matter what.

And then the author gives us characters like Chevalier, and we feel good regardless of our fate.

It's basically like The Road. Existential purposeless, but with a dash of fleeting grace.
