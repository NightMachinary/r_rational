I just started reading this last week and I've binged all the way to the end and went looking for discussion. Holy shit. I haven't had a reading experience like this since /Worm/ (and, later, /Unsong/). /Pith/ actually feels polished, too - I could imagine this in print with just some editing. Time to badger everyone I know into reading.

The only upsetting thing is that I didn't realize what the update schedule looked like while I was reading... going back and seeing one every two weeks/once a week makes me so sad. I know, I know, people have lives and jobs and can't just write nonstop for me to consume their story, but /god damn/ I need more.

I think this might be one of those things like Kill 6 Billion Demons where I should forget about it for a while and come back when it's done, or I might just go crazy. Speaking of which, been about a month since I checked over there...
