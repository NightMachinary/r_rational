really late but I've been catching up and this chapter was worth commenting on, even if its just for me.

the peak is so fucking bizarre. everything to do with the great scholars is so fucking bizarre, and I love it. I hope Han didn't release some monstrosity here, either with him breathing out the gas, or him getting infected by the gas, or whatever the hell was in those balls... speaking of the balls, how did the tortoise know that these will be important?
