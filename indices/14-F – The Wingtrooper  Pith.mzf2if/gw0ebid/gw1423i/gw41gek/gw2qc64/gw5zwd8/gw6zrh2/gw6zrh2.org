  People don't like grimdark necessarily. They appreciate a realistic take on existence, where everyone is doomed to die, no matter what.

But isn't that just real life? Why do people go out of their way to read something that is representative of the worst parts of real life? Idk about anyone else, but I read web serials and fantasy genre to escape from the monotony of depression of the real world, not have it rubbed in my face. It just doesn't make sense to me.
