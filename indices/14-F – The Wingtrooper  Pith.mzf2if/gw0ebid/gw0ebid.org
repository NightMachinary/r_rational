I appreciate getting an inside view of the Spirit Block. We've heard a lot about it from the Principians, all about how it was a masterstroke that won them the war, so I like seeing a Shenti man who had his heart ripped out by it. Not that it sounds like Han Yong was a very good person even before the Spirit Block, but still. It's the principle of the thing.

More creepy First Scholar weirdness is always welcome too. One of the things that I find really compelling about the world of Pith is that it combines the grounded feeling of its realistic political dynamics and rigidly constructed magic system with weird, unexplainable shit like "Oh, yeah, that mountain is totally cursed, you can tell by the red fog and the fact that nobody's ever come back alive." I love how everyone just accepts this stuff and moves on, because what else can you do? And when people /don't/ just accept it, when they decide to climb the cursed mountain, I love that too, because it brings into focus the vast, strange inhumanity of this stuff in a way that verges on cosmic horror.

And on that note, I noticed something that, well, I'm not sure if I'm reading too far into this, but...

  And all the plants had Piths.

  ...

  Tian looked at him. “/They're all headless./”

  Han felt around. /She's right./ Among all the ancient skeletons nearby, none of them had a skull. There weren't even decapitated craniums, or bits of jaw scattered around the area.

  It was like their heads had all vanished. Not a typical way for people to die in battle.

I really hope those two things are completely unrelated, because if they're not then that's absolutely horrifying.
