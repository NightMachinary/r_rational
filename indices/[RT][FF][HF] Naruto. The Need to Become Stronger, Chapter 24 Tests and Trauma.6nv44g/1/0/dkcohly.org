Two reasons.

Firstly, it makes no sense to include it from the proctors' perspective. Originally I was going to reinvent the entire test, but in the end I concluded that everything up to the tenth question was actually already a very clever way of testing a ninja's intelligence gathering abilities. The tenth question however makes everything up to that point completely irrelevant, allowing a student like Naruto to pass without answering a single question in what's basically the academic equivalent of catching the Snitch.

Secondly, everybody has already read this scene a hundred times already, so there really is no point in covering that bit again. The interesting part, for me, was Naruto's interaction with Ibiki (which is part of the main plot as Ibiki is one of Naruto's main suspects for the Kyubi's attack on the Village) and so I wanted to focus on that.
