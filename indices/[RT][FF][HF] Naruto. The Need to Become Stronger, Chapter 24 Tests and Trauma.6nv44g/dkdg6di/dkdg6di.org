Oh man I totally forgot to add this little snippet to the author's notes - I originally wanted to show much more of Tobirama's writing on combat tactics, but it didn't work out timing-wise:

#+begin_quote
  *Tobirama's Creed*

  Hone these things that you will need:\\
  Knowledge, Power, Stamina, Speed.\\
  Beware thine trappings of conceit;\\
  Be you in melee outmatched -- retreat!

  Hurl your tag to raise their shield\\
  Pierce the guard that it would yield\\
  Sense the foe beneath the field\\
  Chakra flared is truth revealed

  One fact surely cannot fail\\
  Forbidden power; widow's wail\\
  Seek out wisdom, break the veil\\
  Only thus may you prevail.
#+end_quote

And then, having gotten his poetry aspirations out of his system, the entire rest of his dissertation would consist of clearcut instructions written in such a simple way that a five year old could understand it, because Tobirama is not an idiot.
