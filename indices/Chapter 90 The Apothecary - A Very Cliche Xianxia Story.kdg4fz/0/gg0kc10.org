Regarding it being rational fiction, I enjoyed this exchange (currently reading).

“Short of allowing me to heal your uncle, I do not think there is a simple way for me to convince you,” Liu Jianguo explained. “It is not wrong for you to be suspicious of me. I am, after all, a cripple. For me to have knowledge beyond the greatest doctors of this city is a laughable thought. It should be far easier for you to believe that I'm merely a charlatan that wishes to avoid death.”

“You know,” Xiao Nan said, his left eye twitching. “You aren't supposed to just admit something like that. You're supposed to grovel and beg for the opportunity to prove yourself to me.”

“If I begged and groveled, you'd see me as too desperate to be trusted,” the doctor pointed out calmly. “Make no mistake. I do not wish to die, and I believe earning your trust would help me stay alive. However, I don't think there is a simple way for you to suddenly trust me. I can heal your uncle. That much is true, but to you, I might as well be saying I am the general of a great army or the prince of a foreign country.”
