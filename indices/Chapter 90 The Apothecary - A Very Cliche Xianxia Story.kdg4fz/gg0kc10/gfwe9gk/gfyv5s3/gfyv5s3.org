It's a bit unbalanced, 12yo kids are breaking the sound barrier while sparring by jumping fast. If that's the case every punch should break the sound barrier.

​

I think it's kind of dumb, breaking the sound barrier is generally high tier power level in most stories. Look at Delve, when people break the sound barrier it's f*ing awesome and it means they are incredibly powerful. Here it's something average 12yo kids can do without even trying hard.

Ave Xia Ren seemed good when it was just him in his home studying to become a doctor because it seemed like a parody, but now that we know that was only a prelude, something that would have happened in a normal story in less than 5 chapters, and everything seems like it's going to follow what the author promised in the tittle.

​

A generic harem xianxia story I've been quite disappointed with it. It seemed like it was a silly tittle with a story that differed wildly from it, but now that we know it's not the case and it has become a cliche fest a lot of the charm is gone.
