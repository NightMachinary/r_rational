It's written better and with more forethought then the most XianXia but I am still not sure if it qualify for "rational".

Hero is no murderhobo and world isn't ridiculous - yes. Characters are not clich√©s - yes. Reading is enjoyable - yes. However, whether it's rational or not is yet to be seen IMHO.
