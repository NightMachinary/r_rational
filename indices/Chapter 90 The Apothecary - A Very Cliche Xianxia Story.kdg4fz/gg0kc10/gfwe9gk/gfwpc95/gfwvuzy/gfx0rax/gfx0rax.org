Xanxia novels in China have roughly the same problem as Young Adult novels do in the United States - a glut of product, most of which is trashy lowest common denominator stuff packed with wish fulfillment and cliches. Only the stuff that sells really well gets translated and for the most part that's not the same as thing as stuff that readers would necessarily want to read.
