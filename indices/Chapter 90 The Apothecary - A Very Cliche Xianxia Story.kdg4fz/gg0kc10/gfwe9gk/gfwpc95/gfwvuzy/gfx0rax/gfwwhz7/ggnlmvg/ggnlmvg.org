One of my biggest gripes with Chinese novels in general is how, despite how oh-so-great the MCs supposedly are, subservient the writing feels.

To give an example; the MC has a treasure, wealthy/powerful/influential/popular antagonist wants said treasure, MC defends treasure, then everyone, the MC included, talks about how the MC has offended wealthy/powerful/influential/popular antagonist('s family, clan, corporation, sect, world,...).

And it's freaking everywhere, xianxia, wuxia, xuanhuan, historical, romance, sci-fi,..., *everywhere*. I'm certain it's a cultural thing, given China's political situation (one Party to rule them all), but it's just so terrible to read.

Or how hypocritical every single MC is. If the MC was treated like shit, then they'll treat others like shit, but somehow that's OK now because they're the MC.

Or how tribal Chinese stories are. Everyone in the immediate area is a mortal enemy until a neighbour shows up, then they're all friends and the neighbours are the new mortal enemies. Then a newcomer arrives, and everyone unites against them, so on and so forth.

Argh, fuck it. The more I think about how shitty the features of Chinese writing are, the more angry I get at myself for still reading some of them.\\
But then I think of the alternatives; Japanese child porn, Korean VRRPG: The Book, and Western wish fulfilment.
