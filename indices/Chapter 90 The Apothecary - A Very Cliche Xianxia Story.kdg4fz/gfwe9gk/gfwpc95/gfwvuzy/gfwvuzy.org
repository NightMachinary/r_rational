Maybe I'm just failing to understand xanxia but the characters always feel utterly alien to me. Their emotions, reactions, thought patterns, and sometimes goals are so far removed from my models of the people around me that they feel more like caricatures than real people. Is the cultural difference between western and asian just this big or is it something else?
