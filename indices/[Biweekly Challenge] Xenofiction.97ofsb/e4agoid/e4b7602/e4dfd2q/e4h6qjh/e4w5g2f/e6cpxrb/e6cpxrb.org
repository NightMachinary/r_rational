The least obvious thing to cry over that I've ever cried over. Mad respect.

Have you ever heard of [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWH_9VRWn8Y&t=3s][these penguins]], who like to wander insanely? There's an important commonality here. Mutation, as it exists in systems of ideas. The precept corresponding to mutation. It invites us to risk our lives in pursuit of imagined frontiers that we can't yet see, frontiers that reasonable members of our species don't believe in. Usually it kills us, but sometimes it doesn't. So we each hurl ourselves towards our frontier, we're all pointed in different directions, but mutation is one of the three ingredients of evolution, every living thing carries some version of that same basic drive.
