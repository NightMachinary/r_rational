ah, that was a good connection but alas that's not what they're doing. from the information i've given so far, plus a little hpmor scholarship, i fully expect someone to work out what lockhart and co. actually did, fairly soon. it's a solvable problem :)

i had to look this up, and i found that many spells do actually produce light, but, being weak first-year spells, they aren't visible under ordinary lighting conditions - but perhaps at night, you would be able to see a slight "glimmer".
