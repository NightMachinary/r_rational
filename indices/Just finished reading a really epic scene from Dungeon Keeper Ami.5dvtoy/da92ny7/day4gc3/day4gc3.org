were you reading it on Sufficient Velocity or addventure(Sp?)

Apparently the story was originally hosted on some sort of CYOA site where people could add their own branches. There's only the one branch done by the original author that was then ported to SV tho.

Unless you mean the bit in the early chapters where the POV swaps from Reaper to Ami a lot without much warning... in which case that settles out over time and gets much smoother.
