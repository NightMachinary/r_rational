Yeah, that was definitely one of my favorite parts, of an altogether too excellent series. the beginning is a bit rough, but it has genuinely intelligent characters, great worldbuilding, and (mostly) intelligent opponents like Mukrezar. There is also a rewrite/sanctioned fanfiction going on- it's IMO better written than the beginning of DKA, so I have high hopes, but it isn't at the level of recent chapters yet.
