NPCs in 5E don't have strict class levels, they just have statblocks, so the whole thing is kind of ... well, not /moot/, but it's trying to work out a problem that's undefined within the RAW, and not just because there are no RAW for population demographics. The rules work differently for PCs and NPCs, and directly mapping PC class levels onto NPCs isn't the assumption that the rulebooks make about how the world works. Yes, this does mean that PCs Are Different.

(This was not the case in 3.5E, but they changed it, because it was a complete pain in the butt, and statblocks are easier to manipulate than class levels/features, and it's all mostly invisible to the players anyway.)
