I feel like the overall numbers in the plan don't hold out very well, because, IMO, it is too large/high level of a team for even a large city to field. TBF that's mostly just my gut feeling about magic and power levels.

A better way to judge the viability of this plan is to count up the daily cost based on DM Manual figures for paying a professional to cast spells of these levels, counting for some sort of discount for regular wages rather than one-off work. Then use more cost tables to determine how that compares to the economic output of a spread of two million people. That would take longer so I'm not going to do that, but maybe someone else would be interested.

Instead I'm mostly going to consider "what proportion of the population is actually of this level, and is it reasonable to think that from that number there would actually be enough people available with this specific build.

I didn't find any actual "official" numbers for the level spread in the forgotten realms. [[/u/fallencoder][u/fallencoder]] posted [[https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/597t3i/dd_character_level_demographics/][this chart]] which assumed a fraction of lvl 1 characters based on the US armed forces percentage, and then from that level 1 number assumed that each level above that had half the numbers as the previous level.

With that benchmark out of a city of two million you'd expect (.0012773%) only 25 level 10 people. Even considering that the high level people may gravitate to population centers for work I don't think you'd be able to create this team, especially considering that the 15 level 10 people you want are Druids, and those are the last people you're going to get to work every day in a dense city.

Personally I have issues with the assumptions on that chart on both ends. First I feel like modern US is a bad example for %combatants. We (and many other modern militaries) are all about a very small number of professional volunteers, which is basically the opposite of the medieval "conscript a bunch of peasants into a militia for a campaign season" model which is probably closer to D&D. But while I think the level 1 number would be way higher, I think the dropoff should be steeper.

I think the death and retirement rate of 50% is fine for the first few levels, but after, say, level 5 I think you'd be lucky to get 10-20% of the population to move on. Those people are either going to be higher fatality occupations (more adventurers and fewer city guards) or picked up in much smaller numbers for elite training. Additionally after you get to that point the retirements are going to shoot up. People will have avenged their Uncles and not gotten sucked into the next crazy adventure, they'll start to realize that their pockets have "retire forever" money in them, and they'll drop out of the business.
