Amusing!

You need significantly more^{*} Druids and Clerics than given, because they have limited coverage, limited capacity, and deaths aren't going to be evenly distributed. Since you need about 8 Druids to cover Waterdeep using Tree Stride, that leaves at least some patrol areas with only one Druid on duty, which will fail if that area has more than three deaths in a day. Which, assuming deaths are distributed randomly, will be basically every day. And the actual distribution of deaths is not going to be as forgiving as random, either, since a lot of accidental deaths are going to be from multi-person incidents like carriage accidents or sneezing wizards.

^{*} I'd give you a number but I can't find the right Birthday Problem variant and I don't feel like coding up a simulation.
