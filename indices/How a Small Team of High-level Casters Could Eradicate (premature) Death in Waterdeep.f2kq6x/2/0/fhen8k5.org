Yes, and those are very real concerns, so if this were actually implemented it would be something like the insurance industry in real life, wherein repeat offenders and at-risk people are charged proportionally more. That's how it works in my setting, the Wishbound World.

In this thought experiment, I've outlined in another comment how I imagine that repeat offenders would be heavily fined and eventually excluded from the system altogether. The EMTs are perfectly capable of withholding care to disincentivize risk-taking.
