I mean, divine intervention can justify anything. I could propose any way of improving people's lives in D&D, and now matter how realistic or well-reasoned my plan, you could respond with “divine intervention.”

There's also the possibility that the designers of D&D just never bothered actually running the numbers on how many resurrections versus deaths can happen each day.

And there's the possibility that even Lirael Silverhand made a similar mistake, because she didn't consider the idea that it would even be possible to improve Waterdeep so drastically and so quickly.

Or perhaps there just aren't economic structures in place that would incentivize this. In the real world you could point at drastic inequality and the way that half of the world suffers from an obesity epidemic while another half starves to death, and say, “there are lots of smart people with reasons to solve this problem, and plenty of billionaires, so clearly divine intervention must be why the problem hasn't been solved.”
