I think in this case there are a lot of /really/ obvious things stopping this from happening, since part of the conceit is creative interpretations of rules-as-written, which will almost necessarily conflict with setting-as-written. One of the biggest things that any sensible DM would almost instantly patch is the Simulacrum/Wish combo, which allows the caster to avoid all of the (many) negative impacts of the Wish.

It seems /much more likely/ that there's some interaction between those two spells which causes them to either fail, or have the usual negative impacts to the original caster, but which aren't explicitly written in the rulebook (which is, after all, the map and not the territory, since actual spellcasting is (in-world) more complicated than it is as presented in the rules).

FWIW, the Adventurer's League answer is that Simulacrum /can/ cast Wish, but that the stresses of Wish apply to both the Simulacrum /and/ the original caster, and if the result is not being able to cast Wish ever again, that applies to all future Simulacrum.

(That said, I do acknowledge that the conceit of the OP's setting is taking some questionable RAW, stripping out any DM intervention, and running wild, I'm just speaking about how/why none of this probably applies with Waterdeep-as-written.)
