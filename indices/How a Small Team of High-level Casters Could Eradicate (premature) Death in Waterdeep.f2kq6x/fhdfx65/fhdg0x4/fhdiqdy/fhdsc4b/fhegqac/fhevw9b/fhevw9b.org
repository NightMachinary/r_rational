Yep, I agree on the whole wish simulicrum issue. Your interpretation is way better.

I was more responding to how I do not like the whole "divine interventions are happening everywhere" interpretation.

"Because God said so" is a really weak excuse, imo, and I don't see it applying except in very extreme situations. You don't just throw that around to solve every problem.
