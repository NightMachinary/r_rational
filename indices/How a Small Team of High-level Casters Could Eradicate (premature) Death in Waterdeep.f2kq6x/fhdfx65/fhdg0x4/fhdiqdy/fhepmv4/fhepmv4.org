  Celestials are exactly as inimical to life as fiends and great old ones. They are alien beings of pure alignment like any other.

I think this is a bit of an exaggeration. If I'm trying to save lives of average people with healing magic, I'm going to bet, every time, on the being of pure Good over the being of pure Evil or the being with motives that are explicitly /even more/ incomprehensible than the other two.
