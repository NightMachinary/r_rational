I'd say that making an automatically repeating [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/traps.htm][magic trap]] of Reincarnate is closer to rationalist dream. You have a week from death to revival, and it gives a fresh new adult body which means that most people probably have 20-40 years to gain one level which seems feasible. You are looking at something like 100k gold coins and going by wealth by level each of the 17th level characters should have 300k+.
