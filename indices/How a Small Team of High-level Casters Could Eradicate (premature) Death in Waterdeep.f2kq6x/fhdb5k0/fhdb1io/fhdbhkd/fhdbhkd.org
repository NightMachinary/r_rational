Well, Waterdeep does have at least 5 17+ level casters. Lirael Silverhand, Vajra Blackstaff, Wyllow, Manshoon, and Halaster. Now, three of those are not likely to be helping out the world above anytime soon, but those are just the ones described in Dragon Heist and DotMM that I can remember off of the top of my head, and they seem to signify a higher proportion of casters than [[/u/fallencoder][u/fallencoder]]'s analysis would say.

Still, perhaps it would be easier to brute-force the Gentle Repose issue by enlisting a ton of 3rd level casters who ride True Polymorphed Nightmares or something. A Nightmare enhanced by Haste, Expeditious Retreat, and Longstrider can move faster than a Druid with Tree Stride. 800 feet per round I think? (90 + 10)*2 = 200, with a bonus action dash, an action dash, and a Hasted dash.
