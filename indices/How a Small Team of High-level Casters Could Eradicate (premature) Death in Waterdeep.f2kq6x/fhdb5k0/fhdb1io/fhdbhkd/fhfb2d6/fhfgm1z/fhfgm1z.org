Perhaps it would be easier to end premature death in someplace like Silverymoon, then, where in canon there are schools which produce actual spellcasters of various levels. Indeed their exact quantities and levels are ambiguous, but I don't think it's such a silly concept that you might be able to scrounge up a fair number of 5th level casters. I'm not an expert on Forgotten Realms Lore, but there are organizations like the Red Wizards of Thay which are canonically made up of spellcasters.

You're right that NPCs have stat blocks instead of class levels, but many do have the Spellcasting feature with a specified caster level. Here are some direct quotes from statblocks in Dragon Heist:

#+begin_quote
  Lirael is a 19th-level spellcaster.

  Manshoon is an 18th-level spellcaster.

  Vajra is an 18th-level spellcaster.

The only actual "Class Feature" required for this plan is that of the Transmuter, who could be a Player Character.
