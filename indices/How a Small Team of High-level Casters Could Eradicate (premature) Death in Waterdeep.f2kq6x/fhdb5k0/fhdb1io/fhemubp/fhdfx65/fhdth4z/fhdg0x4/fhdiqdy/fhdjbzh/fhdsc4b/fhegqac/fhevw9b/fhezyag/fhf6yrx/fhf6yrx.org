I think where you run into a lot of questionable things (again, I understand that's the point of the setting) is in assuming that, for example, cost is a magical property of items, rather than an approximation of labor or representative of baked-in assumptions about the setting. Almost any time I read "a diamond worth 500 gp", I read it as "a diamond that would be worth approximately 500 gp in a typical D&D setting", meaning that if someone somehow manages to flood the market you don't need a diamond the size of a house, and if someone corners the market, the same diamond can't magically power twenty times more spells. Again, economic stuff is a setting conceit you're using ... but I don't think that conceit holds true in canon Waterdeep.

Using a combination of Fabricate and Major Transformation is much more defensible, but there's not much point in having a 20th level Wizard cast the Fabricate, because your two bottlenecks are the raw materials (steel etc.) and the Major Transformation, which is once per day (and also requires eight hours of labor to remake the stone):

  Starting at 14th level, you can use your action to consume the reserve of transmutation magic stored within your transmuter's stone in a single burst. When you do so, choose one of the following effects. Your transmuter's stone is destroyed and can't be remade until you finish a long rest.

But even given that's possible, we come back to something discussed elsewhere in this thread, which is how many people of which class levels we could reasonably expect to exist.
