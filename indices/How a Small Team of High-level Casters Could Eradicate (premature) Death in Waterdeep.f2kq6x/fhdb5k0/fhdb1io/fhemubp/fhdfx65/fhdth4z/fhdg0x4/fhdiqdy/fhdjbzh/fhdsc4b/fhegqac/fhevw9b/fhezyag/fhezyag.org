Yes, the Wish/Simulacrum thing is the most questionable part of this plan, but it's entirely possible to create value in other ways. For example, if the Wizard is 20th level, he could cast Fabricate 12 times per day to craft 12 1500 gp suits of Full Plate armor. He could then have a Transmuter Wizard use Major Transformation to convert the plate armor into diamonds.

As for the other “really obvious things stopping this from happening,” if you list them I can have a go at coming up with solutions.
