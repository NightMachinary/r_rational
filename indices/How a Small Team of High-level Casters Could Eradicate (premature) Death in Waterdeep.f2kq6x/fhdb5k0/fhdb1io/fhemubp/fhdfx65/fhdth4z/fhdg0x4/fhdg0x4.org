Could you link me to where Celestial patrons are explicitly stated to be evil? I mean, their spell list includes Cure Wounds, Leaser Restoration, Revivify, and Greater Restoration. Doesn't seem very anti-life to me. By your logic, any time high-level warlocks try to defeat evil or save the world, they'll be stopped by their patrons.

And I should note that while some deities may be miffed, this plan doesn't actually decrease the total death rate of Waterdeep. It just means that people die at older ages on average.
