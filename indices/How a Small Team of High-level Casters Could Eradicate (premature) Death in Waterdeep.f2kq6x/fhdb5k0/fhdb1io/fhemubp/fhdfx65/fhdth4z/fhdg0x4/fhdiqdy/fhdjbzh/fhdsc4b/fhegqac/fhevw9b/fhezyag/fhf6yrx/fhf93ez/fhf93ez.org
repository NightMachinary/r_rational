I'm glad you brought up the connection between cost and magic. In my original Wibblyverse post, I started out with a description of drastic gold inflation, but after figuring out more about magical industry, I've realized that it's not actually necessary to have have a strongly magic-influenced economy. So this post and my recent one on the industry of the Wishbound World is not at all based on an assumption that gem requirements are magically tied to economics.

Seriously, nothing about this plan for reviving people in Waterdeep depends on the gems being tied to economics. In fact, I made it specifically to work around the limitation of requiring a lot of diamonds. In the original Wibblyverse, each casting of Revivify would only need tiny, shoddy diamonds, because of the low value of the GP. In the current Wishbound World, Revivify does actually require a sizable diamond which would be worth 300 GP in a medieval setting.

And regarding the major bottlenecks of raw materials and Major Transformation, I don't think it's unrealistic to purchase enough steel for 15 suits of plate mail each day. If you say that half of the value of the plate mail comes from labor, then each Fabricate creates 700 gp of value, taking into account the resale of some products to cover losses.

And as far as the Major Transformation goes, I don't think it's that much of a stretch to have a single 14th level Transmuter in the city. You could even have a Simulacrum of the Transmuter build the Stones, so that he doesn't have to work 8 hours each day, since nothing about Major Transformation requires regaining hit points or spell slots.

The only actual high level caster you need is the 20th level Wizard, who can also be the Transmuter. From there, you can supply low level wizards with Nightmares via True Polymorph, and depend on one or two 5th level Celestial Warlocks.
