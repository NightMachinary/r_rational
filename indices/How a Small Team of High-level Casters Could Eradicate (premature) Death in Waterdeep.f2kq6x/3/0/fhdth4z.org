Adventurers commonly work together to keep people from dying. I don't see how this is different than getting them to stop an evil wizard.

What balance exactly are they preserving? If they just have to keep overpopulation from being a problem there are other ways of controlling it besides premature death. And other ways of preserving the balance besides keeping the population low. You could also try to magically feed more people, increasing the population that can be supported.

Also, they're not keeping people from dying. They're just postponing death. I imagine most people die of old age, so the life expectancy isn't even changing that much.

  Step 4, die as the city gets a train run on it by the 50+ deities whose portfolios include death.
#+end_quote

Everyone dies eventually. And if you come up with a plan to make people live longer and have more children, that's more deaths. Sure they'll be later, but gods are old, and also patient.

Also, plenty of adventurers do things like kill evil wizards that are killing people, and they don't have deities come stop them.
