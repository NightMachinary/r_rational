This doesn't sound like a great plan.

- Step 1, Somehow get a bunch of high level characters together to stop death.\\
- Step 2, watch as all the druids and clerics lose their magic powers, because they're either not preserving the balance (and going directly against it) and abusing their magic against the wishes of their deities.\\
- Step 3, survive whatever complications happen as a result of the warlock patrons' machinations occur when they've revified a ton of people, since they are granted powers by an explicitly evil source.\\
- Step 4, die as the city gets a train run on it by the 50+ deities whose portfolios include death.\\
- Step 5, spend all of eternity in super-hell as punishment and warning to others.
