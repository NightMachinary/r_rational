I'll admit 'Evil' was a bad word choice on my part. But players (especially warlocks) should remember that Celestials are exactly as inimical to life as fiends and great old ones. They are alien beings of pure alignment like any other.

Most power in DnD is granted (heck even wizard/sorcerers pull from the weave). It's not science where you just input effort and output results; there's an alien intelligence on the other end that pulls the strings and decides on your spell as it supplies the magic.

Waterdeep has, what, tens of thousands of spellcasters? We know that Waterdeep has people more intelligent than is humanly possible on earth. We know that Waterdeep has the spellcasters to spare. We know that Waterdeep has capital-G Good characters who would want this to happen.

So putting it together, when there are people who are able/motivated/willing to do something and still /cannot do it/ then we know there must be a reason. Divine intervention seems likely to me.
