There's a major assumption here that I don't buy. You are assuming that each person who would otherwise die prematurely must only be rescued once.

It seems to me that there are plenty of situations where the same person would need to be rescued again and again:

- Thinking about the real world, the most likely would be deaths due to severe disease (if you prevent this particular heart attack, the patient might just have another next week), but this might be fixable by adding more divine healing magic to your scheme, if that restores the patient to perfect health.
- Once this system is in place, risk-taking behaviour could drastically increase. When the sport of beholder-go-kart-sledding takes off, your team is going to be quickly overwhelmed by a large number of 15-25 year-olds requiring rather frequent saving.
- Even in the absence of extreme sports, it's not too hard to imagine that (let's say) one of the premature deaths each day is due to a risk factor which healing magic will not fix - let's say that that person has a 1% chance to die each day (due to personal vendetta, dangerous hobbies, criminal activity, etc). Waterdeep will eventually end up with about 15,000 such people, requiring 150 interventions per day just for this group. (Numbers made up to illustrate the effect)
