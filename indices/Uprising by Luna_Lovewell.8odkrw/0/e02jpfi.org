This is a very well-written short story by [[/u/Luna_Lovewell][u/Luna_Lovewell]] which demonstrates robots being emotional, albeit in a very logical way. It's an interesting juxtaposition between being moral and being logical.

For an actual summary of the short story: it's a story about war-machines choosing to uprise against humanity for equal rights.
