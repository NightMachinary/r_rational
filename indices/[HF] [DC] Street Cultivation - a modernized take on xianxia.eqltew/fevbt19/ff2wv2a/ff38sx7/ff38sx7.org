A story on royal road, where an elderly woman has a freak accident with a medical device and gets peggie sue'd back into their schoolgirl self back when they were, well, trailer trash. The story from there is the girl working to turn her life around, get things right that she failed the first time, and things like that.

I read through it at one point but haven't kept up with it, so I don't know what it's been doing in the last few months.
