I just could not get around how the world is still so very similar like you can almost remove the cultivation aspect and its just a novel about some guy pit fighting to pay his little sister's medical bills. It was probably done in purpose but I was looking forward to read a cultivation novel similar to the cradle series but with modern themes.
