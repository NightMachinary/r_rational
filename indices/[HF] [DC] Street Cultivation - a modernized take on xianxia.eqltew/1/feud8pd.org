Read this. It was a fun read; - broadly rational - world building that passes the smell test. - there's not enough revealed detail yet to be confident that it's well thought through. It's a first book, so there's only so much that can be done in that space if you want to write an actual plot, and there's a /lot/ of plot. - The magic system doesn't seem hard enough for my taste, but that could just be lack of exploration of the system as a whole. It's not so broken that adding the right details couldn't make it harder. - As it stands, it feels like it's faking hardness by quantifying the magic, but there's no visible reason for the numbers to be what they are in general.
