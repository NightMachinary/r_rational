My review:\\
I've definitely been enjoying this. It's... real in a way many stories aren't. The main character has a multi-faceted life that you get to see, from jobs to family to social, and not everything has something to do with each other. This is more of a slice-of-life than a literary work. The MC plays to his strengths and is aware of his weaknesses, but any cheat-codes to life have already been taken by the world at large.

It's solidly young adult, in theme, content and writing style.
