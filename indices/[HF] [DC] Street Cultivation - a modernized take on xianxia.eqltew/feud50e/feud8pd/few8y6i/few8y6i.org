I wouldn't say that it's /faking/ hardness with the numbers, as it's pretty upfront that numbers aren't everything, and even the general ballpark of your numbers don't necessarily translate to actual effectiveness. The fact that the numbers are so precise is, to me, more emblematic of their society's approach to magic: that once it's part of the world, it stops being magical. It's the fuel for superpowered combat moves and all those fun things, but science and the measuring of the world has had its way with lucrim just as much as anything else, and that is demonstrated in the magic being precisely measured in standardized units to four or five significant figures when even two is plenty for most practical purposes.
