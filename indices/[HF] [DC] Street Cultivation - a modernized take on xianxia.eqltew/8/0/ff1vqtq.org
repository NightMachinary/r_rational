To me it's less the capitalism and more the systems of power (which in the modern day setting happens to be capitalism). In older feudal times it would be lords and serfdom or combat sects or any number of methods by which people with power exerted power to maintain and extend their power.

In the demon realm case it's also worth noting that the city we visited is a city that explicitly grew out of capitalism (namely having a convenient base to conduct very capitalistic business in human cities) and we don't know if the rest of the demon world is like this. In a way you could compare the demon city we visited to one of those towns built on a gold mine that only existed to mine gold and fell apart as soon as the gold dried up.

It's worth noting that capitalism is both extremely useful and much easier to criticize than many other systems. Capitalism is a giant engine for productivity, and in magicland as in irl-land it's handily outcompeted most other economic systems by and large, but it's also the current paradigm of systems of power and when you say 'meritocracy is an illusion', you're just a cycnic instead of a heretic. And it's really easy to want to criticize capitalism when you're Rick and have been on the wrong end of the power structures all your life.
