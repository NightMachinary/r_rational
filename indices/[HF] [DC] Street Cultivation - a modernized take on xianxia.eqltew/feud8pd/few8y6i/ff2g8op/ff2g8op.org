My priors on this being done badly are high. Your interpretation is plausible, but I don't have enough info to decide yet.

Hence why I am looking forward to the second book, it's sort of make or break for the series. At least in terms of whether I'd be willing to call it rational fiction.

That said, I fully expect to enjoy the next book its just a question if which bucket it fits in.
