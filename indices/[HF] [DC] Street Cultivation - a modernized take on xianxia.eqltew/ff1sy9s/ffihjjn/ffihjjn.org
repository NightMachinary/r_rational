I'm coming to this a bit late. But my view is that in the real world there are places where capitalism is better and worse. For example Russia and Sweden are both capitalist, but Russian capitalism is much harsher to live under.

So why shouldn't a capitalist fantasy world be the bad kind of capitalism? Since the genre is defined by massive and often abusive power disparities - you better bow and scrape before the old masters, they're entitled to kill you if they feel like it - capitalism being worse here seems entirely fitting.
