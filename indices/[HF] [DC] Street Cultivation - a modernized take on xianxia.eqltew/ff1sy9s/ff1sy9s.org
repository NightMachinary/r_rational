Decent enough book, but I hate how it seems like capitalism is both the be all to end all and simultaneously the worst thing ever invented. Which while I guess is the whole point of the book, when in the second book we got to the demon realm and it turns out that demons are also suffering under capitalism my suspension of disbelief was broken. Just too much.
