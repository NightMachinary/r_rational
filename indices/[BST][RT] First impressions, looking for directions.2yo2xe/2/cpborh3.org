The nature of masks.

You say Raeni switches out faces depending on who she's with. What I'm wondering is, how much of any given face is real, and how much of it is a fabrication? People take on different behavioral patterns around different people after all, but can any of them truly be considered false?

What about her feelings towards her friends? How much does she think she values them, and how much does she think she's using them? Does she care for any of them more than she thinks she does, or does she thinks she cares for them more than she actually does? Does she ever show acts of genuine affection? Is it possible to show genuine affection when you know that you're at least partly doing it for your own gain?

As she deceives more and more, as she becomes more accustomed to those patterns of behavior, does she become comfortable with that behavior? Does it feel more natural to her than if she were to act how she used to act? Where does the act end and the "real" person begin?
