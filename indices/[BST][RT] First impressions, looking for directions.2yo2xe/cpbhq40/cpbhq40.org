Heroes are generally defined by their flaws, and character growth is generally about overcoming those flaws.

If I had to take a stab at it based on those initial sketches, Avery's flaw is that he's overcautious, and he would complete his arc of character growth by doing something reckless in service of a thing that he loves (whether that's a person or an idea). Raeni's flaw is that she's ambitious, or possibly that she lacks empathy, and she would complete her arc of character growth by throwing away a position of power in service of a thing that she loves (whether that's a person or an idea).

If I were sketching out a completely standard story, they would meet each other, find an attraction in things that they shouldn't be attracted to, and eventually have a falling out before coming back together at the completion of their character arcs. The homunculus are a narrative stop on the story path which leads up and into the mountain, and they're the place where the characters increase in power, and where Chekov's gun is handed to them. (Standard isn't derogatory - it's the standard because it works.)

If I were sketching out a less standard story, only one character would complete their character arc in full - the other would complete their arc by succumbing to their flaw, making one half of the story a tragedy and turning a one-time protagonist into an antagonist. I might also swap the genders (which would make the characters more atypical), remove any hint of romance, etc. I don't actually know if you intend a pairing here, but standard storytelling for two protagonists suggests it.

Okay, so things that interest me:

- What's at the heart of the dark mountain?
- What are the characters' internal conflicts? What's the source of their flaws? (Avery's brother died while they were out in the woods, which is a part of why he treads so lightly. Raeni was betrayed by an early lover, which is a part of why she keeps up her false faces.)
- How does magic actually work? You talk about it in terms of simple power, but what are we talking about here? Do the characters control swarms of small pearlescent creatures which are visible only with their third eye open? Do they bond to a material to give them power over it? Do they scream "Fireball!" at the top of their lungs while depleting their mana pool? (Magic is a really easy thing to get wrong, especially if you're figuring out what it can do on the fly. I strongly suggest mapping it out before writing too much.)
- What motivates the homunculi to give out their gifts and wisdom? What's their connection with the mountain, if any?
