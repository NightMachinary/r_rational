First, this sounds too much like a videogame or paper-thin action movie trope pile. Terminology from videogames also seeps in, and that isn't a good thing unless played relentlessly and with great skill. There is very little in this list of ideas that hasn't been done before precisely as presented. Putting the elements together isn't enough to make it interesting to me, or I feel most experienced readers, and certainly isn't enough to make it rational fiction. I think a lot of what is actually interesting to you about these elements maybe isn't being communicated.

Or you are simply a boring person.

I'll assume there are things missing from this presentation, as well as conceptual gaps related to storytelling and rational fiction in general, and so I'll attempt to ferret out those elements through careful questioning -- [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2yjc41/metabst_ideas_are_cheap_writing_is_hard_can_we/][as was discussed in the original thread on this topic]].

Before that, this is where I'm coming from in my evaluation and questioning of these ideas.

--------------

Rational fiction characters need to be driven by real human goals (assuming characters are human). What they do in the story is possibly all we see, but it needs to come from somewhere strongly grounded in human motivations and goals. Real people don't simply go around "adventuring" and fighting dangerous beasts just to get better at it.

Those who do similar things in real life have complicated reasons, usually don't have to do it to make a living, and are even able to be in that situation because they have absurd technological advantages that make it less of a fair fight and more of a slaughter. They don't get more arbitrarily powerful from doing so, other than sometimes monetarily. They are usually working outside the law and would arrested for poaching or worse if found out.

A world where people /do/ get more powerful from "adventuring", finding lost treasures, and killing dangerous "monsters" (or where such even existed) wouldn't look like a feudal fantasy world.

Rational worlds need realistic reactions from people and societies to in-world things. People won't act like historically and sociologically sound medieval peasants, or RenFaire villagers, if there /actually is/ a fire-breathing dragon, a horde of angry orcs, or an evil necromancer living nearby. Having big, scary threats doesn't work like in videogames. People would just avoid that shit and move away from the war zone, or the zone of strange things that kill their sons, or whatever.

Lots of questions need to be answered to make this into a world where things happen because of root causes instead of tropes. The characters seem to be driving much of the budding plot, so they need to be filled out as well. Some questions really need to be answered in the first chapter, or even the dust jacket blurb.

Questions time.

--------------

First, Avery:

- Why is what Avery does supposed to be interesting to the reader?
- What do wandering people like Avery actually /do/?
- What differentiates Avery from a murderous, kleptomaniacal hobo?
- Is this a one-orc-per-square-mile world that Avery is working in? If so, /how/?
- What are "artifacts"?
- What is "power"?
- Why "artifacts" and "power"? What are they needed for in his life?
- Why is being cautious important? Is it a positive trait in this world? Why?
- Can anyone use artifacts to gain power? If you kill Avery, can you take his? If so, why hasn't this happened already?
- How much tougher than a non-wandering, non-artifact boosted person is Avery?
- How /specifically/ does that affect the way the world works? It certainly won't somehow look like historical societies from medieval Europe or East Asia, or the modern world, just /plus magic/.
- What is an "area"? Sounds like some videogame logic seeping in.

--------------

Next, Raeni:

- Why is Raeni an interesting character? What about her situation is supposed to be interesting?
- What does she do? That's even vaguer right now than with Avery. What is interesting /specifically/ about her life?
- Why is this focused character attribute of using her friends important?
- Why is Raeni acting in this way interesting?
- What power does she have that people accept this behavior from her? This isn't high school. Everyone over 13 has seen this trait list in books and movies before, or experienced it directly. People compare notes, especially in smaller, feudal style living conditions or tight-knit modern interest groups. Non-Protagonist Characters aren't allowed to simply carry the idiot ball, after all.
- What is the difference in "physical power" between people with and without "artifacts" and what I assume is magic?
- Do artifacts exist that make you more "physically powerful", and if so why does this character attribute matter to a powerful and connected individual?
- Why is "physical power" important in anything but a crapsack, Mad Max world where you have to murder someone for breakfast with your bare (or depending on mutation levels, "bear") hands every day?
- Is this a crapsack, Mad Max world where you have to murder someone for breakfast with your bare hands every day?
- Why should anyone care about her "cards" (i.e. goals) and why do they matter to the plot?

--------------

Now, the mountain:

- /Looming over the world is a dark mountain-/ Nope. Just no. There needs to be a hell of a turn on this idea for it to be acceptable. The entire story needs to be about why this is an awesome idea to make it even slightly interesting. Maybe played absolutely /to the hilt/ this would pass muster. Not otherwise.
- Okay, fine. How long has this...mountain been happening? When did it start being strange?
- What does it mean for it to "loom over the world"? A planet the size of the Earth is literally wholly aware of a single normal sized mountain? Or just a single pseudo-feudal kingdom with 1400s technology?
- What are "adventurers" and why do they adventure around this mountain instead of being traveling merchants moving trade goods around (for example) anywhere else in the world?
- Why the hell would anyone go near a mountain full of apparently human-calibrated affective warning signs? Why don't people just leave the mountain alone?
- What reward would possibly be worth the risks?
- Why hasn't an army or wizard's guild or /something/ organized either quarantined or neutralized it by now?
- Do those things (armies, groups of powerful wizards, etc.) not exist? Why?

--------------

The obvious MacGuffin:

- Why is this character interesting to the reader?
- Why a "homunculus"?
- What do /they/ want?
- Why would they seek out a hidden location, and why would they reward people who have tracked them down after doing that?
- What do the protagonists want from interacting with a world with this character in it? How does the MacGuffin realistically intersect with the lives of the protagonists?
- Why hasn't an organized group formed to track down an individual who apparently only gives people good things? At least, those who report back...
- How do legends grow around about someone without localizing them better? Why isn't that area then swarming with people looking for them?
- How does this world have mysteries interesting enough to note in this highly suggestive way, exactly?
- Why would seeking out a legendarily hard to find person on the off chance they'll tell you some of them be better in any way than just going out to discover those mysteries yourse-...oh, is /that/ what adventurers are doing?!

That there is the sort of thing I do when working on a story. It's a lot of critical stuff and it might look negative overall, but that's because there's so much left unexplained -- things don't logically follow from what you wrote, other than in cliched, uninteresting ways.

After all this, I still think you've got something worth working on. Just...make it more /obviously/ interesting to other people. Highlight the awesome. Answer mine and similar questions about the world and character motivations and you've just about got a plot just from the logical intersections so formed.

My one very strong suggestion is, flip genders on Avery and Raeni but /keep the names the same./ They are not strongly gendered names, after all. As for the why, having a powergaming loner Indiana Jones character be a woman, and making the weak (?!) Diplomancer taking advantage of "friends" be a man shakes things up and makes the characters much more interesting. It defies expectations from the very start. The other way around, and without further rationalization and justification, is really cliched and borderline sexist with the attributes and emphasis given.
