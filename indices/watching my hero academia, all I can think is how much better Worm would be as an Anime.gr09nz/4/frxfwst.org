Lolwat? I disagree. Dragonball or naruto are baseline shonen. You just make up some cool superpower, invent a pretense for the villain, and call it a day after a fistfight

MHA isn't on a worm level, fair enough, and arguably it's still far from optimal.. but /you feel/ like damns were given in worldbuilding, balancing and internal consistency imo.
