I feel like anime has an easier time with this than many other visual/film media precisely because internal monologue is an established trope. Characters openly describe their feelings/thoughts, flashbacks are used heavily to give background, and action is often interrupted to provide broader context. Anime viewers are already accustomed to this, so I think it would actually work better for this kind of thing than a live action movie adaptation, for instance.

Apart from that, building characters and sympathy is just part of the craft of storytelling, and can certainly happen in a visual medium.

My observation was really more noting the popularity of My Hero Academia and thinking that Worm could do that genre way, way better, simply due to the depth of the worldbuilding, more interesting powers, clever use of powers, interesting takes on villains, etc.

It would certainly be much darker than MHA, with heavier tone and themes and much more serious consequences, which personally I find more appealing anyway.

In terms of pacing, I feel like it's already set up with major arcs and beats that port fairly well. There's a steady power arc and things generally move from one conflict with a group of adversaries to the next with some exposition and relationship building in between, which is a standard structure. You can cut or shorten some of the exposition and bits that drag, but overall I don't think it's that far off.

Are there aspects that you think won't translate well in particular?
