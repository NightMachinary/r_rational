  I feel like anime has an easier time with this than many other visual/film media precisely because internal monologue is an established trope. Characters openly describe their feelings/thoughts, flashbacks are used heavily to give background, and action is often interrupted to provide broader context. Anime viewers are already accustomed to this, so I think it would actually work better for this kind of thing than a live action movie adaptation, for instance.

And this is why it sucks. Which implies something about Worm itself that you think it would so well translate into terrible anime storytelling.
