The spin-off manga, MHA: Vigilantes, is more like that - the MC has a quirk, but he's older than Deku and didn't get in as a hero, and now just acts at the edge of the law like some dude who occasionally helps. It's interesting - in some ways, better than the main manga, in fact - in that it explores more the underbelly of hero society, with all its issues and all the people who have been let down by it.
