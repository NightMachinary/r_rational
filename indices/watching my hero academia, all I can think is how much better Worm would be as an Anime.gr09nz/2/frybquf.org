What upsets me most about MHA is that it sets up this very compelling shonen protagonist, one who, despite having no powers, /wants/ to be a hero more than /anyone/...

And it could have so easily been about /Anime Batman/ and overcoming fate in the most overwrought shonen way, but it's /not/ he just gets /handed/ the Best Power and his main conflict is /not accidentally killing himself or anyone else/ with it

Anyway yeah it's not bad, just...kinda papering over the gap Naruto left in the genre, I guess
