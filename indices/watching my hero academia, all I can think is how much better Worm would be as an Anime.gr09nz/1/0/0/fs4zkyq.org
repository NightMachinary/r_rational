Well, lots of people have issues with the Chimera Ant arc for that reason. I've also seen lots of people hate on "Kaguya-sama wants to be confessed to" because of the voice-over - even when the over-explaining is effectively there as part of the joke. Voice overs, narrators, internal monologues in visual media are always controversial choices.
