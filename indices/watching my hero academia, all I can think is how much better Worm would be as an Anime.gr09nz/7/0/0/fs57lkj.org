That's an interesting take; I hadn't thought about it that way.

I'm not very deep into comics so I don't know all of the details but I do recall not being a huge fan of that particular spin in Marvel; like I remember watching Avengers: Age of Ultron and being somewhat confused by what the big deal over the Sokovia Accords was; like of course, when titanic battles happen, collateral (cold as that sounds) is a thing and it's justified that the nations of the world would want to regulate that. The Avengers are great heroes but they are still just a group of people at the end of the day, with powers that could kill millions if abused/exercised incorrectly. And I get it was a movie, so there was limited time to explore and they needed conflict, but it still seemed off to me that said accords would cause an entire super hero battle to the point where it /permanently cripples Tony's lifelong friend/. Felt very forced, overall.
