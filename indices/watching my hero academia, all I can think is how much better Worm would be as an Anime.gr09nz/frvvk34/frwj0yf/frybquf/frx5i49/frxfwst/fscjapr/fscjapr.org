Definitely agree I'd love to see an animated series. Major issue through is the damn marketing and "girl show ghetto" the show runners of Young Justice, Green Lantern Animated Series and even Avatar: the Last Airbender all had their shows cancelled or severely cut down because they don't fall into the easy: is it a girl's show or a boy's show marketing dichotomy. It took the titanic success of the Harry Potter series for Marketing to even acknowledge there was such a thing as a young adult market existed, though the genre of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bildungsroman][Bildungsroman]] existed for centuries. I see any Worm adaptation getting hit with this sexism full force.

On another note where did you stop in the worm story, out of curiosity? There's an [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=710hM7YwMKc&list=PLkRjxdG1jzZISSFTpZmVk5WgC9oRlu14M][audiobook]] which should make things easier, as well as a Wiki but that has heavy spoilers.
