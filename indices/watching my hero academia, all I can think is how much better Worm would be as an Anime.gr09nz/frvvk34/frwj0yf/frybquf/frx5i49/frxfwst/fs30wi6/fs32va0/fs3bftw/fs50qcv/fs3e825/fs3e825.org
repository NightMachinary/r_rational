  What I do not like in Midoriya motivations is that he just wants to be #1.
#+end_quote

Uh? Does him? Last time I checked the motivation was just helping others and shit.

Then being #1 kinda derives from who he admires, and what this represents, but except for being the "most useful" for the purposes above it's not really the main point.

#+begin_quote
  His desire to save people stems not from empathy and compassion
#+end_quote

The first episode has some highs and lows about that, anyway it quite makes you reflect on what it means to be a hero, what it means to be brave and what it means to be a fool.

Idk what egoism has to do with this.

#+begin_quote
  not because that's who he is.
#+end_quote

I cannot think to a single moment where he's not niceguy-ing.
