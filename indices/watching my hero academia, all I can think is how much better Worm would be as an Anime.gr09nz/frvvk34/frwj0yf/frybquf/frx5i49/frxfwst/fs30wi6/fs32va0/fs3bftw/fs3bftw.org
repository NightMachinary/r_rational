What I do not like in Midoriya motivations is that he just wants to be #1. I might as well imagine him wanting to be #1 supervillain or #1 boxer, as deep as his motivation seems to be.

I just can't stop but feel that he is insincere. His desire to save people stems not from empathy and compassion, but from Endeavor like egoism. Midoriya just happens to be a "nice guy".

Sometimes Midoriya actually does things which require deep compassion for other people. But I cannot connect those actions with his core motivation. Feels like his character does those things only for the audience to root for him, not because that's who he is.
