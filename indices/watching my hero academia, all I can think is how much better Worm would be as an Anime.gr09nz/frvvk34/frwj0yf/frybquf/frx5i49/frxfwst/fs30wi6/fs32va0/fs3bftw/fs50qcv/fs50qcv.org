  His desire to save people stems not from empathy and compassion, but from Endeavor like egoism.

That would be Bakugo, his long time +bully+ friend. Midoriya wants to be #1... in saving people. He doesn't want to be #1 for the sake of fame or money or getting laid. He wants to be #1 because he wants to save people, and he wants to save ALL the people EVER. It's in fact his main difference with the other candidate to becoming the Symbol of Peace, Mirio Togata - who calls himself Lemillion because "he knows he can't save everyone, but he'd settle for saving a million". Fuck that, says Midoriya, I'm going to save everyone /anyway/. He's in fact straight up reckless and self-harming in that pursuit. When they meet Eri for the first time, Mirio - who's still 100% a good guy, no question - does the pragmatic thing and pretends he's seen nothing. But Midoriya just tries to help her right there and then. If there's another anime character that gets close to that level of masochistic altruism, it's Shiro Emiya.

It's not that I don't have problems with MHA. The story would have been more interesting with a genuinely quirkless Deku. His friendship with Bakugo is frankly toxic, and in general the story seems way too keen to forgive genuinely abusive characters like him or Endeavour. And other problems I have with it are... manga spoilers, so I won't get into them now. But I never got the impression that Deku's motivation was egotistic. If anything, the guy could use some selfishness. At this rate he's going to be a fine powder of bones and pulped muscles before he ever gets to claim that title of "greatest hero".
