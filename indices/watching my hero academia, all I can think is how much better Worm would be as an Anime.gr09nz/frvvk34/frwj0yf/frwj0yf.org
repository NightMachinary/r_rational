An adaptation of Worm would suffer from the same problem as the majority of VN and LN adaptations. Worm is carried very heavily by internal motivation and monologue, and it's not easy to show that in a visual medium, especially in a long-form medium like anime. People who don't already know what's happening )from reading the original story) are less likely to follow what's happening and why. More importantly, they're less likely to connect with the characters and understand driving motivations, just by virtue of less time with the characters and how an adaptation would need to deal with internal monologue.

Also, the manga -> anime transition is pretty smooth these days, especially in the case of MHA, because the arcs and even individual chapters are well-timed and have a good balance of internal monologue and action by virtue of the medium. For an adaptation of Worm, how would you effectively rewrite the pacing?
