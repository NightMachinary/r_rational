I feel like there's a very nice contrast between the American and Japanese viewpoints on the individual's duties towards society there. In Marvel comics, registration of heroes has been a Big Deal for decades, seen as an ultimate evil, and was eventually established after a literal civil war and pushed for by a rather fascistic faction - though eventually the new order settled into something more sensible. In My Hero Academia, /of course/ heroes are licensed by the State - how else would it be? The regulation of powers is a /fait accompli/ and the series fully promotes the notion that, even with the occasional downside, it is entirely a Good Thing.
