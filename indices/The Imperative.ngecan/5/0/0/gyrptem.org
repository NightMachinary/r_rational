it's not you, don't take this personally. the fact of society is that there is literally no meaningful change that you can make in your current circumstances. given that you have stated that you have flunked out of higher education multiple times, and have less than 200$'s worth of assets free each month, literally the most measurable amount of benefit and happiness you can bring to humanity is to yourself. See a therapist- fix your social neuroses, try to advance in your job, find a hobby, find some friends. Rationality does not somehow make you a supergenius capable of ending world hunger. The only person you are capable of helping in any measurable way is yourself. You can increase a single life's quality by incredibly, shattering amounts or donate all of your 180 dollars to some bugnet charity or something and share the equivalent increase amongst dozens of others, which will not be noticeable by anyone. Stop trying to help the world, help yourself if you truly are so utilitarian.
