If one wants to go this route (get rich to be useful) they would have to be careful of a possible obstacle that is isomorphic to a cognitive bias. (It would be more accurrate to call it a social bias but whatever)

Pierre Bourdieu (french sociologist) calls it "structuring structures". It's the phenomenon where an agent tends to internalize the incentives and utility functions of any system they thrive in.

Imagine a smart idealistic agent that wants to become a politician. They are smart so they do optimal things to be successful. But optimal things often mean lying and empty promises and lots of other compromises.

Soon power is not a mean to an end anymore, but an end in itself. (After all, more power always means more utility, they may rationalize) Before they know it, the game has shaped them into a smart not-so-idealistic-anymore agent.

The same thing can absolutely happen with money - I've seen it happen a bunch of times. Some people even end up working for the very thing they wanted to fight, swearing that soon they will leave and use their money AE-style - but they never do.
