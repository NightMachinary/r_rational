  I'm more interested in fiction-ready approaches to the problem, things that a normal person probably wouldn't think to do, but a rationalist protagonist in a ratfic might.

A fictional protagonist will often recognise something /odd/ about the world. Maybe they discover one minor magical ability, have a unique superpower, or begin to gain some form of XP to buy abilities with; they leverage this 'odd thing' and then use it to somehow Win.

A fictional protagonist who obtains None Of The Above still has one thing going for him, though; he is a Fictional Protagonist. This means that he has a /chance/. One of the following two will occur:

- He realises that he is a fictional character, and breaks the fourth wall
- Something drops into his lap, and kick-starts the plot

In the first case, he can try to find ways to [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExploitingTheFourthWall][/exploit/ the fourth wall]], using it for personal profit in some way. In the second case, he can - well - /react/ to whatever kick-started the plot. In whatever way seems most sensible.

--------------

But let's take this on the hardest mode of all - that the plot is kick-started by the fictional character posting a comment on Reddit (or similar) much like the one above, and that the story is the story of how well he follows - or fails to follow - the advice given. In such a case, the optimal path is clear; the fictional character needs to /gain skills/. These skills are then used in some way to advance his agenda. There are many ways to gain skills - and, being fictional, almost any skill that he feels he can gain will be useful /somehow/. Even if they merely increment his potential earnings (which can be pretty powerful on its own).

So, for a fictional character, I'd start be having him take classes - perhaps online classes. Maintain his social relationships, because that's a good way for more Plot to tumble over him; don't go for /massive/ course loads, but just grab the low-hanging fruit that looks interesting, one low-hanging fruit at a time.

The next steps mostly depend on what he has been learning...
