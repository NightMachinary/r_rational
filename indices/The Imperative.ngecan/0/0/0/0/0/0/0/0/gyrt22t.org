No insult taken at all. I am well aware of a myriad of shortcomings in myself, and those are of course only a subset of the true list. I was probably being flippant, though. I do know how to plan on a basic level, I have made considerable pre-planned progress in improving my mental health over the past few years and I do actually have long-term plans that I am currently implementing. I just know those plans aren't good enough, hence my wondering what people think is possible. I would like to be able to write a realistic character who began in my position and achieved some level of success in these goals.

The difference between then and now is the difference between complete hopelessness / suicidal ideation and a comfortable, forward-moving life that I know I can maintain as long as I am alive and relatively healthy. This was not a sure thing at all only a few years ago.

One primary and remaining reality of my brain function is that those excruciating hours are like literal torture. Maybe I'm just normal, only with very poorly developed coping mechanisms, but good god have I seen other people supposedly go through the same stressors and not react in the same way I do.

Edit: and there is research that increased stress throughout a lifetime leads to a shortened lifespan. So that's a compounding and frightening factor.
