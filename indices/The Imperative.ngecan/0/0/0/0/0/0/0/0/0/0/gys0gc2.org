Analysis paralysis? It is a standard feature of human thought, and there are so very many /options/ out there, and so much of our collected human knowledge is uncertain anyway. It's easy for you to say "just eat healthier", for example, but reasonable disagreements among experts in nutrition science (not to mention scientific fraud) can make that a difficult topic to decide the specifics of.

If some of those experts are necessarily wrong, what if you pick the wrong one? In the past, it was very easy for me to not understand the opportunity costs of worrying too much about opportunity costs. I still struggle with it, obviously, but it's getting better all the time.
