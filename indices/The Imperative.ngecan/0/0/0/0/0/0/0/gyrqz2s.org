The path is easy. Work hard and get promoted. Twice. But the path is hard. It requires lots of hard work and putting myself into uncomfortable situations and placing stresses on myself that I currently do not go through. On the other hand, I can take it easy, put in my work, go home for the day, and not worry about work until the next day.

There are a couple of careers in which the presentation of yourself through both expensive cloths and car is actually important, such as being a lawyer. That's not lifestyle creep because those are actual soft requirements of the job. Lifestyle creep is changing nice-to-haves to must-haves. It's buying the artisanal bread. It's going out to dinner every weekend. It's upgrading your 40" TV to the 55" model. It's going to Hawaii for vacation. It's treating yourself to better things when you don't necessarily need it. It's you buying more because you can afford more.

That's just motivation. Doing what you plan to do. Even planning to plan is something that requires motivation. That you haven't done so in years, not to be insulting, is quite slow. It shouldn't have taken you longer than a weekend to get a rough outline of a plan and then another week or two to hammer out the details.

Again, it's easy to say, hard to do. But in terms of *real hours* it actually doesn't take much at all. How long does it actually take to learn about potential careers? Maybe 10-20 hours to find something that's feasible? But those are excruciating hours where you want to be doing anything else.
