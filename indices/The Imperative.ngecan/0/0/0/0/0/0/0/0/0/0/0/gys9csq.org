Honestly, nah. We want the benefits of exercise, healthy eating, etc. but we don't want to put in the effort, so we spend a bunch of time thinking about it (which makes us feel like we're doing something) instead of actually doing it.

If you want to do things optimally it's easy to get lost in the weeds, but there are plenty of times just doing a thing at all has plenty of benefits. If we don't do those things, it's often because we'd prefer (in a hedonistic way) to be doing something else instead.
