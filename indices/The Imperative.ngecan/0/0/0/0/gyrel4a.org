I like you a lot. This is exactly the sort of thing I was hoping for with this post, and I once again greatly appreciate your effort in responding.

All I can say is that I will carefully consider these comments.

The only thing I will mention off the cuff is that of the number of people who attempt to reach financial independence /to the level of not working for their income/, I do not think any reasonable percentage of them manage this in 20 years, even if that is their single goal and their primary expenditure of time in the range of 80 hours or more per week.

This could be considered a primary goal of every true capitalist, and I will still contend that that level of success in capitalism is waaaaay more based in starting from lucky circumstances or lucking into opportunities and then capitalizing on that luck with as much effort and skill as possible.

With my meagre 25 hours and $180, there's no way I will manage financial independence in 20 years. 200 years, maybe.
