While I agree that such a singular focus is not interesting for a story, given the constraints this is the answer I came up with (which may or may not be correct).

A story can work around this by tweaking the constraints and/or requirements to diminish the need of a singular resource as the focus.

e.g. This is where flexible super powers come into play. Something like say if OP has the ability to discern the true intentions of any individual. Then OP could work on reliably recruiting individuals to his cause and growing his team through multiple avenues.

Or, say the constraint is not "within his lifetime" but, "I have 1 year to live, what can I do to make humanity better in the time I have left?" Then money would no longer be the focus as it loses feasibility as the means to the goal. OP's impact would be significantly diminished, but it would be significantly more interesting. If anything, the value proposition of taking high risk high reward options actually becomes viable if not necessary. That gamble would add suspense as there's a chance of failure.

That all being said, the core of the matter is that in our society reliable upward social mobility is difficult and not very exciting. The story of an average person's life is not going to be terribly interesting, even if they have a focus of improving humanity. Because the best way (for an average person) is going to be a well trodden path.
