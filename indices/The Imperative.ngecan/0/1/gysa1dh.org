For writing purposes, I really really dislike the "hoard X resource" trope; it can be money, time (immortality), influence, etc, but it reduces things to a single dimension that you never have to trade off against.

Money in particular is incredibly multifaceted: it has power because taxes are paid in money. It can operate as a store of time or resources, or be leverage for manipulating even more money. Hoarding it makes sense to a certain point, but not nearly enough to carry a story to the singularity.
