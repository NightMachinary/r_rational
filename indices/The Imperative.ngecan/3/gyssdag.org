A relatively simple, and doable plan:

*Monthly Hero:*

*Each month find ONE person that you could realistically help with their problems*. Rather than going after extremely difficult cases (ie: kids with cancer etc) find someone who's life sucks but can be un-sucked by the efforts of a motivated individual. Then sacrifice 100 hours and 180$ to fix as much about their life as you can. By the end of the month, ask the person to help you out help another person, within their capabilities. If they decline, that is alright.

Example:

June:\\
Betty lives a few blocks from you. She is a 75 year old frail bodied widow. She lives off her meager pension of a former school teacher.\\
100 hours means you have enough time to fix her leaking roof, help her clean out her yard, fix the sink, and un-clutter her phone so it is functional again. Help her connect with long lost freinds from work (if they still live). Assist her in signing off to a Book Club. Drive her to a doctor to see about that knee pain.

July:

Billie is a good kid, but he is not doing very well at school. The combination of being from a very poor home, and a clear case of ADD means he spends more time in detention than he should, and his grades are a forest of Fs.\\
You and Betty can help the kid straight out his grades. You could spend your money to get the kid to a competent doctor to have the ADD medicine prescribed.

August:

Cliff is dying, and that sucks. He has spinal cancer, and there is nothing to be done about it. But he would love it if his final few months were around people, not alone in the hospital bed. Every once in a while you and Betty and Billie can visit him. Play monopoly or something. Cliff has no close family, and a house that will be left vacant. Billie and his Mom live in a single rum slum hole. Can you connect these dots?
