It has worked before. On a more local level, there are loads of worker co-ops all over the country. If you work for, like, Amazon that's obviously way more difficult, but it definitely can be done even in unionbusting states. Hell, the largest worker co-op in the world, Mondragon, was founded in Catalonia (the part of Spain which has always been more socialist) literally during the fascist Franco regime.

As for the rest...yeah. It's a big problem, and I don't have most of the solutions. You could check into union history in your area. The original rednecks were Appalachian coal mine unionizers, after all. Show people that the families they profess loyalty to were more like you than they thought, and some of them might come around.
