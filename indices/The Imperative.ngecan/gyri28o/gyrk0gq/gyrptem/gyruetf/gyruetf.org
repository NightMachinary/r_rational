Oh, this is perfectly fair. That is in fact how I have spent the last several years, going from a person who was almost completely nonfunctional to a person who is confident I can at least not starve or rely on charity unless some unforeseen disaster hits me. My past self of only a few years ago is much worse than the mere incompetent wage slave version of me presented in the prompt.

I'm happy (and lucky) to still be alive, and my primary focus in real life will probably have to include a heavy focus on mental health maintenance for the rest of my life. That's just how it is.

*shrug* Doesn't mean I can't buy a few bugnets in the meantime, though. Might as well. And if someone presents a clever and interesting idea to pursue, why not try it out and see if it provides any inspiration? Fishing for literary inspiration through humanitarianism is like a two-birds-one-stone thing.
