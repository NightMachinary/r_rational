I understand why this might gain traction in EA circles, but in this case it does not follow the prompt. Human healthy life hours, not vertebrate. It's more important to me to have a robust global agriculture system, with the broadest possible range of calorie sources in case of rice crop failure and such. Any tiny advantage in such a scenario would be preferable to a greater impact on human populations.

I /do/ already support efforts to cut animal life cycles out of meat production and replace them with vat-grown meat, algae farming, insect farming and other non-vertebrate options. Veterbrate suffering is not zero cost in my particular system, but it is considerably lower priority than even a single human life's worth of healthy human life-hours. (Edit: in this vein, I'm also interested in reducing reliance on the big monocrops, creating failure-resistant variants, that sort of thing)

As for the environmental impacts, that very well may be, but the individual effect I might have is so minuscule that I would rather buy bugnets and call it a day. At least with the bugnets I provide a noticeable improvement in life chances for some percentage of people who receive them.

And, for the purposes of this prompt, it simply isn't fiction-ready or sexy enough. Is there anything particularly clever that can be done in this direction?
