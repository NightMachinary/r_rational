Ah, gotcha. This is just my take, but existential risk is often technical and addressing it will primarily stem from hiring a bunch of motivated technically-inclined folks to work on the problems, whether that's in health, physics, r&d, politics, or other fields. So some possible lines are:

1. Become one of them
2. Help educate or otherwise support these kinds of folks
3. Draw more of the general public to seek careers in these fields
4. Attract funding for technical organizations working on those fields
5. Get a high-paying job to donate funding to them yourself
6. Improve the public's appreciation for these fields
7. Organize advocacy groups to remove political blockers that prevent the technical pipeline from flowing as quickly as it could

You mention some limitations you've run up against, so those may help filter this list for you a bit.
