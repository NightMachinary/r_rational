Contingent upon if you weren't you and were replaced with a replica of you who was identical to you in terms of intelligence, mentality, and shortcomings with the sole exception of being injected with endless motivation for maximizing the human existence...

The overall goal is straightforward: Make lots of money and use said money to maximize human existence. Whether the money is through hiring other individuals or direct donations to organizations that align with your cause it doesn't really matter. Money makes the world go around and this includes any efforts of philanthropy. Everything requires money. I say money is the goal due to you currently not possessing any unique intelligence or specialized skills such as being a cancer researcher or once in a century intelligence.

So, how do you go from where you start to making lots of money? Slowly and methodically over time. You have 25 hours a week and you've already budgeted time outside of this 25 hours for establishing and maintaining friendships and relationships. So spend the 25 hours to learn a skill with the $180 budget.

Usually, time spent to maximize your primary income is the best way to maximize your income for the spent time. However, there's likely quite a hard cap on how much and how fast you can rise through the ranks as a manual laborer. So the 25 hours should be spent learning a new skill which would eventually replace your primary income source. Whether it be programming, business, or some other trained skill, you would select a profession which gives you a reasonable expectation of stable increasing trajectory of making more money.

Eventually with said accumulated money, you would either invest it to make more money, buy real estate, or something else. But the point is to spend your 25 hours trying your hardest to maximize your income. At a certain tipping point, you would start hiring or start donating your money. It really depends on how much you can make. If you become mega-rich, then you have a personal political influence. However, this is unlikely. The more likely conclusion would be being within the realm of a millionaire. There's... not a lot a millionaire can do. But there's also a lot a millionaire could do.

However, you've also mentioned that you suffer from "occasional crippling anxiety and self-doubt under pressure." Which would surely hinder your efforts to maximize your income. Thus you would initially spend a portion of the 25 hours attempting to fix those issues. Whether through therapy or self-help or putting yourself into uncomfortable situations where you conquer your fears. This time spent would be heavier in the beginning to more quickly put into motion your plan to maximize your income, if not all of the 25 hours and $180 budget being spent in the beginning.
