In personal finance when you maximize expected value you have to account for diminishing marginal returns on personal wealth. Your first 100,000 changes your whole life, while your tenth 100,000 has no appreciable effect on your lifestyle or happiness that matters. That is the beginning and the end reason for risk mitigation, your last 100,000 is almost worthless compared to the first, the value of money drops off very quickly.

The world as a whole usually doesn't have diminishing marginal returns regarding the moral value of the altruistic the actions that you take, not until you're a huge enough force that the global scale seems small. If you make 30,000 vs 36000 and donate to save 5 vs 6 lives, or if you make 6000 vs 12000 to save one vs two lives, it isn't that the 6th life is less valuable than the 2nd life. No diminishing marginal returns.

If it matters how much of it /you/ control or achieve and you do feel diminishing marginal returns on /that/, then that is different, and a common way to feel - but that is driven by motivations other than altruism.
