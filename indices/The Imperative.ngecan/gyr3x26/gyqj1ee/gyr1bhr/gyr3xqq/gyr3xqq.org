Yeah, this is primarily for fiction based in the real world.

Your point may indeed be true, but with even below-average luck my hypothetical above-average edge would be entirely quashed, and both my time and money wasted. The risk of complete failure is quite high for a plan like this, I would say.

I remember reading stuff like The Black Swan, and its idea that almost all of the successes of successful traders happen /despite/ themselves. At the very least, it's too luck-based to be a realistic and scalable strategy.
