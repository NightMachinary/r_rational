You sound like a clone of me, except slightly younger and with more experience in social relationships with others.

I personally believe that none of the problems currently destroying the biosphere we live in will or can be solved under current economic conditions. Continuing to pump carbon into the atmosphere, plastic into the oceans, and lies into people, is too profitable to a set of people who fully plan to be either dead or on Mars before the seas rise to claim us all, for humanity to stop playing Chicken with Death before it is far too late.

Which means the only way to save humanity is to restructure society and the economy. Unionize your workplace, and have the union give an ultimatum: sell to us, or have your business sabotaged. Restructure your workplace into a democratically owned and operated enterprise (co-ops are, on top of being better at business in every way, also better at environmental stewardship). Convince others in your town to do the same. Get enough unions together that you can run your town independently of the traditional government, and be an example to others on how to do it themselves.
