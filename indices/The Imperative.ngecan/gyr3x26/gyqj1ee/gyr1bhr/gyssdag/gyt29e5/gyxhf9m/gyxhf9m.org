Has a peaceful local communist shift like this ever actually happened?

In any case, for my particular situation, effective unions are crippled in my state through right-to-work laws. Anyone I tried to get together would get fired and our workplaces would be immediately filled with scabs. Remember, I live in a college town. A large percentage of the work force are transient 18-22 year olds who aren't going to stay, and next year there will be a new crop of them ready to work.

This might work somewhere else in the USA, but not for me. And I promise you that the methed-up / pill-popping rednecks who constitute the true underclass in my area would start lynching minorities in the streets if they took political power from the bourgeoisie. The previous statement is not a joke, either, it is a realistic expectation.
