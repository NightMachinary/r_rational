Please elaborate. I think this is a fairly reasonable prompt to ask about, to better understand how smart people in the real world might go about this sort of thing. I know that I'm probably not smart enough to design a realistic character who follows from this prompt, so I'm seeking the input of other writers. The origins of this sub include a philosophy of self-improvement in the real world, so I thought it seemed an appropriate place to ask.

If you're talking about my wages and such, I certainly regret my current lack of outward success in American society. At least I never got addicted to anything, or I would probably be dead instead of living as a comfortable working class laborer.

I have more effective purchasing power than the vast majority of historical humans, and quite a few living ones, which is one consolation.
