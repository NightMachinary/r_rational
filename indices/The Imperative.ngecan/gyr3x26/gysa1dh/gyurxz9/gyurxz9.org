I think that's a really important point here. There should be a strong motivation to take risks with your existing money. You could play it safe and grow your money slowly, but then you don't have a story, you have a trickle of water slowly grinding down dirt until it forms a stream. Boring. Or you could take a calculated risk, invest $X in a project that might pay off, then be faced with unexpected difficulties that you have to resolve. Bet $X against Nemesis Y that you can do something, and maybe Nemesis Y knows something that you don't.

Or, you might be called upon to spend some to solve Local Area Problem, but it will cripple your income infrastructure. But if you don't do it, people will suffer! Is the long term benefit of your money worth the short term suffering of, say, not replacing the water treatment facility? Can you figure out a stopgap that will alleviate the suffering long enough for you to close the income gap?

If you put off short-term human benefits too long for the sake of amassing great wealth so you can do more good later, is there a point at which you become the very thing you profess to detest, a soulless billionaire who doesn't actually care about improving the human condition?
