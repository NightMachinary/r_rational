  How do I handle the possibility of such a long-term plan to completely fail due to unexpected injury, disease or death? If I die in one year without any actual progress towards the two maximizations (which is a non-zero possibility), only self-care, my utilitarian worth under the proposed value system remains zero. This would be utter failure.

You weigh the probabilities against expected values. What is the probability of you dying within a year? Within two years? Within 20 years? These probabilities have general answers and more specific answers for yourself. Then multiply that against the measured "good" that you can do, considering each path for your future. Then select the path with the highest expected value. Thus if you /currently had cancer/ and you expected that you would die within a year, then the route of trying to learn a skill to maximize future income would be very unlikely. On the other hand, if you have no health problems and the probability of you living a long and healthy life are high, then taking the route of maximizing income means that the expected good that you can do is higher than the expected good you can do if you continued down the path of manual labor.

I don't recall how to do the math on calculating these expected values but there's a lot of online resources on learning how to do them. And for your hypothetical self, spending the first of the 100 hours a month on learning statistics to calculate the maximized path forward such be the very first step. Planning is always the first step. Sometimes you also have to learn to even be able to plan.

  Any opinions on specific in-demand, scalable and marketable skills that could be self-taught or funded within my budget?

The internet is a free resource where you can learn anything. You can learn to be pretty much anything, learn /about/ every field, and learn about the expected probabilities of advancement. Selecting the best possible path forward would again, fall into the initial research time.

I personally do not know which field would give the best probabilities of advancement as this would also be highly dependent upon your own personal proclivities. As even if you had infinite motivation, a person learns and advances what they like significantly faster than what they don't like.

The first career transition is likely to have significant impact on lifetime earnings potential. But it's also possible to have a transitory first career from which you would generate seed money to transition to a previously unobtainable career (such as learning programming, becoming a developer for 5 years to earn money to go into medical school). Again, this would fall into the initial research phase and would have to be weighed against each expected value.

  A great number of capitalist folk attempt to spend their lives making more and more money, whether for themselves, their descendants, or charitable giving. Following from that, a great number of people are already millionaires, or more. What is the opportunity cost of attempting the same long-term strategy as these people, when budget could be spent influencing those who have already done the hard part and accumulated the resources?

I would say, that earning money is *still* the first step. If you achieve financial freedom, or never having to work again, then you free up an additional 45 hours a week that you can spend towards convincing others to part with their money for charitable causes. Again, this goes into probabilities. If you expect to live an additional 50 years, then spending 20 years to achieve financial freedom allows you to spend 30 years at your quoted "I spend around 45 hours per week working" to "convincing others" with an additional 45 hours a week (for a total of 70 hours a week). This would overshadow the 50 consistent years of continuing your current work and spending 25 hours a week of "convincing others."

This to nothing to say of the calculus of the situation. If your expected lifetime changes in 10 years while in the money making phase (say you develop diabetes), then your expected lifetime decreases. But at that point, you can also pivot your plan, as you can "retire" as you don't expect to live as long and don't need as much money. But again, these probabilities of events can and should be calculated at the beginning phase. I know I'm front loading a lot into research, but that's just how it is. Step 1: Learn statistics. Step 2: Apply statistics to probabilities for best expected outcomes. Even if you're not extremely good at math, it's a necessary first step to learn for maximization.
