  I don't recall how to do the math on calculating these expected values but there's a lot of online resources on learning how to do them.

Very straightforward - if you have a 10% chance of earning $100, then your expected value is 10% of $100. The tricky parts are (a) estimating those probabilities, (b) making sure that you check all 100% of the timeline (or at least the most probable outcomes), (c) the value of money is /not/ consistent over time ($100 now is worth more than $100 next month - there are more complex formulae that can handle this time-difference in value, but they require predicting the interest rate(s) in advance)
