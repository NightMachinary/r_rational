IMO there's almost no difference between you and a motivated you. What is the difference between you and a motivated you? The motivated you just does things. They start.

What's the difference between you starting and not starting? It's quite literally a razor thin line which I don't think even exists. You just do it. How do you start exercising? You just do it. How do you eat healthier? You just do it.

But intriguingly it's also a mountainous barrier that many of us can't overcome.
