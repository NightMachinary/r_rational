I am of course interested in what you believe your path to doubling your income might be (only if you are willing to share). I will look more closely into this concept of lifestyle creep, and see what I can determine from it. It does seem like it would be an obvious effect to see in hindsight, and a difficult effect to avoid in practice for a person with social responsibilities and a career which comes with opulence costs to maintain forward progress and respect within your field.

As for the motivation problem, as you say, that is certainly the difference between this hypothetical person and the real person behind them. Even before the planning phase, training my discipline and my ability to accurately budget and use my resources to /effectively plan/ has been my primary goal for several years, with predictably low levels of success.
