  The only thing I will mention off the cuff is that of the number of people who attempt to reach financial independence to the level of not working for their income, I do not think any reasonable percentage of them manage this in 20 years, even if that is their single goal and their primary expenditure of time in the range of 80 hours or more per week.

They don't reach it because of spending. [[https://www.thesimpledollar.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/earlyRetirementGrid_CORRECT.png][Financial independence can be roughly approximately estimated between spending and earning to years.]] The problem most people encounter is that as they earn more money, they spend more money. So called "lifestyle creep." But an individual can achieve financial independence in 20 years if they continuously cap their spending at roughly 3/5th of their take home income while saving and investing the other 2/5th. Or even faster than 20 years if they don't spend as much.

  This could be considered a primary goal of every true capitalist, and I will still contend that that level of success in capitalism is waaaaay more based in starting from lucky circumstances or lucking into opportunities and then capitalizing on that luck with as much effort and skill as possible.

I don't disagree that luck is the *primary factor* for determining success. Birth is the ultimate lottery. If your mother happened to live in a tiny tribal village in the rainforests of Nigeria, then I don't think you'd even know of the opportunities available, let alone be able to take advantage of them. On the other hand consider X Ã† A-12, Elon Musk's son. He's already won the game as soon as he was born. Hard work is a necessary but insufficient condition for success for the majority of individuals. But it's still necessary.

  With my meagre 25 hours and $180, there's no way I will manage financial independence in 20 years. 200 years, maybe.

Again, I would say it's possible. It's even probable. 25 hours a week is enough to learn a skill to transition into a different higher paying career. Again, it's about transitioning and increasing your primary source of income. For a motivated individual, I don't see how they couldn't transition into a higher paying career within 5 years. Then that's 15 years of a high salary and ever increasing pay. If you have /zero/ lifestyle creep, then that's financial independence.

Consider an average manual laborer's salary of $30,000. It's literally impossible for this laborer to spend more than $30,000 a year (barring going into debt, but that's completely unsustainable). If this person transitions into a white collar job, most white collar jobs make a starting salary of ~$50,000. *Very roughly* this is already financial independence in 20 years if this individual does not increase their spending from before they transitioned jobs. Yes, they'll live like they make $30,000 for the rest of their live, but they can stop working in 20 years.

All of this being said, I never mentioned the ease or difficulty. It's all extremely difficult as you'll be constantly putting yourself into situations that you don't want to be in and doing things you don't want to be doing and thus will take *endless motivation.* Which was the very first thing I said.

Planning the path is not hard. Actually walking it is. Most people know what they need to do but lack the motivation to achieve it. For example, I know my path forward to be able to double my income within 5-10 years, but I lack the daily motivation required to put in the focused hours to actually achieve it.
