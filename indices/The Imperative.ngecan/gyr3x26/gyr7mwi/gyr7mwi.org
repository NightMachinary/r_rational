I greatly appreciate this detailed response. A few follow-up questions:

- How do I handle the possibility of such a long-term plan to completely fail due to unexpected injury, disease or death? If I die in one year without any actual progress towards the two maximizations (which is a non-zero possibility), only self-care, my utilitarian worth under the proposed value system remains zero. This would be utter failure.

- Any opinions on specific in-demand, scalable and marketable skills that could be self-taught or funded within my budget?

- A great number of capitalist folk attempt to spend their lives making more and more money, whether for themselves, their descendants, or charitable giving. Following from that, a great number of people are /already/ millionaires, or more. What is the opportunity cost of attempting the same long-term strategy as these people, when budget could be spent influencing those who have already done the hard part and accumulated the resources?

If I convince even one multi-millionaire to fund humanitarian efforts to the tune of 1 million or more, I get the /entire/ benefit of this strategy without as much of the above-discussed risk of early death and the general risk of failure in capitalism (which is so common it's essentially ubiquitous, and I have no reason to believe I will be more successful than average, being an average or even below-average intelligence myself).

There are a lot more current millionaires than there are reliable opportunities for me to become one myself, in my quick estimation. It would be more scalable, and once I have one, the infusion of funds allows my efforts to convince others to grow, creating a scalable and even self-sustaining maximizing force.
