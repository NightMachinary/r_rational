I believe there is a flaw in this logic. Risk aversion in personal finance is necessary if /you want to be in control of the use of those finances/.

The hypothetical version of myself in this scenario wishes to put all available efforts (the budget) into the two maximizations. If all of those efforts are put in, and zero maximization is actualized, that is utter failure.

What matters is what actually happens. If my entire edifice of effort can be negated with a coin flip, there were probably better uses for that budget.
