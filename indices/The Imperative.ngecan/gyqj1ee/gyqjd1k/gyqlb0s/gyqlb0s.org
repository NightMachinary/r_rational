That is fair, I suppose I wasn't particularly clear, but I was looking for out-there fiction-ready ideas rather than necessarily real EA work.

As in, what shenanigans can a rationalist protagonist get up to if they have an exceedingly *average* life? It's modeled after my own life for realism, and because it's interesting to me to think about what I would do as an author if I was writing my own life in an internally consistent way (maybe a bit self-indulgent of me).

I also am not assuming that the people in this community are necessarily effective altruists themselves. It's a constrained munchkinry challenge.
