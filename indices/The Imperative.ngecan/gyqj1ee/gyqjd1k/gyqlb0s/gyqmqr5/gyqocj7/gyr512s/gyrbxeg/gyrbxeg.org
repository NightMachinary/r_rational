I think this is essentially what Daniel Kahneman is trying to do with his books. "Nudge", "Thinking, Fast and Slow", and the new one, "Noise", are concise explorations that any politician could absorb in a month of casual reading. The gravity of these books is immense, even shocking, and yet?

Kahneman is an expert at the very highest levels of expertise, and he's only managed to just barely get the ball rolling on this front after 50 years of work in the field.

Yikes.

I wish him all the best. Maybe I could spend my budget buying copies of these books and mailing them to every politician and candidate in the world.
