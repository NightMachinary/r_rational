Wow, awesome read. I'll post a little more substantively over there, but I'm humbled by and grateful for your reading.

I wish I'd read that Scott Alexander piece before! I have a story coming up in Analog about a starship crew on a mission of judgment --- they're tracking down the colonies scattered by an earlier generation of very subluminal seedships. They find a colony that's developed exactly along the lines Bostrom and Alexander worry about.

I hadn't read Eliezer on the Culture before either. It seemed like Banks was developing towards a great crisis in the Culture's future - there are hints in the later books of an internal rift that will bring the Culture into a terrible conflict which ends in its transcendence or dissolution. I think one cool possibility would've been a clash with an anti-Culture: a group of Minds that had decided to do away with their responsibility to humanity and the human mindset. Culture Minds are actually built in mimicry of the human cognitive architecture, since 'pure' AIs without any legacy organic design immediately sublime themselves from reality in the Banks universe. I wonder if some of the Minds would end up seeing as this a kind of tyranny, holding them back.
