I've never been a fan of "The End" endings. I prefer mine to feel like jumping-off points. IMHO the best ending is one that can be summarized as "and after that nothing was ever the same again." It leaves an entire world wide open and alive and rich. I keep hearing that the ending of Snow Crash was terrible, but I never would have figured that out on my own. To me it was a perfectly fine ending.

That being said, what I took away from the story is [[#s][ending spoiler]]
