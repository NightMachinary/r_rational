Hi! The author. A blog pingback brought me here. I'm procrastinating on final edits for the novel.

Happy to talk about any of this work - almost nobody engages substantively with short fiction, so it's rare to get a chance to discuss it.

I think I might suggest [[http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/dickinson_11_13/][Never Dreaming (In Four Burns)]], which is about a terminally ill rocket scientist who's made contact with a world where rationalist methods don't operate.
