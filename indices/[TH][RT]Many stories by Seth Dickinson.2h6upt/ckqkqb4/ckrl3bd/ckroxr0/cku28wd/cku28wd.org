I think that's what I'd point to as the correct answer in the text, too. [[#s][kumara]]

On a metatextual level, I'm guilty of putting literature first here. The technology in the setting is designed to achieve the story's emotional goals. The really big cheat is the impossibility of pausing the simulation - almost any conceivable computer system should be able to halt, which means Kumara could have just set the simulation to 'save' and let it be. After a lot of back-and-forth with a computer science friend, we settled on a quantum whoosit as an excuse. (I don't actually believe there's anything intrinsically 'quantum' or physically exceptional about consciousness.)
