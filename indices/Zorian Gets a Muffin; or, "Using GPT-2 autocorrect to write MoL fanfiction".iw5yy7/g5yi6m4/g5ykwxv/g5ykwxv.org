Um, the version of AiDungeon that requires GPT-3 is already pay-to-use. The one that uses gpt-2 is free, but you will be able to run that on your own with a GTX 3070 Ti anyways. Or you can run it on your cpu now, if you don't mind waiting 2-3 minutes for a prediction. Edit: Seems like they changed the free version from gpt-2 to a smaller size gpt-3 version. Hmm.
