I am roughly halfway through it (getting to the part Escapement mentions about politics/politicians, though it was foreseeable a lot earlier), and I am mostly enjoying it, but it doesn't really feel like vintage Stephenson to me (I'd include Diamond Age, the Baroque Cycle, and Anathem in that category). Compared to Anathem, it feels intentionally dumbed-down (directed to a broader audience?); compared to the Baroque Cycle it feels criminally under-researched. There is presumably a TVTrope for suspension of disbelief being much harder for stories that claim to be set in the present day, and it was in full force for me.

Two examples:

1) Stephenson seems to want the story to be set in the present day (with Skype and Facebook and Twitter and Python), but it's obviously set 10-20 years in the future (with asteroid mining actually a thing and a much-expanded ISS and better-developed swarm AI). Given the latter, I found the repeated references to present-day stuff *by name* /extremely/ annoying and immersion-breaking. You can't treat 20 years from now like the present, and I expect better from Stephenson.

2) Similarly, given how much research Stephenson put into the Baroque Cycle, it astonishes me how little effort he seems to have put into researching some parts of the real world. I am a physics grad student, so the inaccuracies in how he depicts the culture of astrophysicists (especially the Neil deGrasse Tyson expy) were always going to bother me. But even beyond those minutiae, which probably won't bother anyone else, there's just a bunch of sloppiness and mixed opportunites. One example: for reasons which I won't spoil, a passage in the book takes place in Bhutan. I was really excited, because I was sure he was going to talk about [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_National_Happiness][Gross National Happiness]], which would have meshed brilliantly with what was going on at that point in the book--but then he just treated Bhutan as a generic Buddhist country for no reason.

3) (This is the point where I think the book strays furthest from rationalist.) In this book, for whatever reason, Stephenson seems totally wedded to the Great Man theory of history, in the sense that only his protagonists get to come up with ideas. There's a point very early on in the book where one of his characters realizes, a week after the moon blows up, that it will have particularly bad effects for the viability of life on earth in the near future. Set aside that it takes him a week to do this; the unbelievable part is that /literally no one else in the world/ seems to figure this out until a similar period of time has passed. This is something that would be e.g. posted on Reddit within /minutes/ of the moon blowing up.
