I just wish to note that reading LWian stuff and /The Diamond Age/ around the same time was kinda painful, what with Stephenson saying in TDA that AI can't ever work, and the Platonism of /Anathem/ was also quite discouraging.

Oh, and God knows his material on language and the mind in /Snow Crash/ was a bunch of fucking bullshit that contradicts his whole "AI can't work" thing in /The Diamond Age/ to boot.

You know, normally I like Stephenson, though I don't like his politics. But I guess at some point these kvetches about the science have to come out.
