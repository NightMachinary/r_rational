I finished it last night; I think it's a really good story, and probably takes my 'favorite Stephenson work' from The Diamond Age. I liked it a lot. However, Seveneves doesn't really depart from Stephenson's tendency towards disappointing endings.

I honestly felt that Stephenson's attitude towards politics/politicians strongly approached the 'evil' (as contrasted with virtuous technology-proficient nerds) in the good and evil of this sidebar. Certain characters fell flat.

That said, the story is extremely well researched and described and thought out; I really liked it overall, and you can tell a lot of effort was spent on technical details.
