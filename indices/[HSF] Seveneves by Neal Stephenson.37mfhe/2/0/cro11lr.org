  I honestly felt that Stephenson's attitude towards politics/politicians strongly approached the 'evil' (as contrasted with virtuous technology-proficient nerds) in the good and evil of this sidebar. Certain characters fell flat.

I agree with this. It wasn't a huge problem for me given that the bulk of the conflict was Man vs. Nature instead of Man vs. Man; if the primary focus had been the political aspects instead of the engineering aspects, it would have been a major weakness instead of a minor one.
