I took the platonism in /Anathem/ as the speculative conceit (and also potentially as an homage to Godel's own platonism), rather than indicative of Stephenson's actual beliefs. I think you can make the same excuse for /Diamond Age/--he wanted to write a particular kind of story and AI (except the Primer) didn't really fit in it. But I agree that his science is not always the best. That's what Greg Egan is for!
