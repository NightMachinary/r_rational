Would love to hear a bit more. I found the book vague on this front.

Otherwise: like The Martian, it gets pretty deep into the intricacies of various engineering challenges. The situation in The Martian wasn't as inherently interesting, but the basics of maintaining food, air, power were still well conveyed. In Seveneves, I found some of topics engaging (bolide fragmentation) and sometimes too familiar (orbital mechanics, covered better in Anathem and elsewhere), and sometimes inefficiently realized in prose (tedious descriptions of spacecraft).

Also, I am finding supposedly smart characters making very dumb decisions too much of the time, to an infuriating degree. The bad ideas are quite disproportionately assigned to the female characters.
