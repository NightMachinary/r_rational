The [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NextSundayAD][Next Sunday AD]] thing bothered me a little bit. It wasn't so much the inclusion of real-world names (since Python has been around for 25 years already and it's reasonable to expect that it will be around another 25), so much as the fact that this imprecision causes the book to lose a little bit of its grounding. Does the book take place in 2020 or 2040? There might be enough clues to peg it correctly, it's not at all obvious to the reader.

There's a similar thing with JBF; you don't actually know whether she's a Democrat or Republican. This is a cheeky bit of slight-of-hand (and ultimately, it's not important), but it makes the world feel a little bit less real. It's a bit of cheekiness that I didn't really want to be there.

  3) (This is the point where I think the book strays furthest from rationalist.) In this book, for whatever reason, Stephenson seems totally wedded to the Great Man theory of history, in the sense that only his protagonists get to come up with ideas. There's a point very early on in the book where one of his characters realizes, a week after the moon blows up, that it will have particularly bad effects for the viability of life on earth in the near future. Set aside that it takes him a week to do this; the unbelievable part is that literally no one else in the world seems to figure this out until a similar period of time has passed. This is something that would be e.g. posted on Reddit within minutes of the moon blowing up.

Well, the conversation on Reddit would go something like, "The moon blew up, we're all going to die!" and someone else would say, "No, the moon is still gravitationally bound, it's keeping the same orbit, it's just going to continue on its course with no appreciable changes to life on Earth". Which is just basic physics. The real issue is not that the moon exploded into seven pieces, it's the grinding down process, which isn't immediately obvious (at least, not within minutes of it happening).
