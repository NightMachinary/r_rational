  The real issue is not that the moon exploded into seven pieces, it's the grinding down process, which isn't immediately obvious (at least, not within minutes of it happening).

I don't think this is true (that it's not immediately obvious). The very fact that Neal Stephenson can come up with it at all indicates to me that it would be immediately obvious to a sufficiently large group of people that it would hit Reddit, etc. immediately (and sure, it might take some time to pass from "some people are saying this" -> "more people are believing it" -> "the mainstream media is talking about it" but I think we're talking hours not days). Even if you don't believe that logic, we've been doing simulations of the moon's formation for at least a decade now; I don't want to look up the papers but I therefore have at least 3 sigma confidence that there are at least some papers on e.g. arXiv that mention precisely this issue.
