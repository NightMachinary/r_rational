  There's a similar thing with JBF; you don't actually know whether she's a Democrat or Republican. This is a cheeky bit of slight-of-hand (and ultimately, it's not important), but it makes the world feel a little bit less real. It's a bit of cheekiness that I didn't really want to be there.

It's also cheekiness that hasn't really made sense since 2008, or even 2006. It's /been a while now/ since the Democrats and the Republicans were /actually/ indistinguishable from each-other, partly because the Republicans have steadily realized what the fuck the DNC is doing with this triangulation thing and /gone batshit insane/ to keep their own base under their own wing, but also partly because Labor has been waking up a bit more recently.
