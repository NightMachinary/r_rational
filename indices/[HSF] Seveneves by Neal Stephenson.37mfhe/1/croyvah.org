Currently listening to it. Niggles in the order they hit me:

1: The plan is to build a closed ecosystem and industrial infrastructure in a place secure against the hard rain. Digging into bedrock would be /far/ easier, in particular because a much greater part of the work force would have applicable skills towards the problem of "Dig the mines of moria" This is even mentioned early on, then so far mostly utterly ignored. WTF?

2: "you can't use iron for rocket fuel".. Wrong. You totally can. They have an iron-nickel asteroid on hand, and can obviously find as much rock as they care to due to moon fragmentation. So the obvious answer to all propulsion problems is "Mass drivers".
