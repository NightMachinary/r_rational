How I think it would go:

Masego makes a spell to lift his corner for him so he can read in peace. Indrani immediately let it go in favor of scratching her bum. Hakram holds half the weight by himself. There is a pillar of pure gold on wheels in place of Vivienne, which is nowhere to be seen.

Akua is, of course, ahead of everyone throwing flowers to make a path. The fact that those are funerary flowers is completely accidental, she assures Cat.
