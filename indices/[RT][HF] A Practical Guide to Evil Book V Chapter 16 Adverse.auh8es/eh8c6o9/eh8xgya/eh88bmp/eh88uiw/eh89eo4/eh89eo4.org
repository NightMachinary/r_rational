Ever since Indrani almost died in the Everdark due to Wonter going crazy, she's been put in situations where her formidable fighting prowess can't save her if things go south. This is psychologically very difficult for her to deal with. Cat wants to make her deal with it because it's best for her in the long run. This makes Imdrani angry, in addition to how being put in situations like that makes her feel.
