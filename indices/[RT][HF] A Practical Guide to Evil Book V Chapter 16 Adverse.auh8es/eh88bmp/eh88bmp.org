The dispute between Razin and Elvera happened more quickly than I expected, and ended more peacefully too. Though I doubt we've seen the last of it.

I wonder how EE handles those off-screen conflicts, if he considers what each character would do and basically writes a draft without publishing it, or if he just throws dice or something.
