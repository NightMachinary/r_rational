That's all true but I'm not sure it can be considered a weak spot in the setting. This is the sort of stuff I am comfortable handwaving since I'm writing fantasy, which doesn't necessarily correspond to our own natural laws. I can just mention some weird biological attributes of the species that make eating humans viable. Maybe consuming human brains is somehow beneficial to them. Anyhow, It should definitely be addressed at some point in the story, thank you.
