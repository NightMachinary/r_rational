  one of the widely agreed-upon theories in academics is that Sharena not only changes the host, but also its offspring, independent of exposure to Sharena by the descendants.

After four generations of exposure to Sharena humans are radically changed by it. Even if a child is raised without the insertion of any Sharena they will still have traces of it, enough that blending in with human slaves will be extremely difficult.

What they could do is employ a newly freed high caste Velargh slave. It's possible in theory but in practice extremely improbable to pull off. They would have to free a slave at an appropriate age for long and extensive training. That person would have to possess the right talent and willingness to risk their newly acquired freedom and life. The list of possible candidates is extremely short to begin with since high-caste slaves aren't easy to free

Even if they did find that individual, execution of a three-part plan- infiltration, data extraction, and escape is highly unlikely considering Velargh's tight security and capabilities.
