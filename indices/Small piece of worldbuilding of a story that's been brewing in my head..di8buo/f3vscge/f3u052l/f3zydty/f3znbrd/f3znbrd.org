Humans aren't really good cattle.. We breed and grow slowly, need a lot more calories than our sizes denote, can't really feasibly survive on a vegetarian diet without modern food preservation and trade, generally you want the animals you use for food to eat things that you can't for efficiency sake it's why we mostly don't eat carnivores, we can just eat the meat they'd eat instead.
