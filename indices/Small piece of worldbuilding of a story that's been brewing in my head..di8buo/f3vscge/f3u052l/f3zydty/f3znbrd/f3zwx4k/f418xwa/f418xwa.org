It's not about viability or natural laws it's about inefficiency. Using humans as cattle is comparable to silly economical systems you see in fiction sometimes.. It will annoy the people here tremendously after the first one figures it out and comments on it.

Maybe as a raid, they'd capture humans from their villages to eat their brains for some magical benefit, but raising humans as cattle, is just too silly.
