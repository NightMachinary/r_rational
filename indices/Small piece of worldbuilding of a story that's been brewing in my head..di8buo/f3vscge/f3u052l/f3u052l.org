  Some of our elite operatives had managed to infiltrate Velargh towns and extract human slaves in addition to tomes from their libraries. A few of these slaves were considered high-caste in the Velargh society. They could write and speak their language well enough to help our scholars decipher parts of the writings.

  The only way to complete the picture is to gain access to the other races' records. That's not going to be possible in the near future. Sharena or no Sharena, a Velargh could still crush a man's wrist like snapping dry wood.

This thing which at the end of the document is described as 'impossible' is clearly a thing which has been done before.

Extreme difficulty would certainly be plausible - after all, it required 'elite operatives' the first time - but it seems a bit much to call it outright /impossible/.
