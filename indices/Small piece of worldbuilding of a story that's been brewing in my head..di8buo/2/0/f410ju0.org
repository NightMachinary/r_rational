I see your point, though /some/ worldbuilding has to be done. I can probably create stuff on the fly but after a while inconsistencies are sure to pile up. I could revise later, sure, but my plan is to post weekly chapters and build a decent-sized readership. A poor first impression would probably hurt that.

Hopefully, I won't end up with a 300K-word tome and no story to show for it. (Not that there's anything wrong with that. I can see how someone might slap on a story almost as an afterthought, and that's ok too. Just not my thing).

If I'm not mistaken, you have experience with webnovels. Where should I post my story? Would you recommend one site or multiple sites for more traffic?
