Eh, people are surprisingly forgiving and it's surprisingly easy to write your way out of a hole. The worldbuilding that I did for The Two Year Emperor would have fit on a postcard and it was never an issue.

tl;dr I'd recommend posting on SufficientVelocity.com

Longer version:

I started off on fanfiction.net but probably won't post there again. Their interface is a complete pain and the ability to interact with readers is very limited -- they don't have threaded comments or a way to link to a specific comment, and you can't respond to comments except via PM, which means you can't respond to guest comments. Their discoverability is for ass, as search is very basic and community features are limited. Plus, they use JavaScript to disable selecting text and copying it, making it harder for people to share snippets of your work or incorporate them into comments, and harder for you to quote specific parts of a comment. On the plus side, their interface is adequate and they have the best statistics out of all the publishing sites I've tried. They tell you how many views you got per chapter, from which countries, how many comments on each chapter, and more. Also, the mods are effectively non-existent, so you can post anything you want without worrying that someone is going to get bent out of shape.

After that I tried ArchiveOfOurOwn.com, although I ended up not publishing there because their statistics were very limited and at the time that was a big deal for me. I have since decided that it's not, and AO3 has a very rich tagging system plus inline and threaded comments, so it might be a good choice.

I've never used RoyalRoad.com, but they do have built-in monetization options, which is nice. I wouldn't worry about that for a first novel, though.

Next I tried SpaceBattles.com. Avoid them; the readership is a toxic dumpster fire and the mods are capricious and hair-trigger, handing out infractions and temporary threadbans whenever their sodas get warm. Less importantly, the site is visually unappealing and the rating system is limited.

Finally, I moved to SufficientVelocity.com, another forum site. Overall, I'm quite pleased. Pros and cons:

- It has a decent sized readership
- It's easy to use, albeit minimal from a publishing standpoint
- The ability to interact with users is excellent: linking to a particular post is easy and quoting is easy (the quotes even automatically link back to the source)
- You can block abusive readers so as to not see their content
- The PM system is feature-rich
- There is an alert system for when readers reply or rate
- The rating system is nuanced
- The site is visually appealing
- The mods are active but relatively okay -- my experience has been that they are usually neither capricious nor trigger-happy. I have had only one serious negative experience with them in four years, albeit it was a doozy -- multiple days of threadlock, readers getting infracted for bullshit reasons, and a real-time inquisition that was poorly organized and exhausting despite the fact that they eventually decided I'd some nothing wrong. I note that other people report different experiences and my use of the site is mostly limited to the Marked for Death quest that I write, so take my words with a grain of salt. Also, one of the directors, EmpressSquishette, is a complete jackass who will go out of their way to cause conflict wherever they show up, but you're not likely to interact with them too often. Overall, despite the issues, I think the mods add positive value.
- You have a signature on all your posts, so word-of-mouth happens naturally if you interact with the site outside your own story.
- There are no statistics aside from total views on your thread plus total replies

You could try publishing on multiple sites at once to get more traffic, but the idea has never appealed to me. Keeping everything in sync between the various sites seems like a drag -- if I fix a typo or make a minor retcon (which you will!), I don't want to have to repost it in five different places. I find it annoying enough to keep Marked for Death in sync between the main thread and the Story Only thread.

Up to you; choice of site will not make or break the story. Only not writing will do that. :P
