My biggest suggestion for you is to not worry too much about the worldbuilding. It's your first novel; it's going to have problems...but, based on what I see here , it's also going to have strengths.

Worldbuilding is fun, but it's a trap. It's all too easy to keep building forever and never actually start the story, because there's always one more thing that "absolutely must" get nailed down before you can start. Forget all that! You can revise later if you want to.

Advice #1: Put your butt in the chair, hands on the keyboard, and write the opening paragraph, right now.

Advice #2: Pick a day of the week and commit to always publishing a chapter on that day, no matter what. There will be weeks where you don't have energy for a full chapter, so you can write a short little fluff bit or omake or post some outtakes. Regardless, every single week you need to post something and link it here on /r/r.

Now hurry up! I'm anxious to start reading this thing!
