A large percentage of people don't and that's true as a general observation. In this instance someone wanted a book recommendation to look more into the ideas of a book they liked. Nothing about this goal specifically warrants a reminder that many people do useless things. Is your influence upon them to stop reading about the ideas in depth sufficiently more likely to help them (than annoy them, because people meddling in your goals is annoying and should require a certain threshold to do so) that intervention is worthwhile?
