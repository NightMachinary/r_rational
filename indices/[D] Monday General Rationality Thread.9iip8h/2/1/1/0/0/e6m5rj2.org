Why would this be your concern. It's condescending because you assume that other people don't know what is useful to them (of which interest is a great indicator, at least much better than a stranger applying generalities).

It doesn't even make sense. First you say "maybe some people have a lot of free time/have not found anything they are interested in" then you are worried that the interests they do have does not yield enough low hanging fruits to be worth their time.
