This isn't a book recommendation, but the first two videos on [[https://www.youtube.com/user/CGPGrey/search?query=rules+for+rulers][this list]] seems related. If you're not interested in the whole thing, the short summary (of the first video) is: The difference between nice democratic societies and terrible dictatorships seems to be that the second profits from something like a single valuable resource, while the first profits from productivity. (They note many other differences, but that's the only /determining/ factor I recall.)
