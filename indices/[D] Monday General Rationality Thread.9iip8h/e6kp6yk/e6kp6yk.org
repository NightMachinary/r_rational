Got around to reading 'The Dictator's Handbook', found it pretty engaging - especially as I'd just read 'The Prince'.

Any book recommendations (academic or otherwise) that follow on from the ideas presented in the handbook? Like how to structure a political system that assumes each agent is not altruistic (so any altruism that appears is a delightful bonus)?
