> Any book recommendations (academic or otherwise) that follow on from the ideas presented in the handbook?

You can read their research oriented work. But why? That doesn't make much sense to me, did you not get the message, why search for more of the same?

Just be happy you liked it and move on, find a way to apply that if you can but that's it.

Maybe some people just have too much free time and / or have not found enough things they are interested in.

> Like how to structure a political system that assumes each agent is not altruistic (so any altruism that appears is a delightful bonus)?

​

I'm fairly sure the author says democracy is the best option a few times in the book. Because the leaders need to do things that benefit the largest number of individuals in order to stay in power. Unlike autocracy and other political systems with a low number of representatives (is that the specific word he uses? I don't remember).

​

Political systems while very interesting are not really applicable nowadays, you can't really apply any of it in a meaningful way in a relative short period of time, something similar and that can actually be applied / useful are business systems.

Businesses are the place where ambitious men have their fun in nowadays, the times when you could conquer lands and do all that cool stuff are gone. But hey at least we have something similar =D

So if you are looking for something to get into / read a few books about, maybe give business a chance, even if some people hate on it and call it greedy and stuff. It's fun, interesting, rewarding, competitive and if you are smart it also pays well.

Don't let other people's views keep you from finding your life's purpose.

Even if you have no interest in ever working on it, you can learn about it so you can get a better understanding of the world you live in. =)

PS. Sorry if I seemed rude at all, that isn't my intention. It's just late, and I'm too tired to try to make it better.
