My point never was that it's not possible.. It seems you missed this part of my reply:

  Anyway I don't think anybody should feel angry or offended just by reading about a different opinion. *I don't have infinite time to be making my comments offense proof, specially when some people will be offended for no reason and with no provocation at that.*

  If seeing a simple comment with my opinion offends or angers you, block me. It'll be better for both of us, that way you don't get angry and I don't get pointless aggressive replies to my comments..

Could it be that maybe my priorities differ from yours ? Or that you value somethings more than I ?

I've read that book already, thank you for the recommendation anyway.
