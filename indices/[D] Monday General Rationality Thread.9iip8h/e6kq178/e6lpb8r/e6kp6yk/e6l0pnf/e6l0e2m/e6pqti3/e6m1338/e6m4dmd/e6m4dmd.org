That is reasonable, my only issue with it is that you get diminishing returns from it.

Unless it's something you are going to actually use in a competitive way, spending the extra X time (X being as much if not more time than it took to get 90% of the knowledge) to get a get your knowledge from 90% to 95% is imho unnecessary.

In general the amount of time it takes to get from 90% to 95% percent or from 95% to 100% in anything is many times the same or larger than it was to go from 0 to 90-95%.

So unless you want to compete at a top level on that subject the roi is relatively low and in general not really worth it.

IMO in most cases it'd be better to find other interesting things, but it's fine if you disagree.
