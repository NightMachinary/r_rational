  It's possible to say things tactfully, for starters.

If you need me to write a dissertation in favor of the position that one can say things tactfully, then I'm sorry, but I've got better things to do.

Most of the people on this subreddit are able to reliably talk with the other members of this subreddit and even criticize them without causing offense. If you can't do that, then maybe you should spend less time studying PUAs and more time learning how to handle people in a more positive fashion. /How to Win Friends and Influence People/ was brought up in a previous conversation that you were involved in, and I genuinely think that it might help you out if you were to study it.
