Nice ad hominem.

What interests me the most is that you didn't post any counter arguments or make any points to try to change my perspective, all you did was criticize what I said. When I politely reply you go and criticize my reply and offend me. Aren't we supposed to at least try to be rational here?

Anyway I don't think anybody should feel angry or offended just by reading about a different opinion. I don't have infinite time to be making my comments offense proof, specially when some people will be offended for no reason and with no provocation at that.

If seeing a simple comment with my opinion offends or angers you, block me. It'll be better for both of us, that way you don't get angry and I don't get pointless aggressive replies to my comments..
