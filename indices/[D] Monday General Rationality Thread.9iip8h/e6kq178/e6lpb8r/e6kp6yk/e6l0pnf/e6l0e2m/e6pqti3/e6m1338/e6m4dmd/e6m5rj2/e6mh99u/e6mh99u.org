  It's condescending because you assume that other people don't know what is useful to them (of which interest is a great indicator, at least much better than a stranger applying generalities).

I think that's a perfectly rational assumption, a large percentage of people don't. That's why we have drug abuse, obesity and many other problems.

So imo my concern is perfectly reasonable.
