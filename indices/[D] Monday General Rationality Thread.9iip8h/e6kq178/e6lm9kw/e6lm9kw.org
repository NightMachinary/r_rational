  Would they have emotions like we do?
#+end_quote

This depends on where they come from, and how they got there. If you start with a human mind and enhance it, then it will have emotions, or at least it will /remember/ emotions, it will have a personality to build itself around.

If you have some sort of entirely artificial mind, a computer made sentient - then it will have that which it is given. So far, we only know how to give computers logic, not emotion or intelligence, and we don't even have a great idea (from a how-to-construct-one viewpoint) of what intelligence /is/.

  Will communication be possible among all posthumans?
#+end_quote

Communication is currently not completely possible among /humans/. At best, we can make a guess at it, trying to think of what the other person might be thinking in terms of what we can think. But on the inside, [[http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Galton/imagery.htm][human minds are so very very different]] that it's pretty amazing [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Aphantasia/][that we manage to communicate at all]] sometimes.

  Would they compete over resources?
#+end_quote

Yes, probably. Though the nature of those resources might be strange to us - in the same way as the nature of their competing might be strange to us. (Perhaps they will play multidimensional chess for a stake of CPU power, or of memories?)

#+begin_quote
  Will there be more than a few posthumans?
#+end_quote

I'd imagine that there would have to be quite a few, simply because the alternative just feels lonely. But that's an anthropomorphisation - I can't expect an AI to feel the way I would.

This depends a lot on the personalities of the posthumans. If they want to be many, they will be.
