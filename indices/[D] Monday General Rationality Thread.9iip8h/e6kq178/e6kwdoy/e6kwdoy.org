One thing I wonder about is the stability of minds. Mind-space is huge, but if stable minds are separated by regions of instability, it might be hard to go from human to post-human after all.

To the extent that emotions are integral to a stable human mind, they'll be preserved. I severely doubt emotions familiar to us are essential to minds in general, however useful they are to minds nearby in mindspace.

I think posthumans are quite likely to have emotions familiar to humans. Minds in general, not at all. It's sort of like how I think posthumans will have neurons (or a simulated equivalent), or posthumans will have neurochemistry. If you kept going long enough, you might get far enough away in mindspace that those things aren't necessary. Emotions as we recognize them fall into the same category.

To elaborate, I think emotions are a somewhat accidental part of our cognition. Essential (for us), and indeed good for their own sake from our perspective, but not inherent to minds.

Competing over resources, however--that is something anything with goals does. With a mind or not. Bacteria do that. It's the same thing with self-preservation. If you are trying to do things, you need to preserve yourself to keep trying.

I'd contend that mindspace contains many minds without either of those, though. It's just that minds too incoherent to reason effectively don't come to conclusions, do they? So only stable minds that reason and have goals will come to the conclusion that self-preservation and resource-control are important. And of course its possible to have minds that are terrible at self-reflection and reason, and still value those goals.

Humans aren't that very reflective, I think. We don't self-preserve from deliberate reason, but are constrained by evolution to self-preserve. We didn't choose to crave power, but craving power is one of our aspects. Indeed, the fact that humans sometimes discard those goals shows how [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cSXZpvqpa9vbGGLtG/thou-art-godshatter][shattered]] we really are.

As long as we're talking about it... what are the dimensions of mindspace anyway? It's not like there are little dials labelled 'self preservation' or 'crave resources' that can be turned up or down. Hmm.
