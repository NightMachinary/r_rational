Nathan, Lilly, and Iliya scored a total of 21.5 NPs, not counting the 5 NP bonus for first-time encounter of Species C. That's 64.5 total NPs, which does look quite lucrative. The problem here is that the ambush /was/ successful, and they still lost Alexander, along with his 90 or so NPs.

Alexander was a capable combatant, easy to get along with, and contributed as much as most other players toward the survival of his peers. His loss is a huge net detriment to his side, even aside from the net 30 or so NP loss.

The only way PvP is viable in the Arena is to eliminate hostiles who would otherwise be hunting and killing your species. If they are - and the numbers and location of the encounter suggest this - then attacking becomes a horrifically risky necessity.
