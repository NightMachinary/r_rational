In chapter 20, frogmen killed Alexander during the ambush. Now, we know the encounter's reward:

- 5 NP award for first encounter (notably not requiring violence).

- 9-12 NP award for each kill. The message says defeat, but a route isn't a defeat for the purpose of awarding NPs (much like a rock isn't a weapon).

Nathan, Lilly, and Iliya all made out like bandits for NPs, but any of them would agree that it was not worth Alexander's life.

That said, two of the frogmen were actively camouflaged outside of the encounter period, and were patrolling close to the human starting area. The camouflage worked on their weapons and dropped as soon as they attacked. I'm calling this out as an elemental skill right now - one that can be unlocked.

The NP rewards were odd: 9, 13, 12, 11, 11. Nathan has earned a total of around 125 NPs in the Arena, and Tygerion is a modern human who uses our system for math. It looks like these rewards are 10% of the NPs collected for each player. If this is the case, though, why do the rewards vary so much? The answer is that these players have already killed lone humans and scored NP rewards. The frogmen were hunting for more when ambushed.

Hunting frogmen for NPs is a loss. Killing them in proactive self defense is easier to justify. Nathan may not have started out to do this, but that's the road they're on now.
