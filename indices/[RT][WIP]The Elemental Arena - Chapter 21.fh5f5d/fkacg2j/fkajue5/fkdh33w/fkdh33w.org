I wouldn't be shocked at all if the frogs have a caste system in their culture that is clashing with the game's egalitarian handing out of NPs. Maybe some dissension between rogue frogs and tank frogs.

Alternately, in the other direction, they may have better social tech than our side is working with, maybe even such advanced concepts as 'a freaking leader'. We'd be in trouble then.
