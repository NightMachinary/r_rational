That's a rather weak steelman for getting a degree.

Regular overtime in a high-stress job seems like a good recipe for overwork, which has all kinds of nasty effects up to and including death.

Overtime also has a high opportunity cost. You are comparing $400 from 8-12 hours overtime a month, to a raise of $300 a month. You're overlooking the 8-12 hours of not-work that are also on the table! She is currently selling her time for about $270/shift. If that's how much she values it, then the degree gets her $300 cash /plus/ $270 worth of time every month, compared to the overtime plan that only gets $400 cash. Equivalently, when comparing those two plans, she's only getting paid an extra $100 for the extra shift. Is she willing to be a nurse for minimum wage?

On a completely different note, we're going to have a new US President before she completes the degree. The four current front-runners known to be running for the Democratic candidacy (Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Martin O'Malley, and Jim Webb) have all made university tuition rates a part of their platform and claim to plan to reduce them. If you had to commit to one plan or the other right now, and you think there's a non-negligible chance of them achieving their stated goals, you should expect to pay less than the current $14k quote over the course of their presidency.

Analysis is hard.
