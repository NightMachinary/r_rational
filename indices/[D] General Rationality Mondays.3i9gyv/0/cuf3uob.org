Some useful rationality exercises I've used recently:

1. Avoiding impulse buys
2. Become calmer and less prone to reactions based on negative emotions.
3. Admit your own bias and steelman your opponent's arguments.
4. Use math, not emotional response, to determine if something is a good life choice.

For #1:

"If someone offered me $1 to /not/ buy this $1 Snickers bar, would I take it? Yes? Okay, I won't buy it." (NB: There are times that I find myself answering 'no', in which case I feel good about buying the thing.)

--------------

For #2:

Read / watch / listen / bring to mind the thing that makes you angry. Focus on your breathing and remember that you have feet.

Anger is a mental thing and it tends to draw your awareness up into your head and away from your body. It also makes you clench your muscles and makes your breathing shallower. Focus on relaxing, breathing deeply and slowly, and be aware of your feet.

--------------

For #3:

When someone is making a weak argument that you disagree with, try to strengthen their position. Look for stronger arguments than the ones they are making. Try to think how /you/ would argue for their position. Facing these better arguments will help you differentiate between a bad idea and a good-but-poorly-argued idea.

See below for an example.

Example of #4:

I had a wall'o'text here; let me boil it down:

My SO is a nurse (RN). She's been thinking about going back for her BSN in order to get the attached $1.75/hour raise. She's been really nervous and stressed about this whole process, so we sat down and crunched some numbers.

- The education would cost about $27,000. (90 credits at $300 each.) Her employer will pay half, so she's on the hook for ~$14k if she does this degree.
- 60 of those credits ($18,000 worth) are not relevant to the BSN -- either undergraduate nursing things she doesn't need because she's, you know, /a nurse/, or general liberal arts.
- While working a fulltime job she feels she could take 12-15 credits per year (6-8 credits/semester), so it would take her about 8 years to graduate.
- Once she had the degree it would take about 5 years to pay for itself.
- Each week of each semester she would need to do 12-16 hours of work outside of class -- 2-3 hours of outside work per credit hour. There would also be some in-class time, obviously
- She works 12 hour shifts, so this basically means she's doing the equivalent of /more than/ an extra shift each week.
- She gets paid overtime to do extra shifts.
- If she does the degree, then 8 years from now she'll be at -$14k.
- If she works one extra shift per month, then 8 years from now she'll be at +$38k.
- Over her expected career duration, she will end up well more than $100,000 ahead by doing the overtime instead of the degree.

I was very upfront about the fact that I thought she should just do the overtime, but because I was admitting bias I tried to steelman the advantages of the degree. What I came up with was: personal sense of accomplishment, good networking possibilities, potential reputational benefits among colleagues and the general field. Neither of us thought those were good enough reasons to spend $13k and work a part-time job for a decade, so she decided not to enroll.

Note: After the fact, she realized that the BSN is a requirement to get into a non-bedside (i.e., management) job. She doesn't want to be working the bedside when she's 60 -- nursing is hard, physical work, especially on an ICU -- but she also doesn't want to leave the bedside in the near future, as she likes the "3-4 long days per week" schedule over management's "5 short days per week."
