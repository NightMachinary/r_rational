  Analysis is hard.

Very true. There's a few other factors though -- she's probably got 15-20 years left in her career, and getting the degree would mean she was taking a loss for about 13 of them.

As to overwork...she actually does less work if she does the overtime option. The degree requires 15-20 hours per week (12-16 hours of out-of-class work, plus several more hours in class means 15-20 hours all up.) That's 60-80 hours a month unpaid work for the next 8 years before she gets the raise. Alternatively, she can work one extra 12-hour shift per month and make more than she would have made from the raise. Even if she does one extra shift per month for the next 20 years she will end up doing less work than she would have done for the degree:

- Overtime: 12 months * 20 years = 240 months * 12 hours/ month = 2,880 hours
- Degree: 32 weeks/school year * 8 school years * 15 hours/week = 3,840 hours

Even if the degree were free, it would be hard to justify it purely for the money. The primary utility is as an entry requirement for management.
