It is not particular about rationality, but it is rational - to consider modern science and neuroscience.

Recently i began listen brainsciencepodcast and found mindfulness and brain plasticity fascinating. The imaging (fmri) is evidence that brain can change itself by means of meditation!

But connection between 'embodied cognition' and 'feeling of knowing' if disturbing.

The idea of embodiment is that there is a lot of things in a brain that computating our body or perception of reality through body. So human mind is not in the brain, but in the brain-in-body. One of the follow up of this is idea that our brain evolved to understand through action and for action. So when Harry Potter-Evans-Verres reasons about how Voldemort can be smart and Order of the Phoenix members be alive, it looks different for those who actually have done subjective bayesian inferences and for who is not. Those who did not done subjective bayesian reasoning will not understand this type of reason unless they actually spend some time doing this. We can't make clever argument to make them understand. No easy-quick way.

'Feeling of knowing' is discussed in ep 42 and 43. Long story short. When we think that we know something ( like "Ah that was all about") it dopamine reward. It is experienced not as feeling of knowing, but as knowing that you is right. It give confidence.

People certain that they know what is right. And it cannot be changed unless they do some work. How to communicate? It is getting pretty lonely here.
