I'm trying to figure out why there seems to be a subjective difference, but no objectively useful difference, between these two models of reality:

- At every moment, every quantum event makes the universe split into multiple near-identical copies of itself. In 75% of the futures springing from this moment, you're alive in five years.
- There are a Large Number of universes, most of which are nearly identical to each other for a significant portion of their history. Out of all the universes which have produced a mind which has experienced the sensory input yours has, in 75% of them said mind will still be alive five years afterwards.

Any ideas why they /feel/ so different from each other?
