I think it's a matter of definition. Consider geometry. I have a green rectangle. Partway across it, it splits into two rectangles: The top one turns yellow and the bottom one turns red. Now look at the same situation from a calculus perspective. I have an infinite number of green lines stacked on top of each other. Partway across them, half of them turn yellow and half of them turn red.

Do you consider a universe to be a rectangle or a line? One way, you're saying that quantum amplitude is a part of the universe, and the other way, you're saying that it's a part of the multiverse. They might feel different because you're changing how "universes" behave, even if the overall structure is the same.
