Since it's an election, you can straight-up gamble on it (in the UK at least) through various gambling firms.

Given the odds offered, these gambling firms effectively say that Trump has:

- 15-30% chance to win the Republican Primary
- Non-contingently, between a 5 and 10% chance of him winning the whole thing.

depending on which firm you're betting with.

An example of such a site: [[http://www.betvictor.com/sports/en/politics][betvictor]] individually gives Trump 4-to-1 odds of being the nominee 12-to-1 odds of winning the whole thing, a 20% and 7.7% chance respectively.

In general, since so much money flows through these sites, you can expect them to be generally accurate about these things.
