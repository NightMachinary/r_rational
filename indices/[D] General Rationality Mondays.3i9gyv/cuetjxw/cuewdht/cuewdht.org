I'm not a financial planner. I'm an engineer and I spent some time thinking about how to spend as little time possible thinking about investing while still getting it done. Here's my knowledge, with no promises. Anyone who's in the business is probably better than I am. My steps to investment:

*0. Invest instead of not investing*

Even accounting for the crash today, I'm still up like 10% from two years ago in my stocks. If I waited a couple years to invest, I'd be 10% poorer. This is taking a low-risk "don't beat the market" strategy. Generally, the first step is deciding to do something, rather than nothing, with your cash.

Also, I am assuming you are in your 20s, in the United States, and gainfully employed, and have cash to spare, and will continue to make money at a rate that you can deposit into investments, and won't withdraw that money until you retire in your 60s.

*1. Setting up Accounts*

You should go to a bank and open two accounts for investment. I use Charles Schwab, which also does Checking. It's possible your bank already offers this service for you, you'll need to look into it.

One account is a Brokerage Account, which is a special kind of bank account designed to hold both cash and other things like stocks and bonds that you use for investments. The other is an Investment Retirement Account, which is like a Brokerage Account but is also tax-free and has a limit in how much you can put into it each year, and also you can't take the money out until you retire. There are two kinds of IRA. One, the Traditional IRA, lets you not count the money deposited in it towards your income this year, though you pay tax when you withdraw it in old age (when your rates are lower). So if you make 105k, and deposit 5k into your IRA, the government treats you as having earned only 100k that year. So you pay probably like 2k less in taxes. Instant 40% return! The other kind is ROTH IRA. You pay tax on money put into a ROTH IRA, but once you do that money doesn't exist as far as the government acts. They do not tax you on the gains made by investments in a ROTH IRA, and do not tax you when you withdraw money from it. Generally, if you make under 100k you go for a ROTH IRA, and if you make over 100k you go for a Traditional IRA for reasons to do with eligibility and your tax rate now relative to when you withdraw the money.

*2. Transfer Cash and make plans to deposit*

Move money into your brokerage account. Bear in mind that money in your brokerage account will not be accessible quickly because it won't be in cash form, so make sure to have plenty of money still in your checking account. Brokerage account is for storing money you won't touch until much later. You can still withdraw your money from this account, but you'll often have to sell things to do so, so plan not to use the money. Deposit money every 6 months. Every 3 months is better. Every month is best to average out market fluctuations. I save 15% of my income and put it into savings.

*3. Don't be a day trader. Also, avoid wacky things like individual stocks or mutual funds*

There are many tools for investment but typically, we'll talk about Bonds and Equities (Stocks). Bonds are very tiny loans or pieces of loans from big, safe organizations that bear interest and get repaid. Stocks/Equities are very tiny pieces of public companies that reflect the value or perceived value of those firms and pay dividends based on earnings. Equities are good for young people who can tolerate risk and want to grow their wealth. Bonds are good for people closer to retirement who want to focus on preserving their wealth as much as possible, even in bad conditions.

Investing in individual company stock is a Bad Idea because I Am Not A Financial Analyst. Trying to buy and sell stocks to "time" the market is a Bad Idea because I Am Not a Financial Analyst. Trying to do anything to beat the market overall is a Bad Idea, because I Am Not Smarter Than The Market. These statements might not hold for everyone, but the hold for most people and for me. I invest money, keep my portfolio balanced, and deposit money every year.

Instead of investing in stocks individually, I invest in Funds, which are collections of stocks. By investing in a Fund, I own a tiny piece of that fund which represents a portfolio of stocks. Let's talk about what stocks are in the fund and how it's managed. There are two major kinds, Mutual Funds (actively managed) and Index Funds/ETFs.

Mutual Funds are managed by experts who charge some proportion of your investment with them each year, and (often) try to beat the market. Some have other goals, like hedging against certain conditions or having a certain behavior. They cost money as a ratio of your investment. Theymight charge you a 1% ratio, which means they will take 1% of your investment with them each year as pay. Some of these funds attempt to do more than 1% better than the market. Many fail. Some succeed. I do not know how tell the good ones from the bad/lucky ones. I do not invest in Mutual Funds.

Index Funds (and the very similar Exchange Tradable Funds) track an index, a commodity, a type of investment, or a basket of assets. I use ETFs instead of Index funds due to structuring issues that allow me to get ones I want that behave in ways I want, but for many purposes, the important distinction is between Index/ETF and Mutual Funds, rather than Index Funds and ETFs. In any case, Index funds track something (like the market as a whole, or "big companies in USA") broadly and don't have big expense ratios. Good for tracking the market with low effort.

*4. Investing in ETFs and diversifying*

So since we're young and will be depositing money every year, we go for an aggressive equities-only portfolio. Since we're not financial experts, we do not invest in individual stocks, but use a fund. Since we're not able to determine which mutual funds can beat the market, we just match the market, not beat it. So we go for ETFs. Which ETFs, though? Well, to get the most out of our money and not expose ourselves to undue risk, we want to /diversify/, which means invest in a lot of different things. This can be done pretty easily.

For geographic diversity, I keep 35% of my money in overseas investments, and 65% in US investments. Most people like to keep more in the US. My US money is mixed between Large Cap (companies with a large market capitalization, or total value) and Small Cap (companies with small market capitalization, or total value) with some in Real Estate which acts unusually and is more like Small Cap than Large. My international money is in foreign markets (developed economies like the ones in Germany or England) and emerging markets (growing economies like in India or even a more developed area like Tunisia).

The specific breakdown I use is:

- SCHX (US Large Cap ETF): 35%
- SCHA (US Small CAP ETF): 20%
- SCHH (US REIT ETF): 10%
- SCHF (INTL Developed ETF): 25%
- SCHE (INTL Emerging ETF): 10%

Some research indicated dropping SCHH and SCHE and going 50/20/25/5 between SCHX/SCHA/SCHF/Cash is the best aggressive investment plan.

When I deposit money into my account, I purchase shares to bring my account back into line with these ratios. Also, each year I deposit into my IRA to pay less tax.

/Other than my 6-monthly deposit/rebalance, I do not touch my account./ This is very important. This kind of "leave everything in equities, deposit money to balance it fairly often" strategy is a good long term growth strategy, but it assumes that you know very little about investing/finance and don't plan on actively managing your account. If you want to do tricky things like buying and selling stuff based on like, watching the news or something, this is not the way to go. Your shares will go up, and then go down, and if you are the kind of person who wants to buy and sell things, a diversified portfolio like this will always have SOMETHING going down on a daily basis. Don't freak out. In the long run, the market grows. Recession years are good because your deposit goes further (since stocks are undervalued). Don't freak out and sell or buy more than you would according to the plan. That being said, if you know more than I do, disregard my advice. This is just me trying to figure out a simple way to invest that I don't screw up.

In any case, keep depositing money and balancing your portfolio.

*5. Financial Planners often don't know what they're doing*

Yeah, if you go a bank they'll have a guy there and for free he'll tell you to get into mutual funds. He'll believe himself when he says "that great fund with the 1% expense ratio will keep your money safe." The kind of person who becomes a Financial Planner is the kind of person who believes, at his core, that beating the market is possible, and beating the market by more than 1% reliably is a real thing. Of COURSE he believes that. Financial Planners are the mother of all selection bias. Listen to him when he tells you to open a brokerage account or whether an IRA or Roth IRA is better for you at your current income. Listen to him when he says it's important to invest. Listen to him when he tells you the legal limits of what you can and can't do. Otherwise, if you want good advice from someone in person, you probably need to pay for it.

And who knows? If you're smart and informed, surely it's possible. I'm not, though. I'm a guy who pays attention to his investments occasionally just to make sure nothing's wrong. I deposit my cash each year and trust that I can't really outperform the market. As I age, I will move to more fixed-income assets that are lower risk (like bonds) and then I will retire.
