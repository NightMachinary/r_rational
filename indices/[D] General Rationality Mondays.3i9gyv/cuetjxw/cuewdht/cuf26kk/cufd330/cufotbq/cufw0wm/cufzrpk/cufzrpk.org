In the case of "exact same tax rate at either end" it's still better to defer. If you have to pay $2,000 in tax on a certain money, or instead you can pay the same amount in 40 years, in the meantime you could invest the saved $2,000, grow it massively, and come out ahead. This is assuming no changes in tax rate, and you're taxed the same on both ends. Any time you can borrow money with zero interest rate (and I guess you could think of this that way) is good.

In any case, as a general rule you make somewhat more money as someone during your career then when you're retired, and in the cases when you don't, you can use a ROTH 401k (the 401k version of ROTH IRA) which is good for people at the beginning of the careers earning very little.

This kind of tricky business is best not discussed in the "simplest investment" post above though, and is also a bit out of my league.
