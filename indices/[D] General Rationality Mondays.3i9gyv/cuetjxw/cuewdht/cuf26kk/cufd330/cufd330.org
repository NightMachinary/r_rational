This is correct. I forgot about this, as my company does not offer a 401k.

*What is a 401k?*

A 401k is a tax-deferred account (like an IRA) that is offered through your employer to help you invest. Like an IRA, a 401k is a good investment vehicle for tax purposes, because deposits into it aren't taxed. This means it gives you an immediate return on any invested money equal to the amount of tax you would have paid. However, unlike an IRA, a 401k places some limits on which kinds of investments you're allowed to use. This varies from company to company.

*What is "Matching"?*

Most companies offer 401k with "matching" which is a good thing. If your company offers 401k with "matching", what this means is up to a certain limit, for each dollar you deposit into your 401k, your company will ALSO deposit a dollar into the account for you (or 50 cents for each dollar, in some cases). This limit is usually a percentage of your salary.

*Show me an example of why a 401k can be good*

So in a best-case scenario, let's say you make $105,000 and decide to put $5,000 into your 401k, and your company matches the first 5% of your gross income as deposit (so they will match up to $5,250 of your deposit). First off, you pay about $2,000 less in tax, and secondly, when you look in your account you'll see $10,000 instead of $5,000 because your company matches your input. In effect, your $5,000 deposit immediately turned into $12,000. This is really good.

*What are the weaknesses of a 401k?*

Now, some caveats.

- 401ks place restrictions on what you can invest in, and a lot of people sort of deposit into mutual funds and forget about it then pay a bunch in fees.
- your company's "matching" deposits vest over a period of time, which means that if you leave the company you don't get the matching stuff. This is a way for the company to encourage you to stay on and not change jobs.
- like an IRA, you can't really withdraw money from a 401k before you retire.

*How much should I put into my 401k?*

Overall, a good rule of thumb is "if you can afford it, invest into your 401k enough that you get as much matching money from your employer as possible. Put the rest of your investing deposit each year into your IRA and Brokerage account"

*What should I do with the money inside the 401k?*

The money inside your 401k should be treated like in your IRA or Brokerage account: invest it in low-cost index funds or ETFs that track overall market performance. Your options for what you're allowed to invest in will vary. If there are no options for low-cost index funds or ETFs, a "target date" fund might be an okay choice, but your main goal should be to find something that doesn't have a high expense ratio.

Edit: clarified language about tax deferment
