A typical vesting schedule (And by that, I mean the minimum allowed by federal law.. so... typical) looks something like like:

<2 years: 0% vested 2 years: 20% vested 3 years: 40% vested 4 years: 60% vested 5 years: 100% vested

The percentage is how much of your company's contribution (Not your contribution, the part that they contribute through matching) you get to keep if you leave. So if you leave within 2 years you get none of their contribution, if you leave after 3 you get 20%.

So if you make 100,000/year and contributed 5%, and your company matched 5% at the end of the year you would have 10,000 (5000 of that being your company's contribution) in your 401k.

If you left you would only be able to keep the percentage you were vested in of their half of that.

If you don't already have an IRA setting up a 401k through your company is still useful even without the matching, assuming their expense ratios aren't high. It's taken out of your check before taxes, so it's hard to miss it because you never see it.

If/When you leave your company you can roll your 401k into your own IRA or into your next company's 401k if they offer that (many do).
