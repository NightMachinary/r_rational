Just to add to that good advice, if you work for a company that offers matching as part of their benefits package, it's usually good to look into that, because it's quite often better than doing anything else. If you have a 50% match up to 3%, you're basically getting a 3% raise by investing 6% of your salary. Another way of thinking about it is that even if you're only holding steady on the market, you're still getting a 50% return on your investment because of the company match.
