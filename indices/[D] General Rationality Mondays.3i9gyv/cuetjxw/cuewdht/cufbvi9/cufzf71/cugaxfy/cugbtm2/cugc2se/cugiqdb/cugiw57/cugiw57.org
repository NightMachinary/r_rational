The name can be deceptive. The idea is that they use advanced hedging strategies, but not necessarily always to lower overall risk, just to double down on a certain position. There as many different hedge fund strategies as there are hedge funds. For example there are market neutral funds that go short on a market index and use that money to buy specific stocks so that, even though they're using a hedge, they're actually a much riskier investment because they are isolating the performance of those specific stocks while hedging against overall market ups and downs.
