An addendum to this:

There are several classes of investment that are only open to "sophisticated investors", meaning people with >$1,000,000. Some of these have advantages over, or at least differences from, more common investments. If you get to that level of savings, it's worth talking to someone about it.

As an example, hedge funds are designed to have lower risk than index funds; the returns are lower in years when the market does really well, but you lose less in years when it does well. Over the long haul, you are likely to end up with more money if you go into a hedge fund than into an index fund.
