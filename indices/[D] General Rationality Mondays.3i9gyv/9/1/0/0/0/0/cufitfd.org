Ah, there seems to be some misunderstanding here. The youtube link is a link to a youtube show named "Game Theory", which in this case seems to be literally a show depicting a theory about a video game, as opposed to some kind of economic thought experiment. Same phrase, different meaning. When Transfuturist says it isn't rational, he's not referring to the economic theory, he's referring to the youtube show which seems to be pretty much unrelated.
