Can anyone recommend something I should read to learn about personal finance management? My current method is just sticking money in the bank. I'm certainly not rich but due to my (excessive) instinct to never spend money I have enough stored up that I worry I'm losing money on opportunity costs.

Something for a complete beginner, please. I don't know anything about any kind of economics.
