To address the core of the critique, I'd say that 100% equities is definitely madness for anyone over 30, but for someone young and depositing constantly it's pretty normal. Equities are high risk, yes. This is also the basic problem with small cap and international equities that BSRussel doesn't like. It's entirely possible he's right; my small cap and international investments haven't performed as well as my US Large Cap.

That being said, the small cap investments aren't super unreasonable for someone young who is more focused on growth than wealth preservation and risk mitigation. That's why the large investment there.

Since I don't own a home, the 10% of my investments in real estate isn't unusual. I'm probably underexposed to real estate relative to homeowners. It's worked out fairly well for me in the past couple years but it could be a bad choice overall.

The large amount of my portfolio that's in international markets is an expression of "bearishness" on the US economy, which is my way of saying I have a certain expectations things may go south in the US relative to what others think. You actually already get some international exposure through US Large Cap also.

For the most part, BSRussell notices that I'm investing very aggressively in higher-risk equities and doesn't like it. It's possible he forgot the "in your 20s" caveat for the "don't be in all equities thing", so if I were to put together a portfolio that he wouldn't complain about at all, it would be:

- 50% US Large Cap
- 20% US Small Cap
- 25% International
- 5% Cash

This allocation is more bullish (optimistic) on the US economy, less risky, and includes no real estate.

If you want independent sources to read, here's what I read as my own research, which you can use to know as much as I do:

- [[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002M2ASZG][The ETF Trend Following Playbook]] by Tom Lydon

- [[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GWSXX26][Stocks for the Long Run]] by Jeremy Siegel

- [[http://www.amazon.com/All-About-Asset-Allocation-Second/dp/0071700781/][All About Asset Allocation]] by Richard Ferri

The first one talks about ETFs, and despite the name is a general introduction to ETFs rather than being explicitly about trends. The second one talks about stocks (of which our ETFS are made up) and what they do in the long run, which is: reliably go up, and why they beat out other investment vehicles in doing so. The third one provides advice about how to diversify your portfolio and prevent risk.

If you read those three books, you'll be informed enough to start making your own decisions-- at least as informed as I am. I had some amount of background knowledge just from listening to my father discuss his investments, but I'm pretty sure if you read all three you'll know what you need to know.
