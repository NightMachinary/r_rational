That's neither true nor really the point of hedge funds. Yes that throwaway is incorrect, but hedge funds often outperform. From 1983-2013 they performed more or less neck and neck with the S&P with lower volatility.

Regardless, hedge funds are an /incredibly/ broad category. There's a stereotype that they're there to promise massive returns, but in reality most of them exist to offer access to alternative investments that add additional diversity to large portfolios. Some hedge funds are generic "beat the market" instruments, but most have a very specific objective (aka add exposure to the energy sector with no additional systematic risk, maintain a -.6 correlation to the S&P500 etc).
