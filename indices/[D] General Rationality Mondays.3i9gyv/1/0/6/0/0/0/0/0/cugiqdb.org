I was under the impression, based on the name and a very short description I read once, that hedge funds are more about risk mitigation than beating the market. They try to "hedge" your bets, so to speak, and have a certain amount of growth whether the market goes up OR down, or whether a particular sector crashes or grows. Based on my very tiny knowledge of investment it seems like this sort of strategy in general would perform worse than the market in good years but much better in bad years. So: if it underperforms a good market, a hedge fund is working as intended.
