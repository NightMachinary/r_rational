The biggest problem with hedge funds is the massive fees. With a guaranteed -2% return before anything else, it's almost impossible to win. You might as well toss your money onto a Vegas blackjack table (provably uncorrelated with any stock market and the house edge is much smaller than a typical hedge fund fee).

When you look at the numbers and factor in the fees, survivorship bias, and the fact that hedge funds tend to experience losses when they're at their peak of managed assets, and most hedge fund investors have been fleeced.
