Investing every 6 months is not optimal. You should do it every month or ideally every 2 weeks, that way you can take advantage of "dollar cost averaging". This is a way to average out your investment across the little ups and downs that occur daily with the value of your chosen investment. If you only dump money over every 6 months, it might be an "up" day or week where the investment is priced higher.

If you buy every two weeks, you get more shares when the price is low and less shares when the price is high...which averages out your "input" into the fund.
