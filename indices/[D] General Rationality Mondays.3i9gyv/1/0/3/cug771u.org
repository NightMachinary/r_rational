A great guide for the most part, but not accurate in characterizing mutual funds. The pros and cons of mutual funds and ETFs come down to trade flexibility (ETFs can trade mid day, mutual funds can not) and tax treatment. Mutual funds are /not/ wacky. If anything ETFs are newer and more "exotic." Both mutual funds and ETFs can have a wide variety of goals, from outperforming a commodity index to capital preservation. There are mutual funds that track an index just like an index fund does. Characterizing them as all aspiring to beat the market is innacurate.

EDIT: I should also ask, if you're not a financial planner why are you building your own asset allocation? Your portfolio is /extremely/ high risk at the moment.
