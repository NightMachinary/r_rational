Because taxation piles on over the years, just like compound interest.

Scenario: 40% income tax, 20% capital gains tax.

Taxable account: You make $100. After income tax that's $60. Invest that at 10% a year, you're at $66, but those gains are taxed at 20%, so you actually end up at $64.8.

Tax deferred account: Make $100, pay no tax, grows at 10%, at the end of the year you're at $110. After you pay income tax at withdrawal, $66.

The difference seems small but, like compound interest, the tax drag becomes HUGE when it's taken in to account year after year. Extrapolate the above example over 10 years and the tax deferred account is at 155.62 while the taxable is at 129.54, a 16% difference.
