Let's assume I switch companies every three years. Does that mean each company would have a separate 401k plan? Also may you clarify what you mean when you say that if I leave the company I cannot get the matching? Lastly, if I Dont Get the matching (assuming switch companies every three years), should I invest in 401k at all? Sorry for the much questions
