If you stay for three years, you will typically get the matching funds from the company. Vesting rates very from company to company but for graded vesting 25% is pretty normal-- so after 3 years if you left the firm you'd keep 75% of the matching funds.

In addition to what BSRussell says, it's also possible to roll an orphaned 401k into an IRA, which will give you more options but I think has a different set of restrictions for how/when you can borrow money from it or take money out.

Generally, even if you plan to switch companies every three years, it's probably a good idea to invest into your 401k enough money to get the matching contributions.
