This is a lovely excuse for Godwinning: I think Trump is the next Hitler.

Not necessarily in the "genocide" sense, but in the sense of a far-right leader who appeals to a chauvinist populist barely-under current during times of economic crisis via a kind of extreme personal anti-charisma that's so hateable it cycles back around to being charismatic. This man is basically an embodiment of all the reasons that Politics Is Spiders: he doesn't put forward a coherent policy program that makes people mad, he puts forward /mostly incoherent nonsense/ that nonetheless makes lots of people believe he's somehow fighting for their interests, and he's extra willing to dog-whistle to groups who would not normally talk about themselves in public, eg: [[http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated][fascists]].

I actually completely agree with Adams that Trump has a good chance of winning the nomination, if not the Presidency. Let's call it a 30% chance?
