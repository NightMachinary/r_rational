Scott Adams (of /Dilbert/ fame) has been talking a lot recently on [[http://blog.dilbert.com/][his blog]] about how Donald Trump is using hypnosis/persuasion tactics to munchkin his way into a non-zero chance of obtaining the U.S. presidency (examples: [[http://blog.dilbert.com/post/126916006856/wizard-wars][1]] [[http://blog.dilbert.com/post/127079241801/political-reporters-cover-a-business-candidate][2]] [[http://blog.dilbert.com/post/127479255236/trump-vs-bush-persuasion-wars][3]])--maybe that counts? I can't tell whether or not he's being serious, though, as it's all very tongue-in-cheek.

Some funny quotes:

  If you apply a political filter to his [immigration] proposal, it is pure nonsense mixed with evil and flavored with crazy. That's how the media is reporting it all over the Internet. Just like Trump planned.

  I hear you in the comments that you are tired of my Trump posts. But if he keeps delivering a master class in influence, you will hear a lot more about his methods. I'm not terribly interested in politics, but this is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to see influence as an art form from a master operator who doesn't feel the need to cover his tracks.

  Someone accused me of having a man-crush on Trump because I keep writing about him. I plead guilty. I have no idea whether he would be a good President or not, and I don't believe you know either. My man-crush is based on Trump's persuasion skills. I have never seen better.
