The Patreon readers made a very interesting prediction about the Tier 3 skill that maxing Mana Manipulation will unlock in Offensive Auras. If you carefully examine the skill progression in the skill tree, you will see 2 to 3 path progressions as shown:

|                   | Tier 0      | Tier 1   | Tier 2      | Tier 3         | Tier 4 |
|-------------------+-------------+----------+-------------+----------------+--------|
| Skill Path #1     | Immolate    | Radiance | Fulmination |                | ?      |
| Skill Path #2     | Refrigerate | Shroud   | Corrosion   |                | ?      |
| Pseudo Skill Path |             | Shear    |             | Discombobulate | ?      |

So the prediction is that Shear+Discombobulate+Mana Manipulation will unlock another Tier 3 Offensive Aura. Possibly an aura that attacks and unravel the mana of spells?
