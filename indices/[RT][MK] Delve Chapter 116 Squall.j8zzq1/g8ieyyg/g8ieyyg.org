I'm surprised nobody in that world has seen the power of supports, refreshing my memory with those list of potential skills, a support class would add so much to a party. Damage reduction, healing for health, mana, and stamina, ridiculous health, mana, and stamina regen, damage reduction for all kinds, buffs to every stat, speed and accuracy boosts, detection, oppressive AoE damage against hordes of mobs, it's really insane.

I'm really curious what Rain would look like in his endgame, skills get more ridiculous with the higher requirements later on, and we've seen how incredible super high level monsters like Val's dad and the plats are. The potential skills he has available right now are already insane, just how crazy are the skills once he unlocks Legendary Dynamo and moves into T4 skills and higher? I've had this inkling that Rain is eventually going to become pretty powerful even DPS-wise, I've been thinking about Aura Compression ever since it was revealed, it has so much potential to be munchkinned. Rain can compress it to 1m and get some really good results, but doesn't that seem to defeat the point of offensive auras of suppressing masses of enemies from a safe distance? At this point all it's good for us maximizing buffs for Rain. I think it's extremely likely there's going to be a hidden skill revealed later on that can change the origin point where the aura compresses into. He could compress all that damage into a single point and deal massive damage to a single enemy within his range, or focus a buff onto a single ally with massive bonuses. Nothing important, but that has just been a possibility that has been nagging at me for months, there's no way a skill like that doesn't exist later on with a skill like Aura Compression available.

Looking forward to when Ascension powers up and has teams of optimized parties, although it's looking like we'll still be waiting many months. There's a lot of things that really get me curious, like what is going on with Rain's soul, and what is going to happen with Dozer and the curious bond between them? It feels like there's definitely something game-changing within one of those.
