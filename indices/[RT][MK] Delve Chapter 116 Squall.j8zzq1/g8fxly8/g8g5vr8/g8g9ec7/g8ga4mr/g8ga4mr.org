It all comes back to the fact that Delve has a great pacing for a book, but it's slow for a webnovel. The chapters are short, events take multiple chapters to work through, and the update rate is only a chapter per week.

The author is amazing at world-building and writing compelling characters, but I would much rather have a book (or just 50 chapters) released per year instead of this drip-feed of a story I can't stop myself from reading.

It was tolerable when there was a chapter every Sunday and Wednesday, but unfortunately SenescentSoul couldn't sustain that pace.
