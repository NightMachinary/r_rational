I wouldn't call the characters compelling at all. You can probably exchange 90% of the characters in the story with any other generic side character and the story wouldn't be impacted one bit. I'm only reading this because of the spreadsheet system, and the author has already far exceeded the threshold of most reader's patience thanks to this stalling.
