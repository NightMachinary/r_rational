On the topic of the empire, isn't it stated that they only have a bunch of slaves they feed super low level blues to, and they only unlock the 4 seasonal auras? I think they've only scratched the bare surface of supports with only measly seasonal aura slaves for massive armies, nothing on the level of dedicated full blown support monsters per party like what Rain is planning and doing.
