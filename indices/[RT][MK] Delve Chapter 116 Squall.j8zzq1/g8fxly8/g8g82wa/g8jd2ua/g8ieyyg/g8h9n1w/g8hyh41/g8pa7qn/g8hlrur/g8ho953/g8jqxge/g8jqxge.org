On whether or not to sign up for Patreon: it's a pretty good time to join Patreon as the current Patreon chapters cover the events of examining the lair, entering and beating the lair, what to do for the slots to awaken, dealing with the issues of actually getting the people to awaken, and destroying the lair. The latest chapter ends with them leaving the Essed Frostbarrows. You'll get an entire mini-arc to read through with minimal cliff-hangers at the end.
