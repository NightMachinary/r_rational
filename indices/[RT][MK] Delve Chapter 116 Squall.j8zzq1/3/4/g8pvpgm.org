At level 18, Rain is able to do about 5000 damage for one or two seconds, 1 meter range.

At level 25, assuming maxed out skills at rank 15, he should be able to easily do at least 94k damage per second, 1 meter range. It'll cost about 12k mana and he will have about 24k mana if he boosts his Focus to 160. About 12-13k total mana if he keeps it at base Focus. Level 25 is well named as 'The Wall.' The moment he increases his max rank to 15 and levels them, he'll see a massive damage increase. This is not taking into account any special bonuses he'll get with a legendary class. I'm only calculating the max rank change to 15.

For comparisons sake, at level 24, he'll only do about 6600 dps.

At Level 50, damage will go to about a million dps if he boosts it in the same manner as he does now. Now that I think about it, at level 26, he'll have Prismatic Intent. Instead of inefficiently boosting one aura, he might end up using his more efficient boosters to boost multiple offensive auras.
