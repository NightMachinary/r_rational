Sure, reversing the point of view is definitely valid. If the initial contact is helpful across the ring, and the time differential remains the same, the Easter Islanders might, eventually, create a highly advanced society with help from their other-dimensional help.

However, there would certainly be people who would object! At first, the villagers, later, perhaps other villages. Eventually, the rest of the world.

All sorts of conflict potential there. The ring becomes the most valuable artifact on the planet if people know what it can do. The story could even revolve around how to keep the existence of the ring a secret.

A secret society? Illuminati?

But what does the advanced technology side of the ring get? Just mental satisfaction?

Perhaps small electronic recording devices can be passed through and the Easter Islanders start recording documentary films of the alternate history?

Lots of fun for a story!
