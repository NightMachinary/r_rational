  Given the risk of having your ring fall into the Peru-Chile Trench
#+end_quote

It doesn't seem /too/ great - redundant vehicles and sufficient electrical power (note to self: get a backup power generator!) go a long way towards calming the risk. I should probably check how well drones perform above clouds first, though. Maybe rent a wind canal.

In the unlikely event that no dronery works and the ring falls into the trench, we can cut the cables on the level of the ring, dropping them into the ocean, have a balloon prepared sticking through the ring that we then blow up with air or helium depending on whether we like the current trade winds/currents, allowing falling back on a civilization of our choice. (We'll want to have it prepared because otherwise one atmosphere of water pressure per ten metres of water depth are about to start rushing through my side.) Maybe add a straw next to the balloon so we can blow air in the direction we want to get away from.

  Just because they have primitive technology, that doesn't make them stupid.

Yes, I meant that I feared that they aren't stupid, and thus I shouldn't trust them not to figure out how the ring works and shut me down. Ergo, drones.
