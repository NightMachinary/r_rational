Okay, so this ring is just a portal to a second Earth that happens to currently be in the state our Earth was in a while ago. Obviously robots that build more robots is nonsense, since if we could do that we wouldn't need that ring.

New goal: Harness the Ringearth's manpower and wealth. (Secondary: Find out the ring's nature, origin, workings, and any further "magic" that might exist.)

Assume some thousand dollars of starting capital. What do we want?

- RC vehicles: Drones, a few blimps, cars, boats, etc.
- Cameras, microphones, radio chips, a miniature beamer or two or maybe a flexible screen.

Get caveguy to assemble the stuff, using incentives like food or drugs. Leave.

Why are we using drones instead of people? I'm not sure how smart these people are. If they at some point realize how the ring works, my might ends - until I have gundrones, I'm just a voice that trades in information and small objects.

Research celestial events and tell the approximate year by observing the night sky. If it is early enough, we can emulate the European colonists and trade modern novelties for gold.

Such trading attempts would of course not be done with the ring present - that one is constantly hidden in a remote place, while single drones carry goods to trade. A default place would be "carried by a team of drones above the clouds", since the combined might of Ringearth's humanity would be hard-pressed to reach it there. (Hmm. Trained birds? I can probably fly higher than birds can breathe, in a pinch, though the winds might get harsh. China's fireworks may prove a problem.)

And so our capital grows by an order of magnitude or two. (Up to this point, I'd expect to be able to deal with a fence on our side without arousing too much suspicion.)

What's our end goal? Amusingly, I'd still say "Make sure the first AI is friendly.". One avenue would be gaining major funds and going philanthropic, another would be to start educating the Ringearth's population on FAI theory and get them working on the problem.

(This might be an interesting story to tell from the point of view of Ringearth's population: A european country is visited by the devil's fingers in this world, offering knowledge and magic for gold or willingness to learn about demonology...)
