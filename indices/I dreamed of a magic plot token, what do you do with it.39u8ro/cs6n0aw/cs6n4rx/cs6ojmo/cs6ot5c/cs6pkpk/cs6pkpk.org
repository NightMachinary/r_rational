If my research tells me the cave has been well-explored, send through an airtight box and an RC ship and get the ring on the ocean floor, or a fleet of RC vehicles and get it to some other safe place my research tells me of.

Future-me merely has to hide the ring and place some durable future-technology timer+UMTS sender with it.

How much am I allowed to do with the ring without changing the timeline to delete myself? Surely breathing is okay and apparently killing a hermit is too much.
