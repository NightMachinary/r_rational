  How much am I allowed to do with the ring without changing the timeline to delete myself?

I'm not sure that there's a good lower limit on that. As soon as a decision gets magnified to the point that it has any observable effect on any human who survives to have progeny, you're probably screwed after more than a few decades. The butterfly effect on male sperm cells will completely change the population of the planet at the rate of communication between societies. Easter Island was "discovered" in 1722, so anyone born in Europe after, say, 1800 would be different.

So the fact that you still exist means it's probably a new timeline.

  apparently killing a hermit is too much

Who said it's a hermit? The caves on Easter Island may have been a key part of their culture, by some accounts.
