There are so many ways for that plan to fail. Including the fact that the caves in Easter Island have been well explored over the past several hundred years, and even if by some miracle the ring is anywhere near there now... odds are that the person on the other end of the wormhole in 2215 or 2615 or whenever is probably not future-you and is more likely to be feeding you the equivalent of a cyanide capsule...

Plus you're kind of assuming a closed loop timeline. You just changed the past, the new timeline where the ring is still in the cave in 2015 probably doesn't have you in it. You're better off extracting what value you can from a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Peripheral][stub]] Easter Island.
