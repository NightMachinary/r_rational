I had this whole plan with cheap RC drones powered by cables leading through the ring to our power grid instead of 6-minute batteries to transport the ring over the ocean, but I just realized I don't need to. Feed him a cyanide capsule so he won't mess with the ring any more. His ring will in 200 years lie in that cave in 2015, connected to my ring in 2215.

[[http://hpmor.com/chapter/77][/Any means of obtaining information transmitted from the distant future was potentially an instant global victory condition./]]

Future-me has arranged for a strong (to penetrate rock) UMTS signal to upload some RSA-encrypted .txt to a web server 2015-me just set up for the purpose. Information obtained. For the rest of the story, read the Black Pill part of [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/06/02/and-i-show-you-how-deep-the-rabbit-hole-goes/]] . (Or substitute what you'd actually do with Black's power.)

(I'd guess the start of the decrypted .txt explains the better encryption algorithm which was applied to the rest of the file.)

(Of course, in-universe I would spend a while covering flaws and details ("how do I gurantee future-me to find the ring?" etc) in the plan before executing any irrevocable stuff. Edit: The glaring flaw in the plan is that the world would have to survive in its current form for 200 years for the loop to be completed.)
