Several hundred years ago?

If that is a very long time prior to Easter Sunday in 1722, you might be able to start working to educate the Easter Islanders with the scientific method before the Europeans arrive? Working slowly of course, passing rolled papers through, and receiving them in return.

Since you exist, you clearly aren't interfering with your own timeline, but you have a connection to that other timeline/dimension.

The first thing to do is determine the state of the people on the island. If it's early Easter Island, it's a pretty ideal place for people with plenty of trees and other resources. Trees are important. If they have already chopped down all their trees, you need to start sending them seeds and teaching them about forestry so they can maintain that resource.

If they still have trees, you need to teach them conservation and forestry so they don't run into the same problem in that timeline as they did in ours.

Educate them through the ring. Create an erudite society. Teach them what you can, and hope they are willing to learn. As they develop, you can teach them where easily accessed natural resources are located in the world, like the Comstock lode, and they will likely happily share wealth with you.

If you plan to make this a story, you need an opponent. Perhaps every now and then, someone shoots an arrow through the ring. Perhaps the ring is thrown into a fire, and you have to quickly find water to pour through the ring to put out the fire before the ring melts.
