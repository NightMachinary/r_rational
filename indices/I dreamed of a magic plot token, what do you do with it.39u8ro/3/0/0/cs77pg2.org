They don't have a whole lot of portable wealth yet. Maybe they never do. That's a plot point. Research would be needed on modern day Easter Island to see if there are valuable resources there. I suspect there aren't, or there aren't many.

Time as an opponent is going to be an extreme challenge if you are writing to entertain. Opponents that people can understand on a visceral level are almost required, unless you are a damn good writer. Stephen King manages a non-existent antagonist in "The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon" (The only reason I know this is because I am currently reading a book about plot and structure - I've never read it.) The book I am reading specifically warns against antagonists/opponents that aren't physical beings of some sort or another, and what they say made sense to me.

You could always flip the story around so that you are the primitive...

There's an alien on Easter Island that has managed to create a dimensional portal with remnants of a very advanced starship drive.

They need help, but they are trying to judge your intelligence and rationality before asking for much. The native islanders are not very helpful.

In the end, the alien sends you a picture of themselves - a very small body with a great, elongated head.

Or perhaps a small piece of a colorful scarf. (Tom Baker was the best Doctor)
