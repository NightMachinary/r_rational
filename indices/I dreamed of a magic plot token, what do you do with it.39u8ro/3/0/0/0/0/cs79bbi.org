Sure! Two people, or two thinking beings of some sort, would be fine. I still think it would be interesting for the person in the modern world to slowly come to the realization that they are the primitive as the individual on the other side slowly introduces more complex concepts. Someone made that ring, after all. It could be even more interesting, if you were to have one side of the ring be magically adept, and the other side be mechanically adept, and for them both to believe the other was ignorant.
