I don't know anything about it besides what I heard in my spanish III class, but Easter Island (Rapa Nui) is part of Chile, and it is inhabited by the Chilean descendents of Easter Island natives, and maybe some other immigrants from the main land.

This could make a good story. Maybe the person who's trapped in the cave is either from the distant past, or he's a modern chilean/easter islander archaelogist that got trapped in a cave in while studying his ancestors or something. Although then I'm not sure how the protagonist (you) even finds out he's from Rapa Nui if you can't see where he is through the ring and if you can't understand spanish or whatever native language he's speaking. If light is coming out of your side of the ring, and you can see him through it, then he should also be able to see you.
