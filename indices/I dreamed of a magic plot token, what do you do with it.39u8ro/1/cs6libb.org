Push food through, water, whatever the other person needs.

Contact government officials, have them take over.

They can start pushing a robot through and small electrical components and some electrical equipment, and train the person on the other end to assemble it with food, water, and video guides.

Once you have a robot on the other side use that robot to build other robots.

Repeat, have fun.
