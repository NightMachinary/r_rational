Just caught up with this. I fell off sometime midway through chapter 50 with all the Alter Ego plans. That in mind, take everything I say with a grain of salt because I'm probably forgetting details that are key to the plot...

As intelligent as Naegi or Monokuma are, it seems like their plans don't matter much in the face of Alter Ego. AE is able to predict with (almost?) perfect accuracy what everyone is going to do and optimize based on that info. Which puts me in an odd position: I don't really like to see the protagonist shoved aside, having their actions not matter ala [[#s][Spoiler of another story]]. On the other hand, having AE not win (via protagonist's actions) wouldn't make sense because AE has predicted capabilities and resources of people it shouldn't know much about at all. AE has pretty much already won if it knows the details of all traps and how to escape them.
