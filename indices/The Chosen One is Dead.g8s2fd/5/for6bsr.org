It's pretty old, but there's a book you might like called "Magic Kingdom for Sale: Sold".

Basically a person buys a fantasy kingdom in a catalog for a lot of money, with a money back guarantee if it isn't really magic. A wizard takes him there, it is.

Nobody respects the King, because there have been like a dozen mundane world pretenders in the last few months. There's a dragon rampaging, magical races seceding, a Demon King menacing everyone and the Chosen guy? The Paladin? Nowhere to be seen.
