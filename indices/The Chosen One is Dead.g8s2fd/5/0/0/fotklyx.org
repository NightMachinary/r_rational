I loved it, my boyfriend at the time loaned it to me to read when I went on a holiday with my parents about.... 12 years ago ( ^{god} ^{i'm} ^{old} ). I had the impression it was the first in a series and every few years when I think of it again kind of idly intend to find the rest of the series.

Was it a series or did it never get finished? All I remember is he fell in love with this naked water nymph.

Wikipedia: "Magic Kingdom for Sale--Sold! is a fantasy novel by American writer Terry Brooks, the first in his Magic Kingdom of Landover." - okay wow apparently there's 6 books published and a seventh on the way. How about that.
