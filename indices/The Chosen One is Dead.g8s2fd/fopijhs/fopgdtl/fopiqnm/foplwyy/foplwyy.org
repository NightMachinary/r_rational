*The Brightest Shadow* isn't quite that, but close. It's frankly much scarier, but saying too much about it is kind of a spoiler.

My own *How to Defeat a Demon King in Ten Easy Steps* is very close - there's a cycle of reincarnation for the Hero and the Demon King, and the protagonists are trying to defeat the Demon King before the Hero's scheduled resurrection occurs. It comes out in a few days on Audible (and it'll be free for Audible subscribers for about a week). Other formats coming later.
