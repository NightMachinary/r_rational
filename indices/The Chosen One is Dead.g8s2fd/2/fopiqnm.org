When it comes to the Chosen One tropes, there's a lot of different [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/PlayingWith/TheChosenOne][ways]] it can be played with.

The one that fits best is probably [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnchosenOne][The Unchosen One]] when people step up to take the place of the chosen hero.

My favorite one is when Hermione decided just because Harry was the hero in /Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality,/ it didn't mean that she couldn't also be a hero.

[[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/UnLunDun][Un Lun Dun]] by China Mi√©ville is another good one where the book subverts, inverts, plays with, and messes with the standard Chosen Hero chosen by prophecy in every way possible. The part that's relevant is near to the beginning where it involves the hero being injured before she can preform her first ever prophetic event, and her plucky, comedic sidekick has to step up to take over.

It happens a lot in the Mistborn trilogy where the Chosen One trope is messed around with including shenanigans by the Big Bad, but I don't remember it too well since it's been a while since I last read it.

There's also /How to Defeat a Demon King in Ten Easy Steps/ coming out on April 30th which is explicitly about this trope where the hero won't be born for another 77 years, but the Demon Lord is about to conquer the world.
