In a way, the Malloreon by David Eddings fits this.

The idea behind the Belgariad/Malloreon series is that there are these two possible realities warring with each other to come into full existence. The protagonist is the Chosen One of the "Light" reality, and, at the end of the first set of five books (the Belgariad), he slays the Chosen One of the "Dark" reality.

The next five books (the Malloreon), although still from the POV of the Light champions, are about the Dark reality trying to get ready for the final showdown between Light and Dark, without the benefit of the Dark's original champion, and resorting to all sorts of nasty tricks to level the playing field.
