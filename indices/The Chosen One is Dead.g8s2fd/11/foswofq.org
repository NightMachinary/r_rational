The Demon Lord's Lover is a sweet romance story about one guy from the Hero's team hooking up with the Demon Lord to end the cycle of heroes and demons. The demon lord and the guy are also both in their middle ages, and the guy is a mentor to the newest batch of heroes.

It's honestly really refreshing in how open and unorthodox the romance is, although it does feel rooted in the world. Basically everyone's polyamorous, and most of the main cast is polygamous, in the best possible way. The comedy's pretty well done too.
