I can't open royal road to give you links right now, but there are some stories I know that brush up on that trope.

Tree Of Aeons is about a guy that gets killed on a bus with all the chosen heroes. All the kids on the bus are reincarnated into heroes to fight the demon king. He gets reincarnated into a tree. Anyways turns out the demon king invasion is a once a decade event in the new, and heroes don't always have that long of a lifespan fighting demon kings. The story has some good rational elements.

[Arrogant young master template number 4] I can't remember this exact title. Its something like that. Anyways the MC gets reincarnated into the body of an arrogant young master in a wuxia world. Meanwhile, he has to try and find genre-bending apprentices. The story is mostly a genre parody. The MC is genre-savvy, but it doesn't really feel like rationalism.

The movie Megamind is exactly the trope you are describing. But I don't know if I'd consider it rational in any special way. It's just a feel-good comedy in the same vein as Shrek where the supposed 'monster' ends up being a good guy.
