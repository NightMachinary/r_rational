Ratchet and Clank comes to mind. He didn't die, but the guy they expected to save everyone turned out to be a fraud.

Also, I can't help but think of Megamind, but I'm not sure that counts given that the person most unsure of what to do when the hero died was the villain. He does end up with a problem of his own making that he has to solve himself though.

Spider-Man Into the Spider Verse has Spider-Man die near the beginning and Miles Morales has to take his place. Though that doesn't really count since several other Spider-Men from other universes help.
