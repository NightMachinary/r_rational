Simole and Nic going on wacky adventures could be a series of its own and I would read the shit out of it. Hands down my favorite duo.

With the revelation that dragons are, in a way, empty husks that can be inhabited, I'm wondering if they're related to how mages are made. Maybe a demon is split in half, with the primal instincts and body becoming a dragon, and the spirit fusing with a human, giving them magic?
