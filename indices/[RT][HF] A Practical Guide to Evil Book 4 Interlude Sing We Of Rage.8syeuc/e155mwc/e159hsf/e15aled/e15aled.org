Yeah, but his plan essentially boil down to "Be really really good at all forms of stabbing, then go confront Black". Which... okay, I guess that could be effective in other contexts (all your powers combined!), but essentially boils down to one trick. Compare to the ways we've seen other characters leverage their Aspects, this is pretty uncreative.

I'm mostly annoyed from an "exploitability" perspective. Like, dude, your plan is "Go find him and stab him real hard", with no additional contingencies, without leveraging any intel you might have. YOU THINK PEOPLE HAVEN'T TRIED THAT ONE BEFORE?

It's especially weak compared to the heroes who confronted Cat, who showed more creativity (baits, some switcharoos of their own) even though they have better odds to start with.
