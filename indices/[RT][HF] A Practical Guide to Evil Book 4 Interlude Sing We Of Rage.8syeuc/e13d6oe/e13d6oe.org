  His power was faint, even fainter than on their last encounter, but the taste of it had not changed. The presence of two aspects wreathed the man like two ravens on his shoulders, urging the villain to Lead and to Conquer. An old monster drenched in blood, come at his summons.

Wait a minute. How the hell does his Name still work when he's in another body? Masego noted specifically, when describing Akua's version of the same trick, that he haven't seen anything like that when studying under his father.
