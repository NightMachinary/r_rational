My impression of it is he's chaining/combo-ing the heroes from the past kind of thing? So while the past heroes might've failed individually in their own timelines, he's putting all of them together sort of way...which might have worked if Black hadn't cheated his way out. I love it actually, last chapter I thought WK had an unfair advantage of bringing the cheat sheet to an exam, this chapter Black changes the exam question after the paper's handed in ha!
