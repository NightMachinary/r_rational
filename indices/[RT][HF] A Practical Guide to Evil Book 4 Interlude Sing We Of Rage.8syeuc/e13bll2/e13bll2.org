The creepy body double is really reminiscent of Assassin in Liesse. Maybe Assassin taught Black that trick? Edit: Nvm, it's from Nefarious.

The exploding horse is amazing as always, though this one needs a bit more goblinfire.

EE has a real talent for snark, shown here:

I like how Black seems to be leaning into his story much in the same way Cat learned to. I'm excited to see Cat's lessons manifest through Black---it's already been entertaining so far.

Also, I just realized that the dragon's name is General Catastrophe, which is a pun I didn't really get til now.
