I could have sworn, just a few weeks ago, there was a definitive listing of all the chapter quotes on the PGtE website. I can't find it now, which only makes me doubt my sanity slightly.

I don't think "One sin, one grace" is ever in a chapter quote; the first speech where he says it is quoted by Hakram in Book One, Chapter 19; he gives a better one in Book 3, Chapter 59.
