Some further details, which may help narrow in on some suggestions: A Singularity-like apocalypse vanished nearly all humans, did weird things to most cities. People rebuilt, started repopulating. Long-distance comms and travel nearly non-existent (due to Plot). Before the brief state of war, the city (Erie) was essentially run by guild-like "unions", who arranged (via methods that haven't been specified) for a mayor to run things at city hall. No bill of rights, no formal constitution; due to pre-Singularity politics, "police" are generally despised, with some of their functions now taken care of by a "civil guard".
