  In the era before the Avatar, the Spirit Wilds encompassed all regions of the Avatar World, but remained largely uninhabited by humans due to hostile spirits that lurked in the wilderness. Spirits often disguised themselves as plant life to deceive human trespassers, and attacked individuals that they regarded as threats to their well-being. For instance, vine-like entities that resembled grass would lie in wait until they made contact with a group of individuals, before ensnaring and pulling the people underground. Furthermore, as humans typically only ventured into the Spirit Wilds in search of food, spirit wasps would join together atop trees resembling fruit and attack humans who attempted to eat them.
