Ah. You're in a [[http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Spirit_Wilds][Spirit Wilds]]-type setting. Also see the anime "Mushishi" for ideas. Neither of these are techno-settings, but the consequences for humanity are essentially the same.

I feel like I've read something like this before online a long time ago. The details are blurry now but it involved a protagonist who got revived from his cryo-chamber and turned into a female rabbit. The environment was hostile and I seem to remember a vending machine AI. Some agency turned to him/her for advice because his ancient-origin made him immune or something. You wouldn't happen to have written that?

Anyway - governments. I don't think any real-life humanity has ever been in this situation before. Check out Scott Alexander's Archipelago. Your world is basically an archipelago, except with techno-wilds rather than ocean.

It's essentially set of meta-rules which allows people to do as they like within small enclaves, and to easily leave one enclave for another, provided the second enclave will accept them - terms and conditions apply. I suppose it's a little more meta than what you asked for - but, from what I know of human psychology, volunteers for scouting are practically lining up to go exploring despite how dangerous it is, so ultimately you /do/ have a world where new enclaved regions are rapidly being charted out. (What was that war over, anyway?)

This doesn't help you with statecraft for a specific city state, but it's good idea-fuel for the broader world.
