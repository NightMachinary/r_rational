Depends upon the size, political history, and activities of the city-state, honestly. A small city-state can make due with a single governing body elected by consensus. A larger one will need separation of powers, checks and balances, etc.

Some areas have bad political history of despotism, which would lead towards an individual head of government being a bad idea, others have histories of bureaucratic nightmares that argue in favor of a single source of final decisions.

Honestly, any American city-state is likely to desire/demand freedoms a la Bill of Rights, but that's all we can say for sure.
