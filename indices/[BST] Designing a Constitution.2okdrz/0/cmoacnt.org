Some simple optimizations for typical democracies:

- Voting uses a preference rank and any Condorcet method for counting, because why wouldn't you.

- Line-item veto decreases pork and gets rid of the ability to hold good laws hostage (seems to be a net improvement, requires separation of powers).

- Laws should be required to have metrics by which they'll be judged, a goal defined with those metrics, and an expiration date for when they'll go away if they miss the goal.

- Budgets are particularly contentious and could be defined automatically (ie: taxes adjust to fit the budget always unless the legislature passes a "we need deficit spending this year" law manually.) Putting this into the constitution would make it harder to fiddle with.

- Political parties are inevitable so you should take advantage of them in your system.
