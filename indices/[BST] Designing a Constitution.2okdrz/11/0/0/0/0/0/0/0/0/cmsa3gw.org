  If A feels that B has broken an executive order, A can accuse B and the burden of proof is on A If A feels that B has broken an executive order, A can accuse B and the burden of proof is on A

  If B has complied with the executive order but A feels that the EO is not an appropriate instantiation of the law, then A can accuse B and the burden of proof is on A.

These two seem confusingly similar and in both examples A has the burden of proof.

I think a better example instead of your last one is: If A feels that B has broken the executive order but B thinks that despite that he actually complied with the relevant Law then B has the burden of proving that he complied with the Law despite not complying to an executive order based on it. Similar on how laws nowadays can get thrown out if they go against the constitution.
