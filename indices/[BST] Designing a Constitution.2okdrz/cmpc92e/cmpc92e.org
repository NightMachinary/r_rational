One thing you may want to consider is *not* including any rights in the constitution. One of the benefits and one of the drawbacks to a constitution is that it is hard to change. As seems to be one of the problems with the gun debate in USA at the moment, things change. What seems like a perfectly reasonable right today might not be in 100, or 1000 years.

If your rights are implied in the laws made, as is common in Common Law systems (I believe, IANAL), you can adapt those rights to changing times more easily. Of course they can also be taken advantage of more easily by a powerful government, but I think it is something to consider particularly if you come from a place like USA where the Bill of Rights is such a commonly accepted part of the constitution.
