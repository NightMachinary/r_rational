That designing transparent A.I becomes against the law automatically. And once the data within A.I. itself becomes part of the A.I.'s speech (because what would be the difference? Everything is data for an A.I.) then it could be easily argued that any data within personal accounts of biological citizen is an extension of their body just the same, making any search for evidence within them inadmissible in court regardless of warrants. Far fetched but lawyers have successfully argued weirder things.
