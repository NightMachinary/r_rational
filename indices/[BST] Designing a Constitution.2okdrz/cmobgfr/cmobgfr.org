How many large is the legislative body? In a city-state, as opposed to a larger collective with more conflicting interests, you won't need hundreds of people to form a quorum. You could probably get by with nothing but a parliament of one person per, say, ten thousand residents (I don't know how many, exactly, because I haven't read past /In -/), and set a number of tasks that they have to accomplish on an annual or bi-annual basis: establish a police force by any other name, regulate trade, that sort of thing.

Have someone leading the government, but their role would be more akin to that of secretary-general than president. They could be elected internally, or whatever.

Issues that the parliament can't determine decisively, say by a 75%-25% majority, go to a referendum. Voting is mandatory. Certain things are constitutionally prohibited (murder, slavery, holding office for longer than /N/-years, owning weapons/drugs etc. without a license or permit, people can't be barred from your establishment/services based on race, colour of fur, gender, sexuality, species, or status as 'alive').

The constitution can be modified, but I don't know how you would pull that off with such a small population.

Maybe a clause for regulating political advertising. How about having mediated television programs where every candidate makes their case?

Rather than having ridings, I (personally, so this might actually be a horrible idea) would go with a certain number of seats, with the top candidates afforded a seat in the parliament. Every citizen has a number of votes they can use relative to the number of seats, number of candidates, and so on.

There are two voting periods, one month and then later one week before the legislature has to dissolve and then reconvene. First item after the vote is revisiting the agenda (i.e. examining the judicial branch, candidates advancing their election platforms) No proxy voting.

I dunno, that's kind of a tall order. Good luck.
