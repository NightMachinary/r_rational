Before the war: ensuring that the poor people in the city didn't get it into their heads to form mobs to storm the rich peoples' homes and take all their stuff. And to keep the economy going so the rich people stayed rich.

Mad Queen Bunny's purpose, post-war: To keep that group of people who happen to live in the city from committing any further acts of war against her; such as by having some body of people to negotiate with about where to set borders between where Bunny's people get to do stuff and where the city-people get to do stuff, and by arranging matters so that the city-people face incentives which encourage them to do things other than commit acts of war.

At least in-story, this probably already exists in the form of the peace treaty which Bunny arranged for the city's major political figures to sign.
