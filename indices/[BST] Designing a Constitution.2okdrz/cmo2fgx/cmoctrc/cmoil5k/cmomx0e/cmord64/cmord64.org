Thanks for that. I think I can grasp his value-system abstractly, but they do seem to be based on a number of assumptions that are hard to justify. Even if we can, as he claims, dismiss the hardship of lives lived at near-subsistence levels, it's pretty pessimistic or unimaginative to believe that such a future is the only/best one probable to occur.
