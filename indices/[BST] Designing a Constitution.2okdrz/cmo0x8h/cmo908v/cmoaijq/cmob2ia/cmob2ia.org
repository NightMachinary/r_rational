That's a pretty strong burden of proof to place on the accused.

Prosecutor: "Your Honor, Joe here was part of the gang that robbed the bank."

Joe: "No I wasn't! I wasn't anywhere near the bank when it was robbed, and I can prove it!"

Prosecutor: "Sure, you didn't actually go into the bank yourself, but you helped them plan and prepare for the crime."

What can Joe say to prove that he never had contact with these people in any way and never contributed anything to the planning or prep of the crime? If he's guilty until proven innocent, he's screwed.
