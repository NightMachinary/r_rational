If I understand this correctly:

- Laws are abstract principles that cannot be changed (without significant effort) and cannot inherently be violated because they lack specifics that would allow for violation
- Executive orders are the instantiation of a law; they provide specific terms that say what constitutes a violation
- If A feels that B has broken an executive order, A can accuse B and the burden of proof is on A
- If B has complied with the executive order but A feels that the EO is not an appropriate instantiation of the law, then A can accuse B and the burden of proof is on A.

Interesting idea; I'll need to think on it some more before I could say if I agree with it, but it's definitely interesting.

My concern is that it does not well address externalities. Take, for instance, drug use (by which I mean serious drugs such as heroin). Drug use itself is victimless, yet drug users place an above-average strain on the nation's health care infrastructure, they contribute less to the economy, and they are overrepresented in the criminal classes. Under your system, what law or executive order would address this? Who would bring suit against them, and who would have the burden of proof?
