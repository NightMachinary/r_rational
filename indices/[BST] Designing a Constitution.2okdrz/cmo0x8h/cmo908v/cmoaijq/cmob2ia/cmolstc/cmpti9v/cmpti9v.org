Grammar nitpick: "prove" is the verb, "proof" is the noun. And in this case I think you actually want "evidence."

I'm still unclear on what you're putting in executive orders and how they differ from laws. If an executive order constitutes a rule that I can be punished for breaking and that will be enforced by the LEOs and judicial branch, then how is it different from a law? (Serious question, not being snarky.)

In your original comment you did not say that people couldn't be accused without proof, which is why I was confused. I'm still worried about your burden of proof however -- the government should never be able to send me to prison unless they have substantial evidence that I actually did something illegal. If I am known to have drinks with Tony the Mobster every Thursday, they are absolutely justified in using that as evidence that I MIGHT be a criminal, and to therefore investigate me to see if they can find evidence that I AM a criminal. When they have leveled a specific charge ("you shot Joe") it should still be their job to prove that I did it, not my job to prove that I didn't.

If the burden of proof is on the accused, then you end up with witch hunts and tyranny -- anyone, citizen or government, can send anyone to prison simply by leveling a charge that cannot be disproven.
