I like the weapons-means-LEO; give people freedoms with attendant responsibility, seems a good plan.

The part about taxes seems exploitable -- if you're only taxed on land /ownership/, then why would anyone buy land? Just rent / lease the use of it. Or, alternatively, create a corporation (or a trust) which holds ownership of the land but you do not. Who would owe taxes in the second case -- the stockholders? The CEO of the company? The board of directors of the company? The administrators of the trust?

In principle I like this, but there are edge cases that would need to be addressed. For example, water right management, toxic waste dumping, strip mining -- these are all externalities with no direct victims, so how are they prosecuted? Would this fall under the "executive orders"?

Actually, I'm unclear on what you're putting under "executive orders" -- how do you see those working?
