Yeah, I like that path. Break down the right to bear arms a wee bit, beef up the privacy right to match, reinforce the separation of church and state ... also, [[http://www.cgpgrey.com/politics-in-the-animal-kingdom/][the voting system would need some work]]. But I think it's a pretty good template, especially for a American city-state like [[/u/DataPacRat]] is describing -- super-especially for one that just ended a period of oligarchical mob rule.
