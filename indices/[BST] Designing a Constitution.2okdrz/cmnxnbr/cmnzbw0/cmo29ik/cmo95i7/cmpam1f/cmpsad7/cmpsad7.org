Yes, I'm aware that that's what it means. You have, however, proven my point: the original text is not clear. The current definition is based on reference to other documents (FP) and to decisions made after the fact by a group of people not signatory to the document. If you're going to write a Constitution, be clear. Try something like: "The people have a fundamental right to own whatever weapons they choose and to carry those weapons on their person at any time. No branch of government shall place restrictions on this right."
