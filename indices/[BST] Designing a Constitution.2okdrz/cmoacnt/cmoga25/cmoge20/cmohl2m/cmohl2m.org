I don't like Borda count, mostly because it fails on a number of criteria that I consider important (majority criterion, Condorcet criterion). My pie-in-the-sky preference is one of the methods that finds the Smith set and then applies some ranked choice algorithm to it if there's not a Condorcet winner, but that's hard to explain to city council members, let alone the general voting public. (Edit: For single-winner elections, anyway. Multiple winner elections are a whole different kettle of fish.)

The biggest problem is that when you start talking about voting systems, people think that you're trying to steal an election or squeeze out some advantage. What people hear is "rank the candidates, then stuff happens, and at the end we have a winner", with that middle step being a thing of mystery.
