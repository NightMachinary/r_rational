I am admittedly biased, coming from Australia, but I like the instant runoff method. I feel that it is a good compromise in that it is simple to explain, reduces tactical voting and fulfills the majority criterion.

While it doesn't meet the Condorcet criterion, *I* don't feel that that is a necessity due to philosophical problems with paper rock scissors situations. Preferable sure, but not necessary.

Of course it doesn't really matter in most cases, (so long as you don't choose first past the post), no voting system is perfect. (As has been mathematically proven!)
