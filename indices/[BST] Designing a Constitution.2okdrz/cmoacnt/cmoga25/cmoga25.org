  Voting uses a preference rank and any Condorcet method for counting, because why wouldn't you.

As someone who's been part of an effort to get ranked-choice voting used by our city, the reasons seem to boil down to:

- It's difficult to understand, and a voter education scheme would cost money.
- It's difficult to count (or manually recount) the votes.
- It requires money for upgrading the existing voting machines.
- There are a lot of different voting schemes to choose from.
- It's fairly opaque to the voters.

(These range from reasonable to frustratingly stupid.)
