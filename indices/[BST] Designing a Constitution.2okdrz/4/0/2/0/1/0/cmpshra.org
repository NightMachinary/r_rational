No, I said militia and I meant militia. The point I was trying to make was:

1. There are people who are not considered part of the militia (e.g. because they are too old). Are these people allowed to own and carry weapons?
2. In revolutionary times, the militia had training sessions. Are militia members allowed to carry their weapons when they are not actually on the field of a training event? e.g., can they go grocery shopping with a rifle on their back and a pistol on their hip?
