Significant typo: By 1972 you meant 1792.

Also, that passage distinctly does /not/ say that " 'militia' refers to all able-bodied men between 17 and 45 years of age." If that was true, then it would not be necessary to enroll them in it, as they would already be part of it by virtue of being able-bodied mean between 17 and 45 years of age. Additionally, two-century-old Acts of Congress which were not well-enforced even at the time are not strong precedent for current law; there are many strange laws passed around that time that are totally disregarded for all purposes (often called 'blue laws').

I'm quite confident that the current legal interpretation of 'the militia' in practice is 'the National Guard', and unless you can find a citation in law from the post-WWII period discussing militia that implies universal membership, I stand by that.
