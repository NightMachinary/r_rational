  Break down the right to bear arms a wee bit,

Also, clarify it. Do they really mean:

- you may carry a weapon at any time
- you may only carry a weapon if you a militia member, regardless of whether you are currently on duty (e.g. on the training field)
- you may only carry a weapon if you are on active duty in the militia at that moment

Also, what's the definition of "arms"? Blunderbuss? Pistol? Rifle? Machine gun? Tank? NBC weapon?
