For a small area, I'd probably base the organizational model on the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_town_meeting][Representative Town Meetings]] of the large Massachusetts towns (these get reasonably large and remain manageable; Framingham has 68,000 residents). As long as you stick to a small area, this works pretty well, as everyone who is making policy is constantly accountable to their constituents(=neighbors), and it resists the current US form of partisan politics by deflecting factional tendencies toward neighborhoods and specific interest groups rather than all-encompassing Red/Blue Tribes that have an opinion on everything.

The town meeting format does not account for a judicial branch nor deal well with the executive-branch end of things; the meeting moderator and town administrator/town manager, which are in principle carrying out the wishes of the meeting representatives and board of selectmen, in practice can be very powerful positions prone to abuse. Gerrymandering of representative districts is also possible. Copying [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framingham,_Massachusetts#Government][Framingham's model]] seems like a good way to deal with some of this; preference rank within the precint-equivalents is obviously a good plan.

For policy-oriented suggestions, mundane ones include making politicians well-paid for their time in order to avoid bribery and make conflicts of interest unnecessary in principle. Expressly stating the principle that taxes should be placed only on things that the government wishes to discourage or on things that cannot be moved outside the borders of the city-state (i.e. Pigovian and land-value taxes) seems like a broad enough criterion to be included in the Constitution; I'd be leery of including anything terribly specific, on the general principle that theoretical rules should be set up to fail gracefully if they turn out to be bad empirically, and Contitutional limits on what can be taxed would not fail gracefully.

One thing you can get nicely if you have royalty is a safety valve if things go poorly. This makes it easier to provide for governmental stability with very long terms for some parts of the government, with the royal safety valve if someone successfully deceives the voters and changes their policy drastically once elected; allow the monarch to be given emergency powers by a plebiscite or to have their intervention requested in a specific matter by a sufficiently-large citizen's petition.

Elected judiciary is immoral and grotesquely stupid, and should not be considered in any halfway-reasonable discussion of government planning. I am unclear on how it ever seemed like a good idea.
