The constitution of the United States was based a lot on things such as the Magna Carta and the government it outlines was inspired by the Roman Republic. Now, that's not the only thing that shaped the document. Consider the 3rd Amendment.

This was added in more from then recent memory of colonial homeowners forced to shelter British soldiers. It was a pressing issue that the then new government wish to abstain from.

My suggestion is to think hard about your setting's history and what the lives of those writing this new constitution were like leading up to that moment. Find what the beliefs, thoughts, and feelings of the writers are at the time of penning this document and you'll see what would fit.
