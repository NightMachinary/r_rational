What about resource distribution? What's the tech level? If there's /also/ an abundance of natural resources to go with that low population, the best possible thing would probably be to /keep/ the population low and live as technologically advanced hunter-gatherers - perhaps with a loose set of treaties to deal with conflict where it arises. The need for government arises out competing interests, which in turn arise out of scarcity.
