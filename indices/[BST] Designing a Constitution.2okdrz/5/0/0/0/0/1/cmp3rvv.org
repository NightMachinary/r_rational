I started writing S.I., where Bunny once met "Pepsi Convoy", just about six months ago. It's 268,000 words later, and at the chapter I'm currently writing, 'Bunny' is occasionally referred to as 'Mad Queen Bunny' for Reasons.

(Mild spoilers for Book Six)

Erie's Office of the Mayor sent orders for the capture of the visiting head-of-state of the Dominion of Lake Erie (ie, Bunny), and to place her in dangerous proximity to a known transformative zone; violating all sorts of the diplomatic protocols required to have any sort of diplomatic negotiations at all, thus committing a de facto act of war against Lake Erie. The apparent motivation was to gain control of city-killer tech they believed Bunny had access to.
