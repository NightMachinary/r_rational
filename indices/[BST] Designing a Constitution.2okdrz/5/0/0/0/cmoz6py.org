Mad Queen Bunny occasionally daydreams about personally undertaking such a lifestyle...

More seriously - various Plot thingummies have created all sorts of new and interesting life-forms to populate the environment with, various pre-Singularity global heating amelioration efforts are out of control and interacting interestingly, and if a human walks into the wrong zone he might get turned into one of those new and interesting life-forms.

(Sample life-form: 'Carousel tree'. Description: "If you ever find a branch growing out of your chest, and another growing out your back, do whatever you have to to keep the chest one from touching the ground. That is, unless you're in a spot you don't mind being rooted to for the rest of your life.")

One item that is in reasonably short supply: areas that have been carefully mapped out for dangerous plants, dangerous animals, and dangerous zones, and are thus reasonably safe for human habitation. The scarcity comes from the fact that scouting to map out new areas tends to use up the scouts fairly quickly, and without proper monitoring previously-mapped areas can be infiltrated by invasive life-forms.

On average, probably something like late 19th century, with various 20th century tweaks that are more about information or organization (eg, standardized cargo pallets), with occasional surviving near-Singularity-level artifacts (eg, a nearly-self-maintaining university that avoided getting eaten by the Singularity). Some of the new and interesting life-forms provide useful enough materials to have been farmed.
