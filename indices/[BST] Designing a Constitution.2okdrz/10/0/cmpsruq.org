I mostly agree with you, but only mostly. There are certain rights which are important enough that they should be made nigh-unchangeable. Examples might include "no slavery", "cannot be forced to testify against yourself", etc. We could debate about what exactly should be in that list, but I'm confident that most people will agree that there should be such a list.

The list should be minimal, however, and everything else can and should be placed in law though. Absolutely with you on that.
