My personal answer would be, bit by bit. As in, you try to make everything a little less crazy, check your sources a little more often, believe fewer convenient lies, and try to get everyone around you to do that too. You don't try to convert crazy people from voting for populist to politicians to voting for people who like; you try to make them more self-aware about why they vote, and what are the issues and the stakes of the election.

I mean, I don't have a "make politics rational" plan, and politics in general just suck. The way I see it, no matter how stubborn or unreasonable they look, people are always more receptive to someone trying to figure out the truth with them than to someone trying to recruit them. But often it's not enough to change someone's mind.
