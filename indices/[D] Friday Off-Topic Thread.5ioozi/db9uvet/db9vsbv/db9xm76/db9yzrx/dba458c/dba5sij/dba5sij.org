I think that the problem with that reasoning is that you're trying to disguise an object-level policy as a meta-level policy.

I reminds in a SSC link thread, where Scott Alexander mentioned a proposal to limit voting to well-informed people, because Trump being elected clearly proves that people aren't voting intelligently enough; Scott answered that this wouldn't work, since Trump scored more highly on average among well-informed people. The commenter "the non mouse" answered that, if we're just going to look for the electorate least likely to elect Trump, we might as well go ahead and limit voting to Hillary voters.

The thing is, people are wary to adopt general ideas that conflict with their specific beliefs; especially if they know it's the reason they're being told about the general idea in the first place. If you tell someone you believe in souls or consciousness or whatever, and they tell you "oh, you should really learn about this rationality method, it makes you realize how silly the idea of a unified consciousness is!"; you're not going to be particularly motivated to learn the method, except in a "I'm going to try to prove this wrong" way.
