The problem is that when we try to explain why that heuristic is wrong, they stop listening. Many of these people believe that intellectualism is fundamentally biased against them, so they automatically reject everything we say as biased. It used to be infuriating to argue with these people, but now that their ideas have gained popularity and political power they've become an existential threat. Humanity needs to be smarter than this if we're going to survive.
