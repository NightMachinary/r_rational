Agreed, I think that getting people to recognize the distinction between conspiracy theories vs credible news, or gut feelings vs empirical data, is much more important than getting people to go from "I tend to believe what the experts say, but still get swayed by bad arguments if the experts say them" to "I critically examine everything for myself and think rationally." That last bit is the best possible end-goal, but it's not where the sanity waterline is just below for most people.

Unfortunately however, the latter distinction is the one more likely to be crossed by people who care about rationality and becoming smarter in the first place. It's hard to raise people's rationality/intelligence/critical thinking if they are anti-intellectual in the first place. I don't think that means we should give up, but I do think it explains why a lot of sanity-waterline-raising focuses on making already "smart" people more "rational."
