I disagree with you strongly. For you, the emphasis seems to be on trusting institutions and groups of people and specific ideas known to be correct, rather than the methods. I would like the opposite to occur. Methods are what are most important. Someone doesn't become trustworthy just because they put on a labcoat. That kind of trust in authority can easily go bad. Authorities are only trustworthy to the extent they hold themselves to valid methods.
