I hadn't heard of him until someone on SB started complaining about /stepping on worm/. On that day I learned +hate+ mild disdain.

He also has a weird thing for young teenagers. I don't want to call it pedophilia, partially because that word is too emotionally charged, but the long and short of it is that his stories would cleanly violate SB's (admittedly draconian) underage romance violations.
