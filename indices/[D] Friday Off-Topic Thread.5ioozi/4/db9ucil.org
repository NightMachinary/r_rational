/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11984396][Testing the Limits of Magic]]/ is a very nice [[https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Refuge_in_Audacity][Refuge in Audacity]] story. The summary baldly states:

#+begin_quote
  Involves the best elements of every great Fan Fiction I have ever known of.
#+end_quote

However, in spite of this "everything but the kitchen sink" intent, it's surprisingly fun to read, and has fairly good English. It reminds me of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1318171][Perfect Lionheart]]'s stories!

To my chagrin, it seems that the development team of /neither/ of my two favorite mods for [[http://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza][Paradox Development Studio games]] can be trusted to hold historical accuracy over moral outrage...

In /[[http://www.reddit.com/r/eu4][Europa Universalis IV]]/, the player can expend abstracted "military power" in order to make an army of his attack the natives of a province, resulting in the natives' extermination if the army is large and advanced enough. The extensive MEIOU & Taxes mod removed that button on the grounds that "the M&T team does not endorse genocide". Later, the modders attempted to backtrack by calling it "an ahistorically easy to push genocide button"--but, when pressed, they admitted that their rationale for the button's removal was "mostly" moral.\\

In /[[http://www.reddit.com/r/crusaderkings][Crusader Kings II]]/, the player can torture imprisoned characters, though he risks gaining undesirable traits (Cruel, Impaler, etc.) in the process. The extensive Historical +Improvement+ Immersion Project mod has not adjusted the decisions that are available for torture, and has left them at the somewhat-arbitrary levels of vanilla CK2. When a player suggested ways to make the torture decisions more realistic and historically-accurate, the HIP modders expressed "zero interest in touching the vanilla torture/mutilation options to do anything other than remove them outright".\\
