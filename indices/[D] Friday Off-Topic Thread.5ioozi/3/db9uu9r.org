I've been thinking about coffee, lately, and whether I should start drinking some.

On one hand, I generally feel that taking any mind-altering substance on a regular basis is a horrible idea, with potentially disastrous consequences.

On the other hand, I'm not actually sure this is true, and lately I've often felt tired and weary when I need to be productive, even when I sleep more, and "drink some coffee before you start working" is the advice I've heard most often. I'm not sure drinking coffee would address the problem or just remove my awareness of the problem; I'm not sure what the problem even is. And coffee is hardly a strong nootropic, so it's not like I would be putting my life and my health on the line.

So what do you think? What does coffee even do, and should I start drinking some on a regular basis?

For that matter, does anyone know what the deal with ego depletion is yet?
