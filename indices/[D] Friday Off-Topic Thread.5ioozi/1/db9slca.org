Been watching videos on this [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZFipeZtQM5CKUjx6grh54g][guy]]'s channel.

I learned that a dyson swarm, for example, doesn't need any new technology. It's just pumping out satellites after satellites until you have enough, and the sheer scale of such a civilization is just mind boggling to contemplate.

It makes all the space opera I watched or read about puny in comparison.

Star Wars isn't big at all. It's positively tiny.
