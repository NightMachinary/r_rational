The problem with daily caffeine use is that tolerance builds, and eventually you're exactly where you were in the first place.

Caffeine is not a /long-term/ solution to energy problems. If you use it sparingly, you can get an energy boost. Otherwise, it just becomes a return to normalcy, which isn't necessarily bad, if you like the taste of coffee.

Personally, I've found that when I do have a lot of caffeine (triple my normal daily dose), I'll end up crashing 5-6 hours later, and then staying up a couple hours later. Still, it's sometimes worth it when deadlines are approaching.
