  Caffeine is not a long-term solution to energy problems

I'd rephrase this to 'caffeine is not a solution to constant energy problems'. It's a good tool for temporary and occasional energy surges.

So if you start drinking coffee every morning just to wake up, you're going to be at a baseline very quickly. But if you drink coffee once a week because you have an important meeting after a full day of work, it'll work much better.
