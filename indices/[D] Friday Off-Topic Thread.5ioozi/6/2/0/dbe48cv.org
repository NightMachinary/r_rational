I think part of where I may be failing here is that I don't have great examples of responsible drinkers. Neither of my parents drink and most of the people I'm exposed to who do drink are college students. Hardly a demographic known for their good decisions.

On the other hand I don't know that there's some hard line between loosing control and merely having had a few drinks. I think it's important to realize that their is this continuous gradient because it makes us realize we are really trying to solve some sort of system of equations. If we could decide how much benefit drinking has per unit of alcohol and how much harm than it's simple to see that you should only drink until damage(x)=benefit(x). I think the crux of the argument I'm trying to make is that damage(x) is much bigger than benefit(x) for practically every X. Maybe there is some x (some amount of drinking) where the benefits outweigh the damage, but I'd think it would have to be really small and on a personal note I don't like the taste.
