Yeah, I can see where you're coming from. I don't like the taste either.

But I do know some examples of responsible drinkers, one of whom assures me that there is a small but measurable reduction in the odds of death due to heart disease that accompanies very slight use of alcohol - on the lines of one or at most two glasses of wine with an evening meal. If one is drinking enough that one's speech becomes audibly affected, then that is well beyond the like of 'too much' already (and one is quite possibly looking at liver damage if this is regularly sustained).

So, yeah. X /is/ pretty small.
