My parents are responsible drinkers, on the rare occasions that they actually have some sort of alcohol (maybe once a month?), and so that's always been what I considered normal.

If I have one or two drinks I start to feel light headed but in a sort of vaguely pleasant way. It's slightly harder to think, but more so in that it just seems to take longer. My personality doesn't really seem to change, although I'm sort of weird anyway so that's hard to measure.

I've never done anything I regretted while drunk (or buzzed, it's arguable that I've never truly reached "drunk" depending on your definition) I've never really made any decisions other than dialogue choices while socializing, and also choosing to stop drinking once I felt like I'd had enough.

So yeah, it's possible, in fact, easy, to drink responsibly if you know what that means. Given my (extremely limited) experience, I think it's reasonable to say that at least 90% of cases of drinking have the benefits outweigh the damage, because there literally is no damage. It's just that in small number of cases the damage is so severe it outweighs the benefits.

It's sort of like playing the reverse lottery, except it's not really random. It's just the dumb people ruining it for everyone else (like they do with everything else)
