I can sympathize, especially with the HIP modders. Historical accuracy or not, I wouldn't be especially eager to spend time developing and balancing a realistic, developed torture system in any kind of video game.

I don't know how the HIP team works, but if they're volunteers, they're mostly going to work on things that interests them, and if they don't like the idea of organizing and maintaining a torture system, they're just going to leave the system as it is, and work on systems they're more interested in.
