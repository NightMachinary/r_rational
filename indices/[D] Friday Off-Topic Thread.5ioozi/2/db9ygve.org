Weekly update on my rational pokemon game, including work on the data creation tool Bill's PC. [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EUSMDHdRdbvQJii5uoSezbjtvJpxdF6Da8zqvuW42bg/edit?usp=sharing][Handy discussion links and previous threads here]].

Ugh, this week was intense, and not all in a good way.  Between the [[https://imperium.news/assault-m-oee8-keepstar/][destruction of the first armed and fully operational keepstar in Eve Online]] and the grand finals of the Boston Major and the subsequent release of version 7.00 in Dota 2, I got nothing useful done over the weekend.  And then on Tuesday I started coming down with a bug, and I'm only just now returning to work, so nothing got done during the workweek, either.

However, on the lone day I had available (Monday) I did get some work done on an automated logging tool for Discord, to help streamline that process.  That tool is about 85% done, and I will probably get that done in the coming days as I slowly recover.

Once I have fully gotten back on my feet, I expect to continue finalizing the design document of the game.  If there are any features you feel have been neglected, or any critique you've been sitting on as you sit from afar, please let us know!  My goal is to have at least the list of features more or less frozen by the new year, with everything after that concerned with implementation.

Feel free to leave any comments or questions below. Also feel free to join us [[https://discord.gg/sM99CF3][on the #pokengineering channel of the /r/rational Discord server]] for brainstorming and discussion.  It's a great group, really, and I would highly recommend hanging out, even if you're not in it for this project itself.  There's tabletop groups, Dota 2 partying, and [[http://i.imgur.com/j3jRmMZ.png][puns]] like you wouldn't [[http://i.imgur.com/8cUkzoGl.jpg][believe]].  Come join us!
