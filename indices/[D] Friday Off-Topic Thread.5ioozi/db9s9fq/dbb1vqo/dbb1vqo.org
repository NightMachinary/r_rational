That is a pretty common thing among many people. It's why conflict of interest is such a big deal when you're talking about lawyers or doctors. People /suck/ at separating their emotions from themselves and making the objectively right choices that would improve their lives. For example, there are millions of overweight people (myself included) that understand the risks and downsides of being overweight. Yet....we're still overweight. We don't have the necessary willpower to make what would be admittedly simple changes in our diet and workout regimen. Of course, not all overweight people are in this category but the vast majority are.

So with House, he's ruled by his basic emotions. He's hedonistic and childish, and that shows in many of his actions. He's ridiculously intelligent, objectively, but he will also make decisions that are so recklessly stupid, it could only happen on TV (prime example: taking a drug for his leg that had only one success in one rat for a few weeks. Instead of waiting for more clinical trials to be done. And then, proceeding to do major surgery on himself instead of going to his competent coworkers because he was /embarassed/.)
