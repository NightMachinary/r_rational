He's definitely a tremendous asshole, but there is the rare moment of humanity he shows---and in his own, selfish way, he does care for his friends. He tested Cameron for HIV since she was too scared to. Asshole move? Definitely. But he did it because "knowing is always better than not knowing." He also kept Cuddy's 'auditioning' Wilson a secret from Wilson. Granted, he needled her about it for months, but he did do a good thing by keeping her secret.

He's an ass, but he does help people.

And he's tremendously irrational---at least in our world's definition of rationality. His world seems to operate on the principle that "If House is a miserable jerk, things work out." So maybe he's figured that out and maintains the status quo because it works out best that way.
