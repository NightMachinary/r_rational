Not me, I think he's just an asshole who specifically chooses to be an asshole. I never got into the show because I just hated him so much. I don't care if that's the intention, I do not want to watch a show where a man (verbally) abuses people for personal pleasure and gets away with it because he's good at his job, which he does purely for personal pleasure.

He's not irrational, he just doesn't care about anyone and has no excuse for it. Sherlock and Sheldon Cooper have mental disorders that keep them from empathizing with people even if they don't see that as a problem. Archer and Tony Stark are selfish jerks, but they still fundamentally care about people and doing their job despite their personal flaws.
