I was surprised when I searched Less Wrong for posts about alcohol and found nothing big. I always thought that community like that would be quite averse to taking drugs. Then I remembered the "I notice I'm confused" thingy. I thought about it for some time, tried to see it from the other side. I think the main arguments against total abstinence would be something like:

- Drugs, when taken in moderation by someone who researched the topic, can make for a nice experience/have good effect on you. So it's better to make a case for responsible drug use rather than abstinence from them.

- Like you said, for someone who knows what he's doing, it's only low risk. So if it can benefit you, you should take the risk anyway, I guess.
