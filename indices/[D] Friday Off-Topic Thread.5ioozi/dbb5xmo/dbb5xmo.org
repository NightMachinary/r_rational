Little bit late, but if anyone sees this what are your views on alcohol/drinking. I was invited to and went to a party where there was quite a bit of drinking last night. I don't drink. I'd even go as far to say that drinking is mildly immoral. Here's the argument I'm planning on posting to Facebook on the subject.

I'm generally what's called an utilitarian. Briefly this means I believe in doing those things that cause the most good for the most people. Like almost any philosophy there are some problems with it, but I'll ignore them because they aren't relevant to this context other than to say I'm more of a Rule utilitarian this means that rather than looking at each individual case and trying to decide the right course of action based on the total change to society I believe in coming up with a set of rules that if followed with improve the world.

Let's look at drinking then. Positives are that it's a bonding experience. It also has some medical applications but there are both better options now and I'm trying to focus on recreational use. To me the chief negative is that it causes one to lose control of themselves. A huge number of violent crime is committed by or on people who were drunk. About 9,967 people die every year due to drunk driving in the US. And here is the crux of my argument. I'm not sure if I can blame them. Yes I believe in legal manner we can and should, but on a personal level when they made the decision to drive they often couldn't legally or morally make any decision. Critically I see no reason to believe I couldn't or wouldn't do the same thing in their position. The only actual mistake I can see them making is drinking in the first place. Similarly most crimes committed by drunks are committed by people who didn't choose to commit any crime, their real mistake was drinking. Again not trying to say anything about legal culpability.

Given all this my basic argument should be clear. By drinking you're essentially taking the choice of committing terrible crimes and entrusting it to chance. It's a low chance sure, but still a chance. Personally I'm not willing to take those odds and I think looked at this way few people would be. I don't think trying to ban alcohol is the right choice (it just doesn't work), in fact I'd support lowering the legal drinking age, but I think the world would be significantly better without drugs in general. Anyway I'd really like to hear others opinions. I don't have all the evidence and trying to assign value and weigh multiple factors this way is really hard.
