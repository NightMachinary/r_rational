If you drink enough that you lose control of yourself, then yes, that has serious problems. However, though I don't drink myself, observation suggests that drinking in small amounts (e.g. a glass of wine with a meal) does not impair decision-making ability to the point where one would suddenly decide to drive. Especially if one has made plans (e.g. hiring a taxi in advance) to ensure that the simplest decision will be /not/ to drive.

So, I agree with you that the consequences of /losing control/ are a massive negative, and firm steps should be made to try to prevent people losing control. But I don't think that losing control is an inevitable result of drinking in moderation.
