That's an choice where the cost of one is significantly higher than the other. I'm talking about work within our country, or at least the western world. We're focusing too much on people who already care about questioning their beliefs, like college students and graduate, and not enough on people who are voting for populist political leaders who dispute facts and support policies that work against their constituents' self-interest. Don't send the missionaries to Africa or the Bay Area, send them to rural communities in the US.
