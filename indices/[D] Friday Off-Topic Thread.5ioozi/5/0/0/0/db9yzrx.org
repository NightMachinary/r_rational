Well, getting you to abandon your spirituality is pretty low on our collective to-do lists, I think ;p

The same has been debated before. Should CFAR focus on making a few people more rational n the bay area, or sending missionaries to Elbonia?

By focusing on the bay area, they've managed to become self-sustaining. A few very-competent people might be more useful then a bunch of middling-competent people (when you include "being born in the first world" as a form of competence).

That being said, Elbonia is a big country and I have no doubt we could get some very competent people there. They'd just have less access to resources on the global scale. And supporting missionaries is /hard/.
