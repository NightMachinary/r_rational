I think that's what "raising the sanity waterline" means, at least as far as EY's original article went. Personally, I've always seen it as less of a guideline (go out and teach them, my children!) and more of a reminder that, even if it feels useless on a grand scale, trying to teach a particular person is always useful, trickle-down-style.

That said, I feel like you're advocating the exact general principle that fits you specific interests. You're saying that there are people out there who don't like eg science, critical thinking and education, and it could be fixed if we just raised the minimum rationality level; but you don't want the minimum rationality level to be raised so much that you have to abandon your religious/spiritual beliefs; I think there's an inconsistency there.
