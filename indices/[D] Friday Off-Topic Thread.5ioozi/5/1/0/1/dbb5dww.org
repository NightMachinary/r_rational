  I am advocating for trusting in methods, specifically people that utilize those methods and have proven beyond reasonable doubt that they are utilizing those methods to uncover the truth.

I don't think a lot of authorities that have proven beyond reasonable doubt that they're trustworthy exist. I see bad statistics and bad science everywhere. Because major flaws do exist, I think it's asking too much to ask people to trust the system. I'm not saying that paranoia is justified, but it's hard to convince someone who's paranoid that they should trust authorities when there are legitimate flaws that they might point to in response. Instead, I would ask them to give the system a chance to provide evidence, and listen to that evidence seriously before deciding whether something is right or wrong. You see moving people to rationality as harder than moving people towards trust. But I think rationality is appealing because it lets people avoid extreme positions without giving themselves over to trust, which is the bigger leap away from their current beliefs. "Give the idea a chance" is an easier sell than "trust the idea because the people who said it are trustworthy", because even if evaluating ideas is difficult paranoid people are still much more motivated to do that than to trust.
