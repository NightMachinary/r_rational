I've done exactly what you said and it isn't working. I do consider the claims of people is disagree with and find the evidence does not support their conclusions. When I present the evidence for my positions they decry me and my sources as biased against them without good reasons based in rationality.

I'm arguing with people who think that scientists in general cannot be trusted to be objective or accurate, higher education is indoctrinating students into political ideologies, and that political correctness is a culture of oppression that has overrun the media. At best, these are gross exaggerations of real problems.
