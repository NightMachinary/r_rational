I've had more luck than you speaking with people of those positions. It requires a willingness to almost bend over backwards. It might help that on many issues I'm uncertain of things and willing to confess that uncertainty, allowing them to feel they've got breathing room for their own positions. But ultimately this method has worked much better to change people's minds, at least in my experience.
