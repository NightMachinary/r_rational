I am advocating for trusting in methods, specifically people that utilize those methods and have proven beyond reasonable doubt that they are utilizing those methods to uncover the truth. Critiquing institutions and authority is fine, even necessary, but that's not what I've been seeing from people who disagree with intellectuals. I'm seeing conspiracy theories with no supporting evidence.
