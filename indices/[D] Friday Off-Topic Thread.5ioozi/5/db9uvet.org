When I first heard about raising he sanity waterline and how it was frequently framed as promoting atheism, it made me nervous because I am a spiritualist who isn't willing to give up my ontological beliefs that aren't epistemically supported. Now, however, it has occurred to me that the waterline isn't high enough to even consider debating what is a rational worldview.

We as a civilization don't even agree that science, critical thinking, and education are predominantly good things that should be trusted more often than not. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/5igpgq/in_your_opinion_is_antiintellectualism_rising_in/db871ud][There are people]] who genuinely believe that anti-intellectualism is a good thing because they think academia and higher education is either factually wrong or conspiring against them the majority of the time.

We've spent so much time discussing rationality with each other that we've become ignorant of people who fundamentally distrust rationality. With populism on the rise throughout the world, it's only gotten worse in recent years. Our priority should be raising their sanity waterline up to ours, not raising our own up to an ideal.
