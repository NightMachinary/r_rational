I was watching House recently, and got to the third season. I was reminded very much of Quirrell's lesson to Harry on losing. For those who don't know, in the third season, House gets revenge on a clinic patient who's admittedly rude to him, but by inserting a rectal thermometer and leaving him in the room. Massive overkill. The patient was a detective, who then makes House's life hell by taking him to task over his malpractice and Vicodin addiction. House, of course, responds by constantly escalating, even when the entire situation would have been solved just by giving an admittedly fake apology. If he would have just learned to lose, he could have saved such difficulty.

This actually lead me to a minor realisation: I think the reason people are so fascinated with House as a character is that for all his brilliance and love of rationality, in his personal life he's actually quite irrational. He dresses in the garb of logic, but uses it to rationalise and post-hoc justify utterly irrational actions. I think the paradox and contradiction there is what interests people.
