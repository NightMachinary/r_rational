That duality is one of the things I love about this series, the gods bet about good and evil means that /good/ and /evil/ have to exist, when they objectively do not, all that exists is morality and ethics that are agreed upon by society. This forces the world into a broken cycle of stories forcing people who want to make a difference into roles so that they can achieve their ambitions, but depending on where they are, who they serve and how they do things they are arbitrarily divided into Hero's and Villains. This all leads to self righteous people like Cordelia who think they are right just because they aren't villains. Cordelia is every bit as ruthless and villainous as Cat, but she happened to be born in a place of power and privilege, so she didn't have to make the compromises that Cat did to make a difference. I could go on about this forever, I fucking love this series.
