It's exactly the sort of attitude Cat hates the most. Forget the human beings who will die, the destruction of cities, the mass starvation. Just mindlessly fight Evil because the Heavens will it. Force other people to die for your principles all in the pursuit of some 'Greater Good' that helps no one. And of course, rather than have an actual plan, just trust in the power of prayer and narrative to deliver your victory.
