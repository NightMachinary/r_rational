You seem to be expressing skepticism about the validity of heroic losses. I have some pretty major problems with the end of the whole Angel arc... The only contribution I have is that, in regards to William beheading Cat, the Wandering Bard explicitly stated:

#+begin_quote
  She'd watched from a distance as William killed the Squire and known what it meant. That the Lone Swordsman had lost, that Liesse was lost, that the rebellion was over. - Book 2, Epilogue
#+end_quote

But The Battle of Camps ran on pure story: The heroes' victory could not be decided until Cat woke up, and the pseudo-heroic role Cat claimed as /Orphan Defending Home Country from Foreign Aggressors/ basically guaranteed her victory (extended to Akua, who even comments on the novelty of acting in a heroic role.)

The meta-story here is villains flipping the story to eek out victory despite creational logic dictating Good will win in the end. The Battle of the Camps plays that tune well.
