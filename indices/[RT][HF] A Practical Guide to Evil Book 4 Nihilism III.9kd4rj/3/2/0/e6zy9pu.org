  There was also that time William lopped Catherine's head off at the end of their pattern of three

In a fight he probably should have won anyway, judging by their past performances. But more to the point, it's hard to call that one a win for Heroic Stories when three seconds later when the Story help saved Cat with a last minute rescue:

  “A force was helping me along,” the bespectacled mage said. “Your Name, and... something else. It was like Creation did not want you to be dead.”.
#+end_quote

Followed by Cat winning by tricking an angel into ressurecting her as she "couldn't be dead and win"... despite that fact that [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGoodWayToDie][plenty of winners in story die]] and Will's own victory condition was death.

“And yet,” the Lone Swordsman smiled, “I win.”

  The Pilgrim also had something of a victory when he destroyed Cat's portal and knocked her and Masego into a coma.

Hard to say that that came from the Story though, when you figure that it should probably just be something that one of the oldest and most powerful Heroes on the continent is able to do.

And even then it didn't mean anything anyway? Cat and Mastro where asleep, the Crusade outnumbered the Army of Callow two to one, they had the Saint, the Pilgrim, and ten other heroes besides to field against Archer, and they didn't really acheive anything of note.

Then all the heroes went to fight Akua, and put up a pretty bad showing despite it being Akua's first time in a physical body in a long time, being almost completey unfamiliar with the specifics of her borrowed power, and just generally being the incarnation of the old-school villainy that the heroes are meant to obliterate, both in terms of her methods and her position as the Butcher of Liesse.

Then Cat wakes up from her nap with no idea of what's happened in the past few days, and rather than the heroes capitalising on any sort of confusion or disorientation, she immediately takes control of the situation and disengages without difficulty.
