That's what we've been /told/ about heroes, I'm more interested in what's been /shown/.

Triumphant is something that happened off-screen and well in the past. We don't really know what went down back then in any detail, and so it's hard to draw inferences from it.

I'm talking about the events we've seen taking place on-screen, with the characters who actually matter in this upcoming section, and from which we can actually look at and analyse.
