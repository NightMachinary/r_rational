  Well I'm not surprised we've had no evidence of heroes receiving heavenly help that actually works in the long term because this is the story about the rise of a villian

That's a doylist explanation though. /In-universe/ the heroes should get as much help as heroes get, by definition.

  Any heavenly help that actually long-term helped would end the story, or at least Cat's arc.

Antagonists absolutely can have lasting impacts on stories. Look at Akua and Liesse. Look at Summer and the ruin of southern Callow. None of the heroes have been anyway near as successful. Will had the best run of all of them back in Book 2.

  We have to look to what has only been inferred from the past to get an idea of how the world works

I think showing>telling and evidence>speculation should be the benchmarks we use to inform our understanding.

It's better to judge the heroes by what they've actually done rather than by what history says a completely different set of heroes did.

  this story is about Black, Malacia, and Cat exploiting the way it.

Totally! (Although I'm not certain how much Malicia should be included in this group, these days.) But a story is defined as much by its antagonists as it's protagonists. And what the antagonists have done seems to paint a picture of them falling like a house of cards in this coming conflict. They don't have many feats of heroic last stands or last-minute saves, and their odds are looking pretty grim.
