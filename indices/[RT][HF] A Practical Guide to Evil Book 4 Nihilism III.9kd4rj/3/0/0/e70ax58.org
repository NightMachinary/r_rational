One of the big issues I'm having here is that there isn't any example we have of this happening. The closest we've come is the Champion killing the Captain after the Bard manuevered the situation. Otherwise the heroes have been pretty ineffectual and haven't really had any meaningful wins. I'm finding it hard to believe that /this time/ things are going to be different when there's no evidence of Heroic narratives having much of a lasting impact in the conflicts thus far and the crusades haven't won so much as a single file battle.

But if you can point to a moment where the Heroes received Heavenly help in a way that mattered beyond a few chapters, I'm all ears.
