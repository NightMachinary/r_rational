That is how the stories go though, just when the side of good needs it the most someone is gonna get a god-tier powerup or pull an army of named outta their arse. It's a fine line that the author is walking where Deus Ex Machina is literally the way the world works and the story is still compelling. The pilgrim has some story on the backburner somewhere and we haven't had the bard do anything lately so she's probably in the shadows somewhere scheming. Lastly, love it or hate it this world seems to work the same way as the force has been characterised in star wars lately. Doesn't matter how strong one side gets the other side is gonna rise to meet it. The dead king is a huge enemy with overwhelmong force. If the side of good wins that fight, no matter what they lose, they might have some absolute units left over to mop up cat with.

So yes, Procer is fucked. I don't see Cordelia working her way out if this one. She called the crusade as a political move. Now she's gotta face the music, even if it means the country she loves so much gets taken out and its entirely on her.

I love this series so much.
