The question is, what does Bard gain by pushing Saint (and possibly Cordelia) like this? The setup we've got so far goes:

1. Hierarch disables Bard temporarily, an opportunity Dead King takes to start making moves again.
2. Bard returns and speaks with Dead King, only to give him permission to "eat the baby" without her interference.
3. Bard encourages Saint of Swords' dogmatic outlook, potentially sowing discord between Cordelia and the church and/or Good named, potentially pushing Cordelia toward some kind of name.

Even if Dead King doesn't decide to mobilize (and I'm not sure I would, after that exchange), it still looks like Procer's about to collapse. How does this play into Bard's game? Why does she seem to want that?
