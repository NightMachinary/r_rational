Well I'm not surprised we've had no evidence of heroes receiving heavenly help that actually works in the long term because this is the story about the rise of a villian. Any heavenly help that actually long-term helped would end the story, or at least Cat's arc. Look at the heroes she killed at the beginning of this chapter. One was offered revenge by heaven before Cat intervened and killed him for real using winter. We have to look to what has only been inferred from the past to get an idea of how the world works because this story is about Black, Malacia, and Cat exploiting the way it. The dead king is different though. He's overtly evil and although he used subversion to get where he is I doubt he has any need for it now, not that he could use it with so much overwhelming power. I believe malacia when she says that no matter how strong he gets he will be pushed back.
