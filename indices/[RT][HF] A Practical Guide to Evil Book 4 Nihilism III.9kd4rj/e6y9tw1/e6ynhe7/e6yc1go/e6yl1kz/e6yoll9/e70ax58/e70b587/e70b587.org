My best example in favour is the rise and fall of Triumphant. She conquered a huge amount of the continent before the forces of good pulled together and beat her. And we've seen that people have been gaming the story system since the dead king. I don't see triumphant winning so much without some gaming happening. But on that meta level she was still defeated.
