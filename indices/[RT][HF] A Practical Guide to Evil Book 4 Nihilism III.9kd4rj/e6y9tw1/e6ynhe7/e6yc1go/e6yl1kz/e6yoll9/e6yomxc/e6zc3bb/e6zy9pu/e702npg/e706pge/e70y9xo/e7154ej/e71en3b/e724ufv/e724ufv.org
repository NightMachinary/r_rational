  the Creational Logic of that story dictated that nothing could be resolved until Cat awoke.

Not really? Again, the Pilgrim just says that Cat will return at the darkest hour. /Not/ that everything else is pointless before that. I think we can assume that he's meant to be taken at face value here, and not hopelessly incorrect.

Just because King Arthur will return to Britain in is hour of greatest need, doesn't mean that that hour can't come so long as he sleeps. That's mixing up the cause and the effect here.

  Theoretically, but Pilgrim & Saint seemed skeptical that Cat could pull a heroic role and did not try to change anything.

Which doesn't exactly paint a picture of Heroic competence. And remember, Pilgrim /can see the future/.

But that aside, he did try to set up a narrative. He laid out why this war would be fought and how, then stuck to those terms. The heroes mostly fought in defence of each other, and against an army of people-eaters, murderous fairies, the undead and the Woe (who I don't think I need to paint a villanous picture of considering their usual modus operandi, but I'll point out that these chapters came out while the Court extra story came out, where thief pulled a Dread Emperor Traitorous). They where backed into a corner, with no supplies, and yeah, they turned down Cat's offer of a truce, but they had every reason to do so - to them, she's the evil fairy Queen who innocents must be saved from: why would they make peace with the momster?

Another issue I have with the "narrative" in universe is that it often seems rather arbitrary. If you go on TVTropes, then almost any sequence of events has an assisted trope, AND has a trope for if things go the other way. The hero that has evil parents that/is an orphan / has loving parents - all of which can be used interchangeably. The hero gets the girl / doesn't. Etc. Etc. Often, these perspectives can be as valid as any other - what, then, determines who has control of the narrative? It always seems to end up being Cat or Black (or Bard that one time), but if it's arbitrary then it doesn't feel super earned.

All of which is to say, Cat argued that the story was one way, the heroes another, and the. For poorly defined reasons Cat was right.

But let's look at things on a smaller scale. I don't think Heroes had one narrative within this story that made heroes look dangerous.

The Pilgrim shows up in a situation which was described as his archetypal story - heroes overmatched and with some of them dead - doesn't really do much more than a momentary respite and upping the difficulty of the fight. Which Cat continues winning until the Saint shows up, before she runs away without anyone stopping her.

Two heroes die after being outnumbered by man-eaters - which, as situations go, is meant to be a heroic speciality.

The Saint fails to kill someone who is monologing about killing and eating her.

All heroes fail to do something about the elaborate plan with clearly defined failure points, leading to the death of thousands. This is despite Cat talking earlier about the need to avoid plans with crucial pivots earlier, and the fact that the Heroes can see the future.

The heroes failed on every level except for Pilgrim knocking out Cat and Mastro for three days, which didn't lead to any consequences that survived more than a few chapters. They didn't benefit from any narratives, and even outnumbering the opposition two to one with food soldiers, and /twelve to one/ with Named, they put up a terrible showing.

The real issue I'm having here is that in the story the heroes come of as toothless. They've spent the last twenty years being beaten, and that trend doesn't Iook like it's going to be reverezed any time soon. I don't think pointing to a battle where the heroes failed to win at anything is going to change this point.

  That's Cat and Black's game.
#+end_quote

Sure, but it'd be nice if the game had someone else they were playing against, who could make moves and provide danger to them. The Bard seems to be the only Hero competent enough to be a danger on the narrative level. Pilgrim is outmaneuvered, Hanno is outmaneuvered and most of them are seemingly unaware or unconcerned with the meta level of stories.

I'm saying that the heroes have no unambiguous feats, whether by dint of their narratives or by dint of their own abilities, that lead to me to think they'll do more than fold like cheap paper against the odds they're up against. They've done nothing but lose so far, in the story we've read and in the twenty years preceding it.why would that change now?
