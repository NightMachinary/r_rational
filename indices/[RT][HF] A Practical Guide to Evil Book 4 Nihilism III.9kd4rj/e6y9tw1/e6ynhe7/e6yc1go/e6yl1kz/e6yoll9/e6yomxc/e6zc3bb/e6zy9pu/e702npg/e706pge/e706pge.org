  You seem to be expressing skepticism about the validity of heroic losses

Less that, more scepticism about how dangerous heroes and heroic stories are meant to be, when they've spent most of the story being soundly beaten. I feel like there's a big gap between their onformed abilities and the one's we've actually seen.

Following on from this, I'm expressing doubt at the heroes ability to save the day here.

Personally I don't think it's really a point in the heroes favour that apparently Will winning his last fight in the pattern of three apparently lead directly to his losing.

And then there's the issue where Cat is benefiting from the story post beheading but before pulling the sword from the stone and exerting her claim in a way that puts the story behind her.(hell, she was both Dead and nameless between these two things). She got a last-minute rescue , explicitly story-given, a ressurection that the angels apparently had to give her for story reasons, and a last-minute power up that let her win. Did the story just fiat say the villain wins, the hero loses?

But even ignoring this. The issue is that I don't buy the threat level of the heiress, as they've not managed anything in the way of a meaningful victory. Will beheading Cat does not count as meaningful when all consequences of this are undone within three chapters and Cat is better of for it.

You get the same issue with the Battle of the Camps - the Pilgrim takes out Cat and Masgeo, but nothing happens due to this that really has any lasting impact.

  the pseudo-heroic role Cat claimed as Orphan Defending Home Country from Foreign Aggressors basically guaranteed her victory (extended to Akua, who even comments on the novelty of acting in a heroic role.)

There's a fair point you've made in this. But if it's that easy to co-opt narrative momentum.. it seems like less of a big deal to me. If a shiny coat of paint can make the ghost of /Akua/ a heroic figure, then heroes don't have the monopoly that Black's so obsessed with. If setting yourself up as a hero means winning like a hero is meant to... then just always do that?

If heiress are dangerous because they have the narrative on their side, but a savvy villain can steal that support.... and almost all remaining villains are that sort of savvy - what is it that makes heroes especially dangerous again?

Maybe I'd buy it more if we'd seen the heroes actually succeeding in the way that everyone says they succeed... but the only time they've really won in the story itself, or had the narrative support which is meant to be their trump card actually work, is that one time with the Champion and the Captain.
