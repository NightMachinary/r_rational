I mean, I still think the story doesn't work that way - see King Arthur. But yeah, whatever was going on there, it's not a good look for Pilgrim or Saint.

Re: precognition, Saint is apparently more sensitive to stories than almost any hero, but Pilgrim can apparently discern Fate by seeking guidance from the heavens. And the Augur looms in the distance.

  Perhaps we can agree that it would be good to see the Author up the ante in such a way that Heroes are actually a threat.

Definitely!
