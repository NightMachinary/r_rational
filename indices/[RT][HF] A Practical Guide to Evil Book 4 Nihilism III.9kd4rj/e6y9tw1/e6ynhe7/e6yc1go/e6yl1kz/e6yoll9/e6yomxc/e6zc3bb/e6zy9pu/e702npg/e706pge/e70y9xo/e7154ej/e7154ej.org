  but at least in-universe the outcome is 'logical' for the characters and is consistent in that sense

The situation is one where Cat does and then, for not much in the way of reason, the narrative intercedes to mount a rescue for her. Notably, Cat doesn't know why this happens, so it's certainly not her cleverly manuevered the situation. Shortly after this, Cat looses her name and presumably her "story". She gets her name back, and /then/ she starts asserting a position in the story (I think there are issues with how this happens, but let's ignore those) and gets a power-up and a ressurection.

This is all made possible solely by the story. Without any prompting or coercion, the story up and said "you're going to win now Cat". It's hard to tie the rescue to what came later, seeing as in-between you get the disjoint that is the Squire Name and Story being stolen. And Cat was only able to asset her position in the story because the story said she would be alive (well, undead) to assert her position. It's a piece of circular logic that points at Cat being handed a win by the story, which is sort of the opposite of how what's apparently meant to happen.

(And Cat wasn't really a Hero there - she'd just soundly rejected a redemption story with Will, and then later with the Angels.)

I can sort of see how it was /meant/ to be read, but personally I have issues with it.

  *nothing could be resolved until Cat awoke*. The Pilgrim and Saint even commented on it
#+end_quote

I'm going to be pedantic and point out that the quote doesn't actually say that. What they say is that Cat will (possibly) awake before anything is resolved.

#+begin_quote
  So I'd argue Heroes in-universe do have a monopoly on heroic roles
#+end_quote

Hmmmm. Fair point. Well, I'll point out that Akua didn't have much trouble benefiting from all this

#+begin_quote
  The only evidence of 'creational logic dictates Good will win in the end' we have is that every character in-universe takes this as fact. We haven't actually witnessed it.
#+end_quote

Yeah, this is the point I'm circling. Procer's doomed, unless a heroic underdog rises up to beat the odds.. except we've literally never seen a heroic underdog beat the odds.

These two instances, Will and the Pilgrim sending Cat for a nap, were just semi-random points that were brought up as an example of heroes succeeding at stuff, but I don't think they actually /do/ work as that - both events don't lead to the heroes really gaining anything in the way of an advantage or a victory, and certainly don't lead to anything impressive enough to matter in front of the Dead King (or the half dozen other threats that exist).

#+begin_quote
  That said, the author has been improving, and we might see these problems fleshed out.
#+end_quote

We're getting into pure personal preference here, but I miss the earlier books. Not for the plot-related things, but more for character moments and the unveiling of the setting (of which admittedly there's been a lot of recently as well). And just, I don't know, getting to read the /promise/ of things, rather than the executions that I sometimes take issue with.

But again, this is entirely subjective - I totally respect that we might have a difference of opinion.
