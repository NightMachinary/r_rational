I'm pretty much done with expanding this argument, but I'm going to address your first paragraph:

#+begin_quote
  Not really? Again, the Pilgrim just says that Cat will return at the darkest hour. Not that everything else is pointless before that.
#+end_quote

Pilgrim & Saint recognized the potential story, but did not accept that it was actually playing out (they didn't do shit to act against it), because they only saw Cat as a villain. The story was in place, barring interference with the story, it WILL happen. That is what this world's logic is built on, that is Creational Logic. The cause and effect here is an object put into motion staying in motion and reaching its inevitable conclusion.

If we swapped Pilgrim and Black here, what do you think Black would have done? He would have recognized the story being put into play, and avoided it -- potentially by negotiating a 'favorable' outcome before Cat had a chance to swoop in and inevitably defeat him.

The Grey Pilgrim was 1) Wrong, and 2) Full of himself to believe Cat couldn't pull a Heroic role.

#+begin_quote
  Pilgrim can see the future.
#+end_quote

He does not have a precog class, that the Pilgrim or any other non-Precog classed hero can see the future was never established. The closest claim you can make is that Heroes can feel the shape of stories, or have selective clairvoyance due to the heavens or Bard positioning them.

I'm sorry to say that you can have the last word. I'm out of steam. Perhaps we can agree that it would be good to see the Author up the ante in such a way that Heroes are actually a threat.
