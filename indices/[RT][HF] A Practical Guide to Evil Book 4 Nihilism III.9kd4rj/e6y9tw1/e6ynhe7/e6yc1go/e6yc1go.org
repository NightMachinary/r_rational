This is Cordelia's pivot I think. She has so far been very much a "down to earth" sort of ruler, her thoughts and perspective all guided by her love for her people and the desire to keep the principate intact.

And now she comes across a greater power that threatens to undo all of that. A power that she thought she was on the side of.

Now she will have to decide which side she prefers, from the perspective of gods rather than men.
