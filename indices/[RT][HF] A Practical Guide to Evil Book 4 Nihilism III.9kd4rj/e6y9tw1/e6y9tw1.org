Hey, what do you know? Cat was right - the Saint really is Ranger with a coat of paint and a socially acceptable pretext for murder. Don't like Procer? Stab it! Kind of funny that she doesn't seem to accept that every institution goes the way of Procer though. Praesi are a pack of ravening lunatics, but at least they're honest about being a pack of ravening lunatics. Proceran's seem to think that they can't possibly be in the wrong. Heaven Is On Their Side! Cordelia herself rambles on the topic of Procer's history and it's about as bad as it is now.

Really helps to drive home the view of the heavens and Saint though - this nation didn't work? Hey, let's burn it and try the same thing again!
