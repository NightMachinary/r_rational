I'm not going to defend the Angel arc any further than I have. It needs Author intervention.

#+begin_quote
  I'm going to be pedantic and point out that the quote doesn't actually say that. What they say is that Cat will (possibly) awake before anything is resolved.
#+end_quote

No, the quote does not actually say that, but that was the only outcome of the Story that Creation picked up. And I'm not arguing "That was the only way it could have happened because it happened." I'm arguing that the Story of /Hero Awakes At Last Moment To Save The Day/ was set in place after Cat didn't die from Fae-Gate-Recoil and the Creational Logic of that story dictated that nothing could be /resolved/ until Cat awoke. Could the heroes have flipped the story? Theoretically, but Pilgrim & Saint seemed skeptical that Cat could pull a heroic role and did not try to change anything.

#+begin_quote
  Well, I'll point out that Akua didn't have much trouble benefiting from all this
#+end_quote

My interpretation of this is that Akua benefited from Cat's heroic Role for the same reason that she was bound to Cat's oaths and couldn't kill Masego.

#+begin_quote
  heroes succeeding at stuff, but I don't think they actually do work as that
#+end_quote

Heroes are guaranteed wins. Those 'counted' and then played into the meta-story of villains flipping stories to eek out victory. This is short run vs. long run. Pilgrim won the fight, but 'lost' the battle. That's Cat and Black's game.

Tyrant of Helike on the other hand? Not sure why he gets to be special. My pet theory is that the Bard is not Neutral, and is in fact working against her purpose to destabilize the world.
