The Angel arc used its own logic to win. I don't know why the bard thought what she thought, but at least in-universe the outcome is 'logical' for the characters and is consistent in that sense. Maybe it went over my head, or maybe it was just silly. I'm happy enough to ignore than inconsistency so long as the author doesn't try it again.

  You get the same issue with the Battle of the Camps - the Pilgrim takes out Cat and Masgeo, but nothing happens due to this that really has any lasting impact.

Because the shape of that story was /Hero Awakes At Last Moment To Save The Day/. Logically, in PGtE universe, *nothing could be resolved until Cat awoke*. The Pilgrim and the Saint even commented on it:

  then heroes don't have the monopoly that Black's so obsessed with.
#+end_quote

Black spent a good portion of the last 20 years snuffing heroes in the crib while trying to 'turn' a heroic story, and Cat was the culmination of that. She wasn't supposed to be Evil. She chose to be.

Black, himself, has never been shown or hinted at having ever been able to step into a heroic role.

So I'd argue Heroes in-universe do have a monopoly on heroic roles, but Black created an exception.

  what is it that makes heroes especially dangerous again?
#+end_quote

I agree with you here. Up to this point in the story Cat's a bit of a Mary Sue, the horrors aren't that horrible in context, the villains don't fail, and nobody important dies (except Captain.) The only evidence of 'creational logic dictates Good will win in the end' we have is the fact that every character in-universe takes this as fact. We haven't actually witnessed it.

That said, the author has been improving, and we might see these problems fleshed out.

The Battle of the Camps was more palatable than Arcadia, and Arcadia was more palatable than the Angel arc.
