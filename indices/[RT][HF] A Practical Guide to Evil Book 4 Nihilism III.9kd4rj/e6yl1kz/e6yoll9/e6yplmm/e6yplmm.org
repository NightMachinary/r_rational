No, it says it works that way. It literally never does. Here, I'll make my prediction for the dead king invasion. arc outright:

no good charachter gets a deus ex machina powerup or otherwise becomes a serious threat onscreen.

heroes and Procer continue to be toothless unless they're offscreen.

Narrative still doesn't matter unless black or cat or bard or /maybe/ a new charachter introduced who follows along those lines wants to exploit it without setup via poorly defined means.
