Exactly. The Dead King has been at this long enough that he knows exactly how hard to push before Good jumps in with a massive Deus Ex. It's how he became King in the flashbacks--he made very slow and subtle moves and played the long game until he was the only choice left rather than try to lead an uprising or to do some politicking to gain the position over his oppositions.

That doesn't mean this latest invasion will be successful--they haven't been so far--but it does mean that he won't push hard enough for Good to somehow emerge stronger and better than before. He'll push until the State collapses and idiots like the Saint of Swords are left in charge, then probably retreat and let them turn to infighting and internal purges that, maybe, will lead to people like Cordelia switching Sides.
