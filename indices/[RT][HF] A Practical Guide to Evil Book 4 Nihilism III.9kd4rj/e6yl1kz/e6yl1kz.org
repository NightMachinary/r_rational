So uh, Procer's fucked, right?

They've got to fight the Dead King, who has, amongst other advantages, dozens upon dozens of Named (which include some of the most powerful beings to have ever turned up in the story), millions of foot soldiers, and the general raising-the-dead issue that the Hidden Horror brings with him. Then they have the Woe to deal with, who a dozen heroes couldn't deal with and now are probably going to have the Drow with them when they next turn up to fight. Then there's Black, who's been pretty damn successful in tearing up Procer without any supply lines, reinforcements, or basic logistical support on any level. Praes and the Warlock are getting ready to smash Ashur. And then the Tyrant of Helike is doing his thing (which is always quite fun).

By all accounts Procer would feel threatened by any one of these things, let alone all of them. Looking at [[https://ibb.co/b9DLMF][the map]], they've got enemies in just about every direction they /can/ have enemies.

On top of this that the Dwarves are poised to stop selling them cheap armaments. They're running out of soldiers to the point that they're throwing out farmers en masse, leadership is being questioned and their alliance is splintering.

The Crusade has failed to win a battle even before things got turned up to eleven. Now? I don't think there's been any evidence in the story that Heroic Stories can really save the day here. Hell, haven't the heroes /lost/ every battle they've been in, bar that off-screen one with the demon of absence and the Champion killing the Captain (with the Bard's assistance)?
