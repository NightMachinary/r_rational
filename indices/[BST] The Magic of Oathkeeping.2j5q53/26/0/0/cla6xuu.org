  I assume that promises describing individual actions like 'I will break this oath' or 'I will pay my debts' or 'I will kill my boss if it's the last thing I do' simply don't take hold as Oaths.

No, I'm pretty sure they do. They don't have enough time to give you power, but they count for the purposes of Oathbreaking. (So, an excellent commitment/enforcement mechanism.)
