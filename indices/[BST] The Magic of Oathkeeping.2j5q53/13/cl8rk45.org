  Using a simple ritual, you can make an Oath. Anyone can do this, though it's usually done as a declaration in a public space.

Why? Most people don't announce their car loans in the public square; they gain that risk and financial instrument in private, then usually never talk about it even with friends. Unless they are a jerk with a new Caddy, of course.

  You can't fake making an Oath.

From an informational standpoint, this need a LOT of explaining. Does that mean that everyone can interrogate the current oaths and their wordings from everyone at all times? Everyone they can see? Are they in a book that is somehow mystically unhackable?

Does this mean you can't fake it, as in "Psych! Not really an oath!" even though you did and said everything "correctly"?

Do drunk people witnessing an oath become sober enough to judge its validity? Do the blind or deaf get an "oath sense" to tell it was done right? Is it impossible to brainwash someone into thinking they saw an oath take place?

You already suggest testing people's oath abilities, so this doesn't seem to be the case. I don't think you can simply declare this without lots of explanation, especially if it drives plot.

  You can't accidentally make an Oath.
#+end_quote

Can you make an oath while impaired? Why would any oath taker drink or take drugs, then? Can you take an oath that doesn't mean what you think it means? What if you don't understand the language under which you take an oath? What if you misunderstood a word you used in the oath, which you later looked up?

  Oaths are mediated by your internal mental state. The Oath is only kept insofar as you believe that you have kept it.
#+end_quote

What if you have a bad memory, and can't remember the exact wording? What if you have degenerative brain damage, and can't store anything but short-term and medium term memories? Seems problematic.

Maybe emphasize the need to focus on the oath to engage the ability?
