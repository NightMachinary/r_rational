  If no one saw you make your Oath, then they have no way to confirm it aside from having you make the Oath a second time in front of them (since duplicate Oaths have no effect).

As a bystander, how would I disambiguate between a duplicate Oath and an insincerely made one? It seems like both would have no effect.
