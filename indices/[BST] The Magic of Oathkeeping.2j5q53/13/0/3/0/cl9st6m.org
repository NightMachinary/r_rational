That led me to do some reading. The study is about /identity/ - that is, people tell other people about what they're going to do because they want to be the kind of person that would do that thing. Telling people satisfies that need for identity, at least partially, and that in turn makes them less likely to actually do the thing.

But I don't really think that's the full story. I mean, if we looked at recidivism rates for people with and without community support, I would suspect that we'd find those rates to be higher without support. If the public pledges were structured more like "I have made this pledge, help me to keep it" I wonder whether you would see the same problem.

But in any case, it may be that they /believe/ people will keep their pledges better if they declare them out loud, even if they are (counter-intuitively) wrong.
