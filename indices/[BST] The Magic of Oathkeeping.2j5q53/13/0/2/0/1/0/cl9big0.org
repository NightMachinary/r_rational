People like doing things that they're not supposed to do. If you put up a button that says "Do Not Push", people are going to want to press it more because they've been told not to. It's unclear to me /why/ people have this bias, but I don't think it's just about getting away with something - I think some people just have an inherent dislike of being restricted. It's like how a child will throw a tantrum when you take a toy away, even if it's not a toy he was playing with - as soon as it's pulled away, that was what he has a laser focus on.
