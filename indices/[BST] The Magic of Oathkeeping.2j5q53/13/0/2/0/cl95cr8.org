Yes, it does /somewhat/ weaken the Oath, though only to the extent that it weakens the desire to break the Oath. I more think that a public Oath would only make you more conflicted. So that if you made an Oath to not have sex, and you really wanted to have sex, knowing that you'd face public condemnation on top of losing your powers wouldn't necessarily kill your desire for sex (and in fact, might increase it because of the forbidden fruit aspect).

So yes, you can swear an Oath on those things that you can do and want to do but aren't willing to face the risks of - but for you to get much power from it, it really needs to be something that you /really/ want to do. So the average person doesn't get much from "I will not voluntarily kill", though someone with a strong bloodlust might (though again, it depends on whether that desire is soured by the consequences, or whether that's just a rational choice - the latter gaining you more power).
