What happens if you /fulfill/ an oath? I.e. "I will kill so and so" or "on the 9th of November 2015 I will donate half of my money to whichever charity gets the most upvotes"?

Also, using the same examples, how do the benefits work on oaths that you are waiting for in some way. Like, "Once a year I will cut off one of my fingers". Does this give any benefits between the cutting dates? What about before you cut off your first finger?
