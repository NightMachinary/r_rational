The words need to be spoken out loud, though if you were sufficiently skilled at vocal control you might be able to reword an Oath so that it appears you've made one Oath while in reality you've made another. Or if you have sufficient mental control, you might be able to say one thing and think you were saying another, though that's understandably pretty damned difficult. That's the sort of thing that people would watch carefully for though.
