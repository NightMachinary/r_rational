Everyone should swear an oath to live. I don't see any downside, and on the upside, anything that doesn't kill you literally makes you stronger. This oath would be especially potent for those who develop suicidal tendencies, leading to a somewhat unusual superhero demographic.

If there is a reliable way to memory charm (hypnosis?), rule 18 allows oaths to be "taken back" while still retaining benefits, making the decision to swear an oath still high-tension, but ultimately reversible.

Speaking of taking back oaths, most (if not all) oaths should have temporary escape clauses: "I swear to do X except during the time periods after I think 'disable oath X' ten times in a row and before I think 're-enable oath X' ten times in a row". Even if you plan on never breaking the oaths, there might be a case where you just have to make an exception, additional power be damned.

We might be able to munchkin using humans' irrational utility functions:

1. Our animal brains disproportionately stress out about low probability events. One might swear an oath that causes such stress knowing rationally that such occasions are unlikely. For example, oaths to:

   - Not look under the bed for inhuman monsters
   - Not resist attackers under certain conditions (the downside being that anyone who discovered those conditions would be able to attack you)
   - Never look up when crossing a street
   - "I swear that I will never accept Pascal's wager/mugging."
   - "I swear I will refrain from eating bacon for a decade if this billion side dice lands on 22".

   Of course, the stress is real, so this isn't a costless endeavor.

2. "I swear I will make the rational choices in any [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/mz/zut_allais/][Allais Paradox bets]] (which seems to bother people so much that, even understanding the paradox, they still want to defend the irrational choice) of which I am aware." Proceed to have friends engage with such bets, and be bothered by it every time.

3. Take advantage of [[http://www.moneycactus.com/hyperbolic-discounting/][hyperbolic discounting]]: "I swear I will exercise tomorrow as long as the morning coffee is worth it." The effort of exercising seems worth the coffee now, so as far as you're currently concerned, this commits you to exercising tomorrow. In reality, once tomorrow comes, the effort of exercising will no longer be worth it.

Additional munchkin ideas:

1. Open-ended oaths: "I swear I will do X eventually."

2. Oaths open to interpretation:

   - "I swear I will be open-minded"
   - "I swear I will do anything within reason concerning X"

   counting on our abilities to rationalize our choices.
