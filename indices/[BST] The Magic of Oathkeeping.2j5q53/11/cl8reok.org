  If you believe, even for the briefest moment, that you have broken your Oath, it is broken. Even if you're "wrong" about having broken your Oath.

This would render most oaths useless. Transient thoughts are common, people will likely think they broke their oath randomly. Maybe make it require people believe it is more likely than not that they've broken the oath, and require a relatively complete mental state, not a transient thought.

The way I'd game it.

Train toddlers to be strong willed. Get them to make oaths e.g. "I will not eat sugary foods." "I will not buy goods" Have watchers for them, perhaps with oaths, to physically stop them while dangling sugar or goods in front of them.

Or get the toddlers extremely drunk, make them make numerous potent oaths e.g. 'I will not walk or say zaasasauuooooosasa' 'I will not eat or say zaasasauuooooosasa' 'I will not drink anything except alcohol or say zaasasauuooooosasa' 'I will not lust after men or women or say zaasasauuooooosasa'.

When they wake up they will have forgotten their oath. Inform them of the second part of their oath so they have some desire to break their oath. Regularly give them the ability to violate their oath.
