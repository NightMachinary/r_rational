What if the desire changes? E.g. I have a crush on Alice, but I make the oath not to talk to her, which is very hard right now. A month later I am deeply in love with Beccy and do not care about Alice anymore.

Vice versa, what if desire grows over time?

I guess, benefit strength ~= desire * time since oath.

That might enable another boost, if I can increase my desire. For example, taking hormones or drugs? Might be exploited temporarily for a short-term boost.

*edit*: Wait, by (16) I cannot lose benefit strength if desire fades. After a quick desire spike and getting large benefits, it will probably stagnate for a long time. Finding the right drug means we could mostly ignore the time constraint.

1. Make an oath.
2. Take desire drug, which boosts benefits to 90% of what you will ever get.
3. Drug effect fades, but benefits stay.

The tricky part is to maintain the oath, while under drug influence. Under lab conditions this should be possible. Making the drug fade faster is a worthy research goal.

However, the internal mediation might be resistant to any drugs? We cannot be sure, though. At least, some crackpot researchers will claim to find such drugs. There could be a whole industry about (useless) benefit boosting, just like our fitness and weight-loss industries.
