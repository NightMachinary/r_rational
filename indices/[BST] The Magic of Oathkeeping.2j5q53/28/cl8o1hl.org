1. I will not travel in a vehicle.

2. I will not travel in a car.(repeat for truck, cart, vehicle, etc.$

3. I will not travel in a ford. (Repeat for all makes you can think of.)

4 I will not travel in a red car. (Blue, green, etc.)

The point I'm trying to make is that there needs to be an inclusion rule.

I will not fly. I will not grow gills. I will not use telekinesis. I have a strong desire to do these things, but no ability. But desire is enough, as you said that taking an oath to not speak when you have no tongue is a weak other. These forces can stack.
