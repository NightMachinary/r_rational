You can indeed benefit from Oaths that were once constraining and now are not - but the power only grows in proportion to how much you're actually constrained by them (per 12 and 13).

So in your example of going from one city to another and swearing your oaths, you don't actually gain any more benefit than if you just stayed in one city and kept the same Oath, or made an Oath that applied to all cities instead of just one.

Oaths never go to full strength - they keep increasing in power with time with no upper limit aside from that imposed by a death from old age. The most powerful oathkeepers are quite old.
