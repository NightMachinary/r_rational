"Get yourself addicted to some kind of drug, then make an Oath to abstain from it. The more addictive the drug, the more powerful the Oath."

How does this interact with points 11 and 12? Effects start off weak (as per 11), reach some sort of peak, and then taper off as the addiction fades (as per 12)? Or does the growth over time beat out the weakening from the decreased addiction?
