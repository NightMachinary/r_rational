For drugs, you could have a vow not to do a specific drug (caffeine, say) for more than 30 days in a row. Then do the drug heavily to build up addiction and tolerance for it the rest of the time, so the single "off" day really sucks.

One way to use it for communities would be to have every member make a standard "Good Person" oath at regular intervals. They wouldn't be guaranteed never to break it, but breaking it would reduce their ability to make and keep other oaths. Even if they aren't serious oathkeepers, it would represent a trivial inconvenience, and people who refuse to oathkeep for very long at a time would be under suspicion of being not so good people.
