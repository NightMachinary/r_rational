Social-fu and deception is now incredibly powerful. If you can make your enemies believe that they have broken an Oath, you have removed a good deal of their power.

Is there any point to making Oaths like "I will spend 1 year and 1 day, starting now, in contemplation on top of this mountain." or would the short duration preclude any benefits?

If forgetting about an Oath an effective way of never thinking that you have broken it?

As your desire/ability to break an Oath goes down, does the benefit decrease, or just stop growing?

For meta-gaming Oaths, a kingdom could get very powerful, quite quickly with this. First, restrict Oath making to serious, low risk, high reward situations to prevent people from losing power. Next, have every citizen swear an Oath to follow the laws of the land (or the Natural laws of humanity, or whatever), and have the military swear an Oath to follow the lawful orders of their commanders. Ideally, this would solve lawlessness, desertion, and insubordination.
