The kingdom could do a "follow the laws" oath at birth and arrest anyone who lost the benefits, but it looks like you covered that a bit under lie detector. Still, it would be unwieldy but it would be a great way to fight corruption or if organized very strictly could make a police state very effective.

For a police state. Measure strength. Make subject take an oath not to lie to you. Have them tell you they are and have been loyal to the glorious leader over the past X number of years. Measure strength again. Execute the disloyal subjects.

Light side version. Judge makes oath to never accept bribes. Before every session of trial, show he still has the benefit of his oath.
