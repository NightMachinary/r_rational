  Is there any point to making Oaths like "I will spend 1 year and 1 day, starting now, in contemplation on top of this mountain." or would the short duration preclude any benefits?
#+end_quote

Generally speaking, there wouldn't be a point - but it's possible that you could bind a tight enough Oath that it might actually have an effect in so short a time. Say, closing yourself into a small box, subsisting on only token food, minimal water, blinding yourself, etc., with the ability to stop and give in with only the smallest motion. (The year rule is just a lower bound - there's no watershed.)

  Is forgetting about an Oath an effective way of never thinking that you have broken it?
#+end_quote

I'm kind of on the fence about that. Needs more thought.

  As your desire/ability to break an Oath goes down, does the benefit decrease, or just stop growing?
#+end_quote

It just stops growing. Edited the OP to clarify that.

  For meta-gaming Oaths, a kingdom could get very powerful, quite quickly with this. First, restrict Oath making to serious, low risk, high reward situations to prevent people from losing power. Next, have every citizen swear an Oath to follow the laws of the land (or the Natural laws of humanity, or whatever), and have the military swear an Oath to follow the lawful orders of their commanders. Ideally, this would solve lawlessness, desertion, and insubordination.

You only get a benefit if you actively want to break the Oath, which means that lawful people wouldn't gain any benefit, which also means that there'd be no way to test between those who have broken the Oath and those who had no desire to do so. You would have to engineer another Oath that gives people some benefit, which means forcing them to do (or not do) something that they don't want to, which seems like a good way to start a revolution.
