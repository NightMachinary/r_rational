Hmm, how are you measuring "desire"? It it gross (in a financial sense) desire? Could you make an oath to not punch annoying people in the face, not follow through on your intrusive thoughts, not chew your fingernails, and/or other things like that? If those Oaths would work well, it would be a relatively painless source of power.

Or is it net desire, and the Oath has to be the actual deciding factor in your choice, which may make drug addiction a questionably effective tactic.
