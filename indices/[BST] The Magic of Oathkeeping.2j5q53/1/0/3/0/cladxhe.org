  For example, of the oath is no longer breakable, the power lasts forever?

  So a child might go with 'Will not have sex before I am 20' oath; might be hard to keep for a while, but once they are 20, if they have not yet broken it, it becomes impossible to break, supposing they cannot get any younger.

Yes, that is correct - and fairly common. Though the setting is quasi-medieval, so 20 would probably be a little bit old.
