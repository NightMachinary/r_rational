It originally started with the monasteries, where they were making oaths for other (religious) reasons without the expectation of benefits. For a time, it seemed as though the oathkeepers were just being rewarded for being especially devout, but eventually a proto-scientist who worked for the king made oaths of his own in a series of experiments that lasted most of his lifetime - which is where the people of the setting gained most of their knowledge. Oathkeeping is still quasi-religious in nature from a social standpoint, though belief in the gods has fallen out of favor.
