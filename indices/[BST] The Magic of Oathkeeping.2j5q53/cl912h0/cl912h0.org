  If you believe, even for the briefest moment, that you have broken your Oath, it is broken. Even if you're "wrong" about having broken your Oath.

Straight away this tells me that reality is going to be far more thoughtful than ours, people are less likely to jump to conclusion because they have internal controls on instantly believing something without fact checking.

Instead of, I believe I've broken my oath because this guy tells me something. It will be, "Oh I might have broken my oath, let's find out more"

. 11. and 12. seem counter to each other . The more benefits from not doing something the less likely you'll want to do it, so you should see yourself getting less power over time because your incentives to not do it rise, but then they fall because they rise.

Considering the number of oaths people see you will see people getting drunk, etc, very very little because it's just not worth the risk. As well if you are saying that oaths cannot decrease then you can spend some of your time doing very high risky stuff, when you're in a really good mood and think you'll be able to not do it, like I don't know, and the rest of the time it'll not increase since you're miles away from it but you can just keep it going higher and higher.
