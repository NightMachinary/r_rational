  The more benefits from not doing something the less likely you'll want to do it, so you should see yourself getting less power over time because your incentives to not do it rise, but then they fall because they rise.

The way I would model it, desire doesn't decrease, it's just that the counterbalancing force increases. If you make an Oath to eat nothing but gruel, you might still want a juicy steak as much in year 20 as in year 1, but there would be more of an incentive not to eat it.
