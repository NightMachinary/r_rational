I think that depends strongly on how social institutions view/punish forcing Oaths. You can get 20 years in jail for stealing a crappy car valued at a few thousand dollars, but people regularly go completely unpunished for filching multiple millions of dollars. If forcing a truth-only Oath isn't punished as harshly as torturing information out of someone, I know what powers I won't be cultivating as long as I want to retain my ability to deceive someone.
