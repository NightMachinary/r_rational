The extreme use cases are not the interesting ones, the thing you have to consider is how /everyone/ would attempt to use it, and the social implications over time.

Everyone has aspirations, plans and long term goals, great and small, many of which are such that you do not anticipate deviating from them ever being a good idea. So making oaths about such things is a freebie. These are temptations you are going to be fighting anyway? Make it an oath.

So standard oaths would be things like fidelity, faithfully executing an office, studying diligently..

Not extreme or complicated wows, but formal and public commitments to the basic norms of a community. Which will have social effects - I guarantee that almost everyone will be extremely reluctant to make any wow which hasn't stood up to the test of "most people manage to keep this one", because an unblemished record in this regard is going to be the definition of being a respectable citizen.

There would quickly arise standard formulations for the most common ones, which would be carefully worded to avoid both the possibility of sabotage causing you to violate them, and to render void the possibility of playing games with them (to boost the power gain)

Thus, a standard oath of honesty would not be to speak the truth - that's just begging some smartass to fuck with it, but simply

"I will not speak with the intent to deceive or mislead".

That preserves your ability to tell stories - that are clearly stories - keeps the option of keeping your gob shut under duress, but forces honesty, so it is a significant wow.

And in a relatively short time you end up with all positions of authority being filled with people who have kept wows like that one and other obvious markers of good citizenship for a span long enough to have easily verifiable effects.
