Oh, I get what you mean - no, you don't get to choose the benefits. Strength and speed are considered the mainstays, in that it's somewhat surprising that you don't get them, but the other possible benefits are in no way under your control, and can be physical/mental/spiritual in nature and defying physics in their own ways. In theory, if you noticed that you were getting willpower from your Oath, you could do the recursive loop that you're talking about. I'll have to think about that.
