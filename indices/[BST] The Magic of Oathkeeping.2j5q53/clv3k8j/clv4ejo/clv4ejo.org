The big problem with Idea 1 is that rule 12 means that you have to actually want to break the Oath for it to have any effect. So if you have no desire to tell your friend about your favorite color, or about the oath to not tell him, or about the oath about the oath, it just doesn't do anything. The idea of a meta-Oath is a sound one though - I can imagine making an /Oath of Chastity/ and an /Oath of Silence About the Oath of Chastity/, and experiencing a genuine desire to break the second oath which is different from the genuine desire to break the first oath. Though I think you can avoid having to go meta by properly wording the second oath (or even just combining the two oaths into one).

Imagine a woman who's taken an Oath of Chastity, and can't actually tell people about it, and that causes all sorts of problems because she can't explain to her suitor why she's rebuffing his advances.

Idea 2 is currently canonical to the setting for the story (which I'm writing now) - you take as many Oaths as you can handle, and generally add more as time goes on, always staying at the limits of what your will can handle. I'm happy that this is an emergent property of the system that's not explicitly written into the rules.
