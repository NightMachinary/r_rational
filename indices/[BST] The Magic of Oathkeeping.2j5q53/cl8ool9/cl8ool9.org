Rule 6 is interesting in that something similar to LÃ¶b's theorem happens:

Oaths are broken only if you believe that they are broken. This means that if you interpret your oath in some particular way, you are indeed justified in this interpretation. This means that someone with sufficient dissociative ability to say one thing and mean another could appear to be making one oath and in fact be making another allowing them to bypass the lie detector test.
