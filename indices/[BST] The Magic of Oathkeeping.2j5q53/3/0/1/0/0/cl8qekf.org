Hmm, okay. So can I do something like "trials by ordeal," where I swear to undergo something very unpleasant for some set period of time, have the power of the oath grow very quickly during this period of time (because, e.g., I'd really like to stop getting tortured), then get the benefits of this oath for the rest of my life?
