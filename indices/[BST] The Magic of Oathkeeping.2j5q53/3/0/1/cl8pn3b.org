I think your edit 16 was meant to fix this, but it creates at least as many problems as it solves. The basic issue is that I can benefit from oaths that were once very constraining but now are not constraining at all.

Example: while in city A, I swear never to [insert hard thing here, e.g. never buying food in city A]. I suffer for whatever period of time is required to get the oath to full strength. Then I go to city B and repeat the same process. (Note that these are not duplicate oaths, so 17 has no bearing). Then City C, etc.

Possible fixes: -Modify or elaborate on 14 to say that benefits don't stack linearly. -Change 16 back to how it was. (This seems more attractive to me, but that's because I don't know /why/ it's important for you that the benefits of oaths are never lost).
