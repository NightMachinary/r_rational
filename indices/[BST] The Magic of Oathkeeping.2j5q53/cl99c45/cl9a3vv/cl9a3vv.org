  What about Oaths that are time-limited in some way? The seven-year vow of silence is a classic - would the Oath become impossible to violate after seven years, or lose effectiveness after seven years? Or perhaps something else?
#+end_quote

It would become impossible to violate, and you'd keep any benefits you'd accumulated (though you wouldn't gain new ones).

  Are Oaths primarily external, or internal? If I feed a teetotal food laced with wine, and then inform them, will their Oath break because they (believe that they) broke it, or remain intact because they only swore to abstain from drink, not prevent anyone else from trapping their food? [If this depends on the Oath, then everyone will go with the latter, I imagine.]
#+end_quote

Pretty much everyone takes the latter form of the Oath.

  Life hack: swear not to follow desires that you don't endorse. Hmm ... this system is nice to, for example, pedophiles. I think. Unless that's analogous to the cutting-out-your-tongue example? Make psychopaths swear an Oath to behave ethically (as part of the justice system?) IIUC, psychopaths have no problem telling when an action is "immoral", they just don't care. Actually, you should also be able to make criminals swear not to break the law, since they've proven they want to. (Then enlist these guys in your army/police force, under an oath of obedience.)
#+end_quote

Yup, that works. As you might imagine, some of the most powerful oathkeepers are not neurotypical.

  I get the impression that the "extra" powers tend to be, in Worm parlance, thinker and master powers - that is, the best kind of power for a munchkin. Torture. Torture can produce desires so strong that they demonstrably override all other desires. There's definitely a way to use this.
#+end_quote

Yup. And in fact, some of the most powerful Oaths are tantamount to torture in one way or another.

    The benefits get stronger with the ability to break the Oath. Making an Oath not to speak and then ripping out your tongue results in far, far weaker benefits than being able to speak and choosing not to.
  #+end_quote

  So ... a vow not to do something you're physically incapable of doing still produces results?
#+end_quote

The more I look at it, the more that's a terrible example. You can still speak without your tongue, you just lose the majority of the ability (see [[http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Popular_Science_Monthly/Volume_3/September_1873/Tongueless_Speech][tongueless speech]]). Here's a better example, which I replace that one with - you make an Oath to never use your right hand, then chop your right hand off, which results in no effect.
