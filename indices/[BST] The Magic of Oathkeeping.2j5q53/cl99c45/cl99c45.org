What about Oaths that are time-limited in some way? The seven-year vow of silence is a classic - would the Oath become impossible to violate after seven years, or lose effectiveness after seven years? Or perhaps something else?

Are Oaths primarily external, or internal? If I feed a teetotal food laced with wine, and then inform them, will their Oath break because they (believe that they) broke it, or remain intact because they only swore to /abstain/ from drink, not prevent anyone else from trapping their food? [If this depends on the Oath, then everyone will go with the latter, I imagine.]

Life hack: swear not to follow desires that you don't endorse.

Hmm ... this system is nice to, for example, pedophiles. I think. Unless that's analogous to the cutting-out-your-tongue example?

Make psychopaths swear an Oath to behave ethically (as part of the justice system?) IIUC, psychopaths have no problem telling when an action is "immoral", they just don't care. Actually, you should also be able to make criminals swear not to break the law, since they've proven they want to. (Then enlist these guys in your army/police force, under an oath of obedience.)

I get the impression that the "extra" powers tend to be, in Worm parlance, thinker and master powers - that is, the best kind of power for a munchkin.

Torture. Torture can produce desires so strong that they demonstrably override all other desires. There's definitely a way to use this.

  The benefits get stronger with the ability to break the Oath. Making an Oath not to speak and then ripping out your tongue results in far, far weaker benefits than being able to speak and choosing not to.

So ... a vow not to do something you're physically incapable of doing still produces results?
