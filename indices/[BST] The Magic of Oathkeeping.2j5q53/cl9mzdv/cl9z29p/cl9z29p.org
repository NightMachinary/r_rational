Hmm. If this Oath is unbreakable, you'd get no benefit per rule 13 above. But if its nature caused it to automatically break, you'd break your other Oaths per rule 8. Making this Oath both breaks *and* maintains your other Oaths.

More importantly, however, I assume that promises describing individual actions like 'I will break this oath' or 'I will pay my debts' or 'I will kill my boss if it's the last thing I do' simply don't take hold as Oaths. You probably can't make retroactive Oaths ('It wasn't me, I swear!') or vicarious ones ('He'll be good, I promise.') either.
