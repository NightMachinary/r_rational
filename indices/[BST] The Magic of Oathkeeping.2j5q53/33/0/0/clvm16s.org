I don't know about other people, but I'd be tempted to break any oath due to pure masoshism. Thus any oath I'd make would have some want mass, and if you would just stack enough of them you could probably get some pretty hefty benefits.

But can you choose the benefit of your Oath? The precondition of Idea 2 is that the benefit would be additional willpower. Since the benefit increases over time, while want mass doesn't, you would gain a net increase to your ability to keep your Oaths. Patience rewards you with exponentially increasing avalible want mass, in this scenario.
