Idea 1 - Meta Oaths: Step 1. Make an Oath to not tell your friend about your favorite color. Step 2. Check if Oath_counter is set to an arbitrarily large number. If it is, jump to Step 6. Step 3. Make an Oath to not tell your friend about previous oath. Step 4. Add 1 to Oath_counter. Step 5. Go back to Step 2. Step 6. Receive huge benefits.

I guess you could say that the oaths are about the same thing, but I bet a lot of people would disagree. In either case the point is to be able to make new Oaths that depend on pretty much the same want mass. There are probably more elegant ways to do this though.

Idea 2 - Willpower Benefits. Step 1. Make an Oath with want mass proportional to what you can handle, in order to increase your resilience to giving in to your wants. Step 2. Wait for the benefit to grow over time. Step 3. Go back to Step 2.

Additionally you could throw in the occasional Oath to increase your want to break your oaths instead of making new ones. Could be combined with Idea 1.

In general, the most important stat looks to be Willpower.
