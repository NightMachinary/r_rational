The first case was intended but not explicit - I'll add that in.

In the second case ... I suppose that I should just reduce that to "no effect at all". If you're physically incapable of doing something, you shouldn't get anything out of saying that you won't do it. Though I guess you could still make those oaths - you just wouldn't gain an appreciable benefit from it.
