Suppose we have someone who wants to be either a firefighter or a soldier. If they swear an oath against being a soldier, then they will gain benefits to being a firefighter. So as a matter of policy, people should be encouraged to strongly desire to do multiple things with their life, then swear an oath to do just one.
