It's possible - you're essentially trading a bit of your happiness for a bit of power. And it is somewhat common among the oathkeepers to enhance their desires in various ways. For example, if you've taken the Chastity Oath you might go to a brothel every week or so and lay naked next to a beautiful woman in order to increase the temptation to break the Oath (or better, find a woman who's made the same Oath and lay with her for mutual benefit).
