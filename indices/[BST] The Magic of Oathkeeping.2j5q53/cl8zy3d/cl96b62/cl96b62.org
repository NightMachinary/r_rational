You can certainly make "no downside" oaths, and many people do, but the benefits are usually negligible enough that there's not much of a point. And yes, someone with suicidal tendencies would be able to leverage that for some benefit.

There is a form of mental magic, but it's very difficult and very imperfect. But if you could find a sufficiently skilled mentalist, and wanted to consent to having her poke around in your mindscape, she might be able to remove the memory of the oath and make your existing benefits permanent.

You can definitely hack oathkeeping by exploiting irrationality. The Oaths work better if they're big and powerful, but you could make little Oaths about trivial-but-still-stressful things and gain /some/ power. The key here is that you would want to stay irrational so that there's still that desire there.
