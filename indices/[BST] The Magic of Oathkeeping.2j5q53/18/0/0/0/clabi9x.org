There are definitely some evil applications, though they are /somewhat/ limited by the fact that the ability to betray the oath is a requirement for gaining power. And giving power to someone you've mistreated has its own pitfalls, though you can mitigate some of that by making them swear an oath never to betray you (though I guess they'd still be able to betray you by breaking their oaths and depriving you of their abilities).

(There aren't really evil empires - just different structures for different societies, some of which are more just than others, and all of which have their own complexities. One of the things that Brandon Sanderson does that I really like is to take the same magic system and put different flavors on it, which is part of what I'm trying to do.)

I do need to work out the equation. I think there have got to be some exponents in there somewhere, if only small ones. And "chance of success" is a really sticky thing, since it's also mediated internally.
