OK, depending on how the math works, it /should/ be possible to "charge" someone using really really intense torture - without making it easy enough for them to stop it that they'll just, y'know, immediately stop it. Not a good idea, perhaps, but possible (you mentioned an Evil Empire?)

I /think/. Depends on how magic interprets "you have to be *able* to break your oath".

Is it a straight [time x desire x % chance of success] equation to determine the benefit of not doing something?
