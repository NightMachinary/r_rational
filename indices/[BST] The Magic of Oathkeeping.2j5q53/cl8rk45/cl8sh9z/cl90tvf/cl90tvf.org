  People declare in public mostly for social reasons. It's the same reason that people declare that they're going on a diet, or declare that they've stopped smoking. The social pressure when everyone knows that you've made a promise helps you to keep that promise you've made to yourself (or because you're proud of doing this thing).

Wouldn't making the Oath in public make you want to break it less (because of the shame it would carry) thus make the benefits weaker?

Like wouldn't "I will never willingly eat any food containing more than 10% sugar" be a weaker Oath for someone suffering diabetes than for someone completely healthy?

Because otherwise you would just swear Oaths on anything you /can/ and /want/ to do, but weren't willing to face the risks anyway.
