Well, you could do a bunch of oaths for all the things you find morally wrong. They wouldn't give /much/ power, but haven't we all thought about committing one wrong or another from time to time? For instance a no stealing oath would probably strengthen me whenever I go shopping because even though I've never stolen I always think about how easy it would be and look out for security cameras

Something else. If you manage to forget an oath and still stop yourself from doing it then the power would again be slightly stronger, no? Because before forgetting you don't /want/ to break the oath just for it being an oath. Risky though, because after forgetting nothing is really stopping you from just going through with that immoral thing just this once.
