People declare in public mostly for social reasons. It's the same reason that people declare that they're going on a diet, or declare that they've stopped smoking. The social pressure when everyone knows that you've made a promise helps you to keep that promise you've made to yourself (or because you're proud of doing this thing). Making an Oath has more in common with swearing in a politician or granting someone citizenship than it does with buying a car.

--------------

The intent was that /if someone sees you make the Oath/ then they know that it's a true Oath. I will add that clause. There's some small unfakeable display, like your eyes are momentarily limned with light. If no one saw you make your Oath, then they have no way to confirm it aside from having you make the Oath a second time in front of them (since duplicate Oaths have no effect).

--------------

You can make an Oath while impaired - and yes, that makes drinking or doing drugs a bad idea. An Oath that you don't understand ... probably has no effect, if it's all mediated by your internal mental state.

--------------

Alright, the patch that I think would work is that an Oath only works to the extent that you know that you have made an Oath, and know that you are avoiding something because of the Oath. So if you made an Oath and immediately had your memory erased, you wouldn't gain any power from it, but if you had kept your Oaths for decades and had your memory wiped, you'd still retain your power (though it wouldn't grow).
