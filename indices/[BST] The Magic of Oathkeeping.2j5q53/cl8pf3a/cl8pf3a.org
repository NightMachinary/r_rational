Not sure whether this is munchkinism or working as intended. But this setup creates a very strong incentive for people to trade portions of their utility function.

Example: Alice takes an oath not to personally work to benefit Cause A (which she supports). Bob takes an oath not to personally work to benefit cause B (which he supports). Alice and Bob then agree (but don't take oaths) to work to benefit causes B and A, respectively. Now both A and B are benefited, and Alice and Bob both benefit personally because of the oaths themselves. Assuming Alice values A roughly as much as Bob values B, this is stable against betrayal: if Bob stops working to support A, Alice stops working to support B.

This example generalizes in many ways. A few examples:

- People agree to take care of each other's children (and swear not to take care of their own). Scale this up to an entire village/town/etc. providing childcare in this way.

- There's an incentive to solve large problems via specialization. E.g. if a town has two doctors, it makes sense for one to commit to taking care of men and one to commit to taking care of women (i.e. one swears not to take care of women, the other not to take care of men, respectively) as long as the benefits of the oaths outweigh the lost efficiency from forgone coordination. This scales even better when things are non-binary (I only take care of people ages 20-30, i.e. I swear not to take care of people from 0-10 and 10-20 and 30-40 and ...) or when multiple binary divisions apply (I take care of male children, i.e. I swear not to take care of women or adults). (EDIT: It's possible that your edit 17 applies here, but it definitely doesn't work as per your example. Bread is a subset of grains, but these categories overlap without being contained in each other.)
