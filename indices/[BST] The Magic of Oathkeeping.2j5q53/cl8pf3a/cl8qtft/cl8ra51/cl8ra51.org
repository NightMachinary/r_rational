But the point here is that you're /not/ removing the incentive to break the oath. All things being equal, Alice /would/ prefer to break the oath and work to benefit cause A. She still supports it, i.e. it still contributes to her utility function. But she chooses not to break it because she knows doing so would ultimately have negative (or at least neutral) consequences. That's no different that the usual situation of "choosing not to break my oath despite wanting to do so" which is what everyone with an even moderately powerful oath experiences regularly.
