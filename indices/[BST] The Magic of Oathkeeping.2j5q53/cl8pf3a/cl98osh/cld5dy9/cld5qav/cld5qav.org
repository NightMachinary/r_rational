It depends on whether there's an actual cost involved. If two people with equal skill and equal values are both serving half of the community, there wouldn't be any real cost to them, and thus no incentives or desire to break the oath. If there was a single doctor who wanted to help people and took an oath to only help men, then I would expect for him to get some power from that oath as he watched the women in his village die during childbirth or succumb to infections he could have prevented.
