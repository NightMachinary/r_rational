  People agree to take care of each other's children (and swear not to take care of their own). Scale this up to an entire village/town/etc. providing childcare in this way.

This would work.

I'm less certain that having doctors specialize by gender (or age) would, since it depends on what they want. If they just "want to help people" it wouldn't work, since they're satisfying that desire. However, if you had a doctor that wanted to work on women and a doctor that wanted to work on men, they could swap and get some power from it.
