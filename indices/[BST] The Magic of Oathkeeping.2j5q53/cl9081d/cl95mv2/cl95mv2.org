There's no minimum age. And yes, it's part of the world-building that monasteries exist which take in young children (the Foresworn Sisters for women and the High Rectory for men) and +make+ encourage them to swear Oaths. Though since someone who doesn't want to be an oathkeeper can simply break their Oath, the high pressure aspect of it doesn't work as well as it might. Think of the virginity pledges and anti-drug pledges that kids in the real world sign today, and how often those are broken - it would be less with some concrete benefit, but I have to imagine that a lot of the kids would just wash out, especially because for an oath to have any power it has to actually restrict you in some way that's meaningful to you.
