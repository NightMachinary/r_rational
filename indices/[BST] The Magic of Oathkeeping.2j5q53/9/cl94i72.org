Unless the benefits are something other than strength, speed, and durability, this power isn't actually that useful, with all these downsides.

Especially with

That.

You just kidnap their children and force them to make and break an oath to let them live. Repeat with literally anything else they have. If they rely on their powers, you are much better off not using oaths at all, but in paying people a lot to serve you who DO take oaths, one of which is 'unless you intend to betray me' except lawyered to the maximum.

I suspect you would get standard form oaths for employment and such after a time, but with one oath breaking breaking all others, and it taking literally years to fix, this is not actually that useful. Anyone who gets too far ahead of the pack will be brought back down by concerted effort - strength speed and endurance are not hackable enough to give you an unassailable position, especially when they are available to everyone.
