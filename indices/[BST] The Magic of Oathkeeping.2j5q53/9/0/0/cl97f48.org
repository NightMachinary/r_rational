I've made a similar argument against concealed carry. It is /situationally/ useful, yes, but on a grand scale it doesn't actually protect you in the situations you theoretically used to justify its existence. To use that example, having a hidden gun doesn't help you deal with someone who is robbing you and has a drawn weapon pointed directly at you in any real life situation. The only possible use would be to shoot the person as they flee with your things, which does not fall under self defense and would be murder.

  Or perhaps you're saying that losing your Oath makes it harder to retaliate when you have your children back (assuming that your enemy didn't just kill them once he got what he wanted)?

Something like that. The thing is, assuming you survive, it is very easy to get a new gun. Getting a new oath to the same strength level might be literally impossible in the time you have left - break an oath that has been gathering for thirty years, you are over 50.

If you relied on oath power to get into a position of high political or other social power you are actually /inherently weaker/ than a person who got into a similar or even lower position without using oaths directly.

For a better example, think of a politician who got into a position of power by performing one evil act which they must hide, because if it got out it would destroy them. While it is not evil persay, power through an oath is similar except /everyone knows you have a secret and in most cases even knows what it is and how to use it to harm you/.

You have contingent power and the fact that you have it, and that most oaths are public knowledge means that you aren't just leaving the source of your power around where anyone can find it, you are Achilles living in an empire of heel-seeking arrows.

Anyone who steps too far out of line, who uses oath power to gain temporal power merely because they are stronger/faster/ more enduring than others would be taken down by someone who is smarter, or more cunning, or more ruthless or any combination of all three.

And the way oaths /work/ ensures this is much easier than recovering from it is, meaning it will happen pretty much universally to anyone with actually intelligent enemies.

Kings would be people with powerful oath-using knights, who do not rely on oaths themselves. The strongest oath users would likely be 70+ year old monks, who neither have nor look for temporal power, and thus haven't attracted intelligent enemies.
