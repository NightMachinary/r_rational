Well, it's still an interesting concept. It's great worldbuilding, but I'm struggling to see how you could write an informed protagonist character in it which used the rules of the world to tell a novel story without giving him a nonstandard oath power or similar.

Because aside from people occasionally having mildly superhuman bodyguards, and kung fu monks actually being a real thing, it seems like this wouldn't actually change the structure of society overmuch.
