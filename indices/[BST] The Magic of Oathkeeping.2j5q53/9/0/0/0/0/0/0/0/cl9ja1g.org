I think there are a number of ways that societies could arrange themselves, given the existence of such a magic system, and a lot of it varies with what the precise benefits are and how long it takes to accumulate them.

If it takes a year with heavy, restrictive Oaths to show any power at all (let's say, a five-percent increase in strength and speed), and five years until an outside observer would be able to measure it (in other words, to get to the point where an outside observer could be sure that the person isn't just strong, but supernaturally strong), then I think it would be much more rare as a political or commercial tool. A hypothetical trader that's spent five years under heavy restrictions might be able to sell his wares for a bit cheaper because of the lower risk associated with doing business with him, but he would in theory have to charge more to make up for the fact that he's incurred a real cost by denying himself something for so long.

It's also sort of funny that you'd argue that kings would have to have long-standing oaths, since other people in this thread are arguing that kings would have to /not/ take any oaths, because this would be equivalent to exposing their Achilles heel and giving someone a way to strike easily strike at them. Or the other people, arguing that the possibility of blackmail, drugging, or even intense debate would be enough that oathkeeping is nigh worthless.

Mostly I think you could make the argument either way. I can picture a society with two classes of people - the trusted oathkeepers and the oathless, with the oathkeepers having almost all the power and carefully wording the multiple oaths that they make every day. But I can also imagine a society where only a few people take oaths as a quasi-religious ordeal, and don't really operate on another level. Or another, where the oathkeepers are the underclass by virtue of the fact that they can be bossed around and can be kept on a chain by their oaths so long as no one pushes them too far. And all those societies could even exist under the same rules, maybe even next to each other.
