I'm not sure that I like this objection. It's like saying that having a gun is useless because someone can steal your children and force you to give up your gun. There are relatively few weapons where this isn't the case, and I think it makes a better argument for keeping your loved ones safe than for not taking and keeping an Oath. Oaths are perhaps slower and more "expensive" than guns, but I think you're pretty much screwed anyway if someone has the means and motive to kidnap your children. Or perhaps you're saying that losing your Oath makes it harder to retaliate when you have your children back (assuming that your enemy didn't just kill them once he got what he wanted)?
