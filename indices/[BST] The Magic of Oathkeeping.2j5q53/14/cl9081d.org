Is there a minimum age for oaths?

In such a society there are many factions (sports,military,etc) which would have huge incentives to take children as young as possible and put them in "monasteries" where they make all kinds of oaths, which makes them super-specialized and effective. In addition brain-washing is probably applied so they stay in their (forced) careers. Ever increasing oath-boosting, like the drug addiction you mentioned, is most certainly applied until the point where too many kids die.

Even for kids not in a monastery, there is immense pressure. As a non-oath boy you cannot really compete (for jobs,girls,grades,etc) against other kids with benefits. Even loving parents should encourage their children to make some oaths very early.
