I think it's resistance to temptation. For example, you wouldn't say that someone who doesn't like chocolate was exercising a lot of willpower by not eating any - you would only say that about someone who /really/ wants chocolate.

The most powerful oathkeepers are those people with the most powerful passions, who also have the necessary willpower to actually constrain themselves and not break. If you were focused on maximizing power, you would take oaths at or near your limits on willpower.
