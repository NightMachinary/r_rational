I believe this is exactly the situation rule #12 is designed to prevent. By trading those portions of your utility function, you are removing the incentive to break the oath, and will not gain any benefit from it.

That being said, I think the children thing could work, if it's an oath of non interaction. It would be very easy to break, being in the same community, and it would be an Oath that most parents would find hard to keep (or at least, parents with utility structures similar to ours. This doesn't work after a few generations, when you know the benefits far outweigh the costs)

Pretty much, the way I see this working as being fueled by your own misery. If you're even slightly content with what's going on, your Oathing wrong.
