    As your desire/ability to break an Oath goes down, does the benefit decrease, or just stop growing?

  It just stops growing. Edited the OP to clarify that.

That seems like a mistake.

For example, of the oath is no longer breakable, the power lasts forever?

So a child might go with 'Will not have sex before I am 20' oath; might be hard to keep for a while, but once they are 20, if they have not yet broken it, it becomes impossible to break, supposing they cannot get any younger.
