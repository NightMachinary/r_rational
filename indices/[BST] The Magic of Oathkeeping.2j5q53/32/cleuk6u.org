Reminds me of aspects of how Nen works in HunterxHunter; making restrictions and recieving proportionate power boosts. There are clear differences though.

- oaths are (must be?) publicly made, restrictions can be secret

(for an oath to work, how public must it be? being able to keep your oaths as secret as possible is very important, if you make your oath in a public space while no-one is watching, does that still count? you could conceivably make this aspect very strong, so that every oath made is logged on a public database and everyone knows what everyone else's oaths are, or you could make this much less important, and only some people have their oaths publicy known)

- nen powers are chosen by the individuals making the restriction, oath enefits are not related to the oath

- anyone can make an oath, nen powers are strongly moderated by talent and hard work

- breaking restrictions is about the actual breaking of the restriction, rather than belief in whether oaths are broken

- penalties for breaking oaths is uniform, penalty for breaking a restriction is chosen by the restriction maker and is tied into the proportionate power boost (the stronger the penalty, the stronger the power boost)

Still, the nen system was lots of fun, and this is similar enough that I'm looking forward to reading it.
