The very long term unexpected abuser of this system is...evolution! The slowest and most ruthless of munchkins is he! You will breed a population of master post-event rationalizers and double thinkers. If the benefit of the oath adds enough to fitness it would quickly get ridiculous. The oaths are in the brain, and the structure of the brain evolves.

In a few generations you'll have entire swathes of the populace with...

split personalities- (one acts while the other "keeps" the oath)

the ability to immediately retroactively justify their actions as in accordance with rules even when it doesn't match reality

extremely strong impulsive behavior paired with an equally strong ability to resist. (as long it is balanced by an equally strong will you can get more power the more intense your drives are. Basically-Vulcans from star trek. Insane when you remove the rational programming overlaid on top.)

The ability to repress memories semiconsciously. (what oath breaking?)

I would be terrified to live in a world where this oath effect had been in place long enough for evolution to have a significant influence. The populace would be utterly insane and able to violate any rule when it suited them with zero remorse. "Oh I made an oath not to kill? Well that wasn't "actually" a person, it just looked like one. Oh look, another not person over there." This system favors brains that warp their models and record of reality to match their desires.
