The strength of the oath depends on the desire, so being bisexual wouldn't have much effect on total power gained from a chastity oath unless being bisexual was associated with an increase in total sexual desire (and I have no idea whether that's the case - intuitively, I would think not).

But yes, it's fairly common to take oaths like that. But just because you don't have any power to show for it doesn't mean that you broke your oath, since it might /also/ mean that you just never had that desire in the first place (if, for example, you're asexual).
