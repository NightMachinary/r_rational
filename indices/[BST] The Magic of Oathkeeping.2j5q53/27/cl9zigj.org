So basically if as a child you take the oath to not have sex until you're 18 or something you'd become really powerful, especially towards puberty right? And if you didn't break oaths the power would be kept even after X years had passed. I suppose that'd be a frequent oath.

Also...how about a bisexual, so equally attracted to both sexes, although that can fluctuate, making an oath not to have sex with one of the sexes? I suppose you're going to say it'll be weaker than a heterosexual and/or homosexual taking the same oath for their prefered gender. But how about a bisexual taking a full chasity oath? It'll be stronger than that of a heterosexual or homosexual right?

How about we combine the two previous suggestions? A bisexual taking a full chasity oath for X amount of years? How strong would that be? Compared to the same by people attracted by one gender?

I'll suppose this is a very frequent type of oath.
