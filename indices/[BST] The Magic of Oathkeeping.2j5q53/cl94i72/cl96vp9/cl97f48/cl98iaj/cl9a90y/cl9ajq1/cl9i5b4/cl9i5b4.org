Eh, you do realize that the oaths are utterly broken as political tools. Any society of this kind ought to have older members with oaths of honesty of long standing. Never mind the direct benefits - if you are in a profession where trust is an asset, the ability to repeat the oath of non-deceptiveness and then demonstrate that you still have those benefits is ridiculously valuable. To the extent that I don't think you can stay in business as, for example, a trader, if you can't do this. Not if there are competitors who can. That creates a societal class which is implicitly trusted and incorruptible (Because becoming corrupted costs you your livelyhood nigh-instantly) I don't see how you can possibly remain a ruler for very long without belonging to that class. The only people who would remain loyal to you in any conflict are those oath bound to do so. Reciprocal oath bounds would be stable, but starting a revolt against someone oath-bound to be the best ruler he or she can manage would be.. difficult. Because revolution requires distrust of the government.
