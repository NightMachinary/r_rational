All rulers rule because they have support - if nothing else, the support of their army. Being verifiably bound to at least some preceps is a good way to get support from people who are not currently being held at swordspoint by said army, thus it makes you a stronger ruler. By a lot. As for people exploiting it.. errh, not if you pick the wows well. And there would be other examples to study, granted, the first couple of people to try this on will probably mess it up, but viewing it as a weakness? Yhea, as long as one's enemies are wasting their time on trying to outsmart "Grandma Ruth's book of standard wows that have stood the test of time" at least they arent poisoning your soup.
