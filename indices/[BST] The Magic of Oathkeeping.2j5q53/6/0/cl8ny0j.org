That's true. I am mostly thinking that social conventions are in place to prevent Oaths from being forced - there exist major institutions which are dedicated to oathkeeping, and which have a considerable amount of power (and work to prevent external abuses against oathkeepers). But yes, it is something of a liability if you are public about it and there are people in a position of extreme power who can use force against you (though if you're in that position already, you've got other problems).

And you could also just give up your accumulated power to break the "slave obedience" oath, so there'd be strong pressure on your "captor" to not push you too hard.
