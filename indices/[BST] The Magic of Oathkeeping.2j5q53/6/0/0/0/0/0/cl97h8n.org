It would be in your own best interest under duress to bypass any countermeasures you set up and can bypass. If you set up a countermeasure like "I will not make any oath under duress.", that amounts to choosing to oath "1=0" once you are under duress.

Edit: You might be about to question why they would capture you for duressing if you made that countermeasure public. Their reason would be a TDT-like incentive for you to not make such countermeasures: If you precommit to take the lossy way out of a torture session, you'll have to actually follow through on that.
