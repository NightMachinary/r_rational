If you don't use this countermeasure this and they "force" you to make an oath via "Either you make an oath that takes away your ability to lie to us or we torture you for an hour and then ask you again", you either oath the equivalent of "1=0" or you break at some point and comply. If you use this countermeasure, in the same situation you either again relinquish your oath benefits or you comply and insert your secret condition. Therefore, that countermeasure is useless.
