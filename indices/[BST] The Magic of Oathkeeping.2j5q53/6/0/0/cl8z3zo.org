There's a simple countermeasure to such blackmail. Swear an oath to never swear oaths without some secret condition, such as "I will always touch my left thumb and left ring finger together when swearing new oaths."

It does raise the mechanic question of when rule 8/9 actually triggers in such a circumstance. If I swear to never make oath x, and then make oath x, will the breaking of the first oath unmake the second, or does the breaking "game tick" take place before the binding "game tick"?
