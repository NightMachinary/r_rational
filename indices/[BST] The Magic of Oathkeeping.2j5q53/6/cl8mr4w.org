  force them to make an Oath not to lie to you, ask them whatever questions you'd like, then test their benefit again to make sure that they kept that Oath

This makes having an Oath a major weakness. By forcing an Oath, someone can permanently threaten to take away your superpowers which took years of denied desire to cultivate, unless you swear slave-like obedience to them. Blackmail ain't got nuttin on this. Either society would have to make "forcing an Oath" as illegal and strongly prosecuted as kidnapping someone's children, or else very few people will ever take Oaths. Only A) those who can hide it, or B) those who are already very powerful and thus not in significant danger of being forced to make Oaths they don't want to make.
