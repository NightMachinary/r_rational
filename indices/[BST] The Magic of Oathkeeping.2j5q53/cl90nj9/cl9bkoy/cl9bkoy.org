  What happens if you fulfill an oath? I.e. "I will kill so and so" or "on the 9th of November 2015 I will donate half of my money to whichever charity gets the most upvotes"?

These tend to be fairly weak, though it depends on how much you don't want to do the thing you've made an Oath to do, and how much time you spend meditating on it. Generally speaking, it wouldn't be worth the effort unless you were psyching yourself up about doing something relatively painless. For example, if you had a fear of water and made an Oath to swim the Juniper Sea a year from now, you might get a little out of it, with the only real cost being psychological. An Oath that is fulfilled can't be broken, which is one of the major benefits of doing it that way.

  Also, using the same examples, how do the benefits work on oaths that you are waiting for in some way. Like, "Once a year I will cut off one of my fingers". Does this give any benefits between the cutting dates? What about before you cut off your first finger?
#+end_quote

This would give you /some/ benefit prior to cutting off the first finger, but it would be so minor as to be nearly undetectable, even if you spent a half hour every day meditating on how much you loved your finger and how much it was going to hurt to have it cut off.

So in theory, you could make an open-ended "I will do /x/ eventually" Oath where /x/ is some extremely negative thing, and obtain some small power from it until the point where you decide not to do that thing.
