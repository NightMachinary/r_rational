In theory, the day (or even hour) before you're about to cut off your finger is the moment when you most strongly don't want to go through with cutting off your finger, so yes, there would be a small boost then if that were the case. But for time or event limited Oaths, the limits you place aren't really the point of the Oath - it's the desire that gets you the power, not the follow-through.
