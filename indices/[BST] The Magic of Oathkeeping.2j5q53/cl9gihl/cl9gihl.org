If I understand correctly, fulfilling an oath will let you keep the benefits gained during the time the oath was unfulfilled and unbroken. Fulfilled oaths are unbreakable. What would happen if I had a bunch of fulfilled oaths and one unfulfilled oath and broke my unfulfilled oath? Would the benefits from my prior oaths disappear, or only the benefits that I had accumulated from my unfulfilled oath?
