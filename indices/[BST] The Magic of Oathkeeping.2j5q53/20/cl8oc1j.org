I will not break this oath.

I will not break this oath.

I will not break this oath.

Repeat a thousand times.

Then just need to maintain a desire to break those oaths just because. :P

  If you believe, even for the briefest moment, that you have broken your Oath, it is broken. Even if you're "wrong" about having broken your Oath.

This seems very broken; shouldn't it rather be 'if you believe that you /are breaking/ your oath, it is broken'? It's pretty easy to get people to believe something for a briefest of moments (in fact I think I read once that's the 'default' for reading or listening to stories - first you believe, then you possibly undermine that belief if it clashes with previous beliefs). If that's the case, you could trivially get anyone to break their oath.
