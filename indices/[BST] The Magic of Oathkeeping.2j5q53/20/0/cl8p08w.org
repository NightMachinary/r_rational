  This seems very broken; shouldn't it rather be 'if you believe that you are breaking your oath, it is broken'? It's pretty easy to get people to believe something for a briefest of moments (in fact I think I read once that's the 'default' for reading or listening to stories - first you believe, then you possibly undermine that belief if it clashes with previous beliefs). If that's the case, you could trivially get anyone to break their oath.

Perhaps that could be made more lax. The intent is that if you make an oath not to eat candy, and you eat a piece of candy without thinking about it, you've still broken the Oath. Or if you vow not to have sex, get a little drunk, and have sex anyway without thinking about the Oath, you'd still lose your benefits.
