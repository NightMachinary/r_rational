  When the Oath is less desirable to break its power goes down, this makes it more desirable to break which makes its power go up, which is fine if the Oath doesn't change in power, but every day the Oath goes up (rule 11) in power it's a) you're going to lose what you mention (you won't desire a steak as much in year 20, but that's not as relevant) and b) there is more reason not to break it because you get more out of the Oath in Year 20 and Year 1, but as written the more you get out of the Oath the less it gives you the more it gives you the less it gives you ad nasauem.

That's in need of clarification, but I'm not a hundred percent sure what the best way to phrase it is. The intent is that of you take an Oath, and I then make the credible threat of "I will murder you if you break your Oath", your Oath doesn't get weaker by virtue of that extra incentive.

So I need a wording for that rule that means that the accumulation of benefits is dependent on how much you want to break the Oath, regardless of how much you /don't/ want to break the Oath - it's not one desire subtracted from the other, it's just that singular desire. So being conflicted about something gives you power, while being dead neutral doesn't, if that makes sense.
