But it's not based on your desire for the steak, it's based on your desire to break the Oath.

Your desire to break the Oath decreases as the Oath gets stronger.

When the Oath is less desirable to break its power goes down, this makes it more desirable to break which makes its power go up, which is fine if the Oath doesn't change in power, but every day the Oath goes up (rule 11) in power it's a) you're going to lose what you mention (you won't desire a steak as much in year 20, but that's not as relevant) and b) there is more reason not to break it because you get more out of the Oath in Year 20 and Year 1, but as written the more you get out of the Oath the less it gives you the more it gives you the less it gives you ad nasauem.

Rule 12 just breaks it because it's self referencing, desire to break an oath is based from the power it grants which is based from the desire to break it.
