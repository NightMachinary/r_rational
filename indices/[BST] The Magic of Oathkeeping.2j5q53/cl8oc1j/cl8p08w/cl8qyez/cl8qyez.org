Yeah, that one seems really bad. I mean, you can break down someone's will really easily with simple drugs and even alcohol and cause them to agree with something you say. Copy what they do, mimic their methods of speech, agree with what they're saying. And then you simply say convincingly that they have broken all their oaths, and for a moment they'll believe it while agreeing with you.

This is a simple mirroring debate tactic that could bring down the strongest person alive.
