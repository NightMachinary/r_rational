The recent (as of ch. 1741) Forty Millenniums of Cultivation arc antagonist is basically evil!Eliezer Yudkowsky. There are other recent events that mirror, say, the Hanson-Yudkowsky AI-Foom debate (AGI vs ems). I was already suspicious that the author has read Yudkowsky's stuff, but this feels like icing on the cake. Curious whether others have this impression.
