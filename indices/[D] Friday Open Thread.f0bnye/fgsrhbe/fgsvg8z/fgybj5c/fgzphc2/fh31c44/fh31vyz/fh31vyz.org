No, I agree that there's an individual element, don't get me wrong. My point was that it's possible to learn before age 6, not that everyone necessarily can. A few examples are enough to prove that. So I guess I'm saying I believe we underestimate, on average, the potential of children; that doesn't mean their potential is literally unlimited, or the same for everyone. Certainly you don't want to push it to the point of burnout, but that happens already sometimes, and perhaps more because of the methods than the timing of education.
