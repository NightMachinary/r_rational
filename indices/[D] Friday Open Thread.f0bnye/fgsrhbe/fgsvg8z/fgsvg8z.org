I learned to read when I was 3-4. I learned because my mother would read books and had explained to me that they had words in them, then I would sit next to her and ask "what's this letter?" "what's this letter?" and after enough asking I got the hang of it. Later my mother found me scribbling those same letters on paper and pointing at them, calling them by name, so I basically learned to write too that way - only block letters, TBF. Some of my first books were the printed volumes of "Once Upon A Time... Life", the educational series on human anatomy by Albert Barille' (which taught me at the same time the rudiments of biology) and "Pinocchio", which was my first novel, when I was 4, and so still holds a special place in my heart for that. Took me a while to work through it, also because its Italian was a bit antiquated, but I overcame it in the end.

So, yes, I think it's entirely possible to learn earlier than six years old. I wouldn't say I find that consensus sickening - a couple years of headstart don't make that big of a difference IMO - but yes, in general, I believe we /severely/ underestimate what a child's mind can do if properly stimulated and prompted. I have a brother 12 years younger than me and I always made it a point to never treat him like an idiot, no matter what he asked - if he asked me about quantum mechanics and was willing, I'd happily give him as much of an explanation as I could muster by moving from his existing knowledge onwards.
