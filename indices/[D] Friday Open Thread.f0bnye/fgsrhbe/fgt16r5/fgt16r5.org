My parents would read to me while pointing at the words they were reading and I'd follow along, and at some point when I was three or four I started being able to read. But someone told me I'd learn to read in first grade, and I believed them, so I didn't "know how to read" until the first day of first grade, then I knew and started reading whatever, mostly The Hobbit, which took all of first grade.

When I was very young I spent a lot of time trying to remember what it was like when I was even younger, because some of my memories were very alien to me. So I remember remembering being fascinated by one of those boards where you put the matching shape through a hole, because I remember trying to figure out how that was so interesting, but I don't actually remember that far back. The earliest actual memory I have is trying to walk to my parents' room in the middle of the night, having to touch the wall with a fingertip to be confident in my walking, and being frustrated that I had to switch to crawling when I passed the fireplace.
