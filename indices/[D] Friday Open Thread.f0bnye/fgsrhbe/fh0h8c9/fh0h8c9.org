[Part 1]

Unlike the last two comments, there's actually a point to this one and the next one. Since people generally expect a thesis statement of sorts to occur near the beginning, and I've already missed the beginning by a full 10 pages, I should probably get to the point /right now/.

Basically, I believe that literally every single child who physically has the neurological capacity to learn how to read could do so at a much earlier age and with far less difficulty than what's generally accepted as both common knowledge and expert consensus.

--------------

Most of the people who study this stuff for a living seem to acknowledge "phonemes and phonics" and "whole language learning" as the only two methods of learning to read:

#+begin_quote
  In his internationally acclaimed analysis of the effectiveness of teaching methods, Professor John Hattie assigns “effect sizes” ranging from 1.44 (highly effective) to -0.34 (harmful). Effect sizes above 0.4 indicate methods worth serious attention.

  There are two main schools of thought about how to teach children to read and write, one focused on meaning (whole language) and one focused on word structure (phonics). Hattie's meta-analysis gives whole language an effect size of 0.06, and phonics an effect size of 0.54.

  [R]eading researchers have done studies in classrooms and clinics, and they've shown over and over that virtually all kids can learn to read - if they're taught with approaches that use what scientists have discovered about how the brain does the work of reading. But many teachers don't know this science.

  What have scientists figured out? First of all, while learning to talk is a natural process that occurs when children are surrounded by spoken language, learning to read is not. To become readers, kids need to learn how the words they know how to say connect to print on the page. They need explicit, systematic phonics instruction. There are hundreds of studies that back this up.

Basically, some people believe that if you throw enough books at a child and tell them to guess all the words then the child will magically absorb the ability to read (a method which seems to have been shown to be functionally equivalent to not teaching them at all), and the actual scientists believe that you have to systematically force memorization of phonemes (by breaking down individual short words like "bat and cat and rat and hat" to get kids to recognize the "-at" phoneme) and then force memorization of a bunch of common words and then have the child struggle through a phase where they "read" by using memorized phonemes to sound out syllable by syllable every unmemorized word the encounter, without much (if any) comprehension of the meaning of what they're reading.

#+begin_quote
  Difficulty linking letters with sounds is the source of reading problems for many children. Their reading is hesitant and characterized by frequent starts and stops and multiple mispronunciations. If asked about the meaning of what has been read, they frequently have little to say because they take far too long to read the words, taxing their memory and leaving little energy for remembering and understanding what they have read. *Unfortunately, there is no way to bypass this decoding and word recognition stage of reading* [emphasis mine]. A deficiency in these skills cannot to any meaningful extent be offset by using context to figure out the pronunciation of unknown words. While one learns to read for the fundamental purpose of deriving meaning from print, the key to comprehension starts with the immediate and accurate reading of words.

#+end_quote

They believe that a phonics method is the best way to teach a child to read because, out of the two methods, the "expect children to learn to read by teething on books" method has been shown to not work and the phonics method has been shown /not/ to not work, and obviously the method that doesn't not work is the best method.

I'm going to be responding to some things from this article:

[[https://www.apmreports.org/story/2018/09/10/hard-words-why-american-kids-arent-being-taught-to-read]]

But the whole thing is worth reading. I'd be especially interested in a take on this article from [[/u/somerando11]].

#+begin_quote
  The basic assumption that underlies typical reading instruction in many schools is that learning to read is a natural process, much like learning to talk. But decades of scientific research has revealed that reading doesn't come naturally. The human brain isn't wired to read. Kids must be explicitly taught how to connect sounds with letters - phonics.
#+end_quote

That is a true fact. You can't just throw a book at a child and expect them to learn to read.

Important facts:

#+begin_quote
  We are born wired to talk... but... reading is different. Our brains don't know how to do it... To be able to read, structures in our brain that were designed for things such as object recognition have to get rewired a bit.

  --------------

  Another big takeaway from decades of scientific research is that, while we use our eyes to read, the starting point for reading is sound. What a child must do to become a reader is to figure out how the words she hears and knows how to say connect to letters on the page. Writing is a code humans invented to represent speech sounds. Kids have to crack that code to become readers. Children don't crack the code naturally. They need to be taught how letters represent speech sounds.

  --------------

  What's also clear in the research is that phonics isn't enough. Children can learn to decode words without knowing what the words mean. To comprehend what they're reading, kids need a good vocabulary, too. That's why reading to kids and surrounding them with quality books is a good idea. The whole language proponents are right about that.
#+end_quote

So, the whole language method is absolute garbage and shouldn't even be qualified as a teaching method. It's wonderful that teachers are slowly beginning to be forced to teach based on facts rather than based on their personal "feelings and beliefs." It's undeniably clear that learning to read can't happen without knowledge of phonics.

But if you look into the way they teach phonics, you can see why its effect size is only only 0.54. 0.54 is certainly better by an order of magnitude than 0.06, but it's still a far cry from 1.44. You can see it in that article - in a picture of a teacher holding up a single flash card with a single word on it, and in the quote:

#+begin_quote
  If the curriculum says today's the day for kindergarteners to learn words that begin with the sounds "wuh" and "guh," you can walk into any kindergarten classroom in the district and see the teacher doing that lesson.
#+end_quote

So now I feel like I can make a point that I couldn't figure out how to make last night at 2am.

#+begin_quote
  Megan opens a Word Window.

  Guess what she sees?

  A dragon

  in a wagon.

  "Hi," says the dragon.

  "Let's go for a ride."
#+end_quote

You should've read that more slowly than normal, clearly enunciating every syllable, running your fingertip under every word as you said it.

Don't turn the page. Start talking to the child about what's in front of you, and pointing at pictures and words and letters, and asking questions.

#+begin_quote
  "Do you see Megan?" put your fingertip on Megan. "She's sitting in a chair" put your fingertip on the chair "and holding a book... Just like this one!" take the physical book you're holding and present it to the child as evidence.

  "See how it says it's a 'Word Window'?" put your fingertip under each of the three syllables as you enunciate them. "That's because it has words in it" run your fingertip over all the words on the page. "Isn't that silly?" Laugh.

  "/W/ord /W/indow. Can you hear the 'wuh' sound? /Wuh/ord, /wuh/indow. Do we see any other words that start with the 'wuh' sound?" If the child points at either the 'wagon' or the 'what', that is genuinely impressive and you should make a big deal about it by saying like "Wow! Good job!" but that probably won't happen so pretend to search for any Ws and then pretend to find either 'wagon' or 'what' and make a big deal about finding them.

  Reinforce the narrative of the story by re-reading those 23 words again at a normal speed and then turn the page.
#+end_quote

Obviously "double-u" is a complicated idea and you'll need to reinforce things like that later with other more alphabetically oriented books like Lowly Worm's ABC:

[[https://www.bibdsl.co.uk/imagegallery2/BDS/201838/9780008304966_2.jpg]]

[[https://www.bibdsl.co.uk/imagegallery2/BDS/201838/9780008304966_4.jpg]]

Though that sort of thing should probably have already come earlier to familiarize the concept of individual letters having names distinct from the sounds they make.

If you do it like that every day for an extended period of time, kids /can/ crack the code naturally without forced memorization of how letters represent speech sounds.

And a curriculum for kindergartners has an entire day for words that begin with the sounds "wuh" and "guh" and has an effect size of 0.54. I wonder if maybe it's because using flash cards to memorize phonemes from randomly selected single words divorced from any context or meaning makes it harder to remember since there's no meaning or context to associate the words with. Hmm.
