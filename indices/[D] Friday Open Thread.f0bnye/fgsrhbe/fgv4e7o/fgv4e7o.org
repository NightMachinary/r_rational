My first fragmentic memories are from around the age of one. From around the age of 2,5-3 memories got more substantial - prolonged series of events in contrast to few emotional scenes I remember from earlier age. I remember that period of life quite well, much better in fact than my 7-13 y.o. period.

I was a late reader, I think I started to read only when I was 7-8 years old, in 1st-2nd grade (Russian school, it is on the "late" part of spectrum but nothing too unusual). And started to read casually for ones enjoyment only when I was around 10,5-11 y.o.
