I was about three when I learned to read. I might have understood some simple words and phrases at two, but three was when I started reading books. Hooked On Phonics was involved, but I think our family's extensive collection of Seuss was also a critical factor - yes, my parents did want to teach me how to read at an early age, and yes, I did want to make them happy, but I was more concretely motivated by my appreciation of Dr. Seuss's work, which I could read at any time so long as I first /learned how to read/. The appealing and unusual illustrations helped - yes, I could get some enjoyment out of them even without reading, but that just gave me some idea of /the real experience I was missing/.

A couple of years later, at age five, I was reading children's chapter books; the thickest was the first Harry Potter book. My kindergarten teacher took a bizarrely antagonistic stance towards my reading level (which might partially have been the result of her fringe-right religious beliefs not taking kindly to the aforementioned Harry Potter - she also explicitly taught antisemitism, and although my parents were disgusted by that, I'm not sure why it never blew up into a big scandal), repeatedly attempted to prove that I was lying about my ability to read, and essentially treated me like a freak until the end of the year, at which point my parents transferred me to a different school as I'd requested.

The school I was transferred to for first grade specialized in gifted children, but it didn't set the bar especially high - I still had the highest reading level in the class, but that was seen as a good thing and I had serious competition for it. I began looking down on other children for their poor academic performance - one girl in particular, I held in contempt because she was the last student in our class to learn how to read, and I saw this as symptomatic of some great deficit in her character. In retrospect, I have extremely fond memories of her, and this failure to empathize with my age peers (realizing that things like their literacy would mostly be a consequence of factors outside their control) is one of my greatest shames from this period of my life.

I have extensive memories of my early childhood; the memories get scarcer and blurrier earlier in the timeline, but only somewhat, and there are still definitely legitimate memories there, not just imagined scenes reconstructed from others' accounts. For a long time I thought my first memory was my third birthday, but I gradually realized that some of my formative memories actually happened when I was two (particularly during a business trip in Europe). My third birthday was just my first /solidly positive/ memory; an incident during my father's business trip in Europe when I was two, which taught me that /it was possible to lose things/, was my first /solidly negative/ memory.
