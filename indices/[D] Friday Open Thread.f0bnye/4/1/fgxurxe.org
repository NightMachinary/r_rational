For the pharmaceutical researchers, I'd encourage the rapid development of safe and effective [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nootropic][nootropic]] drugs which can be shown to measurably improve results on IQ tests and/or to accelerate work performance at creative or intellectual tasks. There's no guarantee that such a thing could even exist, but if it is feasible, it would have the potential to greatly accelerate all other fields of research.

For education researchers, I'd like to see focus going into establishing learning aids (like educational videos) to help reduce reliance on lectures in classrooms. Lectures will vary in quality; some good, some bad, but most can be improved with visual aids. We can try to identify the best lecture approaches/presentations and then include visual aids with that to produce educational videos which teach concepts as quickly and as effectively as possible. Variations on these educational videos can be presented to groups of students to see which ones yield the best results (in terms of both student enjoyment as well as ability to correctly answer questions across various timescales after viewing the video). With rapid development and improvement of these learning aids, we could possibly start accelerating school/college programs and then have spare time for more advanced topics. Improving education could also help to improve our ability to get capable researchers for promoting scientific advancements.

As far as how science is practiced overall, for any kind of randomized control trial, I would want to ensure that all such studies are registered with whatever journal they'll publish with, and that they undergo pre-publication peer review to ensure that the basis of the study is sound. The pre-publication registration is important to ensure that we don't miss negative findings. It's easy for published research to create a bias towards doing/using things that are actually ineffective if all or most of the negative results don't get published. This has created significant problems in drug research and psychology, although many other fields are not without their problems in this regard as well.

With those in place to accelerate our progress, there's still the big topics with potential for revolutionary socioeconomic impact: friendly GAI, nanotechnology, genetic research and engineering (including genetic screening, gene therapy, and GMO crops), viable nuclear fusion power plants, neural interfaces, and self-replicating robots (which could be sent to the asteroid belt or other planets).
