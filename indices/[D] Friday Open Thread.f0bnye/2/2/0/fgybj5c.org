  So, yes, I think it's entirely possible to learn earlier than six years old. I wouldn't say I find that consensus sickening - a couple years of headstart don't make that big of a difference IMO - but yes, in general, I believe we severely underestimate what a child's mind can do if properly stimulated and prompted. I have a brother 12 years younger than me and I always made it a point to never treat him like an idiot, no matter what he asked - if he asked me about quantum mechanics and was willing, I'd happily give him as much of an explanation as I could muster by moving from his existing knowledge onwards.

All of this is true /for some people/. Remember 50% of people have an IQ below 100, and retardation isn't a firm line.
