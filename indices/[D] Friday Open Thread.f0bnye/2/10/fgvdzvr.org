Alright. I wanted this one to be snappier and organized more coherently, but it's still long.

First, my own experience.

My mother didn't know any better, so she began teaching me how to read when I was basically fresh out of the womb. We've had conversations about it in the past and I mostly remember the broad strokes... but I just stopped typing and went and asked her directly and she said that she started when I was about 3 or 4 months old, right when I was able to hold my head up while in a sitting position. She would have me sat in her lap and read to me slowly and clearly (basically "[[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200203151158.htm][parentese]]") while she traced her finger under every word she was saying, pointing at the relevant pictures associated with the words after finishing every sentence, acting things out and such. She would finish a whole book in one sitting, so 15 to 20 minutes, and that would happen three or four times a day.

She says that at about 8 months I started becoming actively involved, trying to turn the pages on my own, and she would redirect my attention by holding my body still and telling me "no" gently but clearly then taking my hand and putting my finger out and using my own finger to point at a picture of something like a ball after asking me where it was, stuff like that. I have an unfounded suspicion that feels like the fringes of a memory telling me that by then she had repeated all of the books many times each and I already recognized the words by sight and was getting impatient and reading ahead of her. That's probably not accurate.

By 10 months, it was still three or four times a day, but two or three books in one sitting, so 30 minutes to an hour at a time.

By two years, it was only two or three times a day, but an hour at a time, plus one to two hours at bedtime. Around two-and-a-half she had a relative visiting from out of state and my "bedtime" was 7pm (I guess relatively early to give reading time) and I kept asking her for "one more story" until almost 11pm. That would've been the Hans Christian Anderson collection of stories.

And of course through all that period of time, whenever we would be out in public she would point out words. Like if my dad went into the grocery store and me and mom were in the car, she'd say something like "look Michael, that says 'Food Lion', f... o... o... d... food... l... i... o... n... lion. The two 'o's together make an 'oo' sound." And she was always there in the play room where I had blocks with letters on them and magnetic letters and stuff. I might mention here that she quit her job when she had me and took care of me full time until I was two and she started working again. That wasn't something we could financially support, but she did it anyway.

She had my brother a couple of months after I turned three, so for a while I was in a situation where my dad would read to me for thirty minutes a night but he didn't do it right, he thought the point was the narrative and not the reading itself so he just read to me without involving me in the process. So shortly after I turned 3 years old I was reading the Hans Christian Anderson book on my own. [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13514088-andersen-s-fairy-tales][It was this version]], which is about 330 pages. I would read one or two stories at a time (twenty to thirty pages each) multiple times a day. I'm pretty sure there was a period of at least three to five weeks where I read that entire book once a week.

So that's where I ended up, capable of reading something like /that/ on my own at age three, reading all seven Narnia books the summer between kindergarten and first grade, and the gap between was filled with things like the "Wheeler's Adventures" series when I was four and five years old.

But let's go back to the process that got me there.

My mom used several different series. At the beginning were things like Golden Books and Magic Castle books and Richard Scarry books, lots of "just one or two short simple sentences per page" stuff.

Shortly before I turned two, she transitioned to the Sweet Pickles books.

As an adult who knows a little bit about psychology and the development of the brain from casual research over the course of more than a decade, I'm looking at all these books now and I think the books themselves might've boosted the efficacy of what she did.

And probably most importantly, Sweet Pickles:

So it's not just the "tracing under the words with a finger" that does it, it's all the repetition of sounds and having pictures corresponding to the words. It's 2am, I'll have to come back tomorrow and get to the point because I don't think I'm physically capable of making a point right now.
