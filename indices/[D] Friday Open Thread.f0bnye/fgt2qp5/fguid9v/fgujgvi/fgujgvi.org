When you click on a planet, it puts out resources. In order to put out more resources, it needs to take in some resources. Eventually you can get tech upgrades that give you more options on upgrading planets, even one terraformer, another grey goo that lets you reset planets. You can build spaceships and wormholes and things of that nature. There are a couple of different win conditions, but the game doesn't appear to track them and tell you "You won!" yet.
