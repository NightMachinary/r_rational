[[http://noisyowl.com/spacetrains/spacetrains.html][Space Trains]] is coming along. Thanks again to everyone here who's provided feedback! The game has two core mechanics that have been confusing in the past, and I think this version fixes confusion about what hops are in a stylish way. I think I can fix the last confusing element, how resource requirements work, with [[https://imgur.com/a/7PpFhlf][alternate ways to display project boxes]]. I think the last treatment in the album is probably the winner, but I'll have to sacrifice some goats to make a real version of it, so I first want to check, do people feel like this makes more sense? (Especially if you haven't seen the game before, especially especially if you have but didn't understand how it worked.)

I've also done some background work that'll let me add new kinds of mysterious planets, so a bunch of those should crop up over the next week.

Also: new train graphics.
