Hrrm. I would have been reading by kindergarten (~5) for sure as I can recall writing simple books around then, and I recall reading encyclopedia entries for things somewhat after. I was reading Lord of the Rings well before I was 8. Without querying my parents I can't pinpoint much more beyond extrapolating backwards. As for methods, I vaguely recall my mom trying hooked on phonics for me briefly, but I honestly remember the damn pre-movie ads for them on my VHS tapes more than I do the program itself.

EDIT: my mom says I was reading simple chapter books by kindergarten, and she thinks I learned to read around 3 or 4.

To answer your last question, I can't remember much beyond specific impactful events. There's a lot of things in my head bucketed in the "before I was 8" section because it was then that we moved out of my grandparent's house and my dad joined the Navy. It's all very much a blur. I have exactly two memories from before I was three, and everything from then to ~8 is all mixed together.

My son (3) can read very simple books a notch or so below Seuss and can write a very distorted version of all the letters in the alphabet. He could name all the letters on sight by the time he was around 2 or so. I credit the letter recognition to YouTube videos, and the reading/writing to a few different apps that we got for his tablet when he was also around 2. The ability for him to control the endless repetition has been a huge help, I suspect; neither me nor his mother have the patience to have repeated the sounds of each letter or word the thousands of times he's heard them by spamming taps on the tablet.
