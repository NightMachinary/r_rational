I was something of a late bloomer and didn't really put effort into reading until I was six. I may have been able to a little before then, but I didn't put much effort into it until I discovered Harry Potter books.

However, I remember my childhood pretty clearly. I have vivid memories of my fifth birthday, the day my brother was born when I was four, and a few 'snapshots' of events which my parents never described to me, but must have happened when I was three. I have nothing earlier than those, but I'm told remembering anything from that young is unusual.

And we don't really start to become people until we're 2-3 years old. Before then the brain is still too disorganized to support personalities or discrete memory recall. It's less that we forget our early childhood than that we were not capable of remembering at that time.
