  How old were you when you learned how to read?

Fuzzy on the details, but I remember having read Eragon in kindergarten or maybe early 1st grade (6 years old; it was around summertime), but didn't start to learn reading much earlier than kindergarten. I believe my reading education was fairly conventional; I'd had some exposure to letters beforehand (I have memories from when I was about 3 drawing cursive letters with chalk and asking my parents if they spelled anything) but other than that it was just the standard kindergarten exposure to language.

As for how much of my early childhood I can legitimately remember, I start having concrete memories at about 3 years of age, and remember more and more of each year for every year thereafter. Most of my memories are information based-- I remember that I did something in some place at some time, and then any visuals I think up are probably synthetized after the fact. I don't remember sound, smell, taste, or touch virtually at all, with a few notable exceptions, but it's relatively easy for me to place specific events on a timeline because my family moved around a bit so the environments I was in are distinct.

Personally, I think the general consensus on reading age is probably right. The responses you're getting to this post are all coming from [[/r/rational]] members who started earlier, but I have a feeling we were all a very particular kind of child. Since intelligence is highly heritable, any kid you have can probably stand to start early, but my gut feeling is that most kids are poorly suited to be taught reading any earlier than 6ish years old, either due to lack of comprehension or childish hyperactivity. They're technically capable of learning to read, but being forced to could poison them against reading in the future, in much the same way that you see a lot of kids hate reading books because of what they were forced to read in english classes.
