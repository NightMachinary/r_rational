IQ is a malleable thing and it's not only genetic, at least if we're talking toddlers. Stimulating people in their childhood goes a great deal towards making them smart. I mean, you're right that it's not probably a universal thing, but as I said, it's possible, and I think we systematically underestimate just how much children /can/ grow and understand if given the chance.
