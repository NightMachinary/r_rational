  How old were you when you learned how to read?
#+end_quote

Around 3 or 4 years old.

  How did you acquire the ability to read?
#+end_quote

According to my parents, my older brother had just learned to read, and I was frustrated that he was able to do something that I could not, and taught myself to read. Their first guess was that I had just memorized a book, rather than actually reading, but were satisfied after having me read the book in reverse order.

  How much of your early childhood can you legitimately remember?
#+end_quote

Relatively little. A few mental images have internal inconsistencies, or otherwise contradict the known sequence of events. (For example, tricycling down a hallway to visit my cousins, when in actuality we had never lived in the same city, let alone the same apartment complex.) I don't have any distinct memories of learning to read, though I do have a few consistent and confirmed memories that date to when I was about 3.

  That sort of makes me feel sick in the pit of my soul. Like, any faith I may have had in the ability of cultural transmission to properly propagate the stuff that actually matters? Gone. Something major has to be going wrong somewhere for the world to look the way it looks.

Can you explain this further? Does the age that reading is taught seem too early, too late? What about it causes the visceral revulsion?
