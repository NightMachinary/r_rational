This anecdote is coming in a bit late but I figure it can't hurt:

I learned to read around kindergarten, which if memory serves was around four or five. We had a little book section of the classroom that you could spend time in, and I have a distinct memory of something that happened about that.

In my first year of kindergarten, I wasn't much interested in the books. I could read them, so I probably picked up a lot of the knowledge around 4y/o, but I didn't care much. Around the time I started my second year of kindergarten, I got a lot more interested in them (which is what I remember: me noticing the shift in behaviour).

I don't have reading-based memories earlier than that (though I do have one around the same time about learning how to read silently), though, so I can't say when my parents started reading to me. But it can't have been later than four, since I already knew the basics of reading in my first year of kindergarten.
