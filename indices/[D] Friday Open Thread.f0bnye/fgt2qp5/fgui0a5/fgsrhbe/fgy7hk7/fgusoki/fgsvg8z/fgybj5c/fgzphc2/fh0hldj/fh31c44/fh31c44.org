I'm significantly aware of that, given that it's the problem I confront every day. Can children grow and decline? Of course! Significantly so, within the boundaries of their genetics, their current education status, and SES. What happens if you systematically try to push past those boundaries? Burnout, dejection, and educational trauma lasting into adulthood for little to no effect.

Education is /individual/; assuming that what worked for you will work for everyone in the same degree and proportion is foolish. I think most people on this board have no idea what the system actually looks like, because they don't engage with the system or process of education as adults.
