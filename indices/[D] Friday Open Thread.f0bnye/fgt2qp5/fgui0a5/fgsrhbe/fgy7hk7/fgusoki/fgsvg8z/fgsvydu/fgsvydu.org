According to my mum I first started reading around age 2, but it's unclear how credible that claim is (my early childhood was quite tumultuous, and I'm otherwise skeptical just on prior grounds). In this account, I was taught to read by one of my great grandmas, bouncing on her knee in the kitchen of our small apartment (where my "bedroom" often was, either the kitchen table or the bathtub). This was all in Russian, too -- supposedly when I first came to the US (age 4) I'd already taught myself English somehow, and a placement test (since I'd attended Russian, Georgian, and French daycares / kindergardens) put me in the 1st grade (so e.g. I finished 12th at age 16, though personally I wish they'd have let me skip a few more). I was also fluent in and reading Georgian and French, but who knows. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I have no real memory of this time, just ones I've constructed from stories of my infanthood. Don't think I really have any real memories until age 5 or 6 or so.

Is the expert consensus disheartening because it's a later age than you'd anticipated? Why would it seriously impede cultural transmission?
