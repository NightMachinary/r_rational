[Part 2]

    That sort of makes me feel sick in the pit of my soul. Like, any faith I may have had in the ability of cultural transmission to properly propagate the stuff that actually matters? Gone. Something major has to be going wrong somewhere for the world to look the way it looks.

  [[/u/MereInterest]] - Can you explain this further? Does the age that reading is taught seem too early, too late? What about it causes the visceral revulsion?

  [[/u/GaBeRockKing]] - Personally, I think the general consensus on reading age is probably right. The responses you're getting to this post are all coming from [[/r/rational]] members who started earlier, but I have a feeling we were all a very particular kind of child. Since intelligence is highly heritable, any kid you have can probably stand to start early, but my gut feeling is that most kids are poorly suited to be taught reading any earlier than 6ish years old, either due to lack of comprehension or childish hyperactivity. They're technically capable of learning to read, but being forced to could poison them against reading in the future, in much the same way that you see a lot of kids hate reading books because of what they were forced to read in english classes.

  [[/u/--MCMC--]] - Is the expert consensus disheartening because it's a later age than you'd anticipated? Why would it seriously impede cultural transmission?

  [[/u/SimoneNonvelodico]] - I think it's entirely possible to learn earlier than six years old. I wouldn't say I find that consensus sickening - a couple years of headstart don't make that big of a difference IMO - but yes, in general, I believe we /severely/ underestimate what a child's mind can do if properly stimulated and prompted.

  [[/u/somerando11]] - As for your loss of faith: did you assume your perceptions were wrong or experts were wrong? In education "experts" are frequently non-scientific, but in this case, it's probably your perceptions that were wrong.

My revulsion to the general consensus stems from the fact that I am genuinely convinced that the experts are mistaken (and I think I've said enough in the previous three comments to support the idea that even if you disagree with my conclusion you should be able to see how I came to be convinced of it). Literacy training should be taught differently and begin earlier than people believe it should, the consensus is /wrong/.

And that mistaken consensus has real effects on society. It's been shown that "a head start of a few years" /does/ actually make a /significant/ difference. It might not be that children become readers because they're intelligent, it could be the case that children's intelligence is boosted by exposure to reading.

  I should've gathered better sources but this makes a close enough point to the point I'm trying to make - children's brains are literally being physically wired differently due to the mistaken consensus.

From an article I linked in the previous comment, "More than 60 percent of American fourth-graders are not proficient readers, according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, and it's been that way since testing began in the 1990s." American fourth-graders are /9 years old./ I think that pretty clearly shows that there's something /fundamentally wrong/ with the way things are being done.

And my lack of faith in the efficacy of cultural transmission when it comes to important stuff stems from stuff like this:

#+begin_quote
  Wiley Blevins, an author and educational consultant who has written about 15 books on methods for teaching early reading, says the earliest he has ever seen a child learn to read is 4 years old. He defines reading as analyzing words letter by letter and sound by sound and putting them together into a word. He says very early “reading” is more likely babies seeing words as pictures. They see a squiggly line on the page or TV screen and associate it with a specific word, which is a very primitive form of reading, Blevins says.

  "It's not what we in the academic community would say is reading because it's not transferable. It relies on what you've memorized," Blevins says. "It could be a smudge on the page reminds them that it's the word 'cat.'"

#+end_quote

That is not a fringe view. Somehow, despite the fact that a non-insignificant number of children exist who learned how to read by naturally absorbing the written word similarly to the way we all learned how to speak by naturally absorbing the spoken word (basically by watching their parents' finger trace under words while reading aloud from a book), not only is that learning method generally not recognized as existing, but experts in the field doubt those children's very existence. Like, I'm not the only person whose parent(s) read to them while tracing along below the words with their finger. It's an extraordinarily simple idea, and yet I can find barely any trace of it being discussed casually, let alone in any sort of research papers.

#+begin_quote
  [[/u/jtolmar]] - My parents would read to me while pointing at the words they were reading and I'd follow along, and at some point when I was three or four I started being able to read.
#+end_quote

And I found this on an [[/r/AskReddit][r/AskReddit]] post from like 7 years ago... I was planning on just linking to the comment, but it would probably feel pretty surreal to be cc'd into a random discussion because of a throwaway comment you made 7 years ago that got basically zero engagement at the time, so I'm gonna ping 'em:

#+begin_quote
  [[/u/woollufff]] - My dad used to sit me in his lap while he read science journals and astronomy books. He read out loud tracing along with a finger. Reading came naturally as talking, and was reading by age of 4.
#+end_quote

So "kids can learn how to read without being explicitly taught, just absorbing it based on pattern recognition facilitated by an adult reading aloud and tracing along with a finger to establish an association between squiggly lines and vocalizations (and if done with fanatic zealotry like my mother, also word meanings/definitions and phonemic awareness)" is something that is factually correct.

And it honestly shouldn't take much time or effort (relatively speaking) to accidentally sneeze a remarkable amount of literacy and onto a child's brain. Because of the ease with which this extraordinarily simple idea could be implemented by spreading awareness to day care workers and parents (pediatricians already tell parents they should be reading to their kids every day, this would just be a slightly more specific message) and the dramatic effects it would have on cognitive and [[http://www.psychology-criminalbehavior-law.com/2015/01/risk-factors-for-criminal-behavior-preschool-experience/][behavioral]] outcomes, the fact that this idea seems to not even be on the radar of the experts who have devoted the past half a century to studying how children learn to read makes me, personally, feel like it /must/ be the case that something is blocking the transmission of this idea.

Someone who replied to my first comment said something that appears to have been edited away, about how the mere mention of precocious reading ability sounds like bragging even though it's just a statement of fact that you read a book that you read at the age that you did.

#+begin_quote
  [[/u/LiteralHeadCannon]] - My kindergarten teacher took a bizarrely antagonistic stance towards my reading level, repeatedly attempted to prove that I was lying about my ability to read, and essentially treated me like a freak until the end of the year, at which point my parents transferred me to a different school as I'd requested.
#+end_quote

My mom says that for a few years before she knew any better, she would mention things about my reading to other parents and to teachers (she was a teacher, but for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_education][special education]] so strict phonics was the only way to reach them, she never experimented with trying to teach reading to students the way she taught it to her own kids). Reactions would be along the lines of "oh, uh huh, okay." Sort of not really engaging and dismissive, and she realized after a time that most people just didn't believe her, they thought she was making up a ridiculous hyperbole so she could brag.

And of course one of the more common complaints about HPMOR is that HJPEV is characterized as having read things like The Feynman Lectures on Physics and Godel Escher Back before the story begins, and that's "unrealistic" because an 11-year-old isn't capable of that, much less a kid younger than 11.

So that one bit was just my own cynicism - I think most parents think you're an arrogant know-it-all who's bragging about imaginary accomplishments if you happen to state a fact about your child's abilities, and so knowledge of how to make your child smarter doesn't spread. The early childhood memories bit was mostly a waste of time, it wasn't relevant at all to the main point that reading should be taught differently and earlier.

And... I guess I'll try posting this second part first so it shows up below part 1 when sorting by new and so it isn't at the top of people's inboxes?
