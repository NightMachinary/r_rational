Actually, this comment became too long, so it's now going to just be me giving my own answer to the "early childhood" question. I guess I'll cc you lot again once I've made a comment that actually has a point.

*THIS COMMENT IS SKIPPABLE, IT HAS NO REAL POINT*

I guess I'll start by recounting my own memories. People might think I'm delusional, but whatevs. Around 8ish years ago I had a series of conversations with my mother about all this stuff and she corroborated everything, whatever that's worth.

I can remember the first time I walked, a few weeks after my first birthday.

I was on my grandmother's lap in the play place of a McDonald's. The toy that came with the Happy Meal was an inflatable rubber ball, like a mini beach ball. I can /feel/ the spatial orientation of where we were sitting in relation to the play place and the door and the big glass wall. She dropped the ball and it rolled away from us towards the big glass wall, and I climbed down off her lap and ran after the ball and picked it up and turned around and brought it back.

I recounted this memory to my mother, and she confirmed its accuracy. She said that, because I was the first grandchild born on her side of the family, she and my relatives held me all the time and carried me everywhere and didn't give me much of an opportunity to crawl around on my own. She also said that I pitched a fit and /told/ my grandmother (because I never really "babbled," at 8 months I started saying words with the intention of communicating and by 10 months I was speaking in coherent/articulate grammatically correct complex/compound sentences) to let me get down off her lap so I could get the ball.

I've thought about the concept of "remembering remembering" for years now. [[/u/jtolmar]], it blew my mind that you mentioned that using the same type of wording. It's like, if you remember something from infancy when you're a toddler, it strengthens that memory so those connections aren't [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaptic_pruning][pruned]] or something, and then if a few years later you remember having remembered you can remember directly again because rehearsing the memory strengthens the connections that were spared from pruning.

I think we were in that McD's again when I was two or three (most Fridays from like 6 months old to like 4 years old were "outing with grandma" days and by age four the outing meal had shifted from McD's to Pizza Hut so the latest this could've happened was age three). We normally went to one closer to home, but I guess we went to that other farther-away McD's again because it was near a particular shopping center, and we sat at the same table and I think I mentioned the fact that I remembered that this was /the/ table. Whatever adult(s) I was with might have reacted with surprise, presumably my mother was present.

I'm almost /certain/ that I can remember "practicing walking" by holding the bars of my crib and walking in place at night in my crib, with the intention of surprising the adults by going directly from "not walking at all" to "walking perfectly." I'm not going to elaborate about this here or argue about it later, don't @ me about this.

Moving on.

I remember my third birthday. The memory begins while I was asleep, dreaming. A waterfall, with a thin wooden bridge parallel to it. The viewpoint is pointed about 70 degrees to the right, and pointed down at the bridge. The bridge and the edge of the waterfall both extend infinitely into the distance, no end is visible. The waterfall goes down forever, there is no bottom visible. There is no one on the bridge. Then the viewpoint shifts to a first person perspective. I am looking directly at the face of Geppetto from Disney's Pinocchio. He is holding me by the arm, and I am looking up at his face and my arm and his arm /and the bridge/, because he is on the bridge and I am not, I am suspended over nothing. He displays no emotion. I feel no emotion. He lets go of my arm, and I wake up. I am in my parents' room alone on their bed, and it is day, and I can hear my mother and grandmother talking [I'm assuming I took a nap and had the dream during the day]. I walk out and see them in the kitchen. My grandmother has somehow put together a cake shaped like a train (3D like a toy train but bigger and made of cake instead of plastic, not a 2D cutout of a train), and it has white frosting and she's decorating it with those trashy orange candy peanut things. My grandmother picks me up and places me on the edge of the counter. My mother is making a salad, and I take notice of the salad preparation. I ask something about it, and someone hands me a piece of lettuce to try. I desperately hate it with a fiery burning passion and I probably cry. That is the end of the memory.

I took violin lessons from the ages of late three to early four. This next memory happened near the end of that period.

I had a poster on one of my walls, a photographic image of Disney World with a bunch of characters in costumes in the foreground. My bed was situated... you don't need spatial information. I could see the poster in bed at night.

I was not born with a "lazy eye." I might bring that up again later. Basically, there was about a week-long period where I would look at the poster while I was lying in bed and notice that there were two slightly separated pictures, and I discovered that I could cross my eyes /even more/ to get the images further apart from each other. To entertain myself, several nights in a row I kept on seeing how far apart I could get the images and getting them further and further apart each night.

The last night I did that, I felt something weird, like a snap or a pull, and then my left eye was stuck and the images didn't go back to being closer together anymore. I think I thought something similar to the feeling of "oh shit" and decided to just go to sleep and see if it went back to normal in the morning. I woke up and looked at the poster and the two images were split by a large and noticeable amount and they weren't resolving back into a single image. I walked out of my room, down the hallway into the living room. The living and dining rooms were separated by a couch, and my mom was walking around in the dining room near the kitchen counter. I can almost see it, looking up at her with the couch between us. I said "mommy, I see two of you." And she said something like "Michael, don't say things like that, you're scaring mommy."

That's the discrete memory, walking out and looking over the couch at my mother.

Obviously the problem didn't go away on its own and obviously I had a frame of reference for the "before and after" and was unwilling to accept this as the new status quo. So fast forward a week or two to the next violin lesson, and the teacher was always a bitch so of course she said the reason I fell over backwards during the lesson (I'm pretty sure I did that on purpose to make a point to my mother along the lines of "/holy shit my eyes are all ducked up, acknowledge the reality of the situation/") was because I was a naughty and lazy little boy who didn't want to do his violin lesson. I can remember the layout of the room and where I was standing in relation to the door and my mother and the teacher and all that. Anyways, mom took me out of there after the teacher was a bitch, and I said something in the car about falling down because of my eyes to manipulate her into /doing something/ and she made a doctor's appointment and they were like "yep, he's cross-eyed" and then I had a surgery to straighten my eyes back out which probably cost my parents several thousand dollars.

My grandmother on my father's side died of early onset Alzheimer's shortly after my second birthday. I have vague memories of running around the peanut-shaped pool in the backyard of the house she and my grandfather lived in. That would've had to have been June or July or August, so this memory's from age 13/14/15 months. There was some sort of pool toy (I wanna say it was a short 6-inch-long colored plastic stick?) and one of my older cousins threw it into the pool and I can remember looking down at it, gone forever sitting at the bottom of the pool, and I believe I made a fuss and an adult retrieved it with a long net.

I also remember having a Chapstick and walking up to the grandmother with Alzheimer's while she was sitting in a rocking chair at the house of the other grandmother. I showed her the Chapstick, she thought it was funny and may have said something about candy, and I may have giggled because I was aware by then that adults often talked to children by saying silly things that weren't true. She took the lid off and looked at it, twisted the bottom to push the Chapstick up, /kept twisting and twisting until there was a solid two inches of Chapstick/ and I was mildly concerned because /that was/ *my* /Chapstick/ and then /she bit off the Chapstick and straight up ate it and I was straight up shocked./ My mother is flabbergasted that I can remember that. Apparently, according to my her, that would've had to have been the last Christmas for the Alzheimer's grandma so she went to both family Christmases and I guess I was about ~19 months old. As recently as this year I've gone to the spot by the window where the rocking chair was and got down on my knees and bent down further and looked up to orient my field of view so everything spatially lines up with my memory. I might have a weak "mind's eye" and not be able to picture things very easily, but I can feel them volumetrically.

I actually have more discrete memories from the ages of 1.5 to 4 than I do from ages 7 to 14. But that's enough.
