Two points of personal experience:

- I was a late reader. My parents read to me every day, more than one book. When we went to toy stores I could get one toy or two books. But I wouldn't read on my own.Nothing seemed to take, and I was behind in Kindergarten. My parents were distraught. They tried experts, they did hooked on phonics, and tutoring. In first grade, around 6.5 years old, I started to read. I never knew this until he was dead, but my uber-masculine father broke down crying in the parent teacher conference. Three months later I was reading on a third grade level. Two years later I read more books than anyone in the small school, except my sister. When we had reading competitions, I started to throw them because I didn't think reading should be a competition and other people seemed to care about winning. I'm still an avid reader today, even if /Worm/ has eaten up my reading time like nothing before.
- I'm a teacher. I see kids forced into stuff their brains literally aren't ready for all the damn time. It's incredibly harmful, especially to those without a strong support system. Many buckle under the pressure and give up. A few become obnoxious in their ignorance; in High School that metastasizes into prideful ignorance. At the same time, I see some kids that are ready for more advanced materials held back because of lack of institutional resources. Out of 75 or so students, 5 should be finished with High School level material in Freshman year. 20 should spend an extra year or two going over different 5th grade material until they hit puberty and their brains can handle the extra abstraction. 10 should basically do 3rd grade level material until they can master it at around 14, and then go on to career track.

Education is incredibly individual. Stages of brain development are very, very, very real. And the educational trauma that comes from heavily pushing kids too early is just as real as the educational trauma from kids getting bored. Some people can and should be reading by the time they're one, others seven. This is a problem that teacher AIs will ameliorate, but not solve.

As for your loss of faith: did you assume your perceptions were wrong or experts were wrong? In education "experts" are frequently non-scientific, but in this case, it's probably your perceptions that were wrong. That should lead to curiousity, not a lack of faith.
