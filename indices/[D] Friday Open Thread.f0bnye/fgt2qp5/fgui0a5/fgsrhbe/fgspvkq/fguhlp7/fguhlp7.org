Let's imagine you had some say over the scientific practice of a major nation. Something on the scale of the EU, US, or China. You're not a dictator or anything, so you can't just decree that everyone work on GAI (for instance) but you can whisper in a few ears and have some impact on the direction the government of that nation pushes it's science focus in the near future.

What would you use that influence for? Are there certain technological or scientific topics you'd want to promote? Changes to the way science is practiced that you'd want to propagate? Something else entirely?
