In an ideal world I'd want more research into the nature of human intelligence, and genetic engineering. A "plague" that raised the average intelligence of offspring by 40 seems achievable. I don't think it would solve every problem, but it seems like a good step.

But we don't live in an ideal world. Global warming prevention / terraforming. Save us long enough to create world transforming AI.
