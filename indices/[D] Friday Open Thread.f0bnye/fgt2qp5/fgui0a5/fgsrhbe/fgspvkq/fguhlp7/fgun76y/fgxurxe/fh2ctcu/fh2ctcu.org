Go all in on nuclear fusion, I think. Right now a major breakthrough there is about the only way I see out of the impending resource catastrophies. Free energy wouldn't avoid everything, but it'd maybe make more energy-intensive stuff like large-scale carbon capture and storage finally viable. Also ocean water desalination, to ward off the next middle eastern war. Would also help with recycling of electronics and rare earths.
