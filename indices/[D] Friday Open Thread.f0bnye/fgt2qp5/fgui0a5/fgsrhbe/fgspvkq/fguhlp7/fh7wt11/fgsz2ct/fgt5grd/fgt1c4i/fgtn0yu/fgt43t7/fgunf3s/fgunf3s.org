Can you transfer, say, copies of legal docs to a million other worlds? It seems like you only need to solve the "procedure" aspect on one planet, then dry-run and fixup the "blind document delivery with no further interaction" approach several times before you can attempt to move into some form of mass-production. Perhaps you would have access to a sympathetic charity-case lawyer who could bootstrap funds access from your'-to-daughter' if funds are needed.

Side note: Reaching a million worlds can be done in twenty doublings, so it's not like you need to fax a million copies from the first world.

*(edit) Also: I wonder how much real value that old "identical twins A/B testing" joke has. I would guess probably not enough to privately fund the 8-to-18 childhood of every participant. But perhaps some (sane) governments would be interested, as a public investment into the future of the nation and humanity. **(edit2) Ah, with inter-universe communication, there might not be all that much need for doing such experiments same-universe (ie, universes can collaborate).
