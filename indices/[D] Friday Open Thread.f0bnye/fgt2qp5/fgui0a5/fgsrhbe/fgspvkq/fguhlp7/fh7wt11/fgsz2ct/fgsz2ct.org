Here's an unpleasant thought experiment I thought up this last week. Not sure how I'd respond to it, myself:

Suppose in your care is a small, defenseless child. Maybe picture them a daughter, 8 years old, for whom you're the world's greatest parent. You love and care for them deeply, as they do you. You're a widow(er), but despite many struggles you've managed to eke out a small island of comfort and stability: flexible middle-class job, finger paintings on the fridge, long bedtime stories, the works.

You're driving down a forested road one day when a Scientist turns on a Machine and causes the universe to shudder and split. The momentary distraction makes you swerve and crash, killing your daughter instantly but leaving you miraculously unharmed.

One funeral and no small amount of mourning later, the Scientist comes to you and remarks that they've managed to contact and transfer matter between one of the alternate universes, identical in all respects up to the moment of shudder. In this universe, the shudder happened a split second later, bestowing upon the alternate /you'/ that much more opportunity to sacrificially direct your' swerve so that /you'/ died instantly, orphaning /your' daughter'/ but leaving her at the mercy of a cruel and inefficient foster care system, with nothing but horror and inconvenience before her.

The Scientist offers you an opportunity to connect you and /your' daughter'/, that she may live with you and be cared for and loved. Do you accept their offer?

If you don't, the Scientist leaves, never to return. If you do, the Scientist leaves, but returns some weeks later, after you've settled into some semblance of normalcy, beginning to truly love /your' daughter'/, who you've now accepted as if she were your own (which, under many perspectives on personal identity, she is). The Scientist tells you that it's not just one alternate universe they've managed to contact, but trillions! And it would appear that across the distribution of alternate car crashes, an unharmed orphaned daughter was left a million times as often as a living, breathing "/you/". Each of those orphaned daughters finds herself on the cusp of a series of deeply unfortunate and tragic events, every one a unique blend of sorrow and tragedy. You may transfer as many or as few into your care as you'd like. How do you proceed?
