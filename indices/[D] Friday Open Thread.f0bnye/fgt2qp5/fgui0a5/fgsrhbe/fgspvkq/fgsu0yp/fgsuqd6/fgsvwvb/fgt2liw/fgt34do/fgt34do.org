Doctors told me that a lot of people have similar symptoms (though of course there is an element of individual susceptibility). However, then again, lots of houses have dampness and mold too. So it's probably hard to disentangle the two effects.

Anyway, yeah, getting out of the house is already on the order of things to do. I'm looking at buying too but I may not have enough money for that.
