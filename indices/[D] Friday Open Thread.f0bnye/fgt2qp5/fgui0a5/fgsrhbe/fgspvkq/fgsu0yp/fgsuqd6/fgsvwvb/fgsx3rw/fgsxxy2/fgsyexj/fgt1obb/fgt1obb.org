Yeah, I'm aware. "Oxford's average house prices are 11 times higher than the salaries of the people who work in the city." I said that [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a9e41g/rtadj_wip_hpmor_prequel_mary_poppins_begins_the/eco3ool/?context=10000][in a comment]] like 14 months ago (has it seriously been over a year already?).

I accidentally got in the habit of wasting time by watching youtube videos of text-to-speech bots reading reddit comments. Terrible habit, I know. But from doing that I've found that it seems to be a common thing that people in Europe have silly ideas about the concept of distance because it only takes you people like an hour to drive to a different country whereas in the States we'd have to drive like five hours just to get to a different state. My mom drives 55 minutes to work every day.

So I took a break from this comment and I've been on Google Maps for like 15 minutes finding all the cities big enough to register when zoomed out to a reasonable level, taking a random sampling of air quality at intervals of cities separated by about 45 minutes of driving, and, um, /it appears that the entire flipping country of England kinda sorta sucks shit,/ especially the southern half/three-quarters. Like, it doesn't matter where you live in England, pollution is higher than it should be in just about every city big enough to qualify as a city and not a town, so you really can't even make your decision on where to move based on air quality unless you're willing to live in the middle of the countryside 30 minutes from the nearest grocery store in a town with more sheep than humans. Why the hell is your country's air quality so terrible?

I guess don't bother about the /where/ specifically and just focus on looking for jobs in areas with better "cost of living" stats and more modern housing?
