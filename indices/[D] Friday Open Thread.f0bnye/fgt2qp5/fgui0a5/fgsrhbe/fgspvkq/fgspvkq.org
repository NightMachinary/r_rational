Real talk - I feel quite a bit stressed about this all and I need to vent, plus any experience/advice would be welcome.

The recent Coronavirus situation has made me rethink a lot about my health situation. I'm not panicking about this virus specifically - it's just that it made me realise how in practice I'm likely to be quite vulnerable from a respiratory point of view, be it any new strange diseases or the good ol' flu. I've been living in the Oxford area for years now, and apparently this is quite the polluted zone. This has taken a toll as now I've got adult onset asthma, albeit a relatively light form, that has me on preventer inhalers all the time. My doctor says that it's unlikely to ever go away as long as I live here. This kind of thing can't be good - no one has ever mentioned the C- word yet, but I doubt frankly breathing in pollution all the time does wonders for my long term chances in that sense either. I've been considering moving away for a while now. The problem is, to move I would likely need to change jobs, and that's a bit of a toughie.

I'm a scientist and currently I work in a research council. Job wise this might be possibly the best position for me - it's not perfect, but I have no teaching burdens and get a lot of freedom in my projects and managing my time, which is something I cherish. If I were to leave here, it'd be unlikely I could find another job in a similar position while staying in the UK. So it'd be either the private sector, or trying for academia. Thing is, the first option worries me that I might find myself frustrated with a job where I'm much more constrained and have less opportunities to actually apply my knowledge in full; the second option seems far more attractive on the face of it, but it means throwing myself into the whirlwind of crazy competitiveness that universities have become as of late, and in the end working my ass off and suffering through a lot of stress I'm not sure I'd be able to take in order to end up becoming almost only an administrator, writing grant requests all the time, which seems to be what most professors do once they progress enough in their career.

Does anyone here have personal experience of either environment? What is your take on their pros/cons? Mind you, both options would likely be better paid than my current job, so that's not the issue. It's more a matter of long term satisfaction and happiness. I may be underestimating for example the level of stress I can take because in these last times I felt very weak/lethargic. Maybe a job that interests me more could energise me. As I am now, I have a really hard time imagining that in 10 years I'd have the strength to cope with a very stressful job that I could barely handle now, but that might be a wrong impression.
