I've been reading about the topic of "learning to read" for about a year now. Apparently, "common knowledge" /and/ expert consensus both say that kids should begin to be taught how to read at around six or seven years old. That sort of makes me feel sick in the pit of my soul. Like, any faith I may have had in the ability of cultural transmission to properly propagate the stuff that actually matters? Gone. Something major has to be going wrong somewhere for the world to look the way it looks.

So I have a few questions:

- How old were you when you learned how to read?

- How did you acquire the ability to read?

Secondarily (this is not my main concern but it's somewhat related and I'm curious):

- How much of your early childhood can you legitimately remember?

I've got more that I've typed out over the last two weeks (and I guess there's a doc from like 6 months ago from the last time I intended to make a post about this topic but didn't follow through), and last night I turned on the light a few times to jot down some thoughts in the notebook I keep on my bed, but I'm thinking I should just leave it at this for now and see if anybody even bothers responding.
