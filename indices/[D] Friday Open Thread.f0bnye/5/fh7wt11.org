Aside from Petrov day I don't have any good days to celebrate. I was inspired by the recently shared video about fake martial arts I am tempted to add a day to celebrate Xu Xiaodong's relentless pursuit to empirically exposing falsehood in front of immense cultural and social pressure and at great personal cost. Does anyone know when his first match against that tai chi guy was? Earliest sources I can find are from May 5th 2017 but none of them mention when the match actually was scheduled.
