If you're doing the naive-utilitarian thing and just trying to be better than the extra-tragic foster system for the largest number of daughters, then you can safely aim towards the dozen+.

Of course that's not going to be a very fun rest of your life, or very rewarding (your daughters' childhoods will only be pleasant in a relative sense). And if you're a saint out to maximize utility you could just buy malaria nets.
