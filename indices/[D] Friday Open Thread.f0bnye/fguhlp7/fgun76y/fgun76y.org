Encourage scientific topics: Computer science Biology Engineering Large sample health and nutrition intervention studies Gene therapies (part of biology, but worth putting twice)

Commercial business is great at making products a reality once they see the idea in academia, so those fields have great cost/benefit for the general population. The overwhelming majority of nutrition and health studies are either just correlations or have low sample size so they can't detect small effects or nuanced responses.

Practice: Database of research in progress and studies that didn't succeed, just simple ongoing logs with a "failed due to X" at the end would be great. Very useful for academia as a whole. Reduce barriers for "illegal" drug research.
