  The recent Coronavirus situation has made me rethink a lot about my health situation. I'm not panicking about this virus specifically - it's just that it made me realise how in practice I'm likely to be quite vulnerable from a respiratory point of view, be it any new strange diseases or the good ol' flu.

I realize this isn't addressing your question - others seem to have already done this - but I did want to chime in specifically about the infectious disease angle.

Both SARS and MERS are coronaviruses, and the current outbreak looks likely to go the same way, if the same protections are kept in play.

These, as well as influenza, spread in a very similar way - hand to hand. Use gloves when opening doors, and knuckles rather than fingertips to push elevator buttons. Frequently clean your hands with soap and water by vigorously scrubbing for around 30 seconds. Try to keep your hands away from eyes, nose, and mouth unless they've been recently cleaned.

Clean hands will not entirely protect you, but they do greatly reduce exposure.

If a vaccination becomes available, by all means get that done as well.
