  Very damp and mouldy.

I bet that's at least 70% of your problem right there.

  Moisture is one of the most important and least recognized indoor pollutants, affecting both human health and the health of the building. The most common moisture problems arise when warm moist air encounters a cool surface such as a mirror, window, or the wall of a cooler space. Cooler air can hold less moisture, so the excess condenses in droplets on the surface. Where moisture collects, so do mold, mildew, and dust mites, which can cause asthma or allergies, destroy wood products, and accelerate the rusting of metal building components. High indoor humidity can also facilitate “off-gassing” of toxins in furniture or cleaning products.

[[https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/take-action-climate-readiness-and-indoor-air-quality][The EPA recommends using a dehumidifier to control indoor moisture levels and mold.]] [EDIT: A good dehumidifier will probably cost you a couple hundred bucks.]

I didn't think you needed to move, but you actually might. Buy a dehumidifier to tide you over until you can get someone to come inspect your house and see if your moisture problem can be resolved. You might also want to consider getting someone to inspect your HVAC system. If your moisture problem can't be resolved, then you definitely ought to move. It might have a lot less to do with Oxford's pollution levels and a lot more to do with the fact that most homes in Oxford are like a hundred years old.
