  Why the hell is your country's air quality so terrible?

Apparently, geographical configuration. The whole area is shaped like a bowl, and so all the crap that's produced around doesn't disperse, but instead settles at the bottom (which by the way is basically... Oxford) and stagnates. Or at least that's what I've been repeatedly told. We're not big on wind either.

And frankly when I mention moving I'm looking straight up to either northern England or Scotland. Otherwise, as you mention, it's not even worth the bother.
