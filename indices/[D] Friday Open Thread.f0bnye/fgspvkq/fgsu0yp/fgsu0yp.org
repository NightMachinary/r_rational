Have you looked into mitigating the direct personal effects of pollution yet?

Basically, shore up your diet to get more antioxidants and omega 3 fatty acids, don't do cardio outside during peak traffic hours (but /do/ perform cardio indoors to strengthen your lungs), shower after being outside to wash the pollutants off your skin, don't drive with your windows down, blah blah blah lots of common sense stuff amounting to "reduce your exposure and get healthier."

You could also look into supplementing with things shown to reduce asthmatic symptoms, like black cumin:

*But have you turned your attention inwards?* Specifically towards the interior of your home, where you feel safest?

  According to the Environmental Protection Agency, the top five air quality problems in the U.S. are all indoor air problems.

I'd imagine this is almost certainly also the case in the U.K.

  Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are emitted as gases from certain solids or liquids. VOCs include a variety of chemicals, some of which may have short- and long-term adverse health effects. Concentrations of many VOCs are consistently higher indoors (up to ten times higher) than outdoors. VOCs are emitted by a wide array of products numbering in the thousands.

  Organic chemicals are widely used as ingredients in household products. Paints, varnishes and wax all contain organic solvents, as do many cleaning, disinfecting, cosmetic, degreasing and hobby products. Fuels are made up of organic chemicals. All of these products can release organic compounds while you are using them, and, to some degree, when they are stored.

  EPA's Office of Research and Development's "Total Exposure Assessment Methodology (TEAM) Study" (Volumes I through IV, completed in 1985) found levels of about a dozen common organic pollutants to be 2 to 5 times higher inside homes than outside, regardless of whether the homes were located in rural or highly industrial areas. TEAM studies indicated that while people are using products containing organic chemicals, they can expose themselves and others to very high pollutant levels, and elevated concentrations can persist in the air long after the activity is completed.

Do you own an "ionizing air purifier"?

If you haven't already taken steps to reduce your own indoor air pollution, moving away from Oxford won't have as much of an effect as you think it will. Like, it ought to be common sense to not spray things into the air, but people do it anyways. If you haven't already banned Febreze and scented candles and perfume and cologne and sprayable deodorant and sprayable Lysol from your home then do so.

And as far as lethargy/fatigue, you should be taking creatine. I've finally convinced my mother to start taking creatine and she's been taking it for a few months and she's noted a significant reduction in fatigue.
