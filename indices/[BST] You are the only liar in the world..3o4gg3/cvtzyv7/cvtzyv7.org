I try to avoid lying whenever possible. I may share with a single trusted confidant my ability to lie, after getting them to promise not to tell, and talk with them about it from that point on. I record the promise, just in case they, too, are a liar, in which case we have a mutually assured destruction. I then tell them that I made such a recording, either after the promise, but before I tell them my secret. I always ask them for guidance before any lie. lying is like necromancy (well, most representations,) or diabolism... it can be used well, but generally shouldn't be treated lightly.

I try to avoid using my powers, prefering to use wording where even if it is a lie, it could be mistaken for twisty wording that is technichally true. there's probably a concept like this- not liars, but twisties, or some similar, but better, name. people who try to make you think they said something, but actually said something completely different, much like the fae or characters in pact.

generally, I would avoid making promises. I would lie about the past on occasion, but never about the future- getting that paper by thursday is difficult. If I made a promise, it would be as vauge as possible. not "I'll get you that paper by thursday" but "I'll get you that paper as soon as practical, without interfering with my ability to function on the other tasks" or "as soon as the other deadlines are fulfilled." or just "I can get you that paper by wednesday".

I would claim that my hesitation to make specific promises is because I don't like being dragged into awkward situations, like pulling an all-nighter four days straight to finish said paper. given that honest people actually don't like stuff like this, i wouldn't be looked at that oddly- everyone hesitates to commit, genuinely pausing. it's ingrained, and after a few slip ups in elementary, middle and high school, most people don't make the mistake again. people include a lot of conditions in their promises for that reason.

I suspect that there will be people who suspect i'm a liar, but given that i'm the only one known in 7 billion, they may hesitate, excusing it away, or react the same way they would if they told someone else i'm an alien.

(my family probably knows about the inability to pre-commit, though... 5 year olds have poor judgement. unless kids are generally exempt, which would kinda make sense... commiting to do something literally impossible may make you push yourself far further than you should. maybe self-deception works, or your body shuts down automatically before when ours would if we tried that? or there's just a precommitance every child is told to make, where if their path to the commitment seriously endangers their health, they won't do it,and this commitment last until they're [16-18?])
