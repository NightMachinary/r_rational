...Not really?

There /is/ a Liar about.

Potential converts /may well be/ selected at random, at least in part. (edit: /and/ I threw that line in at the time to fit the genre more than as a practical suggestion. If they were selected based on specific criteria you researched ahead of time, you can tell them that, too. Or skip the justification entirely, whatever, they're still /at very least/ as gullible as real-world people.)

How "standard" a procedure is is fairly subjective; it's certainly true enough for our purposes once you've done it a /few/ times.

And that last line is of course optional in the case that a subject is, for some reason, /not/ perfect for the organization (by way of being a normal, /programmable/ member of productive society). How you cover your tracks in such a case is left as an excercise for the reader.

All this to say that once you have /some/ followers, you don't even need to recruit personally. You have people for that!
