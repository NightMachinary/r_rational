The worst thing for normal people living in this world is that they are essentially slaves to their past selves. Imagine if you promise to support what seems the greatest cause and then learn that said cause is crap. Or if you say you'll do something impossible because you don't yet know it is impossible. Or worse yet, something that was really easy but has become really hard ("I'll kiss your cousin Jimmy tomorrow" and cousin Jimmy drowns in the middle of the Atlantic).

How does memory work? Can you forget parts of your promises over time? If someone has amnesia will he try to fulfill all his past promises without knowing what the hell he is doing?

Honestly, it seems like every promise about the future will make you into an automaton. Because fulfilling "I will give you that paper on Thursday" makes you not only write it till Thursday but also try to evade every mishap that could happen and minimize the chance that the paper will never reach its destination. That includes things like making as many copies as possible, minimizing the chances of both your own death and that of your recipient in any way you can think of and probably hovering near the recipient so you can give him the paper on 00:00:01 Tuesday.

I think you should rethink how the future statements part works.
