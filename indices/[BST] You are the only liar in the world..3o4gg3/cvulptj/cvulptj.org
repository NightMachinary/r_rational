"I have a marginally better investment strategy than anyone else, and can provide a better return on long term investments."

"I have promised to not reveal my methods, as that would mean giving up my competitive advantage."

"I also agree to the terms of the contract."

"No, officer, I have nothing to do with that person. We are not related in any way."

"My name is Alex, and I inherited this pile of money from a deceased relative."

In a world where lying is impossible, the law will change to reflect that. It's probably legally impossible to convict a secret lier for a crime - if you say that you didn't do it, the law sees that as very strong evidence that you actually didn't.

Contract law would reflect that, too. Agree to a contract verbally, and everyone will trust that you'll keep to the terms.

Plus, a regular person might literally be bound to be unable to explain or justify their actions.

You can also impersonate anyone - ID means asking someone to introduce themselves. Identity checking means asking a short series of carefully engineered questions, and arresting those who refuse to answer.

All combined, you could rob banks just by talking to them. You are also the only person in the world who can be a spy - an amazing advantage in any kind of conflict. Don't worry about being bad at it, because counterintelligence doesn't exist and no one can doubt anything you say.

With money, military victory, and the ability to betray others, you will be able to gain power and set yourself up to rule.

However... Compared to others, you're lazy, weak willed, and unable to truly commit. You might get stuck with bad habits, incorrect beliefs, or unwanted emotions. You will never receive any help for or even understanding of these problems.
