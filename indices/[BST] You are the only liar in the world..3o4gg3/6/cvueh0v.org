I feel like a world where nobody could lie would express itself more as honesty than as physical coercion. If the world is still full of humans, they will fall prey to things like the planning fallacy all the time.

So either declarative statements like "I will get you this by Friday" are commonly understood to mean that this is your intent and your best guess of what will happen - or languages evolve such that "It is my belief that given an expected sequence of events and accurate knowledge of both my own capabilities and the difficulties ahead that this will occur on Friday" will take much less time to say!

If you plan to trick someone into saying "this will be done by Friday" and they had a normal human understanding of risk and chance, consider that for most people a strong declarative statement like that would actually be a lie!
