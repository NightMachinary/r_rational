Well it makes for a society a great deal more productive than ours right now. Everyone is more healthy, caring, and -of course- more exploited to a degree. Also everyone is better at polit-speak than Hillary Clinton - if you stil want to be able to communicate without committing you need to be extremely careful what you say.

"I will go the gym every day for a year for at least one hour". BAM everyone is fit.

I will have that paper ready for you on tuesday. - bam no more missed deadlines-

I will not every again steal - bam no prisons-

I will not order my military to fire nuclear weapon on your country unless you do any of the following: -not reciprocating, defecting etc etc- bam no nuclear war

I'd disagree with this being able to write your utility function... Saying "I will be attracted to mewtwo-kin starting from next friday" does not mean you will be attracted, only that you will make an attempt at conversion- by reading porn/whatever- but it is no more or less successful than our world today is.

So liars... They probably get caught early in life, and brandmarked- and then special pressganged into roles that need liars- giant corporation negotiations, war negotiations etc- so you'd first have to avoid that.
