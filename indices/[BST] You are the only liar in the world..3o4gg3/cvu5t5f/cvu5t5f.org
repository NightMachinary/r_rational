The "write access to their utility functions" - their /economic/ utility functions, not their stated preferences - is a superpower in it's own right, and maybe a better one than mine. I'm pretty lazy.

Presumably delusional people still exist, so I can't claim just anything and have people believe it. I'd probably still have trouble starting a religion or becoming President.

This society would have no need of credentials of any kind, which means I can pretend to be a cop or any other kind of official.

I suspect most people would abuse the ability to edit their utility function and mess themselves up. I don't just mean simple screwups, I mean things like suicide bombers, I'd-kill-for-you /true/ love, and deontological rules. So this society *has* to have found a way around that; it might be as simple as an unrealistic oath simply feeling like a lie - "huh, I guess I actually don't care that much, sorry" - or it might not have evolved into anything even vaguely resembling our culture, something more like a society of self-modifying AIs, in which case I'm not going to be much help.

I can probably scam people out of their money fairly easily, if I'm careful. Or murder them.

It's probably much easier to argue people into things. I don't even need to lie, really. Just ask them what they really care about, why they really object to something, why they really believe what they believe. Then construe or twist the evidence and fast-talk that thing away, or into supporting me instead.

Depending on how humble I'm feeling, I could set up a bunch of Effective Altruists who've sworn oaths, or a bunch of EAs who've sworn oaths and will obey me without question.

There's probably a good way to hack this into really good scientific/rationalist "cells" of a few people, who've sworn to listen to each other, pay attention to niggling doubts, try and test their beliefs, maximize utility, stuff like that. Basically a Bayesian built out of three or four people.
