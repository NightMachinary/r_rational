Why? A culture like the one I gave seems like it would be pretty successful. You could avoid contracts by promising not to make promises, but another culture that promises undying loyalty would be able to win a war.

Come to think of it, you could just promise not to pledge your loyalty if they try to torture it out of you. I don't think it would be difficult to get kids to make the promise, though, so such a culture would be stable, and they would be able to dominate a culture that doesn't use promises.
