Once someone is old enough to make contracts, they are coerced into pledging their undying loyalty to the Empire. With that many people trying that hard to make sure the Emperor is happy, I'm not going to outsmart them all. I'm doomed. Once I gain the ability to lie, people notice my productivity suddenly drop, and have me tested. I'm tortured into saying some trivial falsehood, and since I don't have the willpower to resist torture, I'm caught and executed.
