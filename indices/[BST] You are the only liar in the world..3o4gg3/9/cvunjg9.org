Thw society and conversation rules would look very alien in this world, and you will have hard time adjusting if you just materialized there. It would be a huge culture shock, you will seem crazy. You will casualy ask questions that force people into months-long comitements, you will tell much too much about yourself and your plans, like you are some superhuman selfassured boasting jerk.

If you grew up there - you will probably be a loser - just because every other kid HAD to do their homework, and HAD to learn for exam, and you didn't. Are there even exams and do they ever check homework? It may be very late when they discover how far you are behind, because the society isn't prepared for kids that can pretend they do their work. In this respect your special ability is a huge disadvantage - everybody will be better at everything than you, unless you are 100% motivated to be good at that thing.

Anyway - at some point you will fall behind, so you'll probably learn to give good excuses, and eventually nothing external will work, so you will probably be considered dumber than average.

Also there is no fiction teaching people how to succesfuly deceive others on this world (and probably no games with imperfect knowledge and bluffing) so you will still be quite naive compared to a human from our world.

I'd say you should pracits small scale deception, and then completely change einvoronment to leave back your "loser" image and all suspictions people who knew you have about you, before you use your deception skills on fresh victims.

And then you won't need anything exceptional - any con trick that works on our world would probably work there better.
