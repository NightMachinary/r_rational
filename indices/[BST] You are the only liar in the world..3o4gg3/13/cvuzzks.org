It really depends on how the power works. Does your brain chemistry change to give you magical willpower when you promise something, or does it become perfectly calibrated before you say something so that instead of saying "I'll finish this paper" you say "I'll have a 20% chance of finishing this paper", or can you tell the future, so you can only say "I will finish this paper" if it will happen in the future.
