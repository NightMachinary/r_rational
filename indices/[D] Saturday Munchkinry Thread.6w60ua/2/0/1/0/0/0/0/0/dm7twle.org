NP-hard is a measurement of computation time, not of mathematical difficulty (of which I don't think there is an objective measurement). Factorization quickly is difficult, factorization given arbitrary amounts of time is so easy you can teach a third grader to do it. If I can write an algorithm for how to do something in less than 20 lines using only basic arithmetic, I consider that to be mathematically easy.
