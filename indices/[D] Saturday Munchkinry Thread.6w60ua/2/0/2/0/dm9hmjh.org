First I don't think people can talk omegalish well enough to be considered a omegaish speaker by the magic. You can't use it in most contexts where English speakers ask questions so think you don't pass the threshold of being roughly as good talking it as the average english speaker speaks english In the np example not being able to use big numbers was a problem but you could still memorice a lot of numbers putting you barely on the treshold . I guess that boundary is too vague and I shouldn't use it to discard solutions that I dont like. .Another problem is that speaking omegalish requires extra information that the humans speaking it dont necessarily have, humans can't speak Omegaish , even whith infinite time and memory which is . Also normal languages don't depend on some sentence being true for some combination of words to be correct , and in fact here you have combinations of words(like "what time is it?" ) that can be correct a given moment and then stop being a correct translation , wich makes the language so diferent from normal ones than it wouldnt be recongised as a language by a magic translator that was desinged for human languajes . So i could argue that Omegalish wouldnt work , but lets say it does since I guess as its written my proposal technically doens't disalow it . In that case I wouldn't risk asking for world domination to a unknown process that you don't know if its aligned with your preferences , and that you don't even know what criterion it uses for deciding whats the "answer" of a question.
