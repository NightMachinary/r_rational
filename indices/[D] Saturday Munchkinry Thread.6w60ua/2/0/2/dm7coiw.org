Well, why stop at NP?

Create a language Omegalish that is English, except every question has its answer appended.

For example, "What is one plus one?" in English becomes "What is one plus one foobar two?" in Omegalish.

Teach 100 people this language. Now your translator power effectively grants you omniscience.

Want to get rich? Convert the question "What is the optimal way for me to get rich?" from English into Omegalish.

Want to take over the world? Convert the question "What is the optimal way for me to take over the world?" from English into Omegalish.
