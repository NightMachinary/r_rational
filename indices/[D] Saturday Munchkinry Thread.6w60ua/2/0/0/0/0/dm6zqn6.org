Well, you're the one who posed the problem in the first place, so what you say, goes... but I do think there's something of an issue with specifying arbitrary languages and then just assuming humans are capable of speaking it. Basically, [[/u/GemOfEvan]] replaced the "at least 100 humans need to speak it" requirement with "it's possible /in principle/ for a human with an arbitrary amount of time to translate back and forth from this new language and a natural one", and the two criteria don't exactly coincide in my mind (the second criterion means that literally any Turing-complete language is permissible, and that turns the power from "magical translation" to "a halting oracle").

Side note: The question of how to munchkin a halting oracle is also an interesting one, but I'm not sure it's what you were asking for.
