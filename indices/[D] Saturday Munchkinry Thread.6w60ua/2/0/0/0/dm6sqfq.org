The 100 persons have to be able to more or less understand each other talking it( they have to be able to communicate more or less the same amount of information the average English speaker can communicate to other English speakers, this is a static variable that doesnt depend on the current number of English speakers as defined by the magic) , they have to think of it as a different language and their brain has to store it the way brains store new languages(so you can't arbitrarily decide something is a different language) .Also at least 1/4 of the world population has to not be able to understand it(so gestures and body language don't count).Once something is considered a language it isn't enough for someone to say a word thinking of it as for exaple English in order for the translation to work if that word isn't recognized as English by most English speakers, 100 English speakers have to agree that it's a English word to count as English . The English +extra rule that the Np solving idea proposed would count as a variation of English so you wouldn't be able to translate it to English but you could translate it to any other language so it would still work.
