This works in any language(even if you invented it , as log as it counts as a valid language)and it has nearly unlimited computing power , so don't give up so easily.I can think of some useful munchking options. Alien detection Is one , if it wasn't because it only works in human minds , but in a fantasy setting you could certainly use it to get information from what languages exist , and what kind of things have human minds ( since in fantasy settings everithing sentient has a basically human mind)
