Munchkin magical translation from any language into any other language . Something counts as a language only if at least 100 persons know how to Speak it.(edit now you have to take over the world whith it or at least get big amounts of money and or power, other creative uses of the power are still ok , but try to think how to exploit them). (EDIT rules of what counts as a language added)

The 100 humans(they have to have minds that are humankind enough for the magic to detect them as users) have to be able to more or less understand each other talking it( they have to be able to communicate more or less the same amount of information the average English speaker can communicate to other English speakers, this is a static variable that doesnt depend on the current number of English speakers as defined by the magic) , they have to think of it as a different language and their brain has to store it the way brains store new languages(so you can't arbitrarily decide something is a different language) .Also at least 1/4 of the world population has to not be able to understand it(so gestures and body language don't count).Once something is considered a language it isn't enough for someone to say a word thinking of it as for exaple English in order for the translation to work if that word isn't recognized as English by most English speakers, 100 English speakers have to agree that it's a English word to count as English .
