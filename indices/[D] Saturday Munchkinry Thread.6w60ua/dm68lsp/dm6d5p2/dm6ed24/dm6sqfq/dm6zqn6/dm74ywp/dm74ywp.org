Well I 100 humans need to speak it but the way I considered what speak means if you are able to speak English words they technically are able to speak English+ extra rule good enough to count , and I didn't specify how fast they would have to be able to talk . sure even if how to muncking a halting Oracle is fun , and I will post it as a separate prompt(in fact I put unlimited computing power which is not the same but it's similar in the last thread , only that it was too late and few people saw it) it's not exactly what's being munckined here and I don't think it really would work whith current rules (is speaking a language but not being able to say any big number without time and effort talking the language? I'm not sure, I would have to define how munch someone has to know of a language to count as a speaker more concretely)I imagine the magic as having really big amounts of computing power ,so if you find some other way to exploit that uses languages that humans could realistically talk fluently it will work. It's just that I didn't really explain that clearly what counts as speaking a language before he posted that comment so I counted it as valid anyway to avoid retroatively making ideas not work.
