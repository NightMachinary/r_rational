Of course you can understand the speaker after some time. If I said "foobar twenty", after a bit of thought you would know it means "two, two, five".

This isn't much different from hard to understand things in real languages. Take "Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo" for example. Understanding it takes time, but you can and it is English.

For a math based example, look at the French word "quatre-vingt douze", which literally means 4*20 + 12. A listener would then understand it means 92.
