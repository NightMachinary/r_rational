  theoretically, anyone with an understanding of the rule and some time can understand our "foobar" phrases.

No, they can't. Anyone who knows the rule can /produce/ such phrases, but another speaker would not be able to understand the first speaker because understanding the phrase would be NP-hard.

If speakers of the "language" can't understand it, it may be ineligible for being considered a language at all.
