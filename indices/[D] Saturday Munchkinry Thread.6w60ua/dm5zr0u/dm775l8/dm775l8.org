We only need to pay the interest and a little extra to pay off the principle as far as wattage goes, so if you can generate 25% of the wattage you're getting from the bank and constantly pumping it into the connection points you can triple your energy output in the short term. Use that to invest in yet more energy production until you hit something like a dyson swarm. Once you're self-sufficient for any need you might have, pay back everything you owe.
