Some ideas:

- If paying back loans early is allowed, two connection points could be setup to transfer energy between them without power losses. Put one near the equator with large amounts of solar panels, and one near giant cities.

- Do we receive interest on the overproduction of electricity (a.k.a. our bank account) If we get 10-15%, I'm sure we can get find funding to invest a few trillion dollar into more power generation. If not, we'll start our own bank and charge only 19%.

- Dyson sphere with a connection point included solves the energy transfer problem.

- Connection points on mars and the moon will rapidly increase our collonization efforts.

- We can get rid of our pollution coal power plants. Maybe even the gas plants, to keep these fossil fuels in the earth and lower global warming.

- Also aliens exist and have FTL travel and communication. They probably have a lot of advanced technology we could buy/trade for.
