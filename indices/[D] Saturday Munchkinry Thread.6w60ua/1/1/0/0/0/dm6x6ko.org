If we define it as "having forgotten something which would cause you to immediately change what you're doing if you remember it" then a Remembrall could potentially be quite useful. Grab it just before you leave home, before you leave work, before you go to sleep, etc. With that criteria, it shouldn't always go off, but it should warn you if you've left the oven on, forgot to set your alarm clock, etc.
