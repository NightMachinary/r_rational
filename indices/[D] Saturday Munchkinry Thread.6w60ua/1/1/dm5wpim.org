One problem is that Remembralls CAN be made in real life. So if you can munchkin one to conquer the world or make a trillion dollar industry, you might as well just do it instead of posting the idea on reddit lol.

The simple reason is that you are ALWAYS forgetting something. ALWAYS. So just make a ball of smoke with a motion sensor, to glow red when touched. Now you have a remembrall!

(Just make sure to keep it away from people with photographic memory.)
