Let me know if someone's done this already:

You have one (1) Remembrall: it is a clear hollow glass sphere about 10 cm in diameter with translucent white smoke inside. The smoke turns red when someone who is currently holding it forgets something, and turns white again about 5 seconds later. It does not tell you what you have forgotten, and it only works as a complete unit - you can't e.g. take the smoke out and use it for FTL signaling. You also don't have other Harry Potter magic. Basically it is a really specific brain machine interface that works on unknown principles.

I'm not sure if the great JK Rowling specified what it means to be holding something or forgetting something, so I'd probably munchkin away from there? Conquer the world, make a trillion dollar industry, discover the meaning of life, whatever you can figure out.
