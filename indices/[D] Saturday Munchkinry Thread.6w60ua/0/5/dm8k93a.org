As others have said, galactic energy banking system basically solves all energy distribution problems we may have. Take out loans where you need energy, and generate energy where it's convenient.

Short-term, missions to Mars are suddenly much easier. Methane for rocket fuel generated via Sabatier reaction will take days to make, not months (what spacex is planning to do in near future). Dyson swarm of solar power satellites in orbit near sun are now viable. Ion propulsion for interstellar missions is doable, although the size of access points is prohibitive for small probes.

I'm thinking the only time we should take out a loan is to bootstrap solar panel production for the first batch of Dyson swarm solar satellites, although having the option is good in case of natural diaasters. All in all, the ability to take loans is insignificant compared to the existence of galaxy-wide energy distribution system.
