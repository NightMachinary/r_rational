Some aliens come by Earth and give the UN access to the galactic energy banking system.

With it, a civilization is able to take out "energy loans" in the form of electrical energy. These loans come with 20% APR, meaning for every gigajoule of energy loaned, you must pay ~6.34 watts of power in interest until the loan is repaid.

In addition, Earth is only certified to take out loans up to 5x the energy it produces in a year. Every year, an appraiser from the galactic bank will come to scan Earth and re-certify our loan limit. The appraiser is not a computer and will only take into account power facilities made in good faith.

To access the galactic energy banking system, the UN receives schematics to create connection points. These facilities are about the same price to build and size as a modern nuclear power plant. These facilities produce power at an adjustable rate as long as they are allowed to take out more loans. These facilities also accept electrical power to pay for interest / repay the loans.

The alien bankers are understanding and will allow for a grace period in the case of disasters. However, they reserve the right to deny loans and have the ability to put a lien on Earth's power production in the case of a default.

You have been appointed the UN Chief of Electrical Finance. You are the only human able to approve of energy loans and can distribute them as you wish to different facilities. You also have a lot of sway in producing an energy plan for the Earth. Also, you have access to see current loan amounts, interest due, as well as usages and payment history of each facility.

With this new found source of energy capital, how can you advance humanity into a new age?
