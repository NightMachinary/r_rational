  I don't think power is all you need to colonize a planet

It isn't "all you need", but it solves a ton of problems, or makes them much easier. With power from Earth, you can start growing food in artificial farms, using heaters/air conditioners to control the temperature, using artificial sunlight, using air purifiers to get rid of dust, etc. You can recycle water much more easily by boiling it and re-condensing it. Or electrolyzing and burning it. Or pumping it through various filters. Oxygen is also solved by the artificial farm.

For the rocky planets/moons, you can even use the power to drill underground, allowing you to build underground bases that are protected from the planet's weather storms or meteors.
