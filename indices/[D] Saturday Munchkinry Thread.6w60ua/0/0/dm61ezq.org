Oh! This one is easy. Since they are galactic aliens, it stands to reason that you can take out a loan anywhere in the solar system, and repay it from Earth.

Build a connection point on Earth and another one on every planetary body in the solar system. Then this galactic bank effectively allows you to transfer as much electricity as you want from Earth to another planet (and back if you want to build nuclear power plants on other planets). This massive amount of electricity would allow us to quickly colonize or even terraform our entire solar system.
