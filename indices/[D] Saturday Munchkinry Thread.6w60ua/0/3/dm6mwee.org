Since we have contact with advanced aliens we can be pretty sure that any energy our entire civ might want would be basically chump change for type 2 civs meaning taking out loans seems a bad idea. So your best bet is to try to sell some other resource such as minerals which might of relatively little value to them but would still be much more valuable to them than any amount of energy humanity could want for the foreseeable future (for instance ice has hydrogen making even a relatively small amount of it worth enough to fulfill our energy needs).\\
So I think the best plan is probably to sell mineral rights for the outer solar system (say the oort cloud and kuiper belt) for a staggering amount of credit. Then use that to buy the necessary tech to start disassembling mercury and setting up your own dyson sphere. Using the energy to build massive ships powered by connection points which can presumably draw upon our credit and not just take out loans. These ships would probably be used as our primary spaceships until we really got a sizeable swarm of statites around the sun which would beam their energy to a larger craft equipped with a connector.
