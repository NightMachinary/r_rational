Still Scott was obviously pulling his punches somewhat when it came to exploiting the powers, for instance by excluding superintelligence.\\
Another thing which I think he probably left out is that you could generate vastly more energy by exploiting Red's thermodynamics violating regeneration than you could having him run a generator. For instance by using the materials from his body to perform fusion or just feeding it to a tiny black hole that produces useful amounts of hawking radiation.

Of course Green would be much better by every account since they could turn a generator by changing from a smaller form into a blue whale (or better yet a new creature designed to be as large as possible while still counting as an animal) and back. Or if injuries don't transfer between forms and material separated from the body sticks around then you can generate vastly greater amounts of fusion material/black hole fuel.
