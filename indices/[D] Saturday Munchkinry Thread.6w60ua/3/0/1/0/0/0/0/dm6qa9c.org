One day, your head scientist tells Red that for the sake of humanity, there is a much better way than simply spinning a turbine: he should simply allow the scientists to cut up large chunks of his body or drain his blood and throw them into a black hole. Compared to the energy from spinning a turbine, harvesting Red-matter is far, far more profitable.

Red thinks he is under attack and punches the scientist, instantly turning the scientist into a cloud of blood and gore.

Your next attempt is more careful. An elite negotiator is sent, attempting to talk sense into Red. Red still stubbornly refuses to cooperate. You decide, to hell with it, /it's not like Red needs to be conscious for his regenerative ability to work./

Tranquilizers are fired, and Red is put to sleep. Permanently. The next few millenniums are a breeze. The universe is filled with massive amounts of energy from all the Red-matter harvested from the unconscious Red.

Then one day, a tiny mistake occurs. The dosage of tranquilizer is insufficient. Red awakens, enraged by the fact that he has been attacked. Using his super strength and speed, he destroys everyone and everything around him. Your forces corner Red, you must get him sedated again. Red sees no way to escape and decides to make his own, punching down walls with his BRUTE STRENGTH.

Unfortunately, what Red doesn't realize is that there are no planets anymore. Such constructs are a massive waste of energy. Instead, everyone lives aboard space stations that are carefully insulated from the outside emptiness of space.

Red punches a hole in the wall and falls out of the space station, dying in the vacuum of space. The space station is quickly repaired so the other inhabitants don't immediately die, but now there is no way to combat negentropy. Humanity mourns its now inevitable demise.

Black, aboard another space station somewhere in the cosmos, is eventually contacted. He destroys the entire timeline, going back to the era before Red-matter. He relays strict orders from the future: DO NOT ATTEMPT TO HARVEST RED-MATTER.
