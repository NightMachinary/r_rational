You're thinking about things as still being dominated by human level intelligences in a cliched sci-fi setting, however if you don't make that assumption then there is no real issue.

The singularity intelligence merely convinces red to plug into a virtual world that is paradise for him, while his blood is drained in the real world at a steady rate. Red never has any hope to rebel because his thoughts are monitored by nanomachines so the GAI always has perfect knowledge of how to manipulate him in whatever direction it wishes, though it's not like he would even want to leave his comfortable digital utopia. After all by now all of the quadrillions of minds in existence are simulated anyway, whereas the physical world is a boring cold place just a bunch of computronium arranged in a shell around the mini black hole. Though the computronium is constantly upgrading as the empty universe continues cooling. Since the landauer limit is inversely related to temperature so given a fixed amount of energy being extracted by Red the available processing continuously increases over time.\\
Plus even if Red were unable to be convinced by any means the nanomachines in his body can control him if the need arises his regen not protecting him from all his neurons, muscles and the like being hijacked with some electrical stimulation by the ever present nanobots.

However now that I'm thinking more seriously about this I don't actually think Red would be the primary source of energy, since he can only be used to run a single fusion generator. No actually I think Blue and Black both have obvious methods of vastly exceeding Red's output:

- Black: It's easy to forget but obtaining information requires energy, and if you know about Maxwell's demon you should be able to start to see how you can use these powers to create energy. It's honestly hard to imagine what kind of complex arrangement would be used to most efficiently transfer back the information best usable to get the most free computation and energy but a superintelligence would find the best way.\\
  Inevitably Black probably lives the gamut of human experiences during the early era of the universe, but eventually like most people he slowly improves his intelligence to open up new novel experiences. Eventually as a superintelligence himself he is either merged with the primary superintelligence, or he most likely agrees to use his power to bring back incomprehensibly large messages that can be used to exploit thermodynamic work. If he still needs the powers to be stored in a biological brain, then that remains a small part of his total mind and is reworked entirely towards maximizing information throughput.

- Blue: Even assuming you can't do time travel this is still pretty damned useful. By the time Blue's powers are of use like Black she probably went down the route of superintelligence. Since she cannot be physically harmed the interface with her larger electronic mind is probably achieved via nanomachines connected with her neurons and interfaced wirelessly with computronium.\\
  Her powers ultimately provide so much output it's unclear there is ultimately any real use to bothering with any of the others. Since she can easily teleport anywhere and have no relative motion compared to her new location, all she has to do is teleport constantly. Adopting the speed of some adjacent streams of high energy radiation used for reference, and the infrared radiation from her body is blue-shifted to create gamma rays that are as powerful as possible without creating a kugelblitz (since the resulting black hole would be far too large to produce useful amounts of hawking radiation). Through this she will be able to output amounts of energy that nevertheless exceed the outputs of most galaxies at the very least, since the energy density of the relevant kugelblitz would be utterly insane.\\
  EDIT: Now that I think about it I'm already thinking of like a million ways you could probably circumvent the kugelblitz problem (or just harvest the black holes energy over incomprehensible time spans if tech allows), in order to get even more unbounded energy production. Primarily by exploiting the limits around what the power will teleport since it doesn't mentioned teleporting you naked.\\
  A lot of these however boil down to daisy chaining many tiny black holes embedded in galaxy scale megastructures. Ultimately however it seems like there's no upper limit here on expansion so we can eventually aim for the ambitious goal of filling the entire ever expanding universe (she's ftl so that's not even an issue) with computronium, and even speeding up that expansion if that gets too slow for us. Basically her power has no real upper limit on how staggeringly awesome it is.
