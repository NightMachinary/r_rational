Um, that's not the trick I was talking about? I was thinking of the trick Scott mentions in the story--specifically, the Coil-reminiscent method of precommitting to do something /unless/ your vision contains an indicator that you shouldn't do so, and then either doing or not doing that thing depending on what you see. My point was that in this variant, it's even easier than that since you don't need to precommit to anything--you're effectively viewing the actions of a copy of you who /doesn't/ have the power.
