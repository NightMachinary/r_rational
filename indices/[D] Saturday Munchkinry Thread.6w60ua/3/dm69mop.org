You have the power to see the one or more hours into the future, /however.../

- You only see what would occur if you did not alter your actions based off of your visions.\\
- You may only look ahead for a burst of 1 second, which grants a 5 minute block vision.\\
- You may only use this power once per hour.\\
- The time ahead you look may be up to 23 hours, in one hour increments from your current time (use at 1:24pm, see 2:24-2:29pm, 3:24-3:29, 4:24-4:29, etc.)\\
- You may not back signal: data from after the time you look ahead to may not be passed to your current self.

What could you manage to munchkin? Please show your work: saying "I could just build a time machine now" doesn't tell us what the visions do for you.
