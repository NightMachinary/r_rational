A couple issues I can see with this: as soon as you win the lottery, people are watching you. Once you start doing well in the market, they'll watch you closer, and probably plan their stock actions based off of yours. When you start buying votes, the people who were buying votes against your wishes would probably try to work against you, especially if you snipe too many. What would you do to deal with those issues?
