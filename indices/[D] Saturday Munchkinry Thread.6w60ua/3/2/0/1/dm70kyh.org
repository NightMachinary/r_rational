I would have to disagree with people watching you moment you win a lottery. Yes some media coverage unless you choose to stay anonymous but it's not like everyone watches your financial decisions for prolonged period of time hopping you will become stock market guru.

My plan would be to make my market investments to win on overage 60% of time. You are losing fair bit and people can see there is no magic there. Some probably most will assume luck. For a long time before they start even suspect anything is off. By then you will be billionaire.

As for votes this is an issue but since and probably wouldn't win every vote but you would buy enough of them to make a difference and most thing that matter to you.
