No, a bigger problem will be that when your share purchases get big enough, then they themselves will affect the 23-hour future share price.

Pick a different lottery every time you need more money, just to really annoy any investigators. By the third or fourth lottery, expect someone to sneakily observe your ticket numbers and purchase several tickets with the same numbers, reducing your prize. By the fifth or sixth, expect the lottery organisers to hear that you have purchased a ticket and immediately switch to their backup lottery drawing machine while the main one goes in for thorough investigation and repairs - this will change the numbers drawn and eliminate your prize (The solution to this is to purchase one ticket before your vision and one ticket after...)).
