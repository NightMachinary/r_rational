So just use your visions to check whether something is likely to fail before you try? That seems like one of the two most major uses yeah.

Though it's worth noting this is critically different from seeing a vision as if you didn't have the power, as if you didn't have the power you wouldn't precommit to anything as there was no reason to. Your big limitation here of course is if something interrupts your ability to carry out a planned action, you'll see what would've happen if you hadn't used your power, but that could have up to 23 hours worth of time to derail plans in potentially the most inanely minor ways. Generally useful though for sure, probably less useful the less regular your actions are as it's more likely for something to go wrong then.
