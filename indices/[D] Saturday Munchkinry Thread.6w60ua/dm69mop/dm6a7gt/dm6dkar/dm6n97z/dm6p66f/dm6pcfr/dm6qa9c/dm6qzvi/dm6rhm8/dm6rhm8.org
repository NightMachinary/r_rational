Ok...

He relays strict orders from the future. The dosage of tranquilizers are now monitored more strictly. The space station's external walls are now transparent glass, ensuring Red would never stupidly punch one open again.

Another few millenniums pass. Another incident occurs. Some idealists got it into their heads that keeping a person permanently sedated is inhumane and decided to free Red. Red awakens, entering a destructive rage. Your forces corner Red. Red flees and mis-estimates a jump, crashing into deadly factory waste and dying instantly.

Black is once again contacted. The timeline is destroyed. In the new timeline, people are stripped of their freedoms so they can't form idealist groups that might free Red. Factories are strictly ordered to control their waste products and make them utterly safe. Humanity is turned into a totalitarian regime under Orange.

It doesn't work. The idealist/resistance movement goes underground. Red once again breaks free and once again gets himself killed in some stupid fashion.

Black is contacted yet again. And again. And again. A civil war. A terrorist group. A sympathetic guard. Red keeps getting freed and proceeding to die in unimaginably dumb ways. Timelines keep getting destroyed. Black's personal plans keep being disrupted, being called in to reverse Red's various deaths over and over. Finally, after one particularly disastrous timeline resulting in Black foreseeing his future self being killed in one of Red's rampages, Black decides to just go back to before the era of Red-matter and stop this fiasco from ever happening.
