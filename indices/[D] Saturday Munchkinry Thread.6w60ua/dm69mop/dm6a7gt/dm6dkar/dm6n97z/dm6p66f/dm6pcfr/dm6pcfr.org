  Intelligence doesn't let you break the laws of physics. Unless we are mistaken about the laws of physics, even a superintelligence wouldn't be able to solve negentropy. So it is entirely possible that a superintelligence was one of the alternative methods they tried and failed.

I wasn't talking about using superintelligence to break physics, but rather referring to the fact that if you can use your future sight to follow the instructions of future superintelligences then it massively changes the story.

  I would argue that spinning a turbine is really the best option here, since it's the safest. Seeing as Red is literally the only thing in the universe that can fight negentropy, you really don't want to risk anything dangerous happening to him. Cutting out chunks of his body to feed to blackholes sounds pretty dangerous, even if he has high regenerative abilities.

It kind of seems you're thinking too small here, given the sort of regen we're talking about here a superintelligence ought to be able to figure out what kinds of injury can be dealt on a consistent basis with no chance for death. Or say figure out the set rate of blood it can safely and continually drain from Red while he is hooked up to VR and nanobots tamper with his body in just the right way as to safely maximize output.
