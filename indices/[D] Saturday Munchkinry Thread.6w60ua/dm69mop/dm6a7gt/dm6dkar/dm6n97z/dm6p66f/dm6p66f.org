  for instance by excluding superintelligence.

Intelligence doesn't let you break the laws of physics. Unless we are mistaken about the laws of physics, even a superintelligence wouldn't be able to solve negentropy. So it is entirely possible that a superintelligence was one of the alternative methods they tried and failed.

  Another thing which I think he probably left out is that you could generate vastly more energy by exploiting Red's thermodynamics violating regeneration than you could having him run a generator. For instance by using the materials from his body to perform fusion or just feeding it to a tiny black hole that produces useful amounts of hawking radiation.

I would argue that spinning a turbine is really the best option here, since it's the safest. Seeing as Red is literally the only thing in the universe that can fight negentropy, you really don't want to risk anything dangerous happening to him. Cutting out chunks of his body to feed to blackholes sounds pretty dangerous, even if he has high regenerative abilities.
