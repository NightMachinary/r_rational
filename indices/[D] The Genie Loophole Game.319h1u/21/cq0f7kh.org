Another one! Sufficiently advanced technology is indistinquishable, but still categorically different from magic. How to phrase this...

I wish for a very small, but damn powerful. virtually indestructible computer, implanted to my brain in a way that lets me use it at it's full capacity, to make me a lot smarter and remember practically everything. It should also have wifi or similar way to connect to Internet.

I wish for practical immortality, medicine for youth and switching my bones to something way harder and my skin a lot tougher and my eyes for similar looking mechanical eyes with... Yea just cyborg me up completely, I'd still like to have my flesh brain though, with some youth medicine to keep it top condition.

Still not sure what to do with the rest of the wishes. Maybe world peace and immortality for other humans if they want it too.
