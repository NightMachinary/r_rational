If you were, you'd tell me in some way that's obviously true. For example, where's the recognition code? Why wasn't your message above my screen?

(If you're right, you didn't cause both of me to call one the copy and the other real.)

(Oh, was your point that you don't think I'd actually do it when presented with sufficient evidence?)

(By the way, I probably wouldn't tell it to simulate the whole universe. Any UFAI released by Humanity in the next 50 years would find a way out of the box via my messages.)
