I wish to extended my influence to the extent of the observable or conceivable universe and all domains that have influence over it, now; and to have absolute control over all events their-in, such that I am able to understand all events, and their implications, and free and able to choose their outcome, without violating the base structure of the reality that results from my wish, while retaining my current values for making said choices; and without having any burden for evaluating when to act to change an events outcome.

TL: DR (please criticize the long form) Make me capital "G" god now. Make the outcome of physics be what I choose it to be with perfect knowledge of the outcome.
