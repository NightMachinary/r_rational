Both call one the copy and the other real, which seems like a sufficient condition. If you think I am unethically condemning someone to 50 years of boredom, you can imagine me to have also told it to, at the end of the subjective 50 years, erase the copies memory of the last 50 years and put its mind into my body. (Which is of course a no-op, but it makes the thing sound less questionable I think.) I'm just taking 50 years to think the question through without the world or me getting older in the process.
