Wish #1 - I wish I knew the best possible wish (for satisfying my desires) to make.

This should be valid because meta-wishing seems to be about getting more wishes or changing something about the wish-granting function. I'm just asking for knowledge of wishes.

Wish #2 - I wish (whatever wish I learned about from Wish #1).

Wish #3 - Emergency wish to become the Genie if the previous two wishes go wrong somehow. I'm not wishing for an Undo Wish. I don't like maintaining a "status quo" like you always see in stories involving wishes gone wrong.
