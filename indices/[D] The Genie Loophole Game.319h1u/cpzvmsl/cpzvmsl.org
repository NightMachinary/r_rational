*The programming loophole.*

"Let the following term - skribbitz - describe the following situation:..."

(books and books describing everything you could every possibly want)

"...end definition for skribbitz. I wish for skribbitz."

*The not-quite-meta loophole.*\\
"I wish to be brought into existence a non-genie device, golem, or being of sufficient power and nature to quickly realize any and all desires I present to it, to the power level of approximately half a genie."

(Basically, genies are able to instantly and trivially grant any wish a human could think of, so a device or being of only half that power would probably still be able to bring about the wishes of anything a human could think of. If a genie could move stars around, for instance, to create a more pleasing constellation, or could put the sun out and rekindle it the next day, or could spin the moon to show the other side, a half-genie-power creation probably wouldn't have a lot of trouble doing anything short of bench-pressing the planet. And it wouldn't have the limited-to-3-wishes restriction either.)

*The super-charisma loophole*\\
Even without persistent supernatural abilities, there's nothing stopping you for wishing to have charisma equal to the maximum natural human ability. Every politician, celebrity, conman, and religious figure in history would have nothing on you - you could ask anyone for anything and they'd be almost orgasmically happy to do it for you. You'd pretty much have total power anywhere there were other people, which is most of the interesting parts of the planet. Tell everyone that war and corruption were to stop and everyone was to get along nicely and help each other, for instance, and the globe would probably be a much more pleasant place to live.

You'd never want for creature comforts; everyone would be more than happy to give you anything you wanted. You wouldn't even /need/ wealth or its trappings.

Heck, even 'merely' wishing for charisma equal to that of the most charismatic person on the planet right now would get you insanely large benefits, and it wouldn't even be asking for something that no-one else had, or something beyond human ability.

*The super-knowledge loophole*\\
Wishing to know everything that any human knows, along with the improved mental capacity to be able to retain, recall, and use that knowledge without deleterious side effects, wouldn't give you knowledge beyond current human capability, but it would give you access to every secret, every idea which couldn't be realized because of lack of resources or opportunity, insider knowledge of everything ever, all languages, all mental skill and experience at all professions, all knowledge of things which the knower couldn't or wouldn't necessarily make use of themselves themselves, all knowledge of how to build and maintain anything humans have made, etc. You'd instantly become the most powerful person on the planet.

Would this count as 'persistent supernatural ability'? I don't know... rebuilding your brain so it could hold and use all this information /naturally/ shouldn't count as supernatural any more than wish-granting you a body equivalent to having great genes and having worked out for twenty years. It's not supernatural; it's just a natural possibility you didn't previously take (or have the option of taking).
