I wish that all sentient creatures experience the maximum possible happiness for the maximum possible amount of time, within the realm of the 'impossible' space you've set out. I wish for our subjective experience of time to slow down enough that we never reach the end of the week limit. I wish for any laws of the universe to change accordingly without causing harm as I understand it of any kind.
