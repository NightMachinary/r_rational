I wish for the sole winning lottery ticket for a large lottery.

I wish for medical devices which reside inside me that can maintain me in perfect health, and can also reproduce themselves using common materials gathered from my bloodstream. Three of them should exist at any given time, and a fourth ready to come online. If at any time one is lost or destroyed, another is rebuilt. They can be transplanted and be fully functional in another human body. If transplanted, the new host's medical device will reproduce itself until there are three active and one standby machine.

I wish for you to be free and have no animosity towards me

I wish for you to join me for a beer. Yeah, it's a fourth wish, but I'm buying.
