I wish for omnipotence which lasts a week. I then create a supernatural effect on Day 2 which grants me omnipotence 1 picosecond after the week long wish omnipotence wears off.

Alternatively: I wish for omnipotence (supernatural). I dilate time or create a simulated world where time runs faster and solve for effective omnipotence (science) over whatever time length is necessary. I return to the real world four seconds later and use my omnipotence (supernatural) to fashion whatever is needed for omnipotence (science).
