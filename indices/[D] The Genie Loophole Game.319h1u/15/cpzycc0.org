I first wish for all my wishes to be carried out according to the maximum likelihood interpretation, conditioned on the genie's supernaturally accurate model of my mind. Let's keep this a /little/ bit fun.

I snark to destroy every Witch before it is born with my own hands.

I snark to obtain a healthy but not world-destroying amount of friendship and ponies.

I snark to be the stronkest, most relevant ruler of Earth, who can into space.

I wish for my mind to have its knowledge remapped into intuitive access to an optimal, supernaturally fast implementation of hierarchical Bayesian causal inference, with conscious access to numerical probabilities and precise concept implementations.

I wish for Spiral Power and a Lagann unit.
