I wish for an effect that grants me omnipotency for one week, and then grants me the effect described by taking the phrase "An effect that grants me omnipotency for one week, and then grants me the effect described by taking the phrase foo and replacing the first occurrence of 'foo' with the phrase in quotes." and replacing the first occurrence of 'foo' with the phrase in quotes.

Each effect only persists for one week, and is not self-referential.
