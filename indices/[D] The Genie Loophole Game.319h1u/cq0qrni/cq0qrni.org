1. I wish for the most powerful computer that would have been built by humanity in the absence of this wish, ever.

2. I wish to have a library of 100 million books (this is less than 5 Libraries Of Congress), where until the books run out, every living and future Fields Medalist and Physics/Chemistry/Medicine Nobel Prize winner will be able to name 1 book per person-year and find that book on the shelves, like how if I walk into a bookstore and say "Twilight" I can find a book about vampires, they could say "The Riemann Hypothesis", and every book will be an unremarkably hefty textbook explaining the most detailed, thorough, and advanced form of the requested topic that is comprehensible to the given mathematician/scientist, with a fair compromise struck between depth and breadth, and while the library will contain no duplicates, if the mathematicians/scientists ask for increasingly precise titles, those books shall be present, like they could ask for "Autoimmune Diseases" and then later "Multiple Sclerosis", and none of these books will have content that would violate your rules, like if some joker asks for "The Structure And Interpretation Of Genie Wishes", their request is simply ignored.

3. I wish to know, genie, are you still there, if so, reply "meow" (18,446,744,073,709,551,615 letters).

(1 is [[http://qntm.org/aum][Ra]]. 2 is the most broken thing I can think of, that nobody else will think of. 3 is [[https://xkcd.com/1354/][Heartbleed]], with 2^{64} - 1 because greedy.)
