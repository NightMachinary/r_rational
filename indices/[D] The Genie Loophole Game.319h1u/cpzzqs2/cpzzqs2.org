Define 'persistent' in rule 4. Say, if I wish for something like, I don't know, a house, would that not be a supernatural effect on the world, and would it not be 'persistent' because it will not instantaneously disappear?

Anyways, wishes:

1. I wish for you to fulfill any wishes made by me in accordance with the results I intended when wishing.

2. Depends on the answer to my question.

3. Backup wish for immortality or something if my wish 2 gambit doesn't pay off. I wish for you to satisfy human values with friendship and ponies? Who knows.
