So could I, say, wish for a voice-and-intention-activated DWIM polymorph any object ability, whose effects are permanent, so long as the power only lasts for a few days? 'Cause I could do a ton of damage* with just a few days of that sort of power. Even if it has arbitrary limitations like "no resurrections, but healing is ok", "no food", "objects must have a reasonably solid bounds, so a bucket of saltwater can turn into a bucket of freshwater, but water and air on their own cannot be morphed", etc?

Combine with something like Greater Teleport, except the philosophical identity stuff gives me the jibblies**, so it'd need to be something a bit more complicated which would ultimately make using it for space exploration impractical.

That does, of course, ignore people wishing to be god for a week outright. I would assume you can't wish for any power that would do things you couldn't get from a carefully worded wish, and that the duration is inversely proportional to the energy cost (or something like that; genies kinda make energy costs incoherent).

So "I have all the abilities available to a level 12 Wizard" wouldn't last long at all, while "I wish for the ability to shapeshift into any human form" might last the whole week (allowing restrictions so you don't shapeshift from some dude with a phone in his pocket into some rich-looking fellow with a lump of gold in his pocket, because that would be cheating).

Probably safer to just forbid supernatural abilities entirely, since they come close to wishing for more wishes (since wishes are the only way such things could be accomplished otherwise).
