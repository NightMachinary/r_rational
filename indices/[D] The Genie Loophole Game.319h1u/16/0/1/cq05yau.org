You should probably put in a rule against wishing for supernatural stuff that can improve upon itself. Or something.

Wish 2: I wish to be omnipotent with the exception that I can't alter past events and capable of using and understanding this omnipotence until one hour after the amount of time it would take to use this omnipotence to make my omnipotence permanent.

Wow that's a pretty long sentence, but I can say it without choking and messing up. I checked.
