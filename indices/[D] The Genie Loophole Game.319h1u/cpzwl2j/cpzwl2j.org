Short of CEV or the world-improving trick of the year, my wishes are usually fairly selfish.

And also include persistent supernatural abilities, huff. So no polymorph any object / greater teleport / shapeshifting / a DWIM mental interface with a high-end computer?

In that case: I wish for the optimization of my body and mind in accordance with my desires (weighting for understanding?), extrapolated over time, from birth to the present.

(So phrased because I've noticed preference/desire/belief changes that I can't undo, that are not completely useless, but that I do not want to have all the weight on just because they are most recent. I at least know that the way I phrased this wish should make me smarter, if nothing else.)

If that doesn't work, undo the wish, or collapse wishing to a prespecified safe-state if the "optimizations" didn't screw with my ability to wish intelligently.

If it works, wait and see what happens.

Other possibilities, though lower priority and might not make it in, depending on how the first one goes:

1. I wish for a meteorite containing primarily platinum to appear in a crater no larger than 1.5m in radius on the area of my property where it would be least likely to disrupt my normal activities were I not to attempt extraction. (The meteorite is as large as possible such that it does not cause any serious destruction to any buildings, or the path from the house to the road, or concrete, or the flower bed / rose bush / trees, although minor tree damage or even a damaged window might be acceptable if the market value of the platinum is at least 100 times the price to repair said window damage. It will not break any power lines, phone lines, man-made cables, or water gas or sewage lines.)

2. I wish to know how to find and optimally interact with (where optimal means "to the satisfaction of myself and the other party/parties") people with whom I am most likely to form and maintain mutually desirable relationships. The "how" should take into consideration the limitations of my present situation (this one goes last because the self-optimization wish could greatly decrease the complexity of this one. It /could/ go in the middle, if I need a third wish to actually benefit from it, but I want my body and mind in a useful state more than I want magically-arranged friendship, and I want a crap-ton of money to get me financially secure enough so that I can make the most out of my magically-optimized self.)
