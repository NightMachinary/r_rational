It's Flicker's excuse to Doc for why she stopped regularly partnering with Journeyman in Chapter 5 here: [[https://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/67179812420/skybreakers-call-chapter-5]]

It was weak writing at the time (I wince reading it now) and I can no longer find a plausible way to write around all the details even as an excuse. So they are going to change slightly when I eventually edit Call to put it into book form. (It needs to be edited anyway to change Flicker's age to 16.) That's the other reason the details are different.

What isn't going to change: Flicker had a traumatic experience with social spontaneity with Journeyman that strongly affected their relationship, and she didn't share the details with Doc.
