  An open question is whether to accept the post-mending summoning mechanic (turning archetypes real) or the pre-mending summoning mechanic (essentially D&D Gate spell.)

Well, Do any of the planeswalkers we typically see even do summoning? Jace 'summons' illusions in stories. I think Garruk just calls actual beasts that happen to be around, Sorin makes vampires the hard way. Do story walkers even typically do summoning the same way player walkers do?
