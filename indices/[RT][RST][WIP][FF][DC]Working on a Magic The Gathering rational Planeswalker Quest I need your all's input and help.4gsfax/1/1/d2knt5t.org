IIRC, the planeswalker spark gives you some advantage in magical skill. That's why Jace, being so young, can still be considered one of the best mindmages of Ravnica. If you look at his early history, he was one of the best mindmages of his homeplane (Vryn) as well, and he was still a child. He managed to defeat an ancient sphinx in a mental battle (he lost most of his memories, but the sphinx forgot /how to breathe/.) The same can be said for every planeswalker we encounter on the lore. All of them were greatly talented in their fields and more powerful than their peers. I guess it's safe to assume that it's not just coincidence.

Also, your last point is crucial to the development of the quest. Summoning an aetheric copy of something is vastly different from summoning a specific something from somewhere. Because there's the conundrum of "how can two planeswalkers both summon the same legendary creature?" or "Why does the summoned creature obey the planeswalker's orders?"
