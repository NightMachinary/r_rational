Basically:

- Innate language comprehension

- Significant resistance to injuries (both physical and mental)

- Greater than average magical prowess

- Ability to retain and utilize mana bonds with extra-planar lands

- Ability to follow "aether trails" when other planeswalkers planeswalk (to allow a planeswalker to follow another between planes)

- Resistance to phyrexian corruption (but not immunity)

I guess there must be some other perks, but none that have been officially stated, afaik.
