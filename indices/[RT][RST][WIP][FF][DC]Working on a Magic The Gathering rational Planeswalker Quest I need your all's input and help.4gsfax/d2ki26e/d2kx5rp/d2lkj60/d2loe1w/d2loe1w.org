It's more of a business relationship between equals than the "summon, mind control, send to their death" of normal creatures.

Modern storyline planeswalkers vary considerably in power. The spellcaster types seem to be at least as powerful and versatile as the average 60-cards Standard deck, albeit with fewer creatures (Liliana excepted). Others are just buff warriors with a few tricks up their sleeves.
