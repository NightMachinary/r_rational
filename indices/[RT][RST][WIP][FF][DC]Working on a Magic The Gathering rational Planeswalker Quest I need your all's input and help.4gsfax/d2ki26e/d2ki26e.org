Lore-wise, I might be wrong, but here's a list of things to consider:

- Planeswalker-ness doesn't really come with any other upgrades. It doesn't make you smarter, or better at magic, or more resilient, it just gives you the GURPS 4e /Warper (World) [100]/ advantage.

- Mana is not discrete in the way portrayed by the card game. Mana ought to be physics-like. Mana Field Theory?

- Anyone could in principle cast any sorcery/instant that does not involve summoning creatures.

- An open question is whether to accept the post-mending summoning mechanic (turning archetypes real) or the pre-mending summoning mechanic (essentially D&D /Gate/ spell.)
