Lore-wise, being a planeswalker means that with enough experience, you can be a better mage than any non-planeswalker.

Regular mages are limited to the mana and spells of a single world. Planeswalkers can draw from dozens. However, this isn't particularly relevant when you know little to no magic yet.
