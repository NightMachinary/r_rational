The top tier planeswalkers are complete bullshit, but lesser ones can still be challenged by a plane's most dangerous denizens, and the lowest are basically just mid-level D&D adventurers.

They do have the ability to walk out of any fight though. This can to some extent be remedied with the proper stakes: yes, /you/ can run away, but not the world / your parents / the ancient scrolls you haven't found yet.
