Planeswalkers are complete bullshit. It's part of the fun of reading them, but you have to remember to make the conflict in the story personal or mental. At least after you've graduated from the baby-walker stage, anyways. A planeswalkers can fuck off to the blind eternities whenever they want. Make sure to have reasons that they want to stay. Shadow-y conspiracies and puppet masters make for the best conflict in this particular brand of story because they just can't set loose creatures of legend on their asses to just dakka them to death. Nothing out-dakka's a competent planeswalker besides an older one.
