The only use for mana is to cast known spells and use abilities of creatures/artifacts/enchantments. Planeswalking doesn't cost mana, only mental/physical fatigue.

But, I'm not sure I get why those abilities are hard to define (I guess "/significant resistance to injuries/" and "/greater than average magical prowess/" are somewhat broad terms, but the rest are pretty straightfoward, and even those two can be determined simply as "more hp" and "faster magic learning". (Just like the character did last update, when he pulled a spell out of a mana well.)
