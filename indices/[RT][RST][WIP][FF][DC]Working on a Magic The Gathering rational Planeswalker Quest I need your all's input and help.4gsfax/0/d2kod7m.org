One of the most important aspects of magic in *Magic* (IMO) is how the color pie (the differences in mechanics and philosophy between the five colors) interacts with magic users.

I don't know if, for example, your natural affinity to blue magic makes you more of a blue character, or if being a blue character enables learning bue magic. But the correlation between personality and acccess to specific colors is very much there.
