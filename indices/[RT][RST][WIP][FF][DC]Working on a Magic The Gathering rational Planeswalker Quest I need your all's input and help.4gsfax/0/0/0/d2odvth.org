That option is what I think is most likely as well. That would mean that learning, for example, red magic, requires that the person frames his/her thoughts in a red way, like prioritizing short-term goals instead of long-term ones, or using one's emotion to fuel rage, passion, or happiness and use these emotions as conduits for the spellcasting.

That's why I think there are enemy colors and allied colors. It's easier for a blue mage to think in a way that represents order, structure and morality (White's characteristics) than it is to reframe your mind to stop making detailed plans and think only "on the moment" (Red's characteristic). So, it's easier to learn allied-color magic than it is enemy-color magic. One must be good at reframing their way of thinking/feeling to adapt to new colors.

And that doesn't even take into account intra-color magical styles. A Beastcaller (a mage who controls and summons beasts, /a la/ Garruk) has a different way of thinking from a Nurturer (a mage who encourages and hastens natural growth in plants and animals), though their way of thinking is much closer than the way of an artificer.

I've been thinking a lot about the precise mechanics of magic in *Magic* for at least 3 years (when I started playing), so, I have some pretty strong opinions on it, hahaha. Feel free to prod my mind for anything you'd like.
