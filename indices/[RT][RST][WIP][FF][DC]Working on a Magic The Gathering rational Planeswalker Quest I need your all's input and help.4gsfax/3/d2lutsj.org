In the second post, I have had difficulty as an author getting across exactly how fish out of water the character is with wilderness survival and finding food, and how hard it is to sustain yourself in the wild and take in more calories than you burn if you have absolutely no idea what you are doing, and that you have to be very careful and make a really hard decision because of that. What could I do as an author to get that across, or am I missing something obvious?
