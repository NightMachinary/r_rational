I don't know how you'd do it in a quest, but typically you'd show a series of failures.

The main character thinks "I need food", decides "I'll catch a rabbit", then starts building a trap. But he doesn't know how to build a trap, so rather than just outright saying that, you want to describe his pitiful attempts to make some sort of collapsing rock trap he'd once seen Wily Coyote use in a cartoon, which is difficult because he has to improvise everything and doesn't really know what sort of bait to use for a rabbit. He's getting hungrier the whole time he's doing this.

Eventually, after the rock trap fails to get anything, he goes looking for rabbits, and eats some leafy greens along the way in the hopes of staving off hunger. This makes him quite sick, but he eventually does find something that he thinks is probably a path made by animals, and sets up a rock trap there to wait.

As he's approaching true starvation, he somehow, by some miracle, catches a rabbit, only the rock falls on the rabbit's back legs, so he hears [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-3z-TjnqB4][this horrible, almost human screaming]] and has to kill the rabbit by snapping its neck, only he doesn't quite know the right way to do that, so spends a lot of time fumbling around with it before deciding to just bash the rabbit's head in.

Next comes starting a fire, gutting the rabbit, etc.

But you get the point; if you want to express that someone is over their head, show them being over their head. Especially good if you show a lot of stuff that seems reasonable if you've never done anything with wilderness survival.

Edit: You're probably not looking for any reading recommendations, but I really enjoyed "Drop City" by T.C. Boyle, which is about a bunch of 1970's free spirits who move their commune from Colorado to Alaska where they hope to live off the land.
