If you're going to make it into a quest, I would suggest against explicitly making it an SI. Many people play quests to immerse themselves in the character as a form of escapism, and when that character is explicitly someone else that becomes harder. Especially when that someone else is in fact the QM. Double especially since many people will feel like they can't make proper criticism since they would be indirectly criticising the QM which is a rather dangerous thing for any player to do. Not all QMs are reasonable about such things after all, and it is hard to know which side of the line a certain QM lies on before it is too late.

To be clear, I am not suggesting actually changing the character in any way; make them be as SI as you want, but I suggest not actually telling/reminding players that they're an SI.
