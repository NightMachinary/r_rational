Yes. I use it at my workplace and it's great and has nice features, but because it's closed source, single server, and I'm pretty sure you can only use the slack client for it, it's kinda a huge pain to deal with compared to IRC, which has tons of clients and can use a different server. It's entirely possible Slack will be gone in a year or two. It's happened to other companies in the same field.
