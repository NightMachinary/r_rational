Sounds nice and i would probably join such a channel if opened, but from my experience having an IRC channel can cause some alienation.

Essentially what tends to happen is that you get a certain subgroup in IRC which develops its own quirks and inside jokes etc. and as a result becomes much harder for new people to join into it.

One aspect that tends to make this worse is the fact that over IRC people develop much stronger interpersonal relations vs forums. But while that sounds good, and it is good in the sense that its always nice finding more like minded friends and getting to know them better, it makes the barrier to entry much higher.

Some of the issues can be solved by having public logs or somesuch which makes it easier for people to get to know the IRC community, but some of those "issues" don't really have a solution, at least not one that I am aware of..
