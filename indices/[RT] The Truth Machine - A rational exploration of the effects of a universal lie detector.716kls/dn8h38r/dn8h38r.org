I read this a number of years ago, but it has stuck with me a long time. The author posits the creation of a universal lie detector that can also eliminate those who are not capable of telling truth from fiction and proceeds to examine the effects on society. He also has a quasi-sequel called [[https://smile.amazon.com/First-Immortal-Novel-Future/dp/0345421825/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8][The First Immortal]] set in the same universe. Unfortunately it is only available in paperback.
