If it is viewed as ethical to answer this, is there anywhere available a (even if crude/terse) synopsis of the plot, rather than of the premise only?

Edit: Particularly, is the protagonist portrayed as a would-be-liar unjustly living while other would-be-liars justly die, justly living while others unjustly die, or a 'third option' in which he justly lives while no others unjustly die? (Replace the concept of 'just' with 'sympathisable-with-by-a-fair-reader' as appropriate.) (If the 'third option', how plausible is it that he's truly the only person in a comparable situation?)
