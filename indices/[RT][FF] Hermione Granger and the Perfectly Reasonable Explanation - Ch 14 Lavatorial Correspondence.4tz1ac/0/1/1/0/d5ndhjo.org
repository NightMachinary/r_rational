Sounds interesting. Got a link?

More generally, while I appreciate why people like HPMOR, I think that Hermione makes for a much better rational!protagonist than anyone in canon. Making Harry a rational!protagonist (in HPMOR and elsewhere) required rewriting his personality from scratch. Making Hermione one (in HGPRE) required a few minor tweaks.
