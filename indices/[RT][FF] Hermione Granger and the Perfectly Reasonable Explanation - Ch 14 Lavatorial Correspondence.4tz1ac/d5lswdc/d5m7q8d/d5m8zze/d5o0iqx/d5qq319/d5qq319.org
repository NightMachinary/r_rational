Perhaps I am misremembering, it's Harry doing science with Hermione as a research assistant good at memorizing things. That was agreed upon after Harry wowed Hermione with Wason's Rule Discovery Test --- which Hermione failed, of course, despite it being an obvious "trick question" given the situation.

No shortage of fics like that. (There's one called /Blindness/, IIRC.)
