The fic is good enough that I've been reading it and its sequel for 8 hours now.

HP fanfic is usually pretty easy going. I imagine I can read it quite a bit faster than pretty much anything else. There's a lot of dialog markers and such, and I don't have to create much in the way of new mental imagery. To be honest it's almost a skim read and I certainly couldn't give a detailed plot outline.
