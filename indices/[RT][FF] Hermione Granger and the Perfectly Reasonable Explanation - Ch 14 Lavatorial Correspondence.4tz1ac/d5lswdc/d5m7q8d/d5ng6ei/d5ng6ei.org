Not "Hermione does science", but somewhat related: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3412346/chapters/7472102][D.S.S. Requirement]] by esama. Some muggleborns ask the Room of Requirement for a spaceship. It complies, but everything is shut down and all labels are written in ancient runes. I think there were some sciencey bits about finding out /where/ the space-ship is located and using the technology gained to find out what makes dragon hide so magic resistant.

Word of warning: Like many of esama's works it's an interesting idea written in an interesting way, but it doesn't go anywhere. They just play around with the spaceship for a while, make some plans, there's some hints regarding the origin of magic on earth, then the fic ends before they actually do much with it. Might inspire someone to write a more thought-out fic, though.
