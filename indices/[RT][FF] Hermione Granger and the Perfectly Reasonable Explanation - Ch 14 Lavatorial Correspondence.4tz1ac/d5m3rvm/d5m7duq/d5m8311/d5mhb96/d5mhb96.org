I wish you all luck in figuring this out - I will try to restrain myself from substantive responses unless I discover /I've/ fouled up some logic somewhere. I will say (for sanity's sake) that the complexity level you're aiming for is beyond the Back to the Future trilogy, but much closer to that than, say, Primer. Without suggesting that any particular element of either of those systems is or isn't included in HGPRE, mind you. :)
