My general intent is to avoid non-diegetic changes to Canon, other than the basic premise. That said, where there are gaps in Canon, I'm usually attempting to find sensible ways to patch them, rather than /deconstructing/ the gaps - the latter can be fun, but it's not as constructive (literally), story-wise. :)
