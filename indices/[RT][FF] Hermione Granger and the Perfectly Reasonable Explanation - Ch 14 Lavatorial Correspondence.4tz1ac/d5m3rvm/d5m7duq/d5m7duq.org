WMG ahead, beware.

Suppose there's at least two types of time travel in this fic: stable time loops, with which we all are familiar from HPMOR, and 'straightforward' time travel which branches out a parallel universe.

So canon!Hermione was sent back by the second type, expecting to see herself in her past, in her timeline.

Let's analyse how that would influence /stable/ time loops extending from before her time of arrival to after her time of arrival, including prophecies.

Say, a week before canon!Hermione's arrival a seer sees her accidentally dropping a book on the floor two weeks later. This information became known to the seer before canon!Hermione's arrival, back when there was no difference between worldstates, so the seer's vision should remain the same: this Hermione /is/ going to drop the book. But it creates inconsistency: after Hermione from the future arrives, she will act differently and won't drop that book, so the seer shouldn't have had a vision, but why wouldn't she have had a vision if at the time of the vision it was going to happen?

So, I think what happened is that this act of time travel hurled canon!Hermione not in her timeline, but in a timeline consistent with her future actions in her' past. That means that all prophecies, all stable time loops extendnig past her point of arrival, were changed accordingly.

Imagine a millinium-old prophecy about the fate of the world ten millenniums later. Imagine someone, long ago, acting on that prophecy, creating ripples extending to the present day.

Now imagine this prophecy /changing/, creating slightly different ripples. Giving Ollivander a certain wand for safekeeping.

That's the cause of all differences from canon.
