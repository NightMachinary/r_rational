Thank you? I like it too.

On second thought, I'm not sure how much sense it makes. If the timeline was allowed to be different from what canon!Hermione remembered, then how many differences were allowed? If there was no Earth and no prophecies, then time-traveler!Hermione's actions (quickly dissolve into vacuum as every good little Boltzmann Mind should) would still be consistent with them.

To be strict, the timeline needed to be such that all events before FutureCanon!Hermione's arrival were the same, with the differences only starting to show up after her arrival. Except prophecies are events, too, so they all needed to be the same, word-for-word, and we're back to square one? Or only reactions to them needed not to differ? But then I bet someone would need to have a fit of madness for this to work. Oh well.

Brr. Now I don't see a way to integrate this mechanic back in the story, at least without metaphysics (e.g., timelines should have a metaphysical property of 'similarness' relative to the time traveler). Have any ideas?
