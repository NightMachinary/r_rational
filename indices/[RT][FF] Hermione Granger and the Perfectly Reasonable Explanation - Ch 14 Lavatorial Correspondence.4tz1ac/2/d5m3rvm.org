One thing which has me wondering, at which point did Future Hermione arrive? The prologue may be taken to suggest that she arrived on October 31, 1981. That could be used to explain deviations from canon even before the story started. From the visions it seems that Future Hermione is exactly Canon!Hermione and this chapter even acknowledges that she was (would have been?) Gryffindor, but Present Hermione at the start of the story seems already different from Canon!Hermione in the first book. It could be postulated that even though the minds appear separated, some of Future Hermione "dripped through" and made Present Hermione "genuinely smart" and distinct from canon. But then Future Hermione seems to have only a short TTL (time to live), why would she be okay for ten years, but then suddenly it's time to go just as the plot arrives?
