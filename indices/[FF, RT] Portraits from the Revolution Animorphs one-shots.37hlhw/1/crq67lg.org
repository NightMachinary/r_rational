This is crazy good! Thanks for writing it, and please keep it coming! The Yeerks are such a good example of a starfish alien race, I love seeing some of the positive (or at least a more nuanced) implications of their existence explored! As with the Reckoning, I also just like spending more time in the Animorphs world.
