This is actually an interesting question to me because I work in road safety and I am planning on travelling to Cambodia next month for a holiday.

We want to travel between Siem Reap and Phnom Phen, which is either $20 for a 6.5 hour bus trip, $75 for a 5.5 hour taxi ride, or $150 for a 45 minute flight (+ time and cost overheads for getting to/from the airport). All figures for two travellers.

My main concern is the amount of stress (flights are stressful! but so is being on a bus full of tourists! and being at the mercy of a potentially crooked taxi driver!), and the amount of time spent travelling vs potentially enjoying the holiday.

Quick maffs: holiday is costing about $150/person/day so $8/person/hr so, assuming no marginal discounting saving one hour on the bus trip is not worth the price of the taxi, and saving 6 hours is not the worth the cost of the flight.

But I think a 6 hour bus ride would be /miserable/, while a 45 minute flight is quite pleasant. (But then getting taxis to/from airport is /miserable/ - unless both hotels offer airport transfers...)

Anyway this ended up being about something completely different but now I'm wondering what AirAsia's safety record is vs Cambodian tourist bus companies vs Cambodian taxis.
