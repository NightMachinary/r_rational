How much more "dangerous" are cars than airplanes?

I feel that whenever I read these "airplanes are safer" comparisons they completely disregard basic nuance. Usually [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromort#Travel][they're in units of fatalities/miles traveled]] (or p(death)/mile), ignoring the fact that we'd be doing a lot less long distance travel without the convenience of planes (which can be hard to quantify, sure). It's like if some new technology enabled travel to the Andromeda galaxy -- on a per-one-way-trip basis, that trip could have a 99.9999...999% fatality rate (I think something like 1-10^{-6476964305} or so? maybe?) and still be as safe as planes on a per-unit-mile basis. But we wouldn't call the trip itself safe.

(similarly, walking can be considered quite dangerous, if you compare it on a per-mile basis to e.g. driving across the country, but people rarely walk across the country, and those that do tend to be pretty good at it)

Also, plane fight would most directly substitute for empty interstate highway travel and not urban travel, despite the former being [[http://freakonomics.com/2010/01/29/the-irony-of-road-fear/][substantially safer than the latter]]. But those miles often all get lumped in together when dividing by total road miles traveled. And cars keep getting new safety features added in, which would put modern miles traveled even further out-of-sample (nevermind better crumple zones and airbags -- the econobox I bought last year has automatic emergency braking, active lane control, adaptive cruise control, automatic high beams, etc. though I'm sure some of that gets canceled out by risk compensation, and airplanes have probably received new safety features, too). Likewise, I've yet to see a treatment of this question break down the component risks of plane flight -- how much of a regional/directional/geographic effect is there? An age-of-plane effect? Time of departure? How much of the risk is fixed to takeoff and landing, vs. relative to the marginal air mile? etc. Plane crashes are rare enough that there's probably insufficient information to really resolve those effects, but still.

(disclaimer -- I think walking, biking, and driving to be way more dangerous than most people give them credit for, and have adjusted my own behavior in light of imo a reasonable assessment of each activity's risks and benefits)
