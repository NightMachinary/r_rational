How about on a per trip basis?

I did some math [[http://planecrashinfo.com/cause.htm][with]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_safety_in_the_United_States#Fatality_rates_by_state][these]] [[https://www.bts.gov/content/average-annual-person-trips-person-miles-and-trip-length-household-purpose-2009][sources.]]

All of these are pretty rough numbers.

- Odds of dying on a flight from the safest half of airlines: 1/(20 million).

- Odds of dying on an average car trip (ten miles), given deaths per mile from Wikipedia for the safest state in the US: 1/(20 million).

- Most dangerous airlines? 1/(2 million).

- Most dangerous state? 1/(5 million).

That's an interesting coincidence. These methods of travel are basically equally safe, as far as I can tell.

Of course, if you substituted a car trip for a long flight I don't think it would be safer. Same for flying to the grocery store.
