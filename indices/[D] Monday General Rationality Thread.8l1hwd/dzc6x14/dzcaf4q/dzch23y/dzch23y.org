Interesting! I think framing it on an averaged, per-trip basis can be useful for personal decision-making -- I wouldn't avoid a drive to the grocer, so why balk at a flight? -- even if the two aren't quite interchangeable (I'd benefit a lot more from a flight than a drive, typically; flights also then to cost more at short distance, both in $ and opportunity, though they get cheaper at long distance unless you value your time little and your car is fuel efficient and spacious enough to sleep in).

It still doesn't quite "feel" right for evaluating which mode of travel is "safer", though perhaps that's just a result of the question being poorly framed. I'd be curious how the "relative risk" of flights/cars changes as a function of distance, for example. Maybe I'll play around with some data when I have a bored moment.
