I think deaths/mile is a good measurement if you're actually considering using one or the other for the same trip. Your complaints might be valid for considering some nebulous quality of "safeness", but if you need to get from point A to point B and are wondering whether to use a car or a plane to get there, deaths/mile is the quantity that actually matters in the safety column of your cost/benefit analysis.
