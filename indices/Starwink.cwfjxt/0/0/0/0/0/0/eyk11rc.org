Yeah, if I hadn't been familiar with Yudkowsky's original post, I would have found the ending confusing too. I wonder whether Alicorn might be willing to rewrite the ending just a tiny bit, for clarity. (I can't quite recommend the rewrite to people wholeheartedly, because I suspect they'll be confused too.)

That said, I did enjoy the rewrite a lot. :)
