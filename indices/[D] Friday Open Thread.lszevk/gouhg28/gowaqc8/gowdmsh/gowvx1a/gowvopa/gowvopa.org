I highly recommend the "Podcast Addict" app on android, I've used it for years and consistently think it's earned the few bucks I paid to remove ads.

I listen to a ton of podcasts due to work and exercise, any specific genres you like? Telling people your specific fiction, hobbies, and pop/pro-whatever you follow will help a lot. I also enjoy listening to things alongside other media, like commentary/analysis on shows or reading.
