  First, because this selection only determines the initial composition of the first generation of colonists.

But that generation would birth, raise and educate the second generation, beign their pretty much only source of culture, norms and morality. The saturation of "astronaut culture" in society will be close to 99% in the forseeable future.

  Second, because harsh enough conditions can crack people in all sorts of ways.

Definitely, though a realistic utopia does not require automatic perfect mental health, just access to top of the line mental health professionals.

  The blank slate also doesn't work unless you actively erase ideas from Earth you deem toxic (and that's supposing your judgement is 100% right on that)
#+end_quote

I agree there would be more than a bit of selection bias when it comes to importing ideas from Earth, but most of it would be simply by picking the right colonists. For example, since most colonists would be extremely highly educated, asutronaut-like specialists, we can pretty much guarantee the society will be agnostic/atheistic (since almost all specialists of that level are).

  doing so would in itself require a pretty authoritarian approach,
#+end_quote

"Authoritarian" approach is inherent in the bottleneck caused by the harsh transit and colony creation. One can put it that way: planetary colonists come in two flavors: rational materialist stoics, and dead. everyone who is not physically, emotionally, and philosophically fit to function in such a society is likely to go insane/die/cause death in transit, nevermind on site.

  or sending only babies and caretaker robots.
#+end_quote

In theory, that would be ideal, but would likely require true AGI (or at least a very, very good SAI that passes the basic Turing test flawlessly ), so if we could have that, all our problems would be solved anyway.
