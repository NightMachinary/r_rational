  The AGI booster idea is that developing aligned AGI is the best way to strive for a better tomorrow, not that the optimal strategy is to buy a straightjacket and wait for Robot God to save you.

That's the thing; since I'm not a believer in AGI in that sense, or at least not on any near-future (this century) timescale, working on AGI as a way to strive for a better tomorrow is indistinguishable from sending missionaries into Africa to try to get people into Heaven.
