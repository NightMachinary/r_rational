  Folks, if you think building a utopia on Earth is hard, doing it on Mars is gonna be a thousand times harder.

Not necessarily. Mars colonist can (in fact, MUST) be hand-picked to be extremely capable, highly educated, cool-under-pressure stoics, rational, emphatic, and able to easily cooperate with others. On top of that Martians would be picked to be top health and fitness. Basically, all martian colonists start as astronauts and must pass the same tests.

If you cannot make an utopia using Peak Human altruist heroes in a remote isolated location away from Earth's ills, then we can pretty much assume that utopia is impossible.
