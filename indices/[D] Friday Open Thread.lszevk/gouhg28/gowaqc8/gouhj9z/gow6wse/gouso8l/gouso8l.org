When I was religious I always took heaven as a goal for us to imitate and not a reward. This I think was a part of me getting disillusioned by the whole thing, when everyone else seemed to use it as an excuse to not do anything. Don't have to worry about the climate or war or poverty because Jesus is going to come and fix it all, dontcha worry.

If I were to have the chance to go back and rewrite Christianity, it would be to make it so that God died permanently on the cross after putting all the butterflies in place for heaven to be possible but not guaranteed. Let people have their guidance if they "listen" for the butterflies, but know that if they don't strive and if everyone doesn't strive, nothing will get done.

But then I bet it wouldn't have survived as long as it did.
