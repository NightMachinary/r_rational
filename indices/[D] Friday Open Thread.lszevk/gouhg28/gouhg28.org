I don't think it merits an actual post, so I'm writing it here.

I just finished The Erogamer (first readthrough), and I have... mixed feelings, shall we say.

On one hand, it's certainly brilliant, with a complex plot, lots and lots of references to almost ALL of my favorite books and authors (I swear, more than once I took screenshots and sent them to my girlfriend with an excited "LOOK, IT EVEN HAS THIS!"). The humor was great, the sex parts were inventive at the least (I'm not really into BDSM though, so I don't know how actually porny it is for those who like that), and there was an occasional insight on sexuality that resonated with me.

But the latter half of it was a really hard read. The endless, ENDLESS philosophizing, the internal monologues and Author Filibusters on metaphysics, parallel worlds, free will vis-a-vis plot requirements, sexual ethics, cosmic bullshit etc. bored me almost to tears. I'm here for the jokes and crazy sexy adventures, gorram it!

When I just started reading The Erogamer, I was ecstatic. I was looking forward to recommending it to all my friends, I was ready to hail it as the best thing I expect to read in 2021. Now I'm not so sure.

If anyone has similarly geeky sex-centered fiction to recommend, with actual plot, but with no meta-anything, I'll be very grateful.
