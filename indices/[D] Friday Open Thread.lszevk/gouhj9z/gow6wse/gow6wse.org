Waiting for agi is like waiting for retirement to live your life. Kind of backwards if you ask me. I'm more of a self reliance type of dude, make my own life as good as possible to the extent that I can, rather than relying on government or other people to do it for me at some point.

There are thinking patterns that are arguably OP, like how you think about diet / exercise, or how much control over your life you perceive you have, how proud you're etc. Most people use the generic ones they got from their parents, and those are fine and clearly work, since you know your parents had kids and statistically are living average lives, but imho there's room for optimization in most people's thought patterns. It's hard to get introspective enough to question and if needed optimize them though.
