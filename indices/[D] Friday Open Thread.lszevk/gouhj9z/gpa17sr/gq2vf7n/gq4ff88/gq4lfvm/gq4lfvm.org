My problem is your assumption that whatever causes trouble on Earth are just bad viral ideas that were born at some point in the past and that we can't rid ourselves of, but that if only we could excise, would be sure to never trouble us again. And I don't buy it. You're treating our problems like a virus that can be exterminated, albeit with great effort. I'm saying they're more like cancer: an unavoidable nasty side-effect of multicellular life itself, that we can certainly get better at managing, but never outright eliminate at its root. First, all sorts of conflicts can arise out of entirely rational motives. Rational doesn't mean selfless. Someone who would rather eat twice as much and let someone else starve than share their food isn't being irrational, just a dick. But such conflicts could arise in any context, and would arise all the much more in a situation of true scarcity. Conflicts then have to be rationalized away, which is often conveniently done via dehumanisation of the opponent, and /that's/ where the real trouble begins. It doesn't matter that these colonists didn't carry with them the specific flags we rally around here on Earth; they will just make /their own/ flags at that point. Any society built around a certain set of values has already a perfect accusation to levy against its opponents: /they/ don't adhere to the values! They want to ruin our perfect society! They're not doing their part, or are pushing against our progress, or something. And so on. Most of these conflicts don't even necessarily start irrational, they /turn/ irrational as people dig their heels in because that's how group dynamics work. And the problem is, I can only see the conditions of a space colony exacerbating these issues, not making them better. You have scarcity, you have a closed environment, a small overall population (thus a lack of meaningful outside input that could inject some much needed perspective), and conditions that are already intrinsically unhealthy for the human mind (long term seclusion, lack of natural sunlight, lack of natural environments, probably limitations and controls on reproduction, and various other hardships).

Honestly, I'd put my money on the colonists going crazy within 10 years and either slaughtering each other or turning into some sort of dictatorial cult in 20, almost regardless of their original backgrounds. Regular astronauts come and go from Earth, so space cabin fever can't get to them as easily. This would be a completely different situation.
