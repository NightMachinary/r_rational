For how to listen, I second the recommendation of Podcast Addict.

As for the podcasts, * 80,000 Hours does really in-depth interviews of experts in different fields. * The Arms Control Wonk podcast has some great episodes on how analysts use open-source intelligence to study nuclear weapons research and proliferation * Dressed has lots of interesting details about the history of fashion * Early and Often looks at the history of elections in the US, starting from the first colonies * Listen to an episode of My Brother, My Brother, and Me, because if you like it there's at least a thousand hours more McElroy podcast content out there * Rationally Writing is by Alexander Wales and Daystar Eld * The Film Reroll has a fun conceit: it's an actual-play podcast where the cast stats up and plays through a different film each episode * The Tip Off is all about the process of research and fact-checking behind recent big investigative journalism stories, following a different article each episode * Throwing Sheyd is about Jewish demonology
