I think this happens quite a lot with popular web related fiction that is very serial and doesn't have a specific endpoint. It even happened with famous old school comics like Cerebus. At some point when the author gets enough attention on their product that they didn't expect they start to use that attention for other purposes.

It is truly unfortunate.
