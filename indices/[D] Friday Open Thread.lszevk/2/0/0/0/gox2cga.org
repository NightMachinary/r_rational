I don't see how I could elaborate without giving examples so here are a couple I use:

The default one: 'exercise needs to happen X times per week, each section has to be at least 50-60min long, and it needs to take a lot of effort'.

What I consider exercise is different: 'exercise takes around 10-20min per day, consistency is more important than effort'.

Another default one is: 'if you're not going to do things optimally, and at maximum efficiency it's a waste of time and you shouldn't do them'. I see this a lot in my chubby friends.

Mine is: 'Consistency is king, shitty execution with low efficiency beats optimal effort inconsistently'.

This one needs to be elaborated on, a guy who exercises at home (suboptimal) consistently, will most of the time be in better shape on the long run compared to a guy who would only consider exercising in a gym for 1-3h/d five times a week (optimal).

This happens because the effort required for the perceived optimal method is too high, which reduces the consistency of execution and causes them to give up after a while. The turtle beats the rabbit in this case.

I can give more examples if anybody wants but these I suspect will already get me plenty of hate.
