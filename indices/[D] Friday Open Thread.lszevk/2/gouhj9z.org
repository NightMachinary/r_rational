One description for the theological notion of Heaven is that it's a lie wielded to maintain Hell; that is to say, instead of focusing on improving this world, which is our only world, the notion of Heaven redirects peoples' efforts towards a nonexistent world to come.

This doesn't seem obviously untrue to me, but I wonder about the causal relationship. Obviously, religion has been used to justify and perpetuate things ranging from the caste system in India to slavery in the Antebellum South to the concentration of wealth in the hands of the few in the United States today. But is that the case because religion is a social structure and social structures are prone to being weaponized by those who have power, or is it the case because the concept of Heaven is inherently toxic, inherently suited to siphoning effort away from creating a heaven on Earth?

I guess in order to test this I would have to know more about theologies that don't have an afterlife. Ironically, my own faith (Judaism) is one of those, but only kind of, because there are all these really fuzzy afterlife notions in different branches of Judaism even though there's no real canon about it, and also I don't know what the position on the afterlife was of the few sets/types of Jewish theological leaders who had substantial secular influence.

As an entirely separate thought, I've been likening AGI-boosterism to this concept in my head for a while now. There's this feeling I get from a lot of AGI boosters that there's no point in striving for a better tomorrow, because that's nothing compared to the post-singularity Good AI Overlord future (aka Heaven), so you might as well do nothing. It's extremely disorienting because metaphorically adjacent to those folks you have EAs who are all about "do the most effective thing for a less bad tomorrow".

[edit] - Similarly to the above phenomenon, I am constantly baffled by the occasional Mars-colonization-as-societal-panacea take I see or hear. Folks, if you think building a utopia on Earth is hard, doing it on Mars is gonna be a thousand times harder.
