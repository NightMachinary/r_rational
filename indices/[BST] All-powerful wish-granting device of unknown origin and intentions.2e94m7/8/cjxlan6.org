  ...you see a notebook appear out of thin air, obviously by magic, and when you open it, you see only this instruction: "Any wish written on these pages will come true". What do you do? What is the best course of action?
#+end_quote

I carefully pick up the notebook, take it home, put it in a locked desk drawer, and then immediately seek professional help.

Okay, fine.

#+begin_quote
  You don't know if the notebook works, but by the way it appeared you suspect that it might. For the sake of the argument, suppose it does.
#+end_quote

No, I don't. I won't. That doesn't logically follow /at all/ from the way it appeared. This is like asking, "If you were less rational and made wild assumptions..."

Isn't a MUCH better question: "What would convince you that you had a notebook that /safely/ granted any wish, if you were too smart to risk actually using it given known issues with genies?"

That's basically the strong AI safety question, which is why people on [[/r/rational]] and lesswrong even talk about it in the first place. What kind of tasks can you safely order your powerful AI to perform that don't endanger the local lightcone through bad wording and buggy programming?

  Do you wish first to be able to understand the consequences of your wishes? But that seems like a lot of information that your brain might burst from trying to process.
#+end_quote

That isn't how brains work.

#+begin_quote
  Do you wish to be twice as smart, so that you could decide on a wish better? But that may also have negative consequences for your brain---heck, it might kill you after a second of horrified realization of your mistake.
#+end_quote

Ehh...why not test it on a rat first, if that is really something you're worried about? Why take any wish and apply directly to the forehead as a first step? Time for exhaustive animal testing. That's why grad students were invented, so maybe wish for those first.

#+begin_quote
  Is the destruction it may cause worth the good it may do if you risk using it? You don't know if anyone else ever received or will ever receive another such note---is it better to risk using the note yourself rather than risk someone else using a note first with disastrous results?
#+end_quote

If you have somehow randomly acquired a wishing notebook, there is no way you are a unique snowflake and the only person who's ever had this problem. Even if that were somehow true, you certainly won't be the last. Just like all dangerous discoveries in science and technology, not understanding and mastering it isn't an option.

Positing a safe, functional wishing device, wish-nuking all other wish devices is a first priority, clearly. In fact, wishing them into evil, effect-limiting, anti-user genie devices might be a good move, if you can't stop them from existing and granting wishing at all for some reason.
