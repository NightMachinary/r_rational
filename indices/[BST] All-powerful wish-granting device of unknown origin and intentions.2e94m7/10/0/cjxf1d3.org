If I write a story based on this, I don't think I'll reveal the kind of wish-granting device it turns out to be, if it is ever known. The story will end with the main character making the wish, or deciding against it. What happens next will be left to the reader's imagination. It's not going to be novel-length or anything, just a short story about wishes.
