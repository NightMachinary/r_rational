Well... My first thought---the blade of grass turns pink because it becomes infested by a pink-colored virus that kills you, and then everybody else. I would look for a safer first wish in case the book was malicious, but, as I said, I can't think of /anything/ that I'm sure could not be interpreted with disastrous results in case of a smart malicious interpreter.

Edit: I'm not sure how likely a malicious interpreter is, and whether it is likely enough that you should take it into consideration when making the wishes.
