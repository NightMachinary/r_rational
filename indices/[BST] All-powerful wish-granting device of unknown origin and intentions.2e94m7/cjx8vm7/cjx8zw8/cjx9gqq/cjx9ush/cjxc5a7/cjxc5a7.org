The question, though, is how much agency does the notebook have? If it's a conscious entity (or even just a sufficiently highly sophisticated but non-sapient expert system), then you're hosed. A normal human can't safely wish from a malicious conscious entity.

On the other hand, if the book lacks significant agency and simply follows the (easiest / lowest power cost) channel, then you've got a shot. You just need to specify things carefully. It becomes less about wishing and more about programming.
