I'm thinking more along the lines of unknown optimization priorities filling in the blanks when something is not specified explicitly. For example, perhaps the notebook wishes to use as little power as possible, with everything else being equal; and what is the best way to minimize power consumption than to kill every potential user (while granting a wish), thus negating the need to grant more wishes?
