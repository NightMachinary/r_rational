Given the existence of wish granting notebooks you shouldn't assume that you are the only person who has ever been granted one. Others likely have similar magics and either have avoided disaster or are about to cause disaster.

So I'd do three wishes.

1. I wish that this wishbook's wish making powers would adhere to my mental intent and desires.

2. I wish that all wish granting entities and objects other than this wish book would be unable to grant wishes.

3. I wish that all people would become immortal and have fast regeneration and that their intellect would gradually increase over years to a high level.

4. I wish that knowledge of advanced AI building, nuclear fusion power stations, and interstellar travel would become common place worldwide.

5. I wish that all entities and people would see me in a favorable and positive fashion and be against harming me in any serious way or stealing this notebook.
