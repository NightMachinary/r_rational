If the wish granter is malicious then there are no safe wishes. It may not even be safe to ignore the book --- after all, you're spoiling their fun.

It's hard to reason about magic, but it seems unlikely that the wish granter is going to immediately kill you. What kind of goal does that serve?

Even if it amuses them, might it not be more amusing to toy with you for a bit, and then only bring in malicious elements once you're sure the wish granter isn't malicious?
