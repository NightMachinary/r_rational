I haven't thought about this at all, just answering off the cuff.

One experiment you could try would be to indicate a small blade of grass and write "I wish for this blade of grass and only this blade of grass to turn pink." If it does, you know the wishes work.

If it does, then you could write "I would like this blade of grass, and only this blade of grass, to become something pretty for five seconds." If it transforms into something you find attractive, that's decently strong evidence that it responds to intent. It could be that the note is conscious and malicious and just messing with you, though -- setting up false expectations for a later whammy.
