For more information [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/ld/the_hidden_complexity_of_wishes/][see here]] for the hidden complexity of wishes. The Open Source Wish project used to have a forum just for discussing the proper wording, but it seems that it's dead now.

I personally believe it's best to attempt to use the notebook for some carefully worded wish, but if the genie is a complete dick there's no one true "safe" wish that you can make. And if the genie is a complete dick that's going to fuck you over no matter what, I think it's probably not going to work from a story perspective. A literal genie is fine, but if you're going to be turned into a suitcase when you ask to be able to fly ... what's the point? It's not clever or interesting.
