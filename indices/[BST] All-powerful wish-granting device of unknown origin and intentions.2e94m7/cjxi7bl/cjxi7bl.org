I don't like wish-granting notebooks. How does it distinguish between these wishes?

"I wish I had a manual for safely using this, with these caveats..."

"I wish I had a manual for safely using this" /black hole/

"I wish I had a manual" /random IKEA instruction book/

"I wish I had a man" /new person suddenly exists/

And what happens to the later valid wishes if I keep writing? Will I be unmaking the person I made, or will junk keep piling up every time I complete a noun or verb phrase? Or does it wait until I finish a sentence? I hope it can read my handwriting well enough to distinguish my commas from my periods. Does it care about grammar, or will it try to grant "I wish I had a manual for safe", leading to a whole lot more headaches?

I don't think I would write anything in it. Notebooks are even more dangerous than genies.
