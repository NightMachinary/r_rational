Very nice. Just a couple of things:

Before the first near-death experience:

#+begin_quote
  I'll need the practice, soon." She reached into her briefcase...
#+end_quote

You change person from 1st to 3rd, but still are referring to the protagonist.

A rhythm of 3/4ths with 2/17ths seems really hard to produce. I suppose that's the point.

Finally, is the point in the end that the protagonist lost? She got caught before she could cause enough deaths.

#+begin_quote
  In your manifesto, you claim that the millions of deaths you caused
#+end_quote

Millions is not even a 1/7 of all existing humans. Death can just shrug at that and know that in the future more souls will be coming. However her speech afterwards supposes the door has already been closed. I am confused.
