I enjoyed this. The core concept of a human trying to persuade Death to permit immortality, and ultimately using her interactions with Death to work out a way to coerce it, was clever and compelling. The Death segments were the strongest parts of the piece, and I felt very engaged with them.

Some critique: I think a lot of fat could be cut from the therapist segments. The debates with Death are the meat of this story; spending so much time on the protagonist's negotiations with the therapist only dilutes their impact. Considering that the therapist disappears completely halfway through the story, she doesn't warrant the page space currently spent on her. (In fact, the amount of focus she got led me to believe, right up until the end, that she was going to be part of some big twist--I thought she was going to actually be Death trying to analyze the protagonist in a simulated scenario.) I think you could easily cut those parts down to one or two paragraphs apiece without losing anything critical. You could even, if you wanted, ditch the therapist as a framing device entirely.

Also regarding the therapist sections (though cutting them down would probably resolve most of this by itself): The narration occasionally describes the therapist's point of view ("Establishing a rapport with the patient was important to her," "she feared what might come next). This is confusing in the context of a first-person POV story, and gives the impression that the protagonist can read minds. I think your intention here was to imply that she is extraordinarily perceptive, which comes across better in the parts where you use phrasing like "she visibly suppressed the impulse."

I also found it hard to accept that the protagonist would explicitly declare her intent to manipulate the therapist into giving her a clean bill of health--and then succeed in spite of that, not just in securing her freedom but in actually convincing the therapist that she was "healed". I think it would be more plausible for that declaration of intent to be confined to her internal monologue.
