Thank you for your comment! That might be the most insightful critique I've ever gotten, and I really appreciate you taking the time to post it.

I think I agree with most of your points. This is not to be a justification, but an explanation for how the suboptimal parts of the story came to be. I originally wrote the therapist part from the therapist's view, and it was intended to introduce Jeanne from the outside, because I felt that an extraordinary claim such as Jeanne's should be approached from a position of doubt. The sections where Jeanne seems extraordinarily insightful are artifacts of a version where those were just the therapist's inner thoughts. This explains both the awkward phrasing and the amount of time spent on the therapist; originally, the parts "analyzing" her were only necessary for her to work as a POV character. After I was done writing the story, I realized that there was only one scene not from Jeanne's POV and decided to simplify the story structure by putting it into that POV as well, given that I'm trying to correct my tendency of confusing my readers by unnecessary POV switches.

So what I've learned from your comment is that I should probably make a viable plan for the POVs in my stories at the very beginning, when I can still consider their global impact. Alternatively, if I have to edit the POV, I should consider a full rewrite of the affected scenes.

Regarding the manipulation, I see the merit to your approach. At the same time, Jeanne's talents regarding manipulation have to be introduced so that her founding a cult is more believable, which means that she has to overcome an earlier obstacle through manipulation. I do agree that I've probably chosen an over-the-top way of doing this and can understand that it strains your suspension of disbelief.

Once again, thank you for posting this :)
