Yes, Death's reason to send humans through the door might well be beneficial to humanity. Some sort of Eldritch Abomination certainly fits the feeling I wanted to create, and I love that you picked up on it. I don't think that I would declare that possibility canon, but you are certainly very close to the author's intent.

From Jeanne's view, there's still the possibility that Death might be consigning the humans to a horrible fate for much smaller (or personal) gains. Given that possibility, I think Jeanne acted rationally; if Death had been feeding humans to Azathoth, she would have wanted to know, because in that case, the best option wouldn't be to just close the Door; she would try to find a way to kill Azathoth first. And given that she assumed Death would know that she would understand that (and wouldn't mind her trying to kill Azathoth) and /didn't just tell her/ she assigned negligible probability to that possibility.
