That was an amazing read, I also love that you mentioned Pascal's Wager. It's one of the great tools of rationality, just unfortunately tainted by the specific context that Pascal misapplies it to.

That said, I find the ending rather worrying. Death never explained what was behind the door, yet the MC forced him to stop feeding souls through it. Given the religious connotations and the fact that Death feels too squeamish to explain, my best guess is some sort of evil gods that demand human sacrifices, so they can munch on human souls. Death sends human sacrifices across the door to appease the gods, and doesn't want to explain it to humans because then they would desperately refuse to enter the door.

In that case, what would happen if Death stops sending human souls across the door? Or sends only a relatively small amount? Coupled with the conjecture that Death cannot lie, and that Death said closing the door would "diminish" it, I imagine the evil gods would break down the door and come over to this side to find more souls to munch on, maybe even munching on Death itself.

What makes this hypothesis even more probable is that Death refuses to explain what's behind the door even when the MC threatens to kill the entire human race and begins carrying out said threat. That means whatever is behind the door, telling the MC about it won't make her change her mind about killing the human race. Given the MC's utility function and methods of achieving her utility, hearing about evil gods being appeased by human sacrifices would drive the MC to kill off the human race immediately, regardless of what Death does. So this hypothesis would explain why Death refuses to divulge any information about what's behind the door.

So now I'm imagining the ending, as Death crossing its fingers, hoping desperately that the sudden extreme reduction in the number of human sacrifices doesn't cause anyone on the other side to come over... /gulp/
