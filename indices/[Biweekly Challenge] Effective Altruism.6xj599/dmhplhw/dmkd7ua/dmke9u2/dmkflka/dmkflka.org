Oh yeah, that does make sense! I've run into similar scenarios in my own writing, where I've made a radical rewrite and later discovered that there were artifacts of the original version that no longer fit. I think you have the right idea in keeping it to a single POV.

I think demonstrating that Jeanne is able to successfully manipulate the therapist into clearing her is a great foundation for her ability to found the cult; I just think that having her keep her intentions to herself could be part of that. When she explains them to the therapist, it comes across as a misstep that makes me /less/ confident in her talent for manipulation. Then when I learn she pulled it off anyway, it comes across as an informed ability rather than a believable one. But if she makes it clear in the narration that she intends to manipulate the therapist, while outwardly playing the role of a receptive patient, I think that would foreshadow her future cult leader status very well.
