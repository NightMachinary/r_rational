  how was she so sure that Death would want souls?
#+end_quote

Jeanne knows Death doesn't want to close the Door. Given that the Door is open so human souls can go through it (and apparently never return), Death seems to want souls (for whatever reason). The possibility that the Door needs to remain open for another reason doesn't really cross Jeanne's mind... if that was the truth, Death might have suggested a compromise of otherwise barring humans from entering. By the time of the third vision, Death is certainly capable of negotiating; that Death doesn't suggest a compromise implies that Jeanne's goal (namely, that humans shouldn't die) and Death's goal are diametrically opposed.

  and what if he thought
#+end_quote

Well, given her limited time frame for negotiation, Jeanne has to make some assumptions. The assumption that Death is somewhat rational is reasonable enough. This means that Death needs to take different possible mind states of Jeanne into account, among those the possibility that Jeanne wasn't lying. If she wasn't lying, she really believes the extinction of humanity is better than future generations passing through the door. And if she's capable of killing several millions in the name of that goal, it's hard to imagine her being squeamish about actually fulfilling it. Given that "those willing to die among future generations" is possibly an almost infinite number of souls, Death faces something approximating Pascal's Wager: even if the probability of Jeanne going through with it is low, the expected value of her doing it approaches negative infinity. Not knowing her state of mind, Death has to comply. And if Death can read minds, it's even easier, because Jeanne is actually convinced.

Now what if the assumption is wrong and Death is willing to gamble on Jeanne being squeamish? Well, Death's willingness to gamble is a matter of probability to Jeanne, and human souls going to a horrific afterlife has an expected value of negative infinity to Jeanne. Pascal's Wager again, this time on the other side of the negotiating table, and extinction is actually a (comparatively) good thing.

She could gamble on the afterlife being a paradise with an expected value of positive infinity, but that doesn't seem likely based on Death's statements.

Now, there are a lot of possible objections to this strategy, given that Pascal's Wager has tons of holes; as soon as the slightest uncertainty about your model is allowed, it falls to pieces. However, /conditional on the model being correct/, it works. And that's all we can ever expect of any decision-making process, anyway.
