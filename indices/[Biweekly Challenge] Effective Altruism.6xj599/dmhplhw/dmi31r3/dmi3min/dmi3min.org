  You change person from 1st to 3rd
#+end_quote

Thanks for spotting that! Unintentional changes of person (and tense) are my most common mistakes because I tend to change them from scene to scene while writing. I just can't decide until the story is done, and then I miss things while editing :)

  A rhythm of 3/4ths with 2/17ths seems really hard to produce.
#+end_quote

(Changed the second rhythm to 2/7ths, because on second thought, I don't think the protagonist could spot it.) Generally, it's possible for an experienced musician to produce these rhythms. If you're not averse to harsh Metal, give Meshuggah a try. It's fascinating how their drummer can keep up with insanely complicated polyrhythms.

  is the point that the protagonist lost?
#+end_quote

Nah. What she did was test her weapons systems, killing a few million people, thereby alerting Death to the fact that she is able and willing to actually kill everyone. At this point, she has the finger on the trigger, and Death has to close the Door to preserve a steady, if smaller, stream of willingly dying humans. And once it's clear that she has won, she stops trying to evade capture.

I rewrote the ending so that the judges actually refer to the strange events that are going on in hospitals (such as people not dying/corpses not decaying). This should make it more clear.

Thank you for your extensive comments! It's always nice to know which points I managed to communicate and which I didn't.
