Considering my current level, I'd call myself a surfacing cave-dweller, but thank you :)

And regarding the last contest... I'm the guy who wrote /The Library Unpublished/ and /Continuity of Consciousness/, how could I not enter the metafiction challenge? Useless bit of trivia: I consider "Applied Cultural Topology" to be one of Cio's fanfics.

Regarding Meshuggah, the complexity of their rhythms is more easily appreciated in the songs which are a bit less aggressive. Try Dancers to a Discordant System, or Pineal Gland Optics. And if you don't like them, no harm done! They're certainly not for everyone. I only listen to them when I'm in a certain mood, as I usually like to have clear melodies in the music I listen to.

Nonetheless, I imagine that Progressive Metal would be appealing to an immortal like Death, who's had time to literally see everything. In some ways, it's one of the "cutting edges" of music :)
