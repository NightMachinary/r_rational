(Copying one of my comments from there, in case anyone wants to discuss further)

Great essay. One possible faultline is that the carefully constructed examples do not map onto common experiences all that well, and thus the actual takeaway that people might try to apply to their lives ends up looking very different.

The examples of the coffee seller and professor are specifically designed to make them seem unreasonable in their strange expectation and lack of understanding of social norms. I understand that they're there to make a point, but their actual equivalent is a prostitute who offers friendship and companionship rather than sex... and oddly enough, she would probably NOT get 0 customers/students once she explicitly reneged on the expectations of her previous relationships with others. And I think it's important to consider why that is.

The rich guy is made somewhat less ridiculous, but there is a completely non-ridiculous version of him who /can/ exist: the one who stops spending money on his dates /for a romantic goal,/ rather than to just save money.

The obvious goal that's most likely is to find women who care about him rather than the rich lifestyle. In which case, seeing which girls stop dating him without the expensive dates is /exactly what he wants,/ and if he still feels upset about girls he was hoping would keep dating him stopping, that conversation would look very different.

The harem girl is much more aligned with this rich man than the one presented in the essay. What both are seeking is /mutual value/ from their relationships, for /equals./ If not in literal socioeconomic/sexual terms, than in expectation of the value of their worth as an individual, rather than their value as dispensers of coffee/credits/money/sex.

And as an expectation in society, for most people's actual experiences and lives, that's not just rose-tinted goggles or naivety. That's a valuable thing to be on the lookout for.

The rich man may someday not be as rich. He may in fact be much better served if he restricts his dating to women who fall for him before he shows off his wealth.

The harem girl may someday not be as attractive. She may in fact be much better served if she restricts her time to guys who care about her primarily as a friend.

For the vast majority of people, who cannot in fact try to downgrade a harem of sexual relationships into just friendships because they do not have a harem, or who do not get to choose between partners who want rich lifestyles and those who are okay with non-rich lifestyles because they are not rich, these dating preferences and expectations are in fact far more symmetrical and justified.

What the essay wants them to understand is that everyone's time and energy and opportunity and demand and preferences are not equal, and thus people should just seek what makes them happy and not be blamed for trying to optimize their interactions with others toward the best possible outcome for themselves.

But I would argue that in many cases, the people who believe that is what they are doing by seeking only-friendships-that-result-in-sex or only-relationships-that-afford-rich-lifestyles is in fact to their own self-detriment. They are seeking what they believe will make them happy, but realistically, they often fail, and make others unhappy along the way.

Transhumanism may be an /ideal/ answer to this problem, but I would assert that it is not the only one. People can in fact shift their values and understanding of themselves and their preferences to better align with a happiness that is achievable rather than a happiness that is, to avoid using any words that have negative connotations, simply unlikely.
