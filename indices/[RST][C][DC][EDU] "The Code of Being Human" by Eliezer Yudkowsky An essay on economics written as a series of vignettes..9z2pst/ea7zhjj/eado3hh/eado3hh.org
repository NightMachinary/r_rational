I understand why girls don't like it when guys don't want to stay friends after finding out the girl is not available/doesn't want to date them.

But at the same time, one thing I think nobody seems to mention in these kind of 'friendzone' arguments, is that sometimes it just isn't healthy to stay friends with someone you really, really want to date, if those feelings are never going to be reciprocated. I had to sit by and watch one of my friends pine over the same girl for years, and nothing about that relationship was healthy. The emotional imbalance there translated into some pretty weird dynamics, and I'm almost absolutely certain that my friend would have been better off, emotionally, if he'd just nipped the friendship in the bud, and came back when he had his head in the right place.

I don't think staying friends is a particularly good way to get over a crush. I'm not saying people should just ghost each other, because ghosting is a pretty shitty behavior (and by ghosting I mean choosing to just blatantly ignore messages/calls instead of bringing the relationship (friendly or romantic) to a close), but at the same time I think we can't ignore that, whether or not the friend-zone is anybody's fault, for many it is an emotional reality that can be quite shitty, and I actually thinking that just moving on from the friendship can be better for both parties in the long run. Or at least, just moving on would have been a lot better for my boy in the long run.
