Something felt wrong in the paragraph two paragraphs about male/female expectations, and.. I think this post explains it well: [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/sSqoEw9eRP2kPKLCz/illusion-of-transparency-why-no-one-understands-you]] (the title, at least)

I'd also possibly nitpick something in your example about women's expectations:

> There is not much that girls can do

Why do they have no agency?
