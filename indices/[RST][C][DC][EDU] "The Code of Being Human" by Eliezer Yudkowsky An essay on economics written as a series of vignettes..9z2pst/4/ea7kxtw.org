Some déjà vu while reading.

I. "I don't even know how to describe what mistake you're making"

II. " I'm not entirely sure how to describe exactly the mistake you're making"

II. "I'm really not sure at all how to describe the mistake you're making"

III. "I don't even know how to describe the exact mistake you're making"

(Incidentally, I had thought that the term Nice Guy was used for the pitiful-but-blameless male behaviour, and then was later appropriated for the bad/easily-criminal male behaviour for which it can only be used sarcastically (in reference to the actually-not-doing-anything-criminal pitiful-but-blameless male behaviour.)

I reflect that in V, a comparison is made with a fictional character who involuntarily because able to provide utility for that character's partner; the significance of the involuntary nature of that doesn't seem to be pointed out for that example. That is, the morality/ethicality of someone who leaves someone when something significant is forever lost (akin to a fairweather-friend or not-a-friend-in-need) versus someone who leaves someone when something significant is withheld.

Edit: I just realised to my amusement that this (the linked text) serves as a direct rebuttal of people who express dismay at spouses who are dismayed when their spouse uses that spouse's life insurance plan to pay for a cryonics plan instead. (For instance, "No! I'm not marrying you in the hope that you'll die and I'll get your life insurance! But the understanding was that if you die early, the life insurance would be insurance for when there's less income and more difficulty marrying again, and now this is being unilaterally changed!")

Second edit: A line of thought I had forgotten, a little silly: "Actually, all this time the barista across the road has been selling coffee for $1 a cup. So, we can hypothesise that your customers valued your conversations at greater than or equal than $3 and less than $4."
