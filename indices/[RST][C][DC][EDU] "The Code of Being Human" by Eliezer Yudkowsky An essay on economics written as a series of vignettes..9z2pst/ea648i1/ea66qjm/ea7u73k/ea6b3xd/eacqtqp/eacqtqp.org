And I feel that the moral is a bit off too. It is feasible that the coffee shop owner/professor/rich guy/girl could be offering stimulating enough conversation that people would be willing to pay for it even without getting coffee/college credits/fancy meal/sex. And the further you go down the scale the more feasible it gets. It really isn't unreasonable at all for a guy or girl to expect deep conversations with people of the opposite gender without having to offer money/sex in exchange.
