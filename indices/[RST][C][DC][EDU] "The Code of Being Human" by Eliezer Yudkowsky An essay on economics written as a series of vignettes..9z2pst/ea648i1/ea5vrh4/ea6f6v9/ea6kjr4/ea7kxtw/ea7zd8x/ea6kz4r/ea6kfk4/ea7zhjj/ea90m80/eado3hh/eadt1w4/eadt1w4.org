I definitely agree that not everyone is emotionally/mentally able to handle that sort of friendship. It was certainly hellish in many ways for me at 17 to deal with it.

I do think it made me a better person, though. Wiser, more emotionally stable, more capable of understanding myself and wants and needs, more empathetic toward others. It also basically burned away 90% of my ability to feel jealous. And I made a lifelong friend because of it (two actually, counting her current husband).

I think a lot of that has to do with actually falling in love with someone, not just having a crush on them or finding them attractive. For those "lesser" feelings it's less of an excuse, in my view, to say "Well it makes you feel bad, so you should just do what's easiest for you."

I want people to challenge themselves more, and go through emotional hardship more, and grow more from it. I think a lot of the immaturity and stunted feelings people develop are the result of not knowing how to handle situations like that, and that's a problem. But I know not everyone has the tools or help they need to do so, and so not everyone can do it and emerge out the other side better for it. I've spent a lot of time thinking about how to help with that, and all I've done on it is write parts of a self-help book related to it that I think isn't sufficient.
