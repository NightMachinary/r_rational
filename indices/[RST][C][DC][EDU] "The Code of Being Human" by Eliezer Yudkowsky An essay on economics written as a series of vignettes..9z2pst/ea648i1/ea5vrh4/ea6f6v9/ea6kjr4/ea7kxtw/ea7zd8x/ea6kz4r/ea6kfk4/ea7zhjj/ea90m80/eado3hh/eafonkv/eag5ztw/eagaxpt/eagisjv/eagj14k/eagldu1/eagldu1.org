Guys who are looking for romance but know to build up a friendly relationship first, with no intention of being friends if the girl is not interested in romance, are still less likely to actually find a girl who is interested in romance but wants friendly interactions first, because the idea that the guy ONLY cares about their friendship if it leads to romance is often seen as offensive and makes the budding friendship insincere.

  They do not wear Raikoth beads around their neck expressing that they are Single and Looking and Not Interested in Friendships Without Sex At the Moment, but I would argue that even if such beads existed, they would not likely wear that third one. It would be to their own detriment to do so unless society has evolved quite a bit further than the one we live in.
