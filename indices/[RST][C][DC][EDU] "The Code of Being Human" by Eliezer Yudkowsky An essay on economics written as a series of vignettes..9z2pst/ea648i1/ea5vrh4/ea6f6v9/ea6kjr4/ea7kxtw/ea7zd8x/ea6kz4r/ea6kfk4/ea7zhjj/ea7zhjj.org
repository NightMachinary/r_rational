(Copying one of my comments from there, in case anyone wants to discuss further)

I also want to focus on the aspect of asymmetrical expectations here, because I suspect that any kind of virtue that might exists in this space might only exist from non-hypocritical expectations.

As of now, the reason there is so much angst in this area is that there are two different sets of expectations.

Guys will often approach girls that they want to date specifically to try to date them, and they understand that they have a better chance if they build up to that and explore a friendship first rather than simply asking out of nowhere. They do not wear Raikoth beads around their neck expressing that they are Single and Looking and Not Interested in Friendships Without Sex At the Moment, but I would argue that even if such beads existed, they would not likely wear that third one. It would be to their own detriment to do so unless society has evolved quite a bit further than the one we live in.

(I would like to note that while I've known many men to use the rationale of not being able to budget all the time and effort it would take to stay friends with every girl they have ever wanted to date, somehow I've never heard the cost of obtaining new male friends considered in quite the same way by most guys who argue this)

Girls on the other hand are often approached by guys who are signalling friendship, and then turn out to often only be interested in romantic relationships. There is not much that girls can do to avoid the loss of budding friendships that result from this, and the pain that results form that, other than to harden their hearts and become so cynical that any guy who approaches them in a friendly way is suspect of only wanting sex. Which is exactly what we see often happen. Even if the Raikoth beads existed, they would not actually be able to ward off such heartache by wearing a bead that said Not Single (some, perhaps, but not all: many guys will continue pursuing women even if they are expressly in a monogamous relationship). At best, they would need a bead that said Not Interested in Dating Anyone Who Does Not Commit to a Genuine Friendship First... but even this is flawed, because there is no way to accurately gauge what qualifies ahead of time. It's built on feelings that everyone will have a different standard and expectation of.

This is an asymmetric arena. There is no clean and perfect answer here, but there are worst-case scenarios that we would all probably like to see less of.

On the guy side, the commonly bad outcome will be those guys who do not just expect sex from women they put "friendship time/energy" into, but who then /blame the women/ for "friendzoning" them, insisting that they are "nice guys" and thus deserve better than just friendship.

On the girl side, the bad outcome will be to blame not just the above guys for "sexzoning" them, but to blame all guys for "just wanting sex."

The best avenue of attack to reduce both of these bad outcomes is to apply energy to educating men and women who express these stereotypes (or any people of any gender who apply either of them), but I would posit as a prediction is that you will see a 70%+ reduction in use of the phrase "Nice Guy" as a pejorative if the male behavior is what is reduced first and faster.

(I find the comparison of "people calling blameless men Nice Guys" to "people who laugh at the homeless" totally missing the point, by the way: yes, such cartoonishly cruel people exist, but that is not how this dynamic evolved or what sustains it in the majority of cases I have seen on both sides)

The fairest possible world in light of all this seems to me to be one where we enforce the norms that guys and girls are allowed to break off friendships at any time for any reason without being shamed for it, but where we /do/ shame guys and girls who either blame girls for "friendzoning" or blame guys for seeking romance.

The potential asymmetry is that, as a natural consequence of this, women will end up being hurt far more than men will. If a girl who complains about guys not wanting to be friends with her without sex needs to better understand the transactional costs of spending time on friends who cannot offer sex vs those who can, then surely the symmetrical step is to help guys understand that girls who do not want to include sex in the friendship package that they were offered are not unreasonable... like, say, a coffeeshop owner who expects to be paid for conversation without coffee is unreasonable.

The coffee shop owner set an expectation, then broke it. The stereotypical male who strikes up a friendship then abandons it when they hear that the girl has a boyfriend also set an expectation, then broke it. I don't want them shamed just for that behavior, but I think it has to be acknowledged that that this behavior has implicit harm attached to it.

We should console guys who feel sad that they can't find a single girl who's interested in them (without blaming women), and console girls who lose friendships they thought were based on "actual" friendship (without blaming men)... but these two things will not necessarily feel equivalent to everyone. Unfortunately I can't think of anything better that retains empathy for everyone involved, the world being as broken as it is.

(feel free to swap male and female words at any point in this comment as needed, since these behaviors are not exclusive to men and women)
