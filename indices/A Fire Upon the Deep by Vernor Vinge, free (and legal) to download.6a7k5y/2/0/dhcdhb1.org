My experience (over the last few months, which is as long as I've signed up for) is that you'll get around one email a week. The last two free ebooks were [[http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8694389-deathless][Deathless by Catherynne M. Valente]] and [[http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7235533-the-way-of-kings][The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson]]. I'm not sure if that's a representative sample, though.

You can also sign up, download the ebook, and immediately unsubscribe, as far as I'm aware. The ebook is a straightforward mobi or epub download (your choice).
