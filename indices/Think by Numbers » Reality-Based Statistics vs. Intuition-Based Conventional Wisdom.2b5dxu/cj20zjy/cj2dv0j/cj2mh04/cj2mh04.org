The sad thing is that the "right wing" party has moved so far from center that the views the party holds probably are less supported by facts. This probably isn't true for regular conservative people (of whom I know many and are all intelligent, relatively rational people).

Unfortunately that's just my gut feeling. It would be awesome if a blog like Think by Numbers could list the major planks of each party and analyze them all so we could get a more complete, balanced view.
