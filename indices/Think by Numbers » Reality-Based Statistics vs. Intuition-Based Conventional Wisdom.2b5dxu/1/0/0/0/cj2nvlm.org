Yeah, I definitely know people with "right-leaning" or libertarian-leaning /personalities/ who are entirely sane and capable of reason. The problem is that the available spectrum of opinions in most mainstream /parties/, across most of the Western world, has been skewed /extremely far/ to the neoliberal right, and often the /insane/ neoliberal right. So large parts of the populace have nobody to vote for, and the people who /do/ have someone to vote for are /fucking crazy/.
