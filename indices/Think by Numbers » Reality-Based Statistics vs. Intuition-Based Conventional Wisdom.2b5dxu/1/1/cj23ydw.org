You could probably make a pretty good case that it is biased in the choice of topics to cover but as far as I can tell, within those articles, it does a pretty good job of sticking to the facts and making rational analyses (although as a biologist I had some issues with his article on animal suffering).

Also, it seems to be tackling mostly the more obviously irrational policies. While I definitely agree that liberals have their fair share of wrong ideas and irrational thinking, I would argue that they tend to be harder to demonstrate exactly why (less obviously irrational).

It's really easy to show that our country is irrationally worried about terrorism over other threats, but it's a lot harder to show that it would be better for the economy if the corporate tax rate was cut to 0% (something a whole bunch of economists from across the political spectruam agree on)

Just out of curiosity, do you have any topics you think would balance out the coverage?
