So, I finally managed to catch up on the chapters.

The story itself seems reasonably consistent, but for some reason I just can't bring myself to care and I'm not sure why. I ADORE Log Horizon, and the concept of this is exactly what I had been looking for a long time, but the fic itself seems ... arid, dry? More like a chronicle of events rather than a story.

Am I the only feeling it like this?
