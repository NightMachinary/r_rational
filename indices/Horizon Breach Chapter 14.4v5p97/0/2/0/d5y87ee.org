As others have said, you've expanded the scope of the story way too much and the continuous POV change makes it difficult to care for any character. Perhaps it could be a good idea to simply focus on Michael's POV and use Interludes VERY SPARINGLY for explaining specific situations that the reader needs to understand but cannot infer from what Michael has access to.
