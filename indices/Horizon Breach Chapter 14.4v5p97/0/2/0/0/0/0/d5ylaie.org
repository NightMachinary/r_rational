My current plan with Michael is to fold him into the main storyline so I don't need to keep track of him individually. You'll actually be seeing that happen in CH15 today, but I haven't gotten around to posting it yet because I got writers block pretty bad yesterday and haven't finished the latest chapter on my backlog. (I make sure to write a few chapters in the future so I can fix plot holes without anyone noticing.)
