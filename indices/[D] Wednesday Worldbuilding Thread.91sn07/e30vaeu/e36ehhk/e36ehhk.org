If I'm one of the firsts, making sure I'm not crazy. Then checking if the new body is real.\\
Then start adopting process and adopt my self. (May need to kill parents and random baby, yes I'm evil... But I would prefer to just switch the babies.)

After that, I go to the James Randy Foundation and get my million dollars. (I can see what the babies see.) And it is a power, he can't steal.^^

After it gets proven, we have now two bodies. I start a company/website to "reunite" same soul bodies. (Of course, I will sell the data off my customers.) Mostly I will pay parents off. If that is not possible, I wait x years and then they have to escape on their own and I manage the rest of transportation. Active freeing someone will cost extra. I will make sure, they are really the same soul (show the baby a password and phone the old one)

Now, I guess that will happen everywhere and soon same soul bodies will live in the same house. Or in safe houses on the other side of the world, for the paranoid ones... But I don't think the world will change much.

What if one body dies? Does the other keep the memories of the body?
