Having thought about the implications of a soul with two differently functional brains in the otehr discussion, it occurs to me that an adult with mental disabilities gaining a neurotypical soulmate could be an intersting case to examine.

Would the personality of the soul inhibit the development of the second brain or would the second brain having abilities the soul previously lacked access to, but which don't violate the "mumble mumble" about super human capabilities cause changes to the personality?
