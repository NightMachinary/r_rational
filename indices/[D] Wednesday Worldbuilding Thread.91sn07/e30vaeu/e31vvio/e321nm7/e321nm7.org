#+begin_quote
  Do all current humans have souls? Have all Homo Sapiens? Did extinct members of the genus Homo?
#+end_quote

All minds of a deliberately vague "sufficient level of complexity" which currently only includes humans, have souls. This does probably raise some weird edge cases for, for instance, humans with brain damage, that I don't really know how to resolve.

#+begin_quote
  Have past souls detached and gone elsewhere upon death or were they wiped clean and recycled?
#+end_quote

Wiped clean and recycled.

#+begin_quote
  On the other hand, was it important that souls be regularly cleansed?

  On a similar note, perhaps we have not run out of souls but merely outrun their natural rate of reproduction.
#+end_quote

These are both excellent points. Neither of those is the case, but the people in this world have no way of knowing that, so they are both interesting things to have characters believe.
