Homosexuality is different in that it's been around long enough for social institutions to try to fight it, it concerns human sexuality (which is full of taboos in behavior and discussion), and it is very hard to distinguish preference from a biological cause (it is hard to test).

I can't come up with any examples of something supernatural happening to 1% of the population, though. I'd say the double-soul thing is different because the modern era is better at solving mysteries and the condition has testable and pretty unique predictions. "Being insane" is taboo, at least, so they are similar like that. It's also hard to test for most people.

But the first viral Youtube video of a baby and an adult moving in perfect synchronicity is going to solve a lot of mysteries for 1% of the population.
