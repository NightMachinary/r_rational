Some consequences off the top of my head:

1. The first several thousand are just assumed to be crazy (odds are bad that somone with adequate resources and eduction to demonstrate otherwise is among the first to share a soul). Worse chances are good the condition gets defined as a mental illness and, it takes the better part of a generation to figure out it isn't, and another one to get it accepted as such by most people.
2. Religious evangelism skyrockets as they finally got something the average scientist will concede is empirical proof of the existence of a soul. Naturally enough of them run with this as proof that their specific religion is exactly correct that chaose ensues.
3. Soulmate pairs become the standard for secure communication between distant points where low bandwidth is acceptable and eavesdropping is not (like between a base and a warship, or between an embassy and the capital). Also for spys. This gets awkward when the population does approach the 15 billion mark and probably leads to a Y2K-esque panic at the last minute.
4. A lot of drama happens as a result of custody battles between parents and soulmates of new children.
