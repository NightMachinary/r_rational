Thanks for the input; it's true that the average mage won't notice on their own. However, later in the story, the theoretical magicians are going to have more sway than you might think. They'll be able to get billions of dollars in government funding to do their research, and their popular writing will captivate millions. I'm worried that if they notice the inelegance, they'll start to doubt my existence and spread this doubt to everyone else. That will really mess up my story.
