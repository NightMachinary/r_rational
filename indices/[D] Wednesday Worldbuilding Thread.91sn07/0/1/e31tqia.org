I'm not sure it's a problem, Lord.

Your average citizen (from peasant to king) only interacts with magic in superficial ways. They'll memorize the quirks of any mass-produced arcana they own, entirely uninterested in the unifying principles behind them. Teach them the principles in compulsory education and they'll be forgotten as soon as exams are through. They certainly won't be reinforced by everyday life.

Working mages will have a somewhat more complex understanding, but most such scribblers will learn spells by rote. What they can't memorize they'll look up in the tables in the back of a book. The methods whereby the most useful arcana are made have been perfected and standardized for decades if not centuries.

The majority of that small percentage of magicians who actually /create/ spells or /invent/ arcana might operate within one of the two "systems" you mention. More likely they'll use a simplified abstraction built atop either or both and it will work perfectly well for whatever they're making. When something doesn't go according to plan, it can usually be brute-forced. "That's funny," they'll say, and they might make a note of it, but then they'll get back to the task at hand. The methods whereby modern spells and arcana are innovated has been standardized for years if not decades.

At the narrow peak of this pyramid are the theoretical magicians. Those who create not spells or magic items, but whole fields of study and potential enterprise. Or that's what they used to do, anyway. It seems for the last few generations they're basically on the same page as you.

There truly may be one single perfect magic system underneath the two awkward ones we've got... but who beside gods, theoretical magicians, and armchair intellectuals gains anything for even caring?
