Be not afraid. Barthes' "Death of the Author" isn't about your literal murder, it's about loosening your grasp on what your story /means/. What it's /for/. In my experience as an (admittedly less ambitious) author, there's more pleasure in seeing what the many creative minds of an audience can come up with than there is pain in watching them guess badly. Nothing makes me happier than having someone come up with a better idea than I had using the tools I've made. It creates a sense of being part of a greater whole. Surely being the thing entire, the alpha and omega, would get lonely after a while.

Take chances. Play dice. So long as the story is engaging enough, some clever readers may engineer a solution without you. If not, no worries, a little suspension of disbelief goes a long way.
