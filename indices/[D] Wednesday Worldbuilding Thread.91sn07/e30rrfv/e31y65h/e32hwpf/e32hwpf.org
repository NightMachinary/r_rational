So I'm already doing the curvature tensor thing, but the problem is that to make it work with the quantum field theory it needs to be more of a quantum force with its own force-carrying particles, and this immediately leads to problems with infinities. However, your suggestion about hiding the paradox is /excellent/ - the second magic system already produces such boundaries naturally - I think I'll take that suggestion. But there is still a strong theoretical problem that I'm worried people will notice.
