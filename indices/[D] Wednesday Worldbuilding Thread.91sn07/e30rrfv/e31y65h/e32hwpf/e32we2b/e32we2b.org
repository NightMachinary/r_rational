Are you sure the curvature thing needs to work with the quantum thing? As long as you keep the two magic system separate you shouldn't have any real problems. If you don't use "force-carrying particles" then the quantum field system doesn't apply to the space-time system and the problems with infinities just won't arise. I know it's not the elegant solution you're looking for, but it should work. Clever readers will realize that just because things look like they could be related at a fundamental level that it isn't necessarily so, and that the settings is designed more for consistency than for the sake of satisfying their aesthetic sensibilities.

Besides which, if you have a "space-time particle", then you end up with deep questions about the nature of the space-time manifold itself.
