Can you give an example of a test someone might perform that would demonstrate a paradox where the rules conflict?

If you can, I recommend hiding such conflicts behind a boundary beyond which nothing can be observed. Safely hidden away, even if a paradox can be proven to exist, it can never be demonstrated in practice and you're in the clear.

Also, you might not want to use an /attractive/ spacetime-warping force. Just let the curvature tensor be a function of local mass-energy distribution and the current metric. This will result in an attractive "force" in the most common scenarios.
