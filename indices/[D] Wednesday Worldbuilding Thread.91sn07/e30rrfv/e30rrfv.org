So I'm planning a story with two magic systems, but I'm running into a problem.

The first magic system is based on fields. There are several fundamental fields, and each field is associated with a set of particles. Particles can interact with multiple fields, and with each other via force-carrying particles associated with the fields. Particles can bind together to form Elements, each of which has special properties. [[https://sciencenotes.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/PeriodicTableWorks.png][Here]] is a link to the elements I've fleshed out so far. Elements can be combined together to form new substances. Magical creatures in this world are collections of substances that self-replicate and have been selected for over time.

The second magic system involves time and space. The flow of time changes depending on velocity, though locally physics appears the same to all observers. There is an attractive force which binds matter together, and this force also warps the flow of space and time.

The problem I'm having is that I can't make these two magic systems work together. I can't quite integrate the attractive spacetime-warping force into the field theory of the first magic system - every time I try, I get conflicting results between the two magic systems. I've been trying to fix this by messing around with strings, but so far I haven't gotten anywhere.

Does anyone have suggestions as to how I could make the two magic systems work together? Do you think anyone would notice if I just didn't address this problem?

Thanks!

God
