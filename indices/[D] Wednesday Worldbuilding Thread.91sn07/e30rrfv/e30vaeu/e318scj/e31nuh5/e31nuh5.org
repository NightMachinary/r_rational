  it takes the better part of a generation to figure out it isn't [a mental illness]

Worldwide population growth is about 1% per year. If 1/100 people all come down with the same new illness, and all attribute it to the same fantastic explanation, the rest of us will probably be convinced in short order. If nothing else, rich folk who are affected have the resources to seek out their new counterparts. Some folks will coincidentally have their counterparts close by.

More importantly, 50% of newborn babies are affected (since people are born about twice as often as they die). Half of the world's parents are going to notice something is up; getting to the bottom of it shouldn't take a whole generation.
