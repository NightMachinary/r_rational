Noticing something is up and correctly identifying what is up are two very different things.

Competing diagnosis will include:

1. Posession
2. Reincarnation (baby is remembering a now ended life not experiencing a shared life)
3. Environmentally triggered infant schizophrenia (blamed on vaccines, GMO food, specific brands of baby products, etc.)
4. Alien hybrid babies
5. A novel developmental illness
6. The "next step" in human evolution leading to genius babies

Also how odd the babies behave is dependent on how much access a body that hasn't fully developed has to skills possessed by its soulmate. If the infant brain still has to learn motor control and language at the usual pace before it has the wetware to actually use the skills its soul possess there might not be much unusual behavior to notice as the soul will have had months possibly a year to get used to the situation before they can act out of the expected range, and by then many will choose not to.
