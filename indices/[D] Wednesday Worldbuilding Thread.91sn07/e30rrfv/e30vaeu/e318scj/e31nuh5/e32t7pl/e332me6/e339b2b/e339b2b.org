I would not expect the adult to behave erratically at least not involuntarily so. The premis states that souls contain the personality and are perfect milti-taskers able to run each body normally in parallel. So it should be capable of keeping the adult body "business as usual" to the extent that the personality wants to (rather than say, spending a ton of time looking for the infant body).

The thing is to be detected as unusual an infant would have to behave outside what an infant is normally capable of. That would IMO depend on the "mumble mumble" that keeps multiple brains in parallel form being able to exceed human intelligence levels. Does it work in reverse and enable a soul to run what its infant body hears through its adult body's language center to try and discern words? Does the same work using the adult bodies language center to convert words it no something the infant body's motor control can turn into correct sounds?

Also, I still thing your unfairly applying meta knowledge of what the correct answer is when assessing what claims of thei phenomenon would actually sound like.

An adult reporting that they experience the sensations of a second body. Most likely while expressing concern that they have gone crazy. These reports will be disproportionately made to therapists who are bound by confidentiality so word will spread slowly and it will take a lot of reports before any pattern is perceived, and chances are by the time it is perceived somone will have made the claims publicly and it will be unclear if new cases are genuine or attention-whoring copycats.

Parents of an infant claiming their baby is somehow special (hardly unusual). They are likely to have a preferred explanation and claim that is the cause. Without the infant's cooperation they'll be unable to prove it, so a lot will be called hoaxes as the infant stops cooperating when it becomes apparent the parents went in a direction it didn't like, a lot will only be reported locally (they only told their priest and the priest didn't pass it up the chain after deciding it wasn't a real demonic possesion, etc.)

Sure, once someone actually does track down their soulmate they'll be able to pass a variety of specific tests to prove their claim. However, that's going to take a pretty specific set of circumstances:

1. Correctly identify the phenomenon they are experiencing (would "i have a second body" actually be your first thought?).
2. Make an effort to locate their soulmate
3. Have the resources to succeed at locating their soulmate
4. Secure the cooperation of the soulmate's caretaker(s)
5. Go public rather than quietly exploit it for personal gain.

#1 is sort of a double whammy as incorrectly identifying the phenomenon could lead to trying to prove the wrong thing. If the first person to actually clear all the other steps happens to be a UFO nut who thinks that alien hybrid babies are psychic and that's why they share the sensory experience of this baby, could majorly setback identification as they pass double blind tests cositant with the claim, so it makes sense to start looking for proof aliens.
