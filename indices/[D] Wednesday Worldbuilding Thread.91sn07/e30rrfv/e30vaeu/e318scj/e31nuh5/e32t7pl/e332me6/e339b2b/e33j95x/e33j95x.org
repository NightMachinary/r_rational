It's interesting that our intuitions are so different here.

  These reports will be disproportionately made to therapists who are bound by confidentiality so word will spread slowly
#+end_quote

If I experienced having a second body, I wouldn't wait until I saw a therapist to talk about it. I'd at the very least search for it online, where presumably some fraction of the 70 million people this happened to last year are talking about it. Seeing anyone else talk about it would embolden me. Even if it was just me I'd probably still look to my close friends and family for support and to help sort out what was happening. Since 1/100 folks are affected, there's a good chance that someone I know is affected as well.

Regarding the behavior of infants with adult souls...

  a lot will only be reported locally
#+end_quote

Half of infants the world behaving strangely would still be a big deal, and noticed, even if parents never tried to report it further than locally. However, maybe it wouldn't be as obvious as I thought. Perhaps a large fraction of second bodies would basically act like normal infants. Between that and

#+begin_quote
  Parents of an infant claiming their baby is somehow special (hardly unusual). They are likely to have a preferred explanation and claim that is the cause.
#+end_quote

I'm basically convinced the world would find out through an adult, rather than an infant. I'm no longer convinced that half of all children being affected is the bigger deal.

So, those steps:

#+begin_quote
  Correctly identify the phenomenon they are experiencing (would "i have a second body" actually be your first thought?)
#+end_quote

If you grew a third arm, would 'I have a third arm' be your first thought? If I had a second body, 'I have a second body' should definitely be a hypothesis I form. "I am crazy" is another, but if my life was otherwise unimpaired I would definitely consider the obvious explanation, rather than deny my senses. It's not like I would say "Nope, I"m crazy" and refuse to contemplate what was going on, seek information, and even talk to others about it.

#+begin_quote
  Make an effort to locate their soulmate
#+end_quote

I might not do this because I wouldn't be certain my second body is even in the same dimension as my first one. Still, if my second body is hearing a language I try to figure out what is being said, for example, and that would help me figure out my second location. If the words being heard by my second self are coherent but not in a language I speak, that lessens "I'm crazy" as a hypothesis.

#+begin_quote
  Have the resources to succeed at locating their soulmate
#+end_quote

If you randomly choose people until you reach 70 million, it seems intuitive that some people will have a second body much closer by. Indeed, there's a 2% chance that (worldwide) someone's second body will be their /own child/ within the first year. (70 million children with second bodies, 1/7 billion chance the second body is a specific parent). If you allow for nearby humans, it very quickly becomes certain that at least a few people will be nearby their second bodies.

How many people wouldn't travel across town to solve a mystery like this? They might not know they are in the same town at first, but if they understand the things said by their parents they'd figure that out pretty quickly.

Of course, some folks are able to travel further if necessary. Those with resources not only seek out their second bodies, they legitimize the phenomenon through their efforts.

#+begin_quote
  Secure the cooperation of the soulmate's caretaker(s)
#+end_quote

This is something I have a hard time estimating. I think that 'cooperation' is much harder than 'believes that the baby has another body' or 'believes a phenomenon other than mental illness is occurring'. If you get to the point that you are talking to your second parents with your first body, proving you aren't crazy is as simple as saying how many fingers are being held up, or revealing you know things you shouldn't. Even if the vast majority of parents wouldn't accept that ("Clearly you're a demon trying to take my child!"), 2% of second bodies have parents with second bodies themselves--those will probably be sympathetic. Widen the area for a second body to be considered 'nearby' by 50x--from a few hundred to tens of thousands. Still just across town, for at least one lucky person.

#+begin_quote
  Go public rather than quietly exploit it for personal gain.
#+end_quote

Why not exploit it publicly for personal gain? The first person who can show they have a second body will be famous. By the time fame is no longer a motivator, it's widely accepted.

#+begin_quote
  incorrectly identifying the phenomenon could lead to trying to prove the wrong thing
#+end_quote

That's true, though if we are looking for aliens we are also admitting it isn't a mental illness. Realizing something is happening will be fast. Eliminating mental illness shouldn't take much longer.

Or at least, that's what my intuition says. I understand that 'obvious in hindsight' might be at play... but eliminating mental illness doesn't require you explain it correctly, it just requires you to convince others it is real. That seems like it should be easy when so many people are affected and when an experimental test exists. Consider the dress with two colors, or a name heard two different ways: even without any way to prove that one perceives it differently, can we agree that those are real phenomenon?

This new phenomenon affects fewer people, but not very few. And it can be tested.
