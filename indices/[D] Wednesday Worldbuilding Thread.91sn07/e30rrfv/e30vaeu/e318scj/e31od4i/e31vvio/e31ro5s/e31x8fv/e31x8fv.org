The good news- if birth rates are high enough people become, well not immortal, but undying. If there are two-three times as many bodies as there are souls, then basically everybody has two bodies. If you lose bodies, such that you only have one body, then you will be near the top of the list to get another body.

There is some question if you lose something when a body dies. If you have an old body and an infant body, and the old body dies, what happens? Does the person's mind essentially regress to an infant's, who grows up normally aside from strange barely remembered memories? What about children or teenagers? If this is the case, I imagine it might take a while to find out. Long enough for people to slip through the cracks.

There will enevitably be cases where people are born into bad situations across the globe. People will be born across country borders with little ability to immigrate. If countries do allow reincarnates to immigrate then expect people to game that system.

Most reincarnates will be born in places with high population growth, like India. It would be interesting to see how the Indian government reacts to wealthy foriegners trying to "steal" peoples babies.

On the plus side I expect people to develop a lot more sympathy to the plight of others across the globe.

I expect people who are [born into bad situations or become disabled or get very old] and have another body in good shape to commit suicide. I expect this to occur more often as we hit the twice as many bodies as souls mark and one can get a "backup" body more easily. Of course, if your new body is likely to be ransomed back to you that will effect your cost-benefit calculation.

I also expect to see people very mad and trying to prevent people from committing suicide. After all, they are selfishly taking bodies from those more deserving, or so those people might say.

Some people might try to pretend to be a new soul, in order to avoid being ransomed or whatever else a hostile government might do to them. Expect methods of detecting reincarnates (checking to see if the respond to foriegn languages, careful monitoring of online behavior, etc.) some of these methods will be prohibitively expensive to apply en mass (probably the more effective ones), so not everyone will be caught. Expect plent of false positives and negatives.

As the population nears immortality, new souls would become much more rare. They would be the result of people's bodies dying at nearly the same time. I expect this to be the result of assassination or execution more often than not. Regardless, new souls would be treasured.

Speaking of execution, criminal justice becomes much more difficult if a criminal has two bodies, especially if the government doesn't know about one.
