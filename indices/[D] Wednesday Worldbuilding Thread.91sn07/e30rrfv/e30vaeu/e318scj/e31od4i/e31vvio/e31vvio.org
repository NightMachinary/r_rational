At what point during evolution did souls start connecting living creatures? Do all current humans have souls? Have all Homo Sapiens? Did extinct members of the genus Homo? All apes? Primates? Mammals? Vertebrates? Animals? Eukaryotes? If not, why not?

Regardless, this will determine what sort of brain people wind up connected to, and how frequently they can expect to.

Have past souls detached and gone elsewhere upon death or were they wiped clean and recycled?

If the former, then that process has hit a major hiccup: Will souls will only depart if /all/ of the creatures attached to it die, or will any single death detach all those connected, requiring them to hook up to some other soul? In either case there's an odd statistical time limit. If souls only detach if everyone dies, then progressively fewer will depart to wherever souls have gone before. Even a 1% growth rate doubles population every 70 years, roughly human life expectancy. The addition of shorter-lived animals with higher growth rates will complicate the process.

Clearly if all lives reassign at any death things are even more chaotic as individual souls will have to incorporate partially constructed memories into their gestalt on what will shortly be a regular basis. Again, this is going to be enormously more chaotic if mice, ants, toadstool mushrooms, and staphylococci are included.

If reincarnation is the order of the day, and non-humans are involved then it's interesting to speculate whether it was human population than caused it or, for example, the increase in populations of livestock. Is it going to be a big problem if there's a climate-based algal bloom? On the other hand, was it important that souls be regularly cleansed? Do they decay or degrade after a few hundred years of continuous use?

On a similar note, perhaps we have not run out of souls but merely outrun their natural rate of reproduction. Was this caused by the exhaustion of some other metaphysical resource, perhaps a whole soul ecosystem is out of balance? If so souls may begin to die off for lack of sustenance, and their inability to reproduce could be a sign of darker days to come.
