I think this would be good for humanity. You'd suddenly care more about the suffering of folks all around the world, since you might up spending half your time in another place. If the population continued to grow you'd start to care more about the future because subjectively you are likely going to live to see it.

It's hard to say whether population will grow faster or slower (I doubt growth will stay the same). On the one hand, the risk of having a baby controlled by an adult mind (which removes a lot of the charm of raising children) might slow population growth. On the other... if folks are willing to pay for custody of their counterpart, having extra children and ransoming the ones with two bodies might be lucrative. How best to get someone to come claim their second body with a hefty fee...

Actually, this might not be a good thing.
