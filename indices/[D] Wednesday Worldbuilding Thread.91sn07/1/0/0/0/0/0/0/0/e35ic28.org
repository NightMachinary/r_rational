Keep in mind more than 1% of the population is homosexual and that has been considered a diagnosable mental illness and many people still claim it should be.

Mostly I think that it will take long enough to prove the phenomenon is real that the initial claimants will have been diagnosed with some form of hallucination/delusion (the correct diagnosis for somone describing the symptoms without their soulmate on hand to prove it isn't), as more cases come forward it'll be reclassified as it's own separate condition, and when proof finally does happen most people will still think it's a hoax until having it personally proven to them.

I also think you're wrong about finding reliable information. When you do that google search you will in fact find many more groups than you estimated all of whom have different mutually incompatible explanations, enough of which will be wrong by enough that they will inhibit determining the correct explanation. You provided one I hadn't thought of yourself with your parallel universe explanation which you admin might keep you from trying to track down your soulmate. Now cosider that chances are everyone who is on those message boards probably has their own unique similar idea, and you should get a better grasp of the problem. Then remember the Internet is full of trolls, and for every real case you'll have 2 lying copycats, 3 people trying to maliciously discredit the others out of spite, and a dozen parroting variations of "extraordinary claims require extrodinary proof".(numbers made up)

You are also assuming that people connect the distinct weirdness of all the soul-sharing babies to one phenomenon.

The parent of their own soulmate, the two infants in different cities that share a soul, the teenage boy who thinks he's hit the jackpot being breast-fed, and the priest of a cargo cult on a pacific island who's soulmate is a baby in India are not necessarily going to present symptoms similar enough to determine that they aren't four completely unrelated cases.

Science works not because it comes up with right answers but because it has a framework for discarding the wrong ones. That takes time, and during the process people think all kinds of wrong things. Something that is as much an outside context problem as 1. souls being real, and 2 souls being shared between bodies won't be figured out quickly. IMO a 40 year cycle (better part of two generations) from first appearance to accepted as fact and being commercially and culturally exploited is pretty fast really.
