The problem is 1% of the population believing a thing (even if it's the same thing and provably correct) does not actually make that the majority interpretation. And in this case there won't be consensus among the 1% about what is happening, and proof will not be trivial in the general case.

The 99% will be skeptical and will point out that the video would be pretty easy to fake (film the infant, then film the adult mimicking whatever the infant did and splice the footage together, a green tarp and a copy of Final Cut would probably be adequate).

Also, by the time that video exists there will be people who asked their therapist about their perceptions and have been diagnosed with something. Also, if the video does go viral, expect copycats (probably involving actual cats somehow), which reduce the credibility.

A useful though experiment might be: Consider what you'd say to somone who replied to this thread with "hey that's exactly what's happening to me right now". How would you react if you knew this just a hypothetical world building exercise on Redit, and that person is either a troll or deluded? because THAT is how this looks to the >99% of the inhabitants of this universe who haven't experienced the phenomenon themselves, or who already sought help and have been diagnosed with delusions.

And to your point on social taboos: Souls, witchcraft, demonic/spirit possession, and care/corruption of babies have been hotbeds for taboos longer than homosexuality has.
