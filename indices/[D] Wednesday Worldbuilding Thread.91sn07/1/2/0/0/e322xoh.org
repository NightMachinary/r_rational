If we're talking brain complexity, then it will almost certainly include the cetaceans who have a significantly larger and more complex cerebral cortex than humans do. Also keep in mind the weird massively parallel brain systems of the cephalopods. The larger ones might cross that complexity boundary.

A population of only a few million though, so it would be an edge case.
