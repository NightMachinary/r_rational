  On a similar note, perhaps we have not run out of souls but merely outrun their natural rate of reproduction.

It's probably important that souls be disembodied in order to reproduce. As the human population has approached the soul population, the growth rate of the soul population has declined. Now that it's reached saturation, the soul population has become stagnant.

We might be able to test this theory by 1) performing a soul census, 2) reducing the population for a time, 3) raising the population above the previous soul cap, and 4) performing a new soul census.
