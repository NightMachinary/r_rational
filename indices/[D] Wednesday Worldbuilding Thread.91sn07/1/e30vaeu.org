You wake up one morning, open your eyes, then open a different pair of eyes on the other side of the planet. You open your mouths to gasp in shock and two breaths of air flow in. One of you cries.

Turns out, there is a finite number of souls in existence. That number is somewhere around 7.6 billion and we just ran out. From now on, until the world populations shrinks, each newborn child gets assigned a soul that is already assigned to another body. Two bodies inhabited by a single soul have a single conscience, they share sensory data, memories, knowledge and personality (though since the new body is an undeveloped infant, the personality of the original body largely dominates), but the muscles in the new body are untrained and the soul is unaccustomed to using them, so it still takes time to learn to do things like walking and speaking.

Possessing two brains worth of processing power allows a soul with two bodies to perfectly multitask between the two bodies, but it does not otherwise make you much smarter than a single bodied human due to the inefficiencies of the [mumblemumble].

Which new bodies get assigned to which souls is completely random: a man can end up with the body of a female baby and a farmer in North Korea can end up in the child of a North American billionaire. The only thing that is consistent is that people that already have two bodies do not get a third until the world population reaches 15.1-ish billion.

How would you expect the world to react to this revelation? What will people from different countries do when their children wake up with the minds of complete strangers? What will those same people do when they suddenly find part of themselves in a completely different culture?
