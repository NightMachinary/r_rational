I love how black is invading procer. He is throwing narrative weight on his side, because the evil army destroying bringing the good kingdom to it's knees before a brave band of heroes rises up in last minute defiance is such a powerful trope. If he plays his invasion right, the story favors him temporarily and we have already seen how all-powerful the story is in this world.
