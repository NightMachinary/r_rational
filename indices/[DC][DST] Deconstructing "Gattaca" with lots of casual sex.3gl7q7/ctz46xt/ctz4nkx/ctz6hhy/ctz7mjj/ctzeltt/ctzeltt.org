The target market for genetic enhancement are parents who believe that genetic engineering can produce a better baby than random chance. (Actually, the initial target market is the population of wealthy infertile couples, but let's assume we've moved beyond that.) So your target market is already against randomly made babies, even those that comes from "good stock", because /science can do better/.

There are a lot of ways to do DRM. I don't think a "strict lockout" makes the most sense from a business perspective, especially because the time to maturity is /at least/ twenty years, probably quite a bit more (in comparison to corn, which has one harvest a year). So there's not actually that much sense in strict protection unless you think that the state of the art isn't going to advance much given an entire human generation.

Personally, I would implement "soft" DRM. We offer a contraceptive enhancement so that no one gets stuck with a "random" baby on accident, and if you want to reverse that feature, we can do that. You're worried about the company going insolvent and not being around to reverse the process? Not a problem; we've got a separate company prepaid through the contraceptive enhancement fee, which is already funded for the next sixty years, so even if /this/ company goes insolvent (which it won't), your children won't be left without the option to have children of their own. All they'll need to do is come in for a free genetic consult to let them know the risks associated with their genome, the troubles inherent in "random" babies, and the pricing options in case they change their minds and want to have an engineered baby after all (with a discount for legacies!). If you really want to roll the dice, we can't stop you, at least not until our lobbyists get some laws passed.

Edit: And hey, that genetic consult is for the benefit of your future child. Obviously my company makes its children backwards compatible with baseline "random" children, but we're not the only company in the game, and we're talking about compatibility with technologies that have yet to be invented. If your child is thirty-five years old trying to procreate with a twenty-five year old, we're talking about two technologies ten years apart, potentially from different companies. We can be confident in the modifications that we're making, but we can't be confident in the modifications that /other/ people will be making using technologies we can't predict under laws that might change. Contraception and a consult is just basic /safety/.

(And of course, you move the goal posts from there.)
