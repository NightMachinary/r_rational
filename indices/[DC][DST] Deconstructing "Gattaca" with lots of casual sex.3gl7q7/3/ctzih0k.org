I got the impression that the invalids were that way because their parents didn't want to play with their children's genes, not because they couldn't afford to.

Also, it was still really early in eugenics becoming popular again after that crazy Austrian dude made it stop being cool. Next generation there will probably be less of a difference, although the valids will still have genes that go well with each other.
