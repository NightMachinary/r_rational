  The upper classes will somehow abolish casual sex so thoroughly that enhanced alleles can't spread out of narrow, advantaged social classes into the broad population in the ordinary way.

Am I misremembering Gattaca? I thought the advantage was less about having "special" alleles, and more in being able to select a whole matching basket of alleles, excluding all the dodgy ones that would otherwise appear with a frequency dictated by chance. Children born of random promiscuity wouldn't be able to inherit all of the parents' advantages without going through the selective screening test-tube process.

Although I suppose eventually you'd have an elite class who were all homozygous for a converging set of "preferred" alleles, and their offspring would be certain to receive at least one copy.
