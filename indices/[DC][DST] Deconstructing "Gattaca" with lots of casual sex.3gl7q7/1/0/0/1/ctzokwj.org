The [[http://www.gwern.net/Drug%20heuristics#algernon-argument][Algernon argument]] strongly suggests that if you move to an optimum for some valuable combination of traits, you're going to move away from those for others. We're never going to be hyper-specialized, but that doesn't mean that you'll get equal proportions of the benefits and no extra drawbacks in a cross.
