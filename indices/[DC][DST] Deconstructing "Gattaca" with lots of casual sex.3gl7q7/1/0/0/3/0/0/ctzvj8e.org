So recap:

In Gattaca there's *no designer alleles*. instead, they ensure the /best possible combination/ of alleles for a given egg and sperm partner.

While this does presumably screen out purely deleterious mutations, the bulk of the advantage presumably come from 1) enforcing heterozygosity at key regions and 2) keeping at the peak of âˆ© shaped fitness curve for a bazillion tiny polygenic parameters (trivial examples: selecting against "too tall" /and/ "too short").

In theory, /most/ of this fine-tuned advantage would be lost within only a single generation of uncontrolled breeding. So, two designer parents /will/ have a perfectly normal baby if they don't artificially design it (and that is, in fact, the plot, right? Two designer parents have one designer baby and one regular?)

I don't know if it would actually work out exactly this way, but this is the way the show posits that it works (and it's not outrageous for a reasonably informed person to speculate that it /could/ work that way).
