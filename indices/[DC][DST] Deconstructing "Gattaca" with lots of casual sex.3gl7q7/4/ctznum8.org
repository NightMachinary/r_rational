while methods like extra artificial chromosomes and germline cell modding would indeed be inheritable, there are various ways where enhancement and treatment could be achieved without it being inheritable. Such as tissue-specific virus vectors who would only target where needed, or chimerization via implantation of modified stem cells (muscle, denser bone, better neurons, etc). these both offer a company the control over its intellectual property and parents are free to reproduce naturally without the worry that their sight enhancement on their eyes result in a baby who has photoreceptors instead of skin nerves. Non inheritable methods are also attractive to parents who want their kids to have the /latest/ in gene fashion and not only inherit their crummy Ãœbermensch V.1.2 that was in vogue when they were born! of course tech tends to trickle down and if governments today pay for vaccines I don't see why they wouldn't pay at least for some gene therapy in the future.
