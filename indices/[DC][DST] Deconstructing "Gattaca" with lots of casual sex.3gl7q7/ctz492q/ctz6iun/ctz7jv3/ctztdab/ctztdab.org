The reason you're (generally) wrong is that assuming smartness is adaptive, smartness alleles with no drawbacks are under strong positive selection and will reach fixation (as in, spread to the entire population) almost immediately.

Most genetic variation between individuals can be conceptualized as the diversity that is left over /after/ this process of obviously-adaptive-alleles-take-over-the-entire-gene-pool occurs.
