My point is that getting your kids engineered using patented genes enforced by sterility means you're choosing that none of your children, or their children if they have any, or THEIR children, will be able to reproduce without the aid of the generic engineering company.

You're putting the future of your family into the hands of a company that might not exist in twenty years, let alone generations beyond that.

This is not something many rich and successful people are going to be willing to do.
