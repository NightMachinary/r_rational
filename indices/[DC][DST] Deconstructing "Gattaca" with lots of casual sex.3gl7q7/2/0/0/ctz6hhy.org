It's not about sterility, it's about contraception. If there currently existed a product which would stop my child from becoming (or causing someone else to become) pregnant until they /explicitly chose/ for that to happen ... well, it would depend on the price point and who would ultimately hold the keys (preferably not a corporation) but if the price point were "free" and my child didn't have to risk corporate blackmail to get reproduction turned back on, I think that would be a no-brainer.
