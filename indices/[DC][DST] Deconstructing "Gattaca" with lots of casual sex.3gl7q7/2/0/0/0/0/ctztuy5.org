Why would you assume a drug/surgery/whatever? Why not just have the same gengineering responsible for the great individual traits also completely foul up the reproductive process? Make the males produce no sperm, make the females produce no eggs, make the uterus unable to support implantation, and on and on. In such a world, when you want children, the parents' diploid DNA gets sampled from their regular tissue, feature-mixed manually on a computer, and a viable zygote protein-printed.

Effectively, the genetically-engineered are speciated from humans, and have a reproductive process with three parents: a mother and father who contribute DNA, and a computer in which the contributions conceive life.
