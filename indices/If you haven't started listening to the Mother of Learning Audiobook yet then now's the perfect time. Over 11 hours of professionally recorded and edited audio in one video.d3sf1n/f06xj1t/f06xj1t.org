If one were to have read the first chapter or three way back when that were all that existed, and decided that they wanted to read the entire god damned thing in one-ish sitting, would nowish be a good time to begin reading it? I'd be fine with waiting a few months for the official climax/end.

Like, the first day of fall is a week from now. Perhaps I read Ch1 a week from now. Do you think MOL will be finished by Christmas?
