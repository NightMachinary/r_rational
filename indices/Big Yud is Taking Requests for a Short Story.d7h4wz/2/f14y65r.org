A rational Orpheus is ascending from the underworld and trying to determine whether or not Hades has kept his bargain (allowing the shade of Eurydice to return to life by following him) without breaking the deal and looking back.

An equally-rational Hades has anticipated this and has put in his best effort to make this impossible to determine until the shade has emerged into the light, and has thus been returned to life.
