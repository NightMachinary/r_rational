Aliens want earth to participate in their Kaiju-esque robot fighting sport (giant robot boxing, basically), so they send brain messages (that are arbitrarily convincing) to the smartest member of our species, as determined by some sort of handwavey brain criteria. This person's situation is not great (maybe they are in jail, maybe just not a big deal), and now they have to scramble to get a giant robot put together before the aliens arrive.

I was just struck by the thought that being Noah immediately post-Arc-revelation would have been extremely weird ("Honey, this is gonna sound crazy, but how many animals, by the by, would you say that there are?"), and one could probably get a short story out of putting that viewpoint in a familiar 2019 scenario.
