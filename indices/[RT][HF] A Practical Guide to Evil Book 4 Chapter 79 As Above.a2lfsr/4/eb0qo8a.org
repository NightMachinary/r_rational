The fact that Cat tries sooooooo hard to commit to cooperating here (despite having it backfire on her) makes me wonder if her not knuckling under to Cordelia was more Winter mediated than I thought at the time.

I'm really curious to see Masego or Grey Pilgrim take a look at her soul. Cat being more "Cat" now implies that whatever metaphysical damage the Winter construct did seems to be revertible back to her "core" self (also ignoring the fact that her soul was rent by Sve Noc).
