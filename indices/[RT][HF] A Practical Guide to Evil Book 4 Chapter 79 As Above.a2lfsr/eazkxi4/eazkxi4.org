I think this is the first main "pivot" for setting up the Wandering Bard as the Big Bad against Cat for the final book. Correct me if I'm wrong, but today's chapter might be the current most biggest narrative event where Cat is vocally rejecting the Gods Below, with Cat already rejecting the Gods Above.

With how things are going, I'm guessing the next book will focus a bit more on Cat rejecting the Gods, slowly putting her head-to-head against the Bard and making her allies with Hierarch and Bellorephon, Shining Jewel of Democracy. I also think that Black's death will be the final nail that hammers Cat's conviction against the Gods, but it's just speculation.
