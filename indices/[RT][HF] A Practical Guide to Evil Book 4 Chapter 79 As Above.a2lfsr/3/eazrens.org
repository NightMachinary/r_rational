If Cat's not going to use Winter mojo to keep the drow in line, how is she possibly going to bring them to Callow without it resulting in a bloodbath? I can understand disliking the drow pseudo-enslavement due to its potential to backfire narratively, but it's not like she has a lot of options or like the alternatives are any better morally. She can let the dwarves slaughter them, but that's not really an improvement for the drow.
