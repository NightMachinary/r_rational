as an author/creator I consider death of the author paramount and vital to remember. Things are not always obvious to me as an author and seeing what people see in absence of my own views and internal biases/greater knowledge on my own work is really valuable.

I've been getting a lot better because I pay attention to what people THINK is going on versus what I mean to be going on.

That said I've decided to try to take a more 'hands off' approach to my serial writing because I want to see what people interpret and view more clearly without me adding cloudiness to the waters.
