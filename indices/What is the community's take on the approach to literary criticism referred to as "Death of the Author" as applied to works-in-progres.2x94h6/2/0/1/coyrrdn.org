Canon is not a term that can really be applied in this context, because it is explicitly driven by authorial intent. Let's say Eliezer writes hpmor. Then, two years later, writers hpmor 2, where in the first paragraph it explains that hpmor was all a fever dream that Hagrid had after being stabbed by a unicorn because he was no longer a virgin after bedding a dragon. Hpmor 2 then follows Hagrid's attempts to understand his dreams of rationality, while Harry is just an ordinary kid in the background.

Does that alter HPMOR? I mean sure, it'll alter your perception of it, but it hasn't changed the words in the text at all. The text is the text. It can be useful to hear what an author wanted the text to say, but that doesn't mean you have to accept it. Tolkien apparently disavowed the notion that Sauron represented technology, but it kind of screams out from the page.

Obviously this becomes blurred when the author goes back to modify the original text, which can obviously change interpretations!
