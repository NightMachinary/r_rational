  Valuing a writer's opinion infinitely more simply because they have a higher chance of contributing something "official" to a story you enjoy...is a belief that has several holes in it.
#+end_quote

Well, it's not my main argument, but yours don't convince me either.

  Both terms only mean what people think they mean.
#+end_quote

That's tautology. Everything means only what people think it does. That's why we have defined the terms. So we can actually talk and know we talk about the same thing when we use the same terms.

  And ultimately, "canon" is nothing more than a distinction made for convenience, meant to describe whatever elements or works certainly exist in the context of any given fictional universe.
#+end_quote

Not really. Marvel has multiple universes and continuities. All canon.

#+begin_quote
  And therefore, I generally just don't bother much worrying about what is "canon" or "non-canon."
#+end_quote

Me neither. It's very clear, so why would anyone worry about it?
