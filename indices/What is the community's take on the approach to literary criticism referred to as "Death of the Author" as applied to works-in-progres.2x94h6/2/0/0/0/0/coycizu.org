Canon can sometimes have certain gray areas. Stories can contradict themselves, new stories can retroactively alter old ones, multiple people who worked on a story can all have different opinions of it, etc. And word of god exists in an even more gray area than that. I think it's a place where people should just be able to believe what they like.

I for one know of at least a few authors with poor memories, who don't sometimes seem to know their stories as well as their fans do. That's natural, humans are quite fallible. And so I'm not going to automatically treat anything the author says as superior, especially if it doesn't appear in the story proper.

  That's tautology. Everything means only what people think it does. That's why we have defined the terms. So we can actually talk and know we talk about the same thing when we use the same terms.

When a person writes a new story in a series, perhaps a comic, they must make certain considerations. Did spinoff X take place in continuity? What about that really nonsensical issue that contradicted several of the other ones? How much weight do stories that were written 20 years ago have?

A writer picks and chooses what they consider to be canon for any given story. Sometimes they make oversights, sometimes they make contradictions, sometimes they flat out ignore what happened before. So in a since, yes, canon truly does only mean what people think it means. For the writer certainly, and for the fans too, if everything is less than transparently spelled out in the story itself.
