Any television program typically uses several writers in the span of its existence. Some book series include works from several different authors. Comic companies routinely employ dozens of writers. On many occasions, shmucks with woefully incomplete knowledge of the source material get the opportunity to create new canon. Valuing a writer's opinion infinitely more simply because they have a higher chance of contributing something "official" to a story you enjoy...is a belief that has several holes in it.

"Canon" and "non-canon"...it's all irrelevant, honestly. If a writer suddenly disavows large parts of their story, does that make it "non-canon?" Both terms only mean what people think they mean. If most people generally consider certain books of a franchise canon and certain books non-canon, so it shall be. If you choose to believe the company publishing the books, then what they say is canon is what is canon to you.

And ultimately, "canon" is nothing more than a distinction made for convenience, meant to describe whatever elements or works certainly exist in the context of any given fictional universe. So you could go for one of many definitions, depending on what suits your purpose.

And therefore, I generally just don't bother much worrying about what is "canon" or "non-canon." I simply try to focus on the aspects of stories that I like, and not dwell on the aspects that I dislike. If word of god enhances your reading experience, good for you. If not, feel free to disregard it.
