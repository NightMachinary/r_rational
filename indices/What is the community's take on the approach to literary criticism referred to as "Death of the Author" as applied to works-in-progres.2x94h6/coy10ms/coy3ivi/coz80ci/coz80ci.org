Thanks for the kind words.

How authors can or should respond to their readers (and critics) is something that I've given a lot of thought, in part because I consider myself to be on both sides of that coin. I get the impulse to engage - I haven't put anything online in quite some time, but I still get a trickle of reviews in my inbox, and every single time I feel this nervous anticipation. Is it going to be good? Bad? And if it's bad, how bad is it going to be? There are a lot of ways that a review can be bad. I actually find name-calling to be one of the least bad; it's articulate negativity that gets me. One of the most impactful reviews I got ended with this: "I think the writing may simply be too precise, dry, bloodless to really let me be absorbed by the story." This wasn't a bad review - it was four stars - but that cut really deep, because as much as I didn't want to, it rang true to me.

And it's /so, so easy/ to blame the readers, to say "You didn't understand me." But I think that's partially an ego preservation tactic. Sure, sometimes people just don't have good reading comprehension, and miss things that are /explicitly/ stated to be true in the text. And sometimes they're not in the audience for your text, and have wandered into it with none of the background or enthusiasms that you're expecting, in which case I feel it's legitimate to simply say "Alright, this is not for you". But most of the time, I don't think that you should assume that it's the reader's fault, because I don't think that leads to improvement. So instead of thinking "You didn't understand me", I say to myself, "I didn't make myself understood", and I think that generally leads me down a better path. I can always decide later, after examining what the reader is saying, that it really /was/ their fault (because sometimes it is).

I might be biased, but I think that authorship is an expression of self in a pretty unique way. And when I hear that someone didn't like what I wrote, there's a part of me that translates that to them not liking /me/. And when people are enjoying something that I wrote, it's such a wonderful sense of validation, and I want to rush in and just have us talk endlessly about how great and clever +I am+ my work was. It's even worse when writing a serial, because when people see the hints of foreshadowing it's like I'm watching someone do a crossword and I know the answer to one of the clues. It's not going to make them happier to hear that I know the answer, and it's certainly not going to make them happier if I point out what they're missing. Or it's like sitting in a movie theater with a friend who's told you that this is his favorite movie, and every time something dramatic or funny happens he looks to you to see what your reaction is. I understand the impulse of it, that need to share in understanding and enjoyment, but I think it's ultimately destructive unless done in carefully considered ways (because of course I don't think that an author should have zero interaction with their readership).

Hopefully that's not too much. I'm not talking about Yudkowsky or anyone else, just about myself, and my own personal experiences instead of the more simple "this is what authors and readers should do" I gave above.
