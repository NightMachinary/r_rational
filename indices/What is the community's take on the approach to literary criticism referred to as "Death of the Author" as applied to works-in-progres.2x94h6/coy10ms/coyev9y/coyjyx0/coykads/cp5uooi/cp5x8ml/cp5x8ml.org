I can tell you in very general terms.

The girl in question is eighteen years old and out of her depth, and talking with someone who has an enormous amount of power over her. He's flirtatious, which she detests. He invites her up to his bedroom, and she doesn't really have a choice but to follow. Once there he drinks too much wine, tells her that he admires her and thinks she's beautiful, and then falls asleep. Nothing happens.

The /problem/ was that this was all told in a very compressed form, with only the barest sketching out of the scene - very little of the actual dialog between them. If you were reading it, there was a part where you could infer that something happened, and you could see the girl's distress and anger afterwards as building on that implication. The whole thing does have definite sex/power dynamics going on, by intent. It was a reasonable way to read things.

But it was never my intent to imply that she was raped - in part because I think that would be a little too heavy-handed for what's meant to be a fairly subtle character.
