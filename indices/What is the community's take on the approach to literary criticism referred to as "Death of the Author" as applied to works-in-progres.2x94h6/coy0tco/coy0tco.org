I consider the author's interpretation to be just a better-informed interpretation than the reader's. I generally trust the author's opinion, but if the text seems to clearly contradict it then I go with the text. Sometimes the author just forgot what they were thinking when they wrote a particular section. Sometimes they have a motive for convincing you away from a particular interpretation even if it's accurate.
