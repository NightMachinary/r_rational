Outside of the text itself, the writer is generally nothing more than a fan with a remarkably well thought out opinion. Nothing to be taken as gospel. When the lines blur between canon and non-canon, it's best to just take what you like and discard the rest. Heck, even with the canon stories themselves we have a tendency to remember the good and forget the bad, and I don't think that practice is wrong. Certainly we must still accept the canon text as canon, but that doesn't prevent us from forming whatever opinions we choose about the work.
