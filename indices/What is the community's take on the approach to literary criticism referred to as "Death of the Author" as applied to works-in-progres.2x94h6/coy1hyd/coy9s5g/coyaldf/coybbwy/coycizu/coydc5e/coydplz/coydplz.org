  Yes, I did talk about different continuities from official sources and said they are all canon.

They're all stories that exist. It doesn't mean any of them are necessarily related to each other at all, and when I'm talking about any particular canon I am definitely trying to establish which stories I can accept as having some bearing on the fictional universe I am reading about.

"Mistakes," if made canon themselves, put something else into discontinuity. Which is one of many reasons that the concept of canon has some measure of wiggle room.
