#+begin_quote
  When a person writes a new story in a series, perhaps a comic, they must make certain considerations. Did spinoff X take place in continuity? What about that really nonsensical issue that contradicted several of the other ones? How much weight do stories that were written 20 years ago have?
#+end_quote

Yes, I did talk about different continuities from official sources and said they are /all/ canon.

#+begin_quote
  A writer picks and chooses what they consider to be canon for any given story. Sometimes they make oversights, sometimes they make contradictions, sometimes they flat out ignore what happened before.
#+end_quote

Nah, it's all canon, different continuities. Oversights and contradictions are just mistakes. Ignoring can be a way of rewriting history, which is bad form.
