Whether or not death of the author applies may not bring anything to bear on the real problem you bring up.

Because the author is interacting with the community and actively responding to interpretations of his work, no community interpretation can be fully discounted as wrong or irrelevant, as it can potentially influence the unfolding of the narrative. If we the readers see errors or inconsistencies in the text as it exists, and the author tacitly agrees with them and accommodates them, or even makes changes specifically to deny them, our interpretations can become valid.

I will therefore say that the answer to your second question is yes.
