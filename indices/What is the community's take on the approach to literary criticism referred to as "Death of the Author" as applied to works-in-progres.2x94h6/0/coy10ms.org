I don't think it's the author's place to say what happened in their story. I see it as a failure state for a text if the author has to chime in and explain what it is that they really meant by what they said. The text should endeavor to be the whole of it, standing apart from anything that the author has to add, because if he wanted to add to it, well, then it should have been in the text itself.

So with that said, I've always hated "death of the author" when taken to its extremes. If I know that the author fought in the Vietnam War, /of course/ that's going to help me extract meaning from the text. "Death of the author" is one of many lenses to look at a work through, and it's not always the best. But I do think that it can be applied well to works-in-progress, to roughly the same extent that it can be applied to finished works. (However, if you're totally ignoring what the author said, then I think you'll have poor predictive power for what text is left to come.)

  Should the way we respond to a work of fiction be shaped by the fact that a large part of the public interaction with that work is occurring in a space where the author now frequents?

I've long shaped my online interactions by considering what would happen if the worst possible person read them. If I'm ever writing something about my wife, I think about what her reaction would be like if she read it. Would she be insulted? Would she feel like her privacy had been violated for the enjoyment of strangers? As a general policy, I think that this tends to result in more measured and thoughtful discussion, and it has the added bonus of making me seem like I'm a swell guy who doesn't tear down or insult people. But if you're going to pursue a sensible policy of online interaction like this, you need to be the sort of person who is willing to say what they think - you can't hold criticism back because you're worried about hurting someone's feelings, but you do need to make sure that you're not hurting someone's feelings for no reason.

*tl;dr* If the author wants you to think something, their job is to do it in the text. If you like your interpretation better than the author's, go with it. But as always, be kind.
