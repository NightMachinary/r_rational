The aspect of this approach that has always appealed to me is as you said "if he wanted to add to it, well, then it should have been in the text itself."

I appreciate your insight as an author of what I consider to be good online fiction and as a fellow reader - and critical commenter - of HPMoR.

When the author condescendingly responds to his readers' speculations based on the text as it is (rather than perhaps the text as he imagined it, or the text as it is yet to be) it makes it hard to be sympathetic to a reading suggested by the author's extra-textual voice.

/tl;dr/ Thank you for your response and your writing.
