  I don't think it's the author's place to say what happened in their story. I see it as a failure state for a text if the author has to chime in and explain what it is that they really meant by what they said.

Especially in a rationalfic, where a significant part of The Point is to provide the readers with enough information for "fair play" to be in effect.

On the other hand, leaving a Word of God comment isn't actually that harmful in circumstances where you /really did mean/ to give readers the information, but the Illusion of Transparency got the better of you.
