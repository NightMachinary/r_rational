When an author claims that a book "isn't really about that", I think it's possible for the author to be incorrect. Sometimes we write about ideas without seeing the entire shape of them.

However, oftentimes the author is correct. If the author says something about the book, that's certainly relevant information even if it's not absolutely definitive.
