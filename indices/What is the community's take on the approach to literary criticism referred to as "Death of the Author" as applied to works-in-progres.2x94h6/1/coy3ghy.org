I have no opinion about 'Death of the Author', but I /do/ think that it does the work an injustice to ignore its context - by 'context' I mean the conversations and interactions that surrounded its creation. This is not a book, it is a serial, and it is being released in a very interactive context.

There are a number of details sprinkled around that that would be weird and pointless descriptions without knowing about some specific bets and promises made in conversations about earlier chapters.
