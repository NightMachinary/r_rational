One point is that these additional contexts also make it difficult to fully appreciate a web serial like this after it is completed and archived; for instance, those who followed web discussions knew at an early point that a certain teacher was possessed, but the extra-textual hints that pointed to this and the discussions that revealed this fact were deleted and lost except in community memory.

To a late reader of the text, death of the author might then be the default reading methodology for lack of access to these contexts and even communities.
