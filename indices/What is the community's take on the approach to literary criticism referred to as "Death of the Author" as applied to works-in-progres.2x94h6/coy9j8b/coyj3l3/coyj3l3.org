I have definitely seen places - as recently as the "author's saving throw" - where that interaction was reflected in the text. Until he actually changes the text or releases new text my internal lawyer keeps throwing up "objection! Assumes facts not in evidence" and wondering what he is really adding to the discussion. After seeing all the insightful comments like yours on this thread I have mostly moved past that initial frustration.

I'm just really fascinated by the way emerging formats change the way we interact with literature. I have been reading HPMOR since around Chapter 30's release, but only really started reading and interacting with the online community of readers during this final arc.
