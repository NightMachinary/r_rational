Do you mean if the story were to end on the chapter that was just posted? Well, then the story would be incomplete and it wouldn't really make sense to judge it like that because of course these chapters only work as a the beginning of the ending arc, not an actual ending. But if you're just asking whether I've liked these last few chapters so far, I'd have to say I don't think they quite match the quality of the previous ones, but they're still very good. There's a bit too much exposition, necessary though that may be for the next chapters to make sense. I'm not sure what Quirrell's motivations are and I don't yet know whether his actions make sense. I think the logic in the last few chapters has not quite been up to par - I'm surprised EY didn't realize at first that Quirrell [[#s][HPMOR]] - and I'm not sure I'm convinced that [[#s][HPMOR]] Also, not everything in these last few chapters seemed solvable to me. We've had a lot of new plot concepts introduced that we didn't have much way of predicting earlier, such as [[#s][HPMOR]] Again, I think this is necessary to set up the final arc, and introducing these concepts too early could have had problems, but if you took these chapters on their own then you could consider it a flaw. Still, the plotting is entertaining and I am confident that there will be a good explanation for the sequence of events in the next couple of chapters. [[#s][HPMOR]] I prefer the more lighthearted and/or pure awesome antics of the earlier chapters, but this is highly entertaining too.
