I think EY's interaction with the readers is a source of motivation for him, but I think his primary motivation is just to introduce rationality and MIRI to more people, which may be one of the reasons why he chose to write a Harry Potter fic instead of a more obscure fandom. And why he's spending so much time writing this fic in the first place when he could be spending some of that time working on AI, not that unwinding in between work doesn't provide advantages as well. So I say choose to ignore or incorporate EY's interpretation as you want to. Even if you ignore it, plenty of other people will still be considering his interpretation, and even if everyone ignores it I'm fairly confident that future chapters will bring the general readers' interpretations closer to EY's, if only because the current interpretations become less likely the longer the story goes on.

Personally, I think people are just making a pattern recognition mistake because EY unintentionally primed them by using the exact word 'caricature' in the previous chapter.
