  The *Nemzeti dal* (/"National Song"/) is a poem written by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A1ndor_Pet%C5%91fi][Sándor Petőfi]] that is said to have inspired the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Revolution_of_1848][Hungarian Revolution of 1848]] [/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed][citation needed]]/]. Petőfi read the poem aloud on March 15 in Vörösmarty Square in Budapest to a gathering crowd, who by the end were chanting the refrain as they began to march around the city, seizing the presses, liberating political prisoners, and declaring the end of Austrian rule.

  Hungarians celebrate the anniversary of the revolution on March 15. Red-white-green ribbons are worn to commemorate the fallen revolutionaries and the ideal of the revolution. Hungary briefly achieved independence from 1848--1849, but were defeated by the combined forces of the Habsburgs and the Russian Empire. Despite its ultimate defeat, the revolution initiated a chain of events that led to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austro-Hungarian_Compromise_of_1867][autonomy of Hungary]] within the new [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria%E2%80%93Hungary][Austro-Hungarian Empire]] in 1867.

  The poem has come to rank third after the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himnusz][Himnusz]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sz%C3%B3zat][Szózat]] as a statement of Hungarian national identity.
