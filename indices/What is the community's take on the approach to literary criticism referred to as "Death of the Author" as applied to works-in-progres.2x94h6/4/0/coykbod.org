I haven't had the opportunity to read any of your work, but I appreciate you sharing an author's perspective. This was really my objection to EY's author thread: It seemed like he was getting upset because he failed to predict reader responses and instead of doing something productive about it, he decided to rant. I sort of understand how after spending months of his life creating and editing these chapters he might be upset when the readers throw him a curveball. Reading a rant didn't really add to /my/ appreciation or understanding of the book, though.
