Wow, this ended up being long. Sorry. Wall of text warning.

I'll start off by saying that I'm a serial writer. Amateur and hoping to start self-publishing soon.

I am not entirely certain if I grasp the full meaning of the concept of "Death of the Author" as written by Barthes, but the surface meaning seems clear enough. While I reserve the right to change my mind later if someone comes up with a good argument, I don't believe "Death of an Author" applies to any book of fiction.

The author has a different frame of reference than the reader. This means that in most cases, especially in fiction, what the author sees in a scene is slightly, or even vastly different from what the reader sees. If you understand the author, you will probably better understand their work. Especially in prose fiction.

I will say that the best writers of prose typically are able to carry the reader with them without vast subjective differences in perspective. That's one common trait of good writers - they immerse the reader, and the reader stays immersed without stumbling over unexpected reactions. Serialized fiction allows authors the opportunity to see when they break immersion for their readers, and address it.

Serial fiction is not new. Charles Dickens, Mark Twain, and Leo Tolstoy were serial writers. While the speed of the response is certainly much greater these days, you can be certain that Twain, Dickens, and Tolstoy were questioned about their serial works by both their fans and their detractors. I don't know if these three chose to engage their readers often while their serials were not fully published, of if their editing team would allow changes, but I cannot imagine that even back before the internet, serial authors could not help but hear both praise and criticism. I would be shocked if some of that criticism didn't shape modifications in the books as they were prepared for full-length printings.

In the end, if the author chooses to engage the readers, then it's fairly certain that the story will be colored by the readers to some extent. If one approaches "Death of an Author" from that point of view, then the author's perspective is not the only perspective being considered during the writing. An understanding of the author isn't going to give as pure an insight in a serialized work where the author interacts with many other people, especially if the prose is modified based on the author's interactions. That having been said, knowing the author will still give some insight, because you don't write a work worthy of in-depth critique by committee. Authors might have been nudged here and there by others, but the final product is their own work, salted to taste with the influences of readers.
