So far as I'm concerned, the pay-off for wandering in D&D land has to be meeting Bellatrix and seeing all the exploits of a skilled and intelligent wizard from the Harry Potter world. I know people have been somewhat down on these sections, but I'm really looking forward to when they meet Bellatrix.

Also, using backstory as an exploit is exactly the sort of thing that I do all the time as a player - you just need a forgiving dungeon master.
