This is actually surprisingly hard, because a lot of the powers that you would want to give people that would, in theory, benefit everyone, will naturally tend to concentrate power in the hands of the petty assholes. An ability like allowing them to open up a portal to a world that's basically like Earth but with no people in it would give us vast amounts of resources ... but you'd be making a lot of petty assholes very rich, which would result in them gaining power, which would result in them /using/ that power, which might make it a wash. (Note: I know that's (probably) not a street level power.)

I would have to dig to find if it was /actually/ a topic of one of those threads, but if petty assholes are the problem, then an empathic superpower would probably be a good one, because it would encourage the petty assholes not to be assholes, and help them see things from the point of view of others. Telepathy or mind reading would be worse options, because of the potential for abuse and/or negative feedback that would reinforce behavior.

The second big option is a power with a lot of positive externalities, such as being fueled by global pollution, waste plastic, nuclear waste, or something like that. Again, not sure that it's ever come up in one of these threads, but there are probably other positive externalities that plausibly were. They would still be petty assholes, but their incentives would be such that they would end up helping the world anyway.

Finally, I think there's an argument to be made for helpful service powers, like healing. Yes, the petty assholes would charge for it, but if they were able to cure currently incurable diseases, or if they were bad at coordination, or if their prices ended up being a lot lower than existing medical technology. In part, whether this ends up good or not depends on how many petty assholes we're talking about, and I would posit that the more, the better, since that means they each have less individual power. Generating materials and/or food is also usually street level, and could work similarly to help alleviate poverty.

Oh, and you could also pick something like "transported to another world", but that's likely outside the bounds of street level. It would get rid of all the petty assholes, /and/ I would get to go to a fantasy world. Win-win.
