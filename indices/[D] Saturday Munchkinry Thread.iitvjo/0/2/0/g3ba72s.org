It would still generate huge amounts of waste heat. Unless the energy transfer completely breaks thermodynamics... well Superman does that anyway so that explanation isn't any worse as a unifying explanation than the tactile telekinesis explanation.

One unifying explanation for the frost breath had Superman's tactile telekinesis extending within his lungs to the atomic level such that he could remove all the kinetic energy from the air in his lungs while simultaneously compressing the air then when he released it, the high pressure near absolute zero air would rapidly decompress further cooling the environment around it.

But the scale of effect described in the original post is beyond the tactile telekinesis explanation, I don't think the air could be compressed enough without even more exotic physics effects beyond molecular level tactile telekinesis.
