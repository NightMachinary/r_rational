So some quick googling gives a hurricane's energy as 6.0 x 10^14 Watts or 5.2 x 10^19 Joules/day. You didn't give a time interval for the 10^21 joules number, but I assume that is within a single usage of heat vision/ice breath. So Superman easily has the power output to match a hurricane. Does the ice breath cheat thermodynamics a bit by generating cold without just transferring around heat, or otherwise transferring heat so thoroughly it doesn't matter (to another dimension, across a several light year volume, or something along those lines)? If so, I think he has this. Flying at relativistic speeds against the hurricane might be dumping more energy into the system overall, even if it disrupts the hurricane but he has his ice breath to get rid of excess energy. I think the procedure would be something like, cool the ocean water just right, enough to slow the growth of the hurricane but not enough to cause ecological harm then fly against the hurricane at relativistic speeds, ice breathing the air that gets super-heated by his passing to counteract the waste heat. This can handle Scenario 1 hurricane okay.

For scenario 2... I think you need to calculate what hypersonic booms look like in terms of damage and what the microclimate of ice breath usage in the middle of a hurricane looks like, which is a lot messier.
