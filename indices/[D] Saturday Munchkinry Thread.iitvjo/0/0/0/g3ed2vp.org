Thanks for the answer. I was going to make it as hard science as possible by saying that the ice cold breath would release heat as a by product and thus cause an explosion if used too quickly, but I suppose then. there'd be no point for it then.

I suppose then the best answer would be cooling the hurricane and/or punching the clouds that make up the storm. The 2nd scenario would probably result in some people dead though if he tried punching the clouds away.
