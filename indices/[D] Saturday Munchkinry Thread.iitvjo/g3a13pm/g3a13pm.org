You can temporarily change the laws of chemistry in a relatively small area, specifically increasing or decreasing the chemical potential energy of any configuration of atoms. You can't break the laws of thermodynamics, but you can "store" around a hundred thousand calories by making reactions that lose energy relative the normal rules, and draw from that to make reactions that would otherwise create energy. You can make effects conditional, but the condition-evaluation has limited computational power and can only condition on low level physical configurations, like "Is within N nanometers of [specific transcription factor] attached to [specific DNA sniper a few tens of bases long]".

You can control this either in real time directly with your brain, or hook it up to a computer controlling it faster and with more precision using an API, but you need to actually acquire the computer and write the code. With a lot of work, you might be able to mass produce machines that have this capability. Regardless of where and how it's used, it consumes a significant amount of energy, be prepared to need to eat more or have beefy power supply and cooling on the computer.

It is generally known this kind of thing is possible, and there are probably about a thousand other people that also gained these powers; it's statistically unlikely any of them is as good at creating a startup or documenting and filing a patent as the average reader of this subreddit.
