Hmm. This grants you and anyone else in the area of effect immunity to a wide range of poisons, since a lot of them work via chemical reactions that you can just shut down completely. Given the rarity of such poisonings, it probably wouldn't cost too much power to set up lots of computers that generate such poison-immunity fields everywhere.

Taking things a step further, you could even shut down various drugs. No new addicts can be created when the drugs do literally nothing after you stop them from reacting with anything. The "war on drugs" would be won with relative ease. (Except for those drugs that are used for medical purposes.) (Maybe don't put the field over hospitals?)
