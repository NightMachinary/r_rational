You are Superman. You can exert a maximum of 10^{21} joules of energy. Your heat vision is as hot as the surface of the Sun (5778 K) and can be applied in an area evenly of a square kilometer. Your ice breath can freeze a square kilometer of ocean water ten meters deep. This ice breath can also blow at hurricane speeds of 150 mph. His speed: Anything up to 99% the speed of light.

Task: Stop a Category 5 hurricane. Similarly stop a F5 tornado.

It's often been told in fiction that Superman can stop hurricanes and/or tornado. But how exactly would he accomplish this without causing harm to humans or sea life? Would he just cool the ocean water? If so wouldn't there be a huge release of heat that would come out as a giant explosion? It wasn't until I saw the size of Hurricane Laura and hurricanes in general that I realized Superman's efforts could easily result in thousands dying.

Is there a way he could do this without causing harm to humans or, at the very least, causing minimal harm? Could be just fly in the opposite direction?

Scenario 1: The cat5 hurricane is in the middle of the ocean. Similarly the F5 tornado is in the plains miles outside of the nearest town.

Scenario 2: The hurricane is right next to the Gulf of Mexico and or near Florida (within twenty kilometers). The tornado is approaching over a town.

Thanks for taking the time to answer.
