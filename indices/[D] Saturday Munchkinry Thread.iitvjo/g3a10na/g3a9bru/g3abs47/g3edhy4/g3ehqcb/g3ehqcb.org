Googling rotation kinetic energy of Earth, I can see the number is 2.138*10^{29} joules. Even in the absolute worse case, in which every joule of the hurricanes energy was moving with Earth rotation and every joule of the hurricanes' energy Superman stops pushed against the Earth the energy output of a hurricane over an entire day is only in the order 10^{19} joules (as I mention in another post). This means 10^{10} (10 billion) times more energy in the Earth rotation than in a hurricanes' daily energy. If Superman stopped 100 hurricanes in the absolute worse way for the Earth rotational energy, this would still only be 1 millionth (.0001% of the Earth rotational energy).

Except that is the worse case. In a more reasonable case, hurricanes move in different directions around the globe (so overall it might cancel out) and a lot of their energy is in temperature difference so only a small percent of the energy being stopped would actually affect the Earth's rotation.

So tldr; the energy is negligible compared to the momentum of the Earth.
