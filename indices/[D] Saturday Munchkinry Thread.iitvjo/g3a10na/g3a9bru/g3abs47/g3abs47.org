Depends on the specifics of how his super speed works. Because some laws of physics must be bent in order for super speed to not do things like create nuclear fusion reactions with the air or destroying the planet with massive kinetic energy input.

"Canonically", for some definition of canon in the giant mess of comics with continuity issues everywhere, relativity seems to apply, since superman can move so fast that he can travel back in time. This would be the simplest, safest solution for stopping a hurricane since he can go the time before the hurricane starts, then ice breath/heat ray things until the conditions for hurricane formation are destroyed.

With a 99% light speed cap, that option presumably goes out the window. So the next option to try is super strength. Superman somehow, always applies exactly the right amount of strength. He never accidentally pulps a robber when he beats them. He never hurts Lois when he catches her in midair or flies around with her.

That implies that he has (1) incredibly precise control over the amount of force he exerts, (2) amazing calculation and observation abilities to let him compute exactly how much force he should apply, (3) incredibly quick mental thinking since he can react to changes and recalculate in no time.

Putting these together, he could use his super speed and strength to apply precisely enough force to stop every air molecule dead, effectively stopping the hurricane.
