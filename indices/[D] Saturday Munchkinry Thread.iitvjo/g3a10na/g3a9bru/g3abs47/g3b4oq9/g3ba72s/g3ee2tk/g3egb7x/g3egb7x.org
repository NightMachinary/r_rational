With the light bulb exploding, isn't that from the glass rapidly cooling and thus contracting causing it to explode? With the frost breath, I'm not actually sure how the thermodynamics would work out. PV=NRT would make me think that if the frost breath started at high pressure and low temperature then it expanding out would keep it at low temperature as it mixed with the regular air, but the conditions are extreme enough I don't know if PV=NRT would accurately describe them over the short term. Averaged out and given enough time, it means the frost breath would mix with and cool the surrounding air, but in the short term it might cause explosions as you said or maybe more like implosions as the frost breath mixed with the regular air and rapidly cools it.
