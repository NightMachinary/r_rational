In 5 minutes, you'll be permanently transplanted into a parallel universe almost identical to this one... except for the fact that in that reality, yourself, and everyone in your extended family, never existed (e.g. your grandparents never met).

You're still in the same city. It's probably not very different from the city you know, since your family probably wasn't super influential. If you had friends, they probably still exist although their life and personality might have taken a different course since they never knew you. Your house would probably be occupied by some other family, your neighbors may or may not be the same.

Basically, you've been completely erased from this timeline with everything that entails. You won't exist in any ID database - you're effectively a non-person.

You appear safely in approximately the same geographical location you are currently. You bring nothing with you except your current clothes.

How would you attempt to survive and bootstrap your life from scratch again?
