Munchkinry to counter negative incentives!

You can get any "street-level" (try to be reasonable with this constraint) power previously described on a Saturday Munchkinry thread or Wednesday World building thread but in return other people in the world will randomly also get this power. The random selection of people that get this power will be biased/weighted towards "petty assholes". The people that get this power will be more powerful/skillful (shorter cooldowns, longer usage periods, more precise usage) by a small but consistent amount if they are "petty assholes". The powers will be partially genetically inheritable (say a 1/3 chance for each offspring that they inherit the powers if one or both of their parents have powers), but will increase in inheritably (up to 3/4) chance if people intentionally practice dehumanizing eugenics (let's say minimum level of dehumanizing is marrying people according to an algorithm with no allowance for love/romance or stopping marriages for love). The powers will be slightly more industrially utilizable if the industry utilizing them has large negative externalities (pollution, cultural erasure, dehumanization, etc.).

By petty assholes this includes a combination of:

- tendency to be rude (even when it is not beneficial or useful)
- tendency to be selfish
- low empathy towards others
- believing themselves to be innately superior/better/smarter than others
- tendency to vote in ways that are more harmful in a utilitarian sense
- tendency to incentive other people into being petty assholes
- tendency to maximize and hoard their own wealth, especially when unproductive towards society as a whole

Note that by tendency, this refers to it being part of their basic personality, and not something they are doing just to get more power (although if they work at it long enough they can change their personality enough to fit).

So what power would you chose that would still make the world a better place?

Or what power would you chose anyway?

Or are you going to dig out some obscure thread in which someone described powers tied to morality in a positive way to counter the whole point of this thought exercise.
