Hmm I never considered that. You make very valid points and I'm inclined to accept your conclusion.

Makes me wonder how far such a timeline could diverge from our current reality. Certainly most of the nation states should still remain intact, and there's probably not enough time for any significant language drift. I'd assume many of the big banks still exist in similar form as they have for centuries but the tech scene would probably be wildly different in that case.

Or I dunno, maybe we belong to the 1% of realities that survived the cold war and most others end in nuclear holocaust. It's hard to know just how many safeguards there were and how close we came to tripping them all.
