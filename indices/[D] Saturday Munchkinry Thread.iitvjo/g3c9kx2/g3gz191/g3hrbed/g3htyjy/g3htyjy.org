Thanks! Got it, I see what you meant in your post now. OK, so we don't have to worry about walking around with a totally unknown phenotype, that's good.

I assume the only prep that will survive the shift is info you keep in your head, right? So you can't i.e. leave a lockbox buried in the woods with a bunch of cash and the best fake IDs you can find with a week's notice? If stuff like this counts, then there's a lot you can do to help out future-you.

Assuming the only things that stick around are your memories and the clothes on your back, then say goodbye to your loved ones and buy the best multipurpose set of clothes you can find. If you can i.e. make a shirt out of $100 bills, do that; then wear a big warm jacket that can double as a sleeping bag/blanket, plus the pocketiest cargo pants you can find (preferably the kind that zip off into shorts if it's going to be warm when you shift).

After that it's pretty much going to be the same deal. Transporting money with you will let you skip some of the drudge work/sleeping rough, but you'll still need to snag a functional ID to get any kind of real career going. This would be much easier if it happened pre-internet.
