You'd think so, but a lot of the society that we live in today dates back far further than three generations - collectively i'd think that it has a /lot/ of inertia. Very rarely do things hinge upon the actions of a single person.

Yeah, your lottery tickets are useless and stock prices are probably inaccurate. Your town might have a population difference of an additional hundred or so. That MacDonalds is now a Burger King.

But major world events? If Princip didn't assassinate Archduke Franz Ferdinand, someone else would have. Or maybe nobody did, but some other catalyst ignites WW1 anyway. If the plane that hit the WTC was delayed, the attack might still have been carried out the next day... or the next week. Small ripples dissipating in a very big pond.

Of course this is completely speculative, and we have no way of knowing all the roads not taken.
