I understand your point, but I disagree with your conclusion. A great lots of events have a lot of causal fragility: change them by a second or by a millimetre, and completely rewrite the timeline:

- influencing the conception of someone, even by a split second will result in a different sperm winning and thus different person be born. So, every child of people who interacted with the parents and grandparents is now not born or 50% chance of being the opposite sex. Same goes for kids of those kids, and everyone they interacted with in an exponential manner.

- deadly accidents, car crashes, plane crashes, etc are prevented AND caused differently, killing or saving millions across the globe, just from a single tiny interaction

- completely different set of people win the lottery

- different teams win matches, thus moving millions of $ in different directions

Take your WW1 example: if a different person kills Franz Ferdinand, then the whole timeline and causality is shifted by a fraction, and completely different set of people survive the chaotic trench warfare of WW1. This means that completely different set of people fight in WW2, if it happens at all. Hitler very likely dies, or has a different war experience. Every major European, Chinese, Japanese or American celeb or politician from now one is different, not born, or has changed personality.
