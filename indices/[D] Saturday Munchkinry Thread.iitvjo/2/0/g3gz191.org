Well, first things first, let's get some money. Walk around looking for Help Wanted signs in diners/restaurants/cafes/shops, explain to the managers that you were recently robbed of everything including ID and need enough cash to feed yourself while you sort out your affairs.

Unfortunately your best bet is to sleep in a homeless shelter or just rough it for the first few weeks while you save up enough to rent a shitty apartment. If you're in an expensive area, work til you have bus fare and head somewhere cheap.

It's not a very sexy answer, but honestly you'd just have to work at whatever under-the-table jobs you can find until you have enough money for good fake documentation. Once you have enough cash to buy a laptop you can start doing some research on how to buy a dead person's identity, which is probably the only way for you to get established in i.e. social security databases (which is required if you ever want any sort of high-paying job).

Theoretically I guess you /could/ show up at the DMV or wherever and say "I was raised in a cult and never got a birth certificate or SSN." If Tara Westover did it, you can too, though it'll be tougher for you since you won't be able to furnish any verifiable information about where you were raised.

EDIT: I forgot to ask, how far back does the family-erasure go? Because all living humans are the descendants of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_Eve][Mitochondrial Eve]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y-chromosomal_Adam][Y-chromosomal Adam]], if it extends back to them, then all humans in your new universe might look very different from you. That poses a whole new set of issues.
