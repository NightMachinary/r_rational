How would one Munchkin the ability to Read Their Own Mind?

rules:

- self-reading is a separate thing from just introspection

- self reading allows thoughts and memories to be read as text, images, videos etc, not raw thoughts.

- conscious thinking and self-reading that thinking can coexist simultaneously, with no issues.
