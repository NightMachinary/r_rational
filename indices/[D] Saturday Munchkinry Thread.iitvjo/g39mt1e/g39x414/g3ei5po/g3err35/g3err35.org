  I would be worried about a power disproportionately belonging to petty assholes being used heavily by law enforcement.
#+end_quote

Why? What could a petty asshole law enforcer do with this power that he couldn't without? I suppose it makes it easier for corrupted cops to blackmail culprits or suspects to pay up or be arrested, but they can and probably do already do that anyway.

Also the power by itself hopefully wouldn't be enough for a conviction, because it would just be another witness testimony, and witnesses can be mistaken (or lie).

  As for reducing crime... Serial killers and premeditated murders might be able to figure out how to work around it, and a lot of other crime isn't driven by a careful weighing of risks and punishments.
#+end_quote

Still makes it harder to commit murder, makes it less fun for the serial killers, makes it harder for the impulsive murders to cover it up after the fact, etc. (It even lets spiteful victims kill themselves to reveal the criminals with their corpse.)
