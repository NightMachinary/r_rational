I guess this one: [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a8lgsu/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ecbry7v/]]

I would classify this as street-level since it isn't going to let you take over a country or anything. It doesn't even help you much in combat. All it does is give you a lot more time to think about things, and make investigating murders easy.

I suppose it also gives incentives making corpses, but anyone with a brain would realize animal corpses are far better in every way.

Overall, even if the power mostly goes to petty assholes, I expect crime levels to drop just because its now so much easier to solve murders.

(And personally, I would be abusing the heck out of the time freezing part. I have a lot of thinking that needs to be done and pathetically tiny amounts of time to do it.)
