In the story universe, the cape names are supposed to be representative of the characters' personalities. Characters who want to be edgy choose edgy names. From outside the story universe, it was written in 2010, and social sensibilities have changed a lot since then. Another example of the dated writing was one description of a female teacher with mannish-looking features, later edited out for being transphobic.

The tone of "one step forward, two steps back" doesn't change. It's not a happy story, because it wants to be a "realistic" one. And if it brings you down to read about traumatized people suffering and making unoptimal decisions, this probably isn't the story for you. It also doesn't help that the relentless pacing keeps injecting new conflicts with every arc, as soon as the last conflict was resolved, because it's serialized fiction and the nature of the format requires every episode to have some sort of action or plot progression.

I found it pretty depressing in the end, and delved into the fanfic scene to cleanse my palate. Honestly, if you're still in and finding it hard to go on at the halfway point (arc 20-ish) it's worth pushing yourself to the end just for the fanfic.
