I'm currently reading [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Worm]]. I have read quite my share but I think it's the first time I encounter a bad guy from a story that genuinely terrifies me. Jack Slash at the end of arc 14 gave me nightmares, the sort where you are running from a nondescript threat with abject fear.

Then there is this tirade of him:

"According to studies, clinically depressed individuals have a more accurate grasp of reality than the average person. We tell ourselves lies and layer falsehoods and self-assurances over one another in order to cope with a world colored by pain and suffering. We put blinders on. If we lose that illusion, we crumble into depression or we crack and go mad. So perhaps I'm crazy, but only because I see things too clearly?"

It had haunted me long enough that I asked a friend about it who provided [[http://i.imgur.com/KTvPLZB.jpg][this]] and [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3356869/][that]] and I got over it but damn. To have have a character go as far as forgo his humanity, completely instrumentalize it like him... Maybe I'm over-sensitive or too uncultured but I feel like it's some genius-level of writing.
