The Vlad Taltos books are great. Strongly recommend publication order rather than chronological, especially for a first read-through.

The books have a bunch of variance and the author experiments more between them than a lot of genre fiction does. So if you don't particularly like one book in the series, that is actually perfectly fine and not surprising at all. For me, Teckla was a very painful novels for a few plot/theme-spoilery reasons; if you react similarly, know that the series doesn't particularly stick with Teckla's themes.
