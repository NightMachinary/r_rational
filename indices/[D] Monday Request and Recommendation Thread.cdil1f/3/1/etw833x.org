The three books that fit that for me are:

- The Handmaid's Tale - now a Hulu series, but the book is absolutely excellent. If you've been living under a rock, dystopian near future fiction. (I remember one night I started reading it before bed at about 1am, and read through to dawn because I just couldn't put it down).

- The Martian - everyone's heard of this now but if you haven't read it, it's a must-read for anyone here. If you've been living under a rock, someone is stranded alone on Mars and has to survive for a very long time with very limited resources.

- Crystal Society as someone else mentioned
