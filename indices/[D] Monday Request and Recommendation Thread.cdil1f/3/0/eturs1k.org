The last book that honestly did that to me is Worm, but obvious answer is obvious.

​

Enjoyed, but with reservations, mostly notably that it's hard to call it "rational": Tim Zahn's Quadrail series. I picked it up because I liked his Thrawn books. It's what happened when Tim Zahn said to a friend, "Hey, what if I wrote an old-fashioned railway mystery, but in space?" Then Tim's friend said, "But Tim, that would be stupid. You can't have trains in space." And Tim said, "Why not?" Instead of getting around space via spaceships, they use trains. Space trains. The books play it completely straight. Zahn had fun making up a mix of weird alien cultures, notably the giant warrior chipmunks, and if you can ignore the part where the fundamental conceit is stupid he did a good job keeping the rules consistent and having the characters work around them. There's a lot of fun window dressing, a strong sense of place.

​

Other drawbacks: the "mystery" in book three is no mystery at all, and the very end of the book five is pretty weak IMO. I still liked them well enough to go back and read again.
