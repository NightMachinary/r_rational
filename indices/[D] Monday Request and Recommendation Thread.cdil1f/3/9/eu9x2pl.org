Malazan Book of the Fallen by Steven Erikson , the first book series that really hooked me on fantasy. I have only read the main series which is 10 books long, more than 3 million words. There's another series, Novels of the Malazan Empire, written by a different author, Ian C Esslemont, set in the same world around then same time frame though focusing on different characters, which I haven't read so don't know if they're good or not personally though I've seen people saying that it starts off weak but by the end the novels are muchbetter. They are also releasing prequels and sequels to these two series.
