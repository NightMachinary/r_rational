I have two counterpoints:

1. Every Xianxia novel protagonist ends up immortal, so it's not a spoiler if you know the genre.

2. You can be on a journey to somewhere and not reach it. It's a goal, and if this weren't Xianxia I'd have given it even odds that the protagonist pulls a Gilgamesh and doesn't actually succeed. (But it's Xianxia, so I'm sure they do.)
