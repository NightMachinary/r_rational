Terra Ignota is one of my favourite ongoing series. I /still/ strongly recommend you try Tor's free chapters from the start of the first novel before buying any of it: [[https://www.tor.com/2016/04/12/excerpts-ada-palmer-too-like-the-lightning-chapters-1-and-2/][1-2]], [[https://www.tor.com/2016/04/13/excerpts-ada-palmer-too-like-the-lightning-chapter-3/][3]], [[https://www.tor.com/2016/04/14/excerpts-ada-palmer-too-like-the-lightning-chapter-4/][4]], because the story's told in a highly unusual style. Some people (e.g. me) love the style, others find it basically unreadable.
