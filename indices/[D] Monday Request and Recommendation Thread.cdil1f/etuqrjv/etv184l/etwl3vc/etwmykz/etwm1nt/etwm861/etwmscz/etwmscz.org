75% of fanfics replay the first 10 arcs with a different superpower, and don't use much, if anything, of the latter arcs. But it's generally recommended to finish the original novel because the whole premise of the setting hinges on a mystery that isn't explained until the end, but is treated like expected knowledge in just about every fanfic.

[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PpXPrYhQUPC-ULuz4mqbe3HM0JunwWWPK9t9czWrTZ4/edit][Here's a compilation of popular "good" fics.]] The reviews seem pretty fair and the "must read" category is in line with what I'd recommend to first time readers, so I'd say to start there if you want to get into the fanfic scene.
