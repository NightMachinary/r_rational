Oh man I really wanted to read it, but I give up every time I start.

It's just so relentlessly negative, the first few chapters are nothing but pointless misery. Also it's not that well written(in my opinion), and I can't get over some character names. Bitch and Clockblocker, seriously?

Does it get better? Is it worth sticking with? Or is it just not my thing?

I really love the idea of rationalist superheroes though...
