I've read a lot of My Little Pony fanfiction, and I'm going to recommend what are the best of the best short stores( <20k words). I'll list the word count too so consider reading the shortest first and seeing if you like my judgement. If you're not familiar with MLP, the only information you really need is that the three main species are unicorns that can do magic, pegasi, and regular ponies. The princesses are also semi-divine ponies that have wings and horns (alicorns) and have super-magic that control the sun and moon.
