[[https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/rmji][Record of a Mortal's Journey to Immortality]] is a Xianxia novel. It avoids the majority of the problems that I have seen in other Xianxia novels. Ex. I think it avoids 1-3 and 7 from [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/b6py6a/the_irrationality_of_xianxia_settings_even_when/][this thread]]. It partially subverts 4 and has way less of 6 than I see in other Xianxia. It is still Xianxia so enter at your own risk.

The Good:

The MC is careful about taking risks and tries to start fights only with overdetermined outcomes despite how weird Xianxia combat is.

The MC has one ability to start with that would plausibly give a huge advantage and manages it carefully to give himself other advantages.

The progression seems more meaningful than in other Xianxia stories. There is a big difference in how the MC behaves at each stage of cultivation and the problems he is facing.

The MC's world changes and involves many characters besides the MC with different objectives who rationally pursue their objectives.

The same techniques return multiple times. Things acquired earlier in the story are never dropped or forgotten later on.

The Bad:

Strange coincidences happen, but not as much as they do in some other Xianxia. I think the way [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/b6py6a/the_irrationality_of_xianxia_settings_even_when/ejmg1uv?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x][this comment]] puts it is a good way to look at it. The anthropic principle is in play and we are reading about the character that was successful.

This story is really really long, and I don't think the story will ever end. The Chinese version is way longer than the currently translated part which is already 1042 chapters. It will take huge amounts of your time to read.

Translated from Chinese with all the problems that come with a translated novel.

Weird sex based cultivation methods play a small part in the story, but a small amount is enough to annoy me. The romance is also one dimensional, though I'm not sure if it counts as romance anymore since the character is basically a thousand year old shut in at this point...

The MC is making rational use of an irrational magic system. The fire mcguffin aureate jujube has the heaven defying power to increase one's fire origin qi many times! The mysterious blah element qi sword passed down from martial ancestor has injured the lion hawk with its swordlight!
