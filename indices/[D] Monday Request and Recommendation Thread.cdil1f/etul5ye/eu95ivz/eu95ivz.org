As a teenager (decades ago, alas) I found book #8 of the urban fantasy 'Anita Blake' series, titled Blue Moon, by Laurell K Hamilton. After reading it, I overnighted and read books #1 - #7, devouring all of them in about a day and a half, and was excited enough to try and call a friend about them, only to realize, whoops, it's 2am, sorry Mr my-friend's-dad. I can recommend the series up through book #9.

I should however note that you MUST, for your sanity, stop reading after book #9. The fact that books exist that claim to continue the series is a vicious, filthy lie to try to trick you into paying Hamilton for the privilege of reading torturous drivel overwhelmingly interspersed with porn. Somewhere along the way, Hamilton got divorced (I think it was around book 5?) and her first husband was her plotline editor. And after she hooked up with whoever (in whatever quantity) came next, she apparently decided that the plot was pointless compared to the main character sleeping with literally every other character in the series. Hamilton wrapped up the longest running plot of the series, somewhere in book 11 or 12, out of nowhere, in three paragraphs, very much 'just because', and then went back to having the MC sleep around. So.....just stop at book #9, Obsidian Butterfly, where there was still plot.
