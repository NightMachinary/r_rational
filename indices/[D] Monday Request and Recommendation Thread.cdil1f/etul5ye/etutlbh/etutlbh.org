[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][/Time Braid/]] is the story that, many* years ago, convinced me that fanfiction can be as fun as, or even /more fun than/, traditionally-published fiction (rather than comprising nothing but a mixture of romantic fluff, power fantasy, and bad English in varying proportions). When I first discovered it (coincidentally, just a few days or weeks before its completion, IIRC), I read it voraciously on my dumbphone during high-school bus trips and lunch periods. Since then, I've read it five more times. If you aren't well-acquainted with /Naruto/, however, you may not be too interested in it.

*Okay, I guess eight years isn't /that/ long a period. How time flies!
