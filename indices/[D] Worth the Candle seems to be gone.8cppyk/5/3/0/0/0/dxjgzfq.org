It seems like one of the key issues for you is the fact that Joon is not explicitly reacting to the DM's suggestion. I think you would have to read that scene in a vacuum without the context of the story to come to your conclusion and based on your responses that does seem like what you're doing.

Has Joon been characterised in any way as the sort of character who would consider â€˜mind-raping' ethical or moral? Joon has repeatedly shown to care about whether his companions have free will via the loyalty mechanic, has worried about their continued existence when he is absent and has worried that their mental make up was inorganically designed by the DM. He has shown himself unwilling to glance at amaryllis' naked form through the soul link and has been unwilling to peer at his companions personality through the soul link unless it is of the utmost necessity. He also has numerous explicit negative reactions to the way Fallatehr uses soul magic to mind rape his companions. If you take all of this context yet come to the conclusion that a non reaction is evidence enough to heavily discount all of the above, well, we weigh evidence differently then. I think it's important if you have a particularly strong negative reaction to a story that doesn't seem to have been experienced by other readers (some readers had issues with the ROB scene but they appear to be more regarding the overarching plot or a lack of munchkining) to consider the possibility that you are reading something into the story that wasn't intended.
