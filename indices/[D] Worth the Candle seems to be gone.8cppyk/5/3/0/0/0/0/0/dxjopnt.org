Am I right in saying that a) you agree Joon is not okay with or the sort of person to endorse mind rape, b) AW was not trying to put forward the message that mind rape is okay, c) you felt the scene unintentionally puts that idea forward, due to a writing mistake, and yet, d) this is going to effect your perception of the entirety of the rest of the story?

Even though I don't agree with c) I can understand your point. d) is hard for me to wrap my head around. Is the timeline in your head for the story that Joon is a reasonably moral and ethical character that had an in universe moment whereby he was for the space of a conversation okay with mind rape before going back to being a character with reasonable morals and ethics? Reading stories whereby you understand the authors intention but think they failed to translate it well and then forever after read the story with that mistranslation warping your perception of the story just seems...like a good way to not enjoy reading honestly.
