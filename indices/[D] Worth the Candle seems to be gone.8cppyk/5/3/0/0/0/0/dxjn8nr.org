I'm not trying to say it was intended.

I've read a lot of fiction and fan fiction, and one mistake that I see often is that people write dialogue as if they're just transcribing what each person says, and leave out the important part, which is how a character reacts to what is being said. I don't care that Alice is telling Bob that Carol is having an affair with Dave, I want to see how Bob /reacts/ to that information.

Now, normally, in WtC, the author has been decent about writing that kind of thing, but in this particular case, there was something that /absolutely needed/ to be reacted to. And the lack of a reaction to an idea that noxious, when the character /has/ reacted to lesser offences (compare, in the next chapter, how he reacts to the existence of embryo-souls), conveys its own message by its absence.

Again, I'm not saying that message is there intentionally. It's probably that same mistake I see over and over again, in presuming that /what is said/ is more important than the /reaction/ to what is said. When I read that paragraph, I fully expected Joon, based on the character that he was shown to be, to jump down the DM's throat for even suggesting such a thing, for even suggesting that Joon would /do/ such a thing. And then, when it cost him a wish, I again expected /some/ sort of protest.

Trust me, if it had seemed /in/-character for Joon to be okay with that sort of thing, I would have stopped reading a long time sooner. The lack of reaction sent a message that I was so thoroughly not okay with, and caused me to re-evaluate the character.

Even unintended, the message is there, conveyed by the absence of a reaction to a truly foul suggestion. And, even unintended, that message is going to colour how I think about the rest of the story.
