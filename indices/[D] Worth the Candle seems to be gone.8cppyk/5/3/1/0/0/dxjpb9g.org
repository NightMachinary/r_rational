  “Whatever you want, do it,” said Fenn. She stared at me, glancing briefly down at my lips. “My soul is yours.”

  “No,” I said. “That's creepy, your soul is your own.”

There are other instances where Joon expresses horror at the idea of mind-raping people. But judging people by a lack of reaction doesn't tell us that he's a horrible person, but rather that you yourself are very sensitive to morality. Trying to put myself in that situation, I wouldn't have had a reaction either, because 1) editing values and mind-rape through soul magic isn't exactly news, 2) I would be trying to analyze every word the DM says because he just revealed a hint™ and 3) it's not like someone else making a suggestion to commit a heinous act means I have to do it or even react to it. I think Joon clearly has a code of ethics (e.g. thinking about how it's wrong to kill the tuung guards and vaguely following through), but he's not particularly zealous in following it because he's also a bit of a utilitarian neutral (e.g. committing to the plan and killing all the named tuung vanguard on the ship).

You raised up something fun though! It's interesting how the first-person voice has an effect on what we notice and what bothers us. It highlights any dissonance between how Joon reacts and how we would react, especially if you get engaged in reading. God knows I get this itch whenever Joon acts in a way that feels foreign to my own envisioned response.

About the harem, the latent homosexual feelings for Arthur theory was thrown around, so as long as the new male companions like Joon romantically, the harem potential is there.
