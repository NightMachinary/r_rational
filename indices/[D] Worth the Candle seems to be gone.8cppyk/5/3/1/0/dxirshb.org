  Sure, he could say that it's wrong or immoral or unethical, and that'd be true. Joon recognizes that.

Where? Where does the story say that he recognizes that? Really, just having that recognition in the story would put my mind at ease. As it stands, there is absolutely no reaction /whatsoever/ from Joon to that suggestion, even internally.

  What exactly would pushing back solve?
#+end_quote

The DM stated that the wish had been granted based on Joon having been given a way to accomplish his desire himself. He could push for that wish back, since the solution given is something the DM knows he'd never actually do.

Even if he can't get the wish back, he could use the wish as worded to push for his /future/ companions (if there's seven, that's still two he hasn't met) to be heterosexual men, so that he's neither attracted to, nor /attractive/ to, them. A party of three men, four women, and a dwarf could hardly be said to be a "harem" (and it provides the women in the party who aren't Finn a chance to express romantic interest in someone other than Joon).

And even if the DM refuses to budge at all, at least then there's /some/ sort of reaction to that horrific idea.
