I didn't mind the ROB so much as that one part where (all of this is paraphrased) Joon says, "I wish to not have a harem," and the DM replies, "Well, you can always mind-rape your companions and remove their attraction to you. And, since I've given you that idea on how to accomplish it, I'll count that as a wish granted."

And, you know, I could even let that slide, except there is /no push-back/ from Joon on that. At all. He just moves on to his next question.

I almost stopped reading at that point. It horrified me. It disturbed me. And yes, in the very next chapter, Joon pledged not to make any soul modifications without the person's consent, which alleviated some of that horror. But still, that one paragraph colours my perception of the entire story, and not in a positive way.

...And, having written all of that, I went back and read that paragraph, thinking that I might have oversold it, but no. It's actually worse than I remembered.
