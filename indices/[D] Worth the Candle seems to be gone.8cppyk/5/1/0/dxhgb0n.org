The characters framed everything in terms of "how do we please the unseen puppetmaster?", and even justifiably within the story. But I think that's a narrative dead-end, unless he gives us a sign.

IMO, the DM character doesn't exhibit even as much power as is implied by all the speculation of our protagonists. Much better to have the DM write himself out of the story than leave him hovering in the background.
