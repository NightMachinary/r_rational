I got fairly busy in real life and stopped reading since chapter 53 with plans to get caught back up at a later day. Since I had some free days this week I binged read back up to the current chapter and must say that the story has continued to be excellent and I love the direction it is going. I love binge reading to get caught up when I get behind since it is so satisfying to have 35 chapters to read all at once. :)

This story continues to be my number 1 recommendation to readers in the litRPG subreddit for good reasons. :)
