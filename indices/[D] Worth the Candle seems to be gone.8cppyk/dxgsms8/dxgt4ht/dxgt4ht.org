I doubt he'd take the entire story down just because of negative feedback, and it has mostly tapered off since that chapter (at least the actual constructive feedback if you know who I mean). In any case, I don't think you can consistently make it to the top of [[/r/rational]] with a significantly flawed story.

I also enjoyed the story and hope this is all just a glitch.
