I guess I'm not sure how he'd push back on it. Sure, he could say that it's wrong or immoral or unethical, and that'd be true. Joon recognizes that. What exactly would pushing back solve? He gets an alternative answer to the throwaway wish to not have a harem? Either way, he loses the wish. Any other answer probably wouldn't be much better than That. It's a wish granted. A waste of a wish, sure, but Joon dug that hole for himself. He's not going to forcibly remove their attraction because he doesn't need to since he's not going to try and build a harem.
