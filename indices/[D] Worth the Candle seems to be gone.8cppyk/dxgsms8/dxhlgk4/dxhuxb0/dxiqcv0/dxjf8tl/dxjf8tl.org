My read is that DM tells Junpier that editing companions via administrative access to prevent harem possibility is not that different from soul magic mind-rape. Since Juniper was reckless enough to ask that sort of thing and wish is technically granted, he is penalized with one wish.

Later Juniper explained why he did not attempt optimizing the wishes.
