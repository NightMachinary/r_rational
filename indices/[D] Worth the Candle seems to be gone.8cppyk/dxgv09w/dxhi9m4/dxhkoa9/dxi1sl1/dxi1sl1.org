I still say you should offer higher Patreon tiers. It doesn't even have to be really useful stuff, my server's patreon offers discord roles, user ads and custom channels and it still gains more income than WTC's with 25% of your patrons, which is a shame.

I definitely think you could swing at least $1000 a month with your current userbase if there wasn't only a $1/month tier. Someone a while ago gave you a better gameplan, something like a really low tier, another tier that you're hoping the average user aims for, and an expensive tier to make the average tier look cheap.

It just feels like a shame to me that the top royalroadl writers can live off their work and you can't.
