You could potentially do freelance software development from home to supplement your wife's income. Stuff like web design, writing apps for mobile devices, etc. Things that can get you money and still allow you to work from home and not be tied to a business's schedule. It wouldn't be writing full time, but it also would allow you to set your own hours.
