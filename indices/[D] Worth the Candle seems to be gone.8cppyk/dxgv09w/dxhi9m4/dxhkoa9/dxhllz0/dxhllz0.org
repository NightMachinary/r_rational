  You can just say "visit my website" with a link, and then the website has a link to Patreon. I think that this case /isn't/ bad, since it's Patreon for an original work, and there's debatably not a problem with intermixing of fan and commercial works ... but it's easier to have a blanket policy that everyone follows, rather than trying to judge on a case-by-case basis that inevitably results in bias, perception of bias, and blowback.

Yeah, that makes sense, and is technically a good idea for them if a bit annoying for you.

  I'm fine not having a link, or just having a link to my website (since they explicitly allow that), and would have just done that if I'd known that I was supposed to. I /like/ AO3, and the Organization for Transformative Works, and would only move the story if I was forced to.

It's good that you're not /too/ annoyed about it, though.

  Apologies for the long and somewhat tangential response, I think I'm just in a talkative/contemplative mood.

Naw, it's fine hearing about one of my favorite authors. :)

Btw, I saw some people in this thread noting that other people complained about the DM showing up and just wanted to say:

I actually really liked how you did it. I didn't think of it as a ROB at all, and it felt really well done and well justified. Don't listen to the haters, your fic is going as strong as ever. Keep up the good work!
