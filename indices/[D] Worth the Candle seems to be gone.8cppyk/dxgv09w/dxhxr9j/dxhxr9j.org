hahahahahaha I didn't realize you were the author of Worth the Candle. I've been reading it but not by being linked to from reddit I guess, and your Ao3 username is different.

I really enjoyed your Metropolitan Man and Last Christmas, and finding out you wrote Worth the Candle is really funny to me, it's like finding out that CS Lewis was a pseudonym of Tolkien for example instead of a different guy.

Not that I'm comparing you to those guys because, well, hey. But still. I'm quite tickled now.
