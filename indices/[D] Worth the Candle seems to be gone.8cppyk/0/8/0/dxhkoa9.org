You can just say "visit my website" with a link, and then the website has a link to Patreon. I think that this case /isn't/ bad, since it's Patreon for an original work, and there's debatably not a problem with intermixing of fan and commercial works ... but it's easier to have a blanket policy that everyone follows, rather than trying to judge on a case-by-case basis that inevitably results in bias, perception of bias, and blowback.

I'm fine not having a link, or just having a link to my website (since they explicitly allow that), and would have just done that if I'd known that I was supposed to. I /like/ AO3, and the Organization for Transformative Works, and would only move the story if I was forced to.

(As far as monetization goes ...

Well, a little more than two years ago, I quit my job as a software engineer to be a stay-at-home dad to our son, who had just been born. It was something that my wife and I talked about a fair amount before we did it, and a decision that we made with the understanding that we'd be going from DINKs (Double-income, no kids) to living off just her salary. For the most part, we've made this work without it hurting too much, mostly because we were already living fairly frugally.

I try not to think about the intersection of money and writing all that much, because I worry about giving myself anxiety, but there's going to be a point, a few years from now, when my son starts going to school and I'm going to have to figure out what I'm going to do as far as rejoining the workforce goes. I'd /really/ like to write full time, if I could justify it, but it's not clear whether I'll actually be able to justify it -- and that's what I think about, when I think about not linking to Patreon anymore.)

Apologies for the long and somewhat tangential response, I think I'm just in a talkative/contemplative mood.
