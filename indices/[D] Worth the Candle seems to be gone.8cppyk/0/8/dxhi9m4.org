Aww man, I hope that you don't have to remove it from AO3. That would be really annoying.

Is linking a Patreon really that bad? I wonder what you can even do about it. Can you say, "support me at my website," which has a link to you Patreon?

Definitely annoying, but I see why they don't commercial stuff on there. It could ruin their whole deal.
