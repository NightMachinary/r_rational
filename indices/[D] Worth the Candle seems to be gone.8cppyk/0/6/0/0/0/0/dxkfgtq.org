Unfortunately it's got several stories that I follow. While the site and comment user base are a bit questionable, it does have several talented authors.

I'm not sure if it's convenience or something else that attracts them, but I wouldn't mind it if there was an alternative.

I've found it to work well for me as a mobile user for the past few years, and it was only quite recently that the ads became an issue. Not sure what the problem is. I haven't run in to any issues since enabling the chrome flag.
