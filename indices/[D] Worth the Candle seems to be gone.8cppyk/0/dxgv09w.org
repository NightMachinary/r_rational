Edit: The story appears to have been restored.

--------------

Not to worry (much), just bureaucratic stuff that's mostly my fault. Here's the e-mail I got 11 days ago, which was auto-filed to a folder that I don't check.

#+begin_quote
  The AO3 Policy & Abuse committee has received a complaint regarding your work "Worth the Candle", stating that it violates the AO3 “no commerce” rule.

  Section IV.B. of our Terms of Service states that “promotion of commercial products or activities is not allowed”. Additionally, our ToS FAQ explains: “We want the Archive to remain a non-commercial space. That means that it isn't the right place for offering merchandise, even fan-related merchandise. Linking to your personal page (not, for example, an Amazon author page) is fine, even if the personal page includes some items for sale, but the Archive is not advertising space."

  Linking to a personal website or blog/social network where you are taking donations, posting commissions or mentioning published works is permitted, but advertising it directly on the Archive is not, nor is using language which one might interpret as requesting financial contributions. For example, you can say something to the effect of “check out my Tumblr if you want to know more about me and my writing” and include the link to the site, but you cannot specifically state anything about donations, commissions or sales on the Archive.

  As such, we require you to edit out all the offending content from your account within 7 days. This includes anything that might be in any other works and in your profile. If you fail to delete the offending material by the date given, we'll hide this work and any other violating works so they are only visible to you. If the works are not edited within a week of being hidden, an Archive administrator will delete this work and any other violating works.

  When you created your account, you agreed to comply with our Terms of Service, including our “no commerce” policy. A formal warning has now been placed on your account; failure to comply with the terms of this letter, or further violations of the ToS, may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your account. You may consult our Terms of Service FAQ for more information regarding warnings and suspensions: archiveofourown.org/tos_faq#content_faq.

I didn't actually read the ToS, and I'm not really involved with the Ao3 community, so my first warning of this was the story being hidden by the admins. I've removed links to Patreon from the story (in the summary, and in the most recent chapter), and responded to the e-mail that had languished in the folder; we'll see what kind of turnaround time there is.

I'll choose to believe that the anonymous report was from a Good Samaritan who wanted to ensure that Ao3 is able to achieve its objectives, rather than just someone who hated the story (or me personally) and was being vindictive.

(Worst case scenario, I'll have to change hosting to my own website, which would be an utter pain in the ass that would eat up writing time.)

In the meantime, if you'd still like to read the story, this will have to do for now:

These will not stay current, and will probably be taken down once the story is back up.
