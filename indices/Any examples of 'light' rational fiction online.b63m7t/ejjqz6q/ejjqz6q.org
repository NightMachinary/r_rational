Is Blindsight considered rational fiction? I've only just discovered this subreddit (and rational fiction in general), and I'm not quite sure what its parameters are quite yet. But I have read Blindsight, and I don't entirely understand what's particularly... well, rational about it?

It might help me get to grips with the idea of the genre- and to work out whether if it's for me- if someone could explain what attributes of rational fiction Blindsight contains. Sorry if this is derailing the conversation, but I'm really interested in the idea of this type of fiction, and if anyone could offer their opinion I'd be grateful.
