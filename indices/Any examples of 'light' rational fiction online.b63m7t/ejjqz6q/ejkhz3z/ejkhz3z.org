Its rational!adjacent at least. If you'll have a look at the sidebar, there are a couple of critera, we can check these off:

#+begin_quote
  Focus on intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of their knowledge and resources.
#+end_quote

Main problem solver is the vampire whose POV we are not private to, but the stuff the humans get to seems pretty creative. Also the humans are selected to be top of the field specialists and their conversations reflect that.

#+begin_quote
  Examination of goals and motives: the story makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear.
#+end_quote

Lots of the specialists presenting their pro/cons and debating about decisions.

Intellectual pay-off: the story's climax features a satisfying intelligent solution to its problems.

The climax is building in lots of puzzlepieces falling into place, with deception and counterdeception and countercounterdeception.

#+begin_quote
  Aspiring rationalism: the story heavily focuses on characters' thinking, or their attempts to improve their reasoning abilities. This is a feature of rationalist fiction, a subcategory of rational fiction.
#+end_quote

Lots of discussion of cognition in general, but not so much on the individual level, this one gets very little points. (I think, been a while for me to read Blindsight).

#+begin_quote
  Thoughtful worldbuilding: the fictional world follows known, consistent rules, as a consequence of rational background characters exploring it or building realistic social structures.
#+end_quote

Yeah pretty much. Lots of interesting worldbuilding tidbits, the vampire thing is taken trough its paces and logical conclusion.
