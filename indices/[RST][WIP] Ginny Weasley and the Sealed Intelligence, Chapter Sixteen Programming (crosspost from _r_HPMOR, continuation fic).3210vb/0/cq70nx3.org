Do we really need a new discussion thread for this fic every day? There's currently three-four of them on just this subreddit's front-page alone and all of them are downvoted below 0. I'm sure those wishing to discuss this fic are able to seek out the latest thread without a daily reminder cluttering everything for the rest of us.
