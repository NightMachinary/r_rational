The very fact that he deceives Zach at the end gives me pause on that. Zorian has grown a lot in the time loop, but he's a fairly selfish individual. He's not like Zach, who gladly throws his life away to protect his friends. He could conceivably find some way to rationalize it to himself.

Under normal circumstances he wouldn't, but with death as the alternative who knows? He's certainly done terrible things to people he views as enemies.
