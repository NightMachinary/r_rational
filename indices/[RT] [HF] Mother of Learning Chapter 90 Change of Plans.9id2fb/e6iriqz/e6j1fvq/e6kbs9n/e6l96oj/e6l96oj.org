There's much failing to this plan. For one, what you store in your mind is a blueprint. Indeed it does not require you to be a mind mage (many alteration mage can do this), but the space it takes up is equivalent to the blueprint complexity. Also, because what you store is a blueprint, a recreation of it would result in freshly made phylactery. No soul inside it whatsoever.

There's other failing too. But these are minor when compared to the first. One, I'm not sure Zach has the space to put Imperial Orb blueprint inside his mind. Two, it took Zorian ~6 restarts to master Simulacrum spell; I'm not sure how much time he would take even if he's currently a better soul mage. At the end of the chapter, they're at least 16 days into the restart. Zorian would have 45 days left if Imperial Orb black room has not been successfully improved. Third, I'm sure getting out with phylactery blueprint inside his mind is allowed by Guardian of Threshold, but what good does it serve? Zach must ferry Zorian soul. But, will he be able to?
