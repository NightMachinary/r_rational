Have we confirmed that a straight up mind transfer or body hopping is possible? As in Person A(Mind A) => Person B(Mind A), Person A(Mind Null)? I feel like Zorian would have gone body-hopping already if it were that simple.

Otherwise Silverlake runs into her simulacrum problem, with Person A(Mind A) & Person B(Mind A) and an expiration date on Person A as her final outcome. Silverlake A(A) wouldn't allow for the destruction of herself, Silverlake B(A) would know that, and they'd probably end up fighting until one or the other is dead since Panaxeth rampaging is a massive negative for B(A) with no upside and A(A) needs Panaxeth free.
