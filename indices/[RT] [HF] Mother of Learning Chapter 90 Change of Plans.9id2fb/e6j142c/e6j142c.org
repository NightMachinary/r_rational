I wonder if they actually have to worry about Silverlake. I mean, she's a totally selfish person who would betray anyone and hurt innocents if it ends in her favor, so I can easily see her trying to defeat the real Silverlake first to get all her stuff back. And she would be able to do it quite easily too, since she knows everything about her real self while her real self doesn't even know her loop self exists. Then, since she has to defeat her real self anyway, she could very well erase Silverlake's mind and transfer her own mind over to her body, the same way evil simulacrums try to take over the real mage's body. Then, since she would be back in her own body rather than Paxaneth's puppet body, she wouldn't have to worry about the death pact and have no incentive to release it.
