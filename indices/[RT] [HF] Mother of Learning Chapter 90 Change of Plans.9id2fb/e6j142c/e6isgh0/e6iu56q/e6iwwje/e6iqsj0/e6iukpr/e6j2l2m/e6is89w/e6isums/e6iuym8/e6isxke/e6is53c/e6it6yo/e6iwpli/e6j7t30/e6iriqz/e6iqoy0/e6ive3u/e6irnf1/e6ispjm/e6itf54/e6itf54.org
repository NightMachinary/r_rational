I don't think this is a solution to anything. If Zorian has that level of access to Zach's mind, he can just check for compulsions then. If there's no compulsions, he doesn't need to do anything. If there are compulsions, he can subvert them or counter them or something, as Zorian said previously that mind mages can counter soul geases by simply making the person forget the compulsion.
