For a lich, having two copies of yourself isn't necessarily a benefit. He can get away with using simulacra, but if there were two fully-souled copies of him running around, they'd likely clash. And for the first time, he'd face an opponent at his own level of skill and /knowing where his phylactery is and how it's protected/.

Moreover, unless he brought his phylactery with him, leaving the loop would probably be fatal.
