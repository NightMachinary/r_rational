I don't think you understand what a phylactery does. It's only used as a container to house a soul. If you use Ila's technique, then it would only copy the container but wouldn't copy the soul resting inside since that's a whole branch of magic altogether. You'd have to modify Ilsa's spell to contain a soul magic aspect which would be impossible to do in the remaining time (not to mention the orb hasn't shown capability to house any souls).

As for mind wise, I think you are thinking of a form of a memory packet which Zach hasn't the time to master the necessary magic to be messing with memories/minds (even a copy of one) to be trusted with something as delicate and complex as Zorian's mind without it falling it apart during the transfer. Zorian hasn't even dealt with transferring minds yet and it would take a some time to do even that(testing and all) which they don't much of.
