  A more accurate metaphor would be to having someone break into your house and steal a vase, then not letting someone you already severely distrusted come in to investigate the theft.

No, it's like still protecting the vase, while not allowing someone to investigate the theft of the jewellery, home theatre, and several sports cars.

And Zach doesn't have any special distrust of Zorian, just a general objection to mind magic. He actually said he trusted Zorian more than he would trust a mage guild professional. So, he doesn't want anyone, be it the police or whoever, to investigate, because he wants to protect the vase, in a house that's been looted and trashed.
