A ward that allows the creation of a simulacrum but not the self-dismissal of one? That allows the use of one of the most complex feats of soul magic (creating a simulacrum) but not the simplest (examining your own soul)? That allows one person to forcefully use mind magic and not the other to resist it? That would have to be a heck of a ward.

As for rendering the simulacrum unconscious: the mental state upon creation is necessarily the same of that of the caster (as it's a copy). The sleep effect would have to take effect absolutely instantaneously, or it wouldn't work. We've seen Zorian resist similar effects himself.

I'm not saying that it's impossible; there is just absolutely zero room for error, because if you screw up... wait, let me find the quote... [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/62/Mother-of-Learning]["People have been killed by their own simulacrums in the past." ... "it's a bad idea to foist things you hate upon your simulacrums."]]
