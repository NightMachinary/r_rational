When does Panathex ever talk about Zach being under compulsion? Panathex says quite the opposite. That Zach remembers everything is and is "acting" in order to trick Zorian. And the only time Zorian mentions Zach being under compulsion is in regards to forgetting about Veyers. Neither of them, at any point, imply that they even suspect that Zach's attitude towards having people tamper with his mind is at all unnatural. No one ever states that in any way, shape, or form.

As for evidence... any? Any evidence at all would be a start. Zach being unwilling to have people tamper with his mind is entirely natural and seems to be the entire foundation of your theory. You may very well be right, but I don't see the corroborating evidence.

Let me put this another way. When I leave home, I lock the door. I do it every single time. But sometimes when I get in my car, I can't remember if I did. Now I do lock the door every single time, so me getting out of my car and heading back to check isn't a rational decision, but I do it. Now I could very well be under some compulsion to lock my door, but it's nearly impossible to tell. Because my actions would make sense whether or not I'm under any supernatural compulsion to do so. Me getting out of the car isn't evidence, even if it's irrational. It fits perfectly with what I would do in EITHER case.
