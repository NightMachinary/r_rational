Rats are arguably much weaker than human beings, but prisons that can easily hold human being will let rats easy scamper through the bars. There is a lot of details about the prison we don't know so I don't think you can just assume that because the primordial can't get out it is the same way for the humans because the prison was designed to hold the primordial not humans.
