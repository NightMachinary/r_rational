The only way for both of them to survive is one of them ferry the other's soul. The question is, how good is Panaxeth (in case Zorian ferrying Zach) or Guardian of Threshold (in case Zach ferrying Zorian) to perceive such ploy, and how trusting is one toward another. Zorian ferrying Zach sounds riskier. Not only because Panaxeth would be aware what they're planning, but also Panaxeth itself is not bound by his word.
