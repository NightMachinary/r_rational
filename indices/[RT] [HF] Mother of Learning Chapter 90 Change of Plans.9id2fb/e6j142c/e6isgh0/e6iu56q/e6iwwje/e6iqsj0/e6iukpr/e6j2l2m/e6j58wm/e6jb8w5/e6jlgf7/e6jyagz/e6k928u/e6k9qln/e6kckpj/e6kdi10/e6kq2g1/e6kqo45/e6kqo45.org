  Zach's soul marker is broken in such a way that he cannot restart the loop at will.

Says who? Every in-story indication has been that Zach's marker is perfectly intact. He simply lacked the necessary skill at personal soul perception.

Since he's now capable of creating simulacra /and/ wears the soul sight ring, he's almost certainly advanced enough to use those marker switches.
