It's /possible/ that Zach could use the crown to give Zorian another six loops for them to improve their escape plan, but if I was Zorian I wouldn't want to pin my hopes on that.

Doylist assumption 1: the protagonist will survive. Doylist assumption 2 (weaker): it wouldn't fit for Zorian and Zach to turn on each other at this point, not when other antagonists are readily available out of the loop. Doylist conclusion: Zorian will survive but will not take Panaxeth's offer and turn on Zach. The most likely way for that to happen is for their escape attempt to succeed.

If the escape attempt succeeds, then all of our temporary loopers get out too (by now they're no worse off than Zorian), and we get to go full-throttle Red Robes + Silverlake + Ulquaan Ibasa vs. Zorian, Zach, the Cyoria crew and allies, and potentially their IRL duplicates as well. Having two Xvims will certainly be helpful, among others, and something tells me IRL!Silverlake won't have any fondness for the antics of Loop!Silverlake.

Things are shifting into high gear, it looks like all the waiting is over. Time to see where this story goes!
