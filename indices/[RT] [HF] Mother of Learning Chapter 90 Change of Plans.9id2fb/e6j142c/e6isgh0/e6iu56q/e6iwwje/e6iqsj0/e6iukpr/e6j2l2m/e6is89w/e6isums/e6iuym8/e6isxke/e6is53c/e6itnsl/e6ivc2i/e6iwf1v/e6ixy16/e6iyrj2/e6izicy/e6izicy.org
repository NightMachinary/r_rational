If he gets to walk out with everyone else, aside from the danger of having his phylactery exposed, he would have the benefit of having two of himself instead of just one. One QI is an incredible force to be reckoned with, two would be nearly unstoppable for a small group. Especially since he would then have two Crowns, and each would be able to manipulate the other's mana. It's an incredibly potent combination.

I think you're right that QI wouldn't go for it, but only because the potential for betrayal is too high and too dangerous when his phylactery is exposed.
