Just because he was affected by mind magic once, doesn't mean in any way that mind magic can't harm him again. In fact, I would suspect that being harmed by something would make you less likely to open yourself to it again as a cure. The "horse" may have bolted as you've put it, but that doesn't make Zach LESS vulnerable. If anything it makes him MORE vulnerable.

He has something to gain, sure. But remember Zach's outlook on life. He didn't even think about soul defense for literally decades. He doesn't stop to consider consequences. He moves blindly forward towards his next objective, and he does it his way. To that kind of person, recovering these memories might not seem like that big of a deal. Even if it logically is a big deal. But having his mind invaded bothers him, and most everyone, a great deal. The prospect of it having happened in the past, might actually do more to convince someone like him to AVOID letting anyone else in than it does to convince him to do as you recommend.

It's not the right move. But neither are most of Zach's actions.
