  figured out how to boost his mana reserves with divine magic

  I doubt he'll be able to do this. Even Qatach Ichl says he has trouble affecting divine magic.

At this point I don't think it will happen either. I thought Zorian patching up his primary deficiency would be one of the major steps to escaping the time loop, but at this point we don't have the time left.

That being said, there's evidence of people in the setting working with divine magic. I think it would be fully possible for Zach and Zorian to create at least some crude divine augments if they'd hadn't needed to focus on dimensional magic.

I believe the author said they they were considering writing another story in the setting. Perhaps I'll get my godly fix then.
