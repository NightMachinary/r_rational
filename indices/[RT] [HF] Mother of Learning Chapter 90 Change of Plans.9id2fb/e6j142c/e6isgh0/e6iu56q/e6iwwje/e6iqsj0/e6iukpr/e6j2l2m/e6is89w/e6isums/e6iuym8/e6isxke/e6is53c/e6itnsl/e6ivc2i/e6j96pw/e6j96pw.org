#+begin_quote
  It's possible that Zach could use the crown to give Zorian another six loops for them to improve their escape plan, but if I was Zorian I wouldn't want to pin my hopes on that
#+end_quote

I don't think that's necessary because

1. they're going to try to bust out this loop

2. Pan said he stopped the guardian from messing with Zorian

Maybe Pan was lying, but I don't think so. He wants Zorian to stop Zach and isn't willing to give up on that possibility just yet
