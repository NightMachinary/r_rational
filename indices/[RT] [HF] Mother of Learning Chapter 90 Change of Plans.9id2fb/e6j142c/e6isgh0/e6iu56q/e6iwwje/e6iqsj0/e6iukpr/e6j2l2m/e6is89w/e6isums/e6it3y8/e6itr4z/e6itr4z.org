  Zorian should tell Zach to get some of the Aranea to look into Zach's head, while Zorian stays at a tea shop or something under supervision of one of Zach's simulacrum.

Zorian has previously asked Zach to have a trusted third party check his mind for compulsions, the result being Zach instead got mind defense lessons from Xvim instead. I don't think anything has happened that would change Zach's prior decision (they knew back then that there was a chance he had compulsions and had his mind edited, it wasn't enough to sway him).
