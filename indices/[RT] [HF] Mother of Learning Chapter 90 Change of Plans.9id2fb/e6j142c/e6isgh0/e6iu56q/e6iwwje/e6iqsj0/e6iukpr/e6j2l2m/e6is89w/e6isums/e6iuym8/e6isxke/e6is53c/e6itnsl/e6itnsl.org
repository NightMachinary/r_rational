It is neither possible nor impossible to give Zorian temp marker. It is unknown.

I'm not prepared to comment on Doylist assumption thingy. Is it derived from Arthur C. Doyle name? Can I assume it ponder on how the story will possibly go if the book success is priority? I agree Zorian have to survive, regardless method or cost. Erasing him will guarantee flunk.
