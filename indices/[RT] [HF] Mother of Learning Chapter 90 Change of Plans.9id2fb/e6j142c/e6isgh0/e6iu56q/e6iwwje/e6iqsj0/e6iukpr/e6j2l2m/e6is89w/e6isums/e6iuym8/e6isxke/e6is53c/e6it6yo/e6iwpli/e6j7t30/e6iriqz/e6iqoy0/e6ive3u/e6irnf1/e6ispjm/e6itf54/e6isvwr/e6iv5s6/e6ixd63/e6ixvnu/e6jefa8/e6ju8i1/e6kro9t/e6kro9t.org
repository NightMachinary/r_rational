  I didn't mention Zorian's expectations, I mentioned Zach's.

I quote from your comment:

"And at no point does Zorian imply that he can recover Zach's memories."

And from chapter 57:

"Well, it's true that a properly blanked out memory is irrecoverable. But why assume Red Robe executed the mind wipe flawlessly? I saw his mind magic in action at one point, when he tried to use it against me, and he wasn't all that good with it. There is a good chance he missed something."
