Yes, but the Sovereign Gate clearly has an out for people. While details weren't forthcoming, I don't think Zorian was just talking out of his ass when he said he believed that had a 30% chance of getting it to work that month. The prison was made to stop Panaxeth, but despite being a superbeing there are most likely many things humans can do that he can't. Ever see an old bear cage? The bars were often narrow enough that a bear can't possibly hope to get out, but a person can easily slip through.
