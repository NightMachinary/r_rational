I can't imagine even an overmatched and outgunned Zach submitting to mind magic. He'd probably put up a Mind Blank and self-immolate first. Or trigger a reset. Or find a way to escape.

And it would take a /lot/ of draining in order to get Zach down to a level where he could be overpowered easily by Zorian alone, with a Mind Blank up.
