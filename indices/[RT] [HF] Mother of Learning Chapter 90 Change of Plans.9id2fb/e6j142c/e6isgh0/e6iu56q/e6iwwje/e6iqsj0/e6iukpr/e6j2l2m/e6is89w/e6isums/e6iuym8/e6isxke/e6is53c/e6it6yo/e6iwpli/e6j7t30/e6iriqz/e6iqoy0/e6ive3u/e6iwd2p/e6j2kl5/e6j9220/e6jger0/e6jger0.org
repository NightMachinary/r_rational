Oh, at least two reasons. First, you overestimate the things that can be done in a day. Arranging trade or hiring outside help is multi-days business. Making sure they're competent in specific kind of dimensionalism magic will take yet more time. This is important, because botching a spell is not only dangerous, it cost time as well. Suppose they're uber competent, have recognizable temperament, easily motivated, and trustworthy, I still think it'll at least took a week to bring them up to speed.

Second, Zorian is about to trust unknown mage in operation of utmost importance. Even if they're just as selfish as Silverlake, lack of familiarity will make them more likely to betray. Oh, you cannot assume other people is less selfish than Silverlake, that's just trusting your fate to the roll of a die. You may hope for the best, but you should always expect the worst.

One thing that people either here or on fictionpress review page failed to perceive regarding Silverlake's temperament is that she's perfectionist. She saw everyone as inefficient and that frustated her because she could do much better under the same condition. This is shown frequently. Remember when she scolded Zorian when he didn't pay attention stirring cauldron? Or when she presented both logical and legal idea to speed up Kael's medical research? Imagine working under and with people below your competence level for a whole year, for every single day, no holiday because both her character and hard deadline: that's stressful! That's why when Panaxeth presented its offer, Silverlake saw it as the opportunity to free herself of figurative shackles. Or at least, take matter to her own hand.
