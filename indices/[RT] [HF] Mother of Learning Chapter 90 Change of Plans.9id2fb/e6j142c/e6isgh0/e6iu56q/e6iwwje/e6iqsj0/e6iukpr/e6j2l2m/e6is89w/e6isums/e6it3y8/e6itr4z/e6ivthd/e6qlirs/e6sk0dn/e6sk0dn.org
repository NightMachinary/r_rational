That's fair, though that will largely depend on the person and the situation. Some people wouldn't change their behavior even if they were told they weren't "real people". And while some people would be willing to die, with their shortened lifespans, they likely wouldn't be willing to do things they found abhorrent.

I'm not saying there are things Zach wouldn't do that his Simulacrum would, but things that Zach would NEVER agree to? Yeah, they won't do it.
