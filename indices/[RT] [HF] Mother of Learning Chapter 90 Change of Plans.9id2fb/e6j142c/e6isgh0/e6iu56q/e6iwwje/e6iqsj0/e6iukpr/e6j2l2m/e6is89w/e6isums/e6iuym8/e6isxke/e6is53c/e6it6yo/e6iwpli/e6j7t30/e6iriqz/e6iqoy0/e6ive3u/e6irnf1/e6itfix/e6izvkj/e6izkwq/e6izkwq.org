Alright, the only way I'm seeing Zorian getting out of this time loop right now is by going all out and trying to mind control Panaxeth. Maybe Zorian can fool Panaxeth into thinking that Zorian did as he asked and thereby get out of the time loop. That's the only path out of this thing I see baring some major discovery or new information next chapter.
