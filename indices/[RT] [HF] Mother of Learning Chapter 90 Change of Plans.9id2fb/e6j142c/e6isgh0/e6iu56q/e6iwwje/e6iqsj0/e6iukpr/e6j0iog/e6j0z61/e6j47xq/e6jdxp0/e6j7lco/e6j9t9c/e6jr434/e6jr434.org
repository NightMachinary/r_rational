What's wrong with QI getting a blessing? He's actually a great guy and decent human being. Most of his "faults" stem from the fact that his country is at war with the MC's country, so he looks like a monster that's willing to slaughter countless innocents unprovoked. But you have to remember that he is positively ancient. He was probably around when the Ikosians attacked his countrymen and forced them to flee into the wilderness to survive. In his mind, the Ikosians struck first, and QI is just retaliating for the sake of his country.
