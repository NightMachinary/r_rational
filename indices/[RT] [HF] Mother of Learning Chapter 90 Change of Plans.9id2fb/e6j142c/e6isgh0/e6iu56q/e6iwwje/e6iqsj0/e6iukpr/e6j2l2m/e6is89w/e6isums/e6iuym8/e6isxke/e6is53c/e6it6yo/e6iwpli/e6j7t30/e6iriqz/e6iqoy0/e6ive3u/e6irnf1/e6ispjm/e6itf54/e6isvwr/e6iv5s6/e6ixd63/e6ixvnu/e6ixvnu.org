You think so? He's a hothead from the beginning, with a very strong sense of what's right and what's wrong. His reactions make sense without a compulsion. Just look at the rest of the group. Every single one of them learns to protect their mind from Zorian as soon as they find out what he can do. Every single one.

And at no point does Zorian imply that he can recover Zach's memories. Even if he found out that they were purposely removed, that doesn't mean he could pull them out of the ether and return them to Zach's brain. Maybe he could, but it's completely reasonable for Zach not to believe that.

Maybe Zach is under a compulsion to avoid mind mages, but there is by no means "100%" certain evidence of it. Every piece of evidence for it is speculation.
