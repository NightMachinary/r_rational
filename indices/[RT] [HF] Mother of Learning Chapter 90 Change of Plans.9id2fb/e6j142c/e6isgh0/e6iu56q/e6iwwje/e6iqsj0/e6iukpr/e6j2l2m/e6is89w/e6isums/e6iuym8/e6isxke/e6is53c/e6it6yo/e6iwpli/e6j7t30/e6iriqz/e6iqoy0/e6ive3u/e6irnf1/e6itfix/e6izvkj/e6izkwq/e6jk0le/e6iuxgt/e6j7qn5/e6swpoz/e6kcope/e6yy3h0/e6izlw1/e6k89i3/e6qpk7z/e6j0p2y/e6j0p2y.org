Great chapter to confirm the stake and to reignite the old conflict. I personally lean toward Zorian, but conflict with Zach should cost him dearly. That's why I dread Zach-Zorian win-lose situation, never wishing it come to be. I was actually glad that there were multiple method for both of them to escape. /Until the last chapter. Sigh.../ Well, at least higher stake means more excitement.

Two criticism which I hope constructive. I know that Panaxeth pronoun generate a discussion last chapter, but I don't feel it worth a paragraph today. Unlike plot hole that is 'dismissed simulacrum upon entering black-room' many chapters ago, this is merely a consistency problem. One or two sentence acknowledging different pronoun usage should suffice. Author could even just chalk it off. The story took Zorian POV (?) after all.

Then there's the posing of problem. I get what happened and what at stake in just one read through, indicating effective writing. But the experience to get there is cumbersome. Discussion on Noveda mansion has too much distraction before getting confirmation on Panaxeth capability and putting a close on Silverlake 'betrayal.' Noise and important piece of information is rather indistinct there. Author did well, but not as well as last chapter. Maybe breaking passage (using -break- stuff) into more parts so that reader can more clearly identify the piece of information story trying to convey?
