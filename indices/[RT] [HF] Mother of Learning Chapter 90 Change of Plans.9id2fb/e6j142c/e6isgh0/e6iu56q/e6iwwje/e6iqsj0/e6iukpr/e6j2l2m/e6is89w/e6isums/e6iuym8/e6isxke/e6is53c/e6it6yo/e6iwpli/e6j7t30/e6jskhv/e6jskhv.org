Well Panaxeth could have taken out zorian just as easily if he could take out silverlake which seems the smartest thing considering that he is the biggest threat(Not considering Zach since he seems untouchable without someone to work for panaxeth).

I don't think for a second silverlake didn't betray them and took the same exit as RR since it makes the most sense. Despite that, real world silverlake might be an unlikely ally since she won't ever help her loop self(loop self would always try to kill her other self in order to get her stuff back).
