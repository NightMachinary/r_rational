Hmm, Panaxeth said that there's no point in isolating Zach because it doesn't care if he hears what it has to say to Zorian, but then it tell Zorian to betray Zach as its only price for getting out of the time loop. This doesn't add up, obviously, so sowing discord between the two is probably the goal. Zorian has been much more instrumental in stopping the invasion in the past than Zach, so maybe it is trying to get Zach to kill Zorian now, which implies that Zorian is actually closer to getting out on his own than he realizes and Panaxeth needs to stop that.
