yeah i think that distrusting /all/ perception in the sovereign gate is going a bit far - i think its more likely that panaxeth is just able to manipulate his own appearance

that being said, it is definitely plausible that there was never a guardian (other than panaxeth). it taking over the guardian without the need for them to unbar the gate is fairly strong evidence. could be that zach and zorian have always been /able/ to leave, but just didnt know /how/, and were trusting the guardian to be honest.
