I have a theory: Panaxeth realises that if ZZ keep working together, then Zorian can /reversibly/ lock away Zach's memories, while leaving a compulsion to exit the loop after Zorian leaves. Then Zorian claims his ticket, meets Zach in the real world, and fixes him. Panaxeth can't actually read minds, so if Zorian made it look convincing, Panaxeth couldn't tell the difference. And once Zorian is out, Zach doesn't need Panaxeth's help any more.

So, it deliberately sowed distrust to ensure that Zorian can only enter Zach's mind by force and as an enemy.
