Panaxeth doesn't actually SEEM to be a superintelligence though. It seems to have vast capabilities, but while it can record things with perfect clarity (supposedly) it has an admittedly limited capability to process information. It also fails spectacularly to convince most of the group. What we can say with relative certainty is that Zach's magical capacity is superhuman, that someone or something divine has allowed him the single largest power known to ever be given to a mortal (the Sovereign Gate), and that Panaxeth is more than willing to manipulate and lie (his accounts to multiple different people disagree with each other).

He's willing to use a portion of his remaining power, which he's stated is limited, in order to get rid of Zach. That would imply that if you actually wanted to beat Panaxeth, Zach is useful. Also there's no reason to trust that Panaxeth would ever ACTUALLY release you. He has to use the power he is clearly cautious of using in order to pay you for a service you've already rendered. I doubt he would be troubled by not keeping a deal with a mere human.

No. I wouldn't take the deal. I would consider taking the original deal that let's me out for the death bond, if only to help stop his resurrection, but that would only be a very last resort. Tricking Panaxeth into letting you do that doesn't seem too incredibly difficult. Even after extensively researching Zorian, it thinks it's wise to mention that it views destroying an entire city as an unfortunate side-effect of getting out. It seems to have a bit of trouble actually understanding human motivations and thought processes.
