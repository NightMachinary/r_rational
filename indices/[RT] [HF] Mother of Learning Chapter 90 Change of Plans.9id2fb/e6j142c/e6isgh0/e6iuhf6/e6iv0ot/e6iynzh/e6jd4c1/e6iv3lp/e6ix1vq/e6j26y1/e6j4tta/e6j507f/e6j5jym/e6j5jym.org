Well we know everything in Zach's marker doesn't work. Zach's marker being damaged is a key plot point earlier on. Which is one of the reasons he can't purposely restart the loop, like Zorian can. That being said, you are right about the loop restarting only when he dies and not when Zorian does. That might imply that it would behave similarly upon him leaving, but we don't have definitive evidence of that either. Certainly it would be bad to make a plan that centers around Panathex getting desperate after Zach leaves.
