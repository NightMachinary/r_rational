The danger there is that your trusting Panaxeth directly with your soul. He's offering to pull it out of the loop and make you a new body. He could do the first half of that, effectively neutralizing you. Presuambly he has some control over you soul at this point and could destroy it, but that's just conjecture. At the very least, he could leave you a bodyless soul, which I remember not going very well in Zorian's training. With no body to return to, he's fucked.
