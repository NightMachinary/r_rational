Half right. Soul /sight/ isn't necessary to sense and manipulate one's own soul.

The reason Zorian gained marker manipulation first is because a) he'd had more practice at personal soul sensing, and b) he could do accelerated near-death soul sense training.

By now, Zach almost certainly can manipulate his own marker. He has enough personal soul awareness to create simulacra, /and/ he has the soul sight ring.
