Honestly? I'd probably go Swords-style; try to make memory packets of myself and all the loopers, stick â€˜em in Zach's head, and have him get help from the Aranea on the other side to handle the invasion and distribute the packets/train other-me up enough to incorporate it. This is way bigger than any one person at this point, and considering there's no guarantee Zach's going to be able to gather the keys again without help, it's not worth risking the chance to arm him to save the world.
