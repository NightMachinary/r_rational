Is there a reason Zorian can't get a temporary marker like the others have used for the past couple resets? It doesn't get him through indefinitely, but it does give several months margin.

Assuming he's even at risk, since the controller could well have been compromised when it claimed it was going to reset Zorian at the end of the month. Not something to stake your existence on, granted, but a possibility all the same.
