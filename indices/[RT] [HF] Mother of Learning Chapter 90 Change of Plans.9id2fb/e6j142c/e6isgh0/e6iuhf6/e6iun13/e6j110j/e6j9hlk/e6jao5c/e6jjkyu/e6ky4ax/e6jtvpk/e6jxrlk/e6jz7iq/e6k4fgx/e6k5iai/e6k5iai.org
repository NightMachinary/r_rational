Fair points. It's also interesting that in the one time we see RR use mind magic on Zach, he roots through his brain without triggering any of the loops protections against mind magic. That would imply that either his mind magic at that time wasn't very intrusive (and Zach's memory had been manipulated before this point), he had performed mind magic on Zach before and was accustomed to the triggers for the loop reset (and Zach's memory had been manipulated before this point), or the protections against mind magic aren't as stringent as I've been led to believe (which is still entirely possible for any number of reasons). I suppose RR might have also been coached on how to do this without triggering the protections, as an alternative, but that seems difficult and unlikely.
