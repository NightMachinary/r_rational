To me, a combination of 2 and 3 seems most likely: Zach takes RR into the Gate, Panaxath +alters his temp tag into a permanent tag+ gives him a looper tag (unbeknownst to Zach || decieving Zach about the duration || ??), RR takes ## loops to not suck enough to brainfuck Zach (or is already that good, if not Veyers), RR begins brainfuck of Zach and spends the next ## of loops perfecting his technique while Zach is coma'd out, ## of loops pass, Zorain gets looper tag.

This also helps explain RR's reaction to other unknown loopers: Panaxath got him in, so they'd either entered though Zach and his sponser (making them hostile to Panaxath) or they were also working for Panaxath, but at counterpoint to him, meaning their success could lead to RR's death -> best course of action is immediate destruction then immediately leaving the loop.
