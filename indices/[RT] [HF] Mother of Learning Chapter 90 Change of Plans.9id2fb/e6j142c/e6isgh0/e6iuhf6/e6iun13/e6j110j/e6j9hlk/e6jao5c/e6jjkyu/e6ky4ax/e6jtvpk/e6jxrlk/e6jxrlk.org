  Maybe, but RR is helping the invasion succeed since before Zach's encounter with the lich in the beginning of the story.

Well, yeah, the whole senario I'm proposing would have happened before Zorian entered the loop, including Zach's memory edit.

  That would mean he knew about Veyers at that point and did nothing to stop him throughout the entire restart. He was clearly in no rush or worry about anything, which might be consistent if he believed the attack at the end didn't matter, being in a loop and all, but he seems to care about the people of the city dying a good deal.

Why does that mean he would have known about Veyers? Zach was almost certainly mindfucked pre-Zorian-looping, although it was admittedly offscreen and we don't have a ton of details. That means that he had no knowledge of RR by the time we see him in the story.
