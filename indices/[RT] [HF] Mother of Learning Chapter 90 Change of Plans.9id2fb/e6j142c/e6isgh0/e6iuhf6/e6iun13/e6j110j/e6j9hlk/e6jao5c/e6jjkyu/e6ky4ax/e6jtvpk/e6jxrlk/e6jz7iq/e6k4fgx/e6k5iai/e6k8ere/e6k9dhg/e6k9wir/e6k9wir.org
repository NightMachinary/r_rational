I don't actually think he would know they can leave - assuming he's operating under the assumption that others working against him still lived in the loop (having met Zorian, this is probable), he wouldn't neccessarily have known that the gate could be unbarred again - Z&Z didn't realize this until they'd extensively questioned the Gaurdian, who we now know was subvereted by Panaxath. RR could (and is heavily implied to have) believed that by being the first one out, everyone else would be permanently sealed in. Panaxath himself may have not known that until Z&Z's questioning; Zorian speculates that this is probably the first time the gate has been opened using Panaxath as the 'source', so he wouldn't have knowledgeof previous loops to draw on for such things and Panaxath certainly doesn't seem to be omnicient outside of the loop (and even then has very limited omniscience inside the loop, if any).
