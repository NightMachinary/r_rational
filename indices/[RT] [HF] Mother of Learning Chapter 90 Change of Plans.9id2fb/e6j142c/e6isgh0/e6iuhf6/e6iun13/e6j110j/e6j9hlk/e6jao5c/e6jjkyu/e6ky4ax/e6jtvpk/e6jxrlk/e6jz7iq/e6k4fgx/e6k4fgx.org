The primary evidence we have of this is Zach's own comments during his first "teamed" loop with Zorian: Even that early, he has no idea what's happening. Then, later, when QI uses self-destruct on them, there is no mention of either suffering any memory loss from the soul damage (Zorian's augmented memory provides an excellent control sample here).

Your counterpoints are actually something Zorian brings up in-story when they first notice the memory hole regarding Veyers; Zorian remarks something along the lines of "it's amazing he was skilled enough to pull this off around the failsafes and stupid enough to not lay false tracks (because Veyers is the only one he forgot about)." This is actually a big part of the theory for Veyers NOT being RR.

As for it being caused by soul damage, I think we actually DON'T have any evidence for that having been the cause, and again, I believe Zorian specifically adresses that as unlikely due to the fairly specific and targeted nature of the memory loss (Zach remembers all the other classmates and several people from school who weren't even in their class /but nothing about veyers specifically/.)

This chapter also tenatively confirms Zach as the original looper, which would make permanently removing him from the loop extremely dangerous; even with a modified marker. if the original were 'soulkilled' or in some other way permanently removed from the loop, it's very +probable+ possible the loop would collapse or cease to exist. As for less fatal methods of disablement, we don't know. It's possible (even likely) that Zach suffered severe trauma from his mindfuck sessions, but Zach wouldn't have noticed; we have evidence that he's completely unaware of 'coma' runs (this would also have given RR fairly uncontested and uninterrupted access to Zach for long periods to 'fine tune' his mental surgery, as we've seen that Tessen tends to react to coma'd-Zach by sticking him in a basement somewhere and shrugging his shoulders to the rest of the world.)
