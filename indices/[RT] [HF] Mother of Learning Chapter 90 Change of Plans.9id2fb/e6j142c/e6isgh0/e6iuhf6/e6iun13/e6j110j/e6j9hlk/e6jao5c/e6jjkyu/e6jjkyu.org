Judging on what just happened and what we know of Zach's character, I would bet that pre-memory edit Zach brought RR into the gate, where the primordial had one of his little "talks" with him, agreed to a deal, and altered his marker as part of the payment. This would explain motivation, timing and abilities and is utterly consistent with post-edit Zach's actions as a Looper.
