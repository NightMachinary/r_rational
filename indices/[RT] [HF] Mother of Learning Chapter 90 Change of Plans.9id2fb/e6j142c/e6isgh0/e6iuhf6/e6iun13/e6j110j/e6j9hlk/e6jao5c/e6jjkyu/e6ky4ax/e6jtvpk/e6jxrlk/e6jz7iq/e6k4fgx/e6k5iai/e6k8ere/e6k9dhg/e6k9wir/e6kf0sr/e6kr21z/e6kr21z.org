That's the thing, though, isn't it? He doesn't "need" Panaxath to get out (though getting a body out of it is helpful), he needed Panaxath to /not prevent him/ (not murder him on the way out) from getting out and to make a situation where getting out is worthwhile (i.e., letting him loop in the first place). The actual leaving part seems to mostly be a function of the gate itself - a function neither RR nor Panaxath seemed to know was repeatable under any circumstances. (At best, Panaxath thought it incredibly unlikely that the Key could be recovered and assembled, if he knew it even existed at the time RR left.)
