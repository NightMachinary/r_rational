Zorian did not have inclination to agree with Panaxeth, but he can be convinced when presented by a good reason, like any reasonable character do.

Stepping into Zorian's shoes, what Panaxeth presented rings some truth. One, Zach is a good actor, nothing so far confirmed that Zach has no lying bone in his body. Two, Zach's unwilling to risk Zorian from checking his mind. And finally three, Zach immediately trying to ensure Zorian stays in line (put his hand on Zorian's shoulder asking to disregard Panaxeth) after discord sowed between them. This is a high time to get paranoid!
