Honestly, I'd just go straight into narration mode and lay the whole thing out directly.

There's a knee-jerk reaction to that with the whole "show, don't tell!" idea but that tends to get misinterpreted a lot. Show, don't tell is advice that's meant to apply to character details and important plot points. For distributing important information, I've found it's often more effective to just say it like it is rather than trying to deliver it through character dialogue.
