I'm curious about the nature of Zach's potential mental compulsions. Any compulsions from Red Robe would be from before Zorian even started looping, so he couldn't have left anything targeting Zorian specifically. Since RR was also a looper, it wouldn't make sense to leave a general "kill other loopers" compulsion, especially not one that only triggers if Zach leaves the loop. In fact, any compulsion that only triggers once Zach leaves the loop would make little sense for RR to create, as RR was hoping to prevent Zach from leaving the loop entirely.

It is a bit more likely that the angels could have left a "once you're out of the loop, kill any other loopers" compulsion as a safeguard against people like RR and Silverlake, but it would make more sense to compel Zach not to allow these people to become an issue in the first place.

Panaxeth's "in the end, one has to kill the other" statement is also suspicious. If a mental compulsion is the danger here, then why ask Zorian to invade Zach's mind, where he could probably remove whatever compulsion Zach may have?
