And unlike Silverlake, QI actually cares about people other than himself, such as his countrymen. He wouldn't prioritize his own personal survival over the survival of his country, so he would be unlikely to backstab Z&Z in the same way. The only problem is somehow convincing QI that they are telling him the truth.
