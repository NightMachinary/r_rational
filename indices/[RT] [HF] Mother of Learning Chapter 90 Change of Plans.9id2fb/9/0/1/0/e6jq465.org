The fact that he suicide soul-bombed Z&Z is concrete evidence that he cares about some things more than his personal survival. Even if he knew about the time loop from mind reading Xvim, the fact that he killed himself rather than even try to get a temporary marker on himself (he does have the crown after all) shows that he is willing to prioritize some things over his own life. The only question is what did he prioritize over his life.

It was never stated (because he died), but I suspect he succeeded in learning about the time loop from Xvim's mind, and then suicide bombed the group of time loopers to try and stop them from messing up the Cyorian invasion plan in the real world. That shows he prioritizes his country over himself.
