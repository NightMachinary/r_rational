Side thought: As long as they're inside the time loop, it may get increasingly more dangerous for Zorian to summon simulacrum. There's always a /slight/ difference in their mental models, no matter how in control Zorian is; as the pressure on him increases and the deadline for the end of the loop draws to a close, it's possible one of them will choose to defect.

I'm interested in the dilemma presented, but I hope neither betrays the other. That feels a little narratively forced. I want to say they should ally with Quatach-Ichl in response to this, but since the lich is explicitly working against them on this particular goal, that's unlikely. Unless QI is missing some critical piece of information about Paxaneth that would change his mind.
