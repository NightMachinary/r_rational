> Godlike power is great, but it's not as good as "not dying" or "not dying, and also not having everyone you know get murdered by a god being unleashed."

of course, if it's absolutely necessary, handing out the artifacts outside of the loop makes sense. But let's not pretend that they have zero value in the real world. Planning for the future should be an obvious goal.

> Inside the time loop though, the artifacts are worth more than 'not dying' since the price of dying is lower and the value of the artifacts are higher.

For zorian? yes, dying would be a tragedy, and even for zack from zorians point of view (since if this is his last loop, then zack's death means his death as well). But the artifacts inside the loop mean little unless they need them on that particular loop (ie, the loop before this one they had little need for them, but in *this* loop they are absolutely vital!). they actually have high value inside the loop only because they didn't start with them. If instead they start with them, then they are absolutely vital! hence why gathering them outside the loop later is so very important. Get them, stash them away, gain immortality, then wait and use them to gather even more power. Right now that's not that vital for sure, but once they are out and things are settled in whatever way? then it should be *very* important. Literal god like power! Imagine if they had started the loop with the artifacts!
