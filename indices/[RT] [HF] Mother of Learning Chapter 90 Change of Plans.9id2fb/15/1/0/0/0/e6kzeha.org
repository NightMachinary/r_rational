I did say that I didn't think using Ilsa's technique to bring a phylactery out of the loop would work (although saving Zorian in the short term by putting it in the Orb's storage area might).

Side note- why haven't they been putting /the other pieces of the Key/ into the Orb's storage area? Has there been a reason given as to why that wouldn't work? (Edit: right; it stores memories, not objects; I was conflating it with the Ilsa thing again. Never mind, carry on)

But yeah, a memory packet wouldn't work. Even if Zorian could be taught to create it and Zach could be taught to hold and transfer it, there's no way that real!Zorian could learn how to integrate it with his own mind in the month he has to spare.
