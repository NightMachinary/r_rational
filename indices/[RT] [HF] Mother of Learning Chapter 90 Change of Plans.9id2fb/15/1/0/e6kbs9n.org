A way for this to happen:

We know that creating a simulacrum gets you more than halfway to becoming a lich.

A lich's phylactery is a physical object.

You can store physical objects in the Orb until looping ends.

You can also store physical objects in the mind (using Ilsa's technique), and recreate them if you have the materials at hand to do so.

So:

- Zorian uses the rest of this restart to become a lich.
- Zach puts the phylactery into the Orb.
- Zach uses the rest of the (dozen?) remaining restarts to learn how to create a phylactery and how to use Ilsa's technique. Zorian uses this time to learn how to build better bodies.
- Zach takes the mind print of Zorian's phylactery into the real world, Zorian creates a body in the real world (or Zach makes one for him).
- Good to go.

Do I think that's actually going to happen? No. I think the "how small can the writing be and be reproducible" issue with Ilsa's technique prevents a phylactery from being reproduced accurately enough to be transported out of the loop this way. But I thought it was a fun idea.
