I don't think he will. He doesn't even really consider betraying Zach. He was suspicious of compulsions Zach may have been under, but I think he's extremely unlikely to go for Panaxeth's contract unless it's impossible to escape, in which case Zach would be just as dead anyways. When Panaxeth offered the deal last chapter, Zorian refused before even hearing the details, and I think he's feeling about the same now.
