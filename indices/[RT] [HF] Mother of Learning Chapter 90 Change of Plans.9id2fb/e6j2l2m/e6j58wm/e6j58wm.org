I thought of the same thing, and mentioned doing so in one of my comments. I guess it's a privacy thing? Zach, not being a psychic, would have virtually no control or possibly even awareness of what Zorian was doing inside his head if his mental barriers are down. Having it be done on a simulacrum makes compulsions and stuff impossible, but that's still a huge level of trust to show someone. How many people would you allow to look through your memories and thoughts without restriction? Zach trusts Zorian, but he also knows that Zorian has done worse things to people than Zach is even capable of in order to train his abilities. Can Zach really guarantee that Zorian would never take advantage of the information he gets from Zach's head?

Zorian also isn't able to respond in kind to that level of trust. He can share memories easily enough, but Zorian would be able to shield memories he wants to keep hidden even if his outer shields are broken.
