Simulacrums share a mana pool with the main body.

Main Zach can be complicit, drain his own mana, and sacrifice his simulacrum. Without mana, what's the simulacrum going to do? Bite its tongue? They don't bleed. They don't carry over functional items. It could literally be created inside a trap that prevents anything but compliance.
