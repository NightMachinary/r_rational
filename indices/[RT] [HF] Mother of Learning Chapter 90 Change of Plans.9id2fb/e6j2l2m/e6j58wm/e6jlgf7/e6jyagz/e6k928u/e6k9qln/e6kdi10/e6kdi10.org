Would it need mana to look inside its own soul and hit the "restart loop" switch? I can't imagine it'd need much, and Zach's mana recharges at a speed proportional to his Magnitude (which is ridiculously high).

It also takes a certain amount of mana to create a simulacrum. So, Zach would have to either calculate exactly how much mana he'd need to use in order to perform the creation, so that he'd have exactly zero left when the simulacrum was made, or drain whatever was left so quickly that the simulacrum couldn't perform even the simplest tasks (like self-destruction or Mind Blank or a loop reset).
