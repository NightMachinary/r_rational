Zach wouldn't do that because it would mean making himself vulnerable to Zorian without mana to defend himself. Also it would probably force the simulacrum to dispel. If they were going to do this the smart thing would be for Zorian to knock Zach's simulacrum unconscious while it's still dazed from being created. Remember, it takes simulacrums around 30 seconds to wake up.
