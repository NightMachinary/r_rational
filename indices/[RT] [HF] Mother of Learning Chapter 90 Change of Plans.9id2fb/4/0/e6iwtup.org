My prediction, when they went back in the gate, it was Panaxeth talking to them the whole time, he just pretended he needed to do the whole body thing to confuse them. Nothing has changed about Zorian's marker, it was just Panaxeth saying that to force him into making a premature choice.

He's going to side with Zach, they are going to try to tunnel out at the end of the loop and fail, but Zorian wakes up again in the next loop.
