I was assuming that the Guardian was not compromised during that part because it does make sense that interactions between the Guardian and Controller would have built-in protections from the Maker, and the explanation about the Key triggering a full analysis was extremely logical.

But I agree that's not confirmed, and the Guardian was vague about how it was going to resolve the situation so its possible the temporary marker could tide Zorian over... Personally I would be surprised if that was permitted, something like specifically wiping the "anomaly" is my default assumption.
