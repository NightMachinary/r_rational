  Zach was almost certainly mindfucked pre-Zorian-looping, although it was admittedly offscreen and we don't have a ton of details.

What evidence do we have of this? RR certainly would have been capable of it, I suppose, but is there any actual evidence of it happening? The story seemed to lay the memory problems mostly on Zach's soul being damaged. There's a decent case for it based strictly on circumstances being as they are, but is there any actual evidence? Also, if Veyers wanted to stop Zach as a threat he could have done a lot more than just erase Zach's memory of him specifically, right? There are protections on Zach to prevent meddling with his mind or soul, but it would seem RR has gotten around that.
