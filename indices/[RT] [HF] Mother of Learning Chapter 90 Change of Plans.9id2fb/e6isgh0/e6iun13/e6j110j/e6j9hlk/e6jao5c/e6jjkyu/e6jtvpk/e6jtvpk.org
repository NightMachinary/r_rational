Maybe, but RR is helping the invasion succeed since before Zach's encounter with the lich in the beginning of the story. That would mean he knew about Veyers at that point and did nothing to stop him throughout the entire restart. He was clearly in no rush or worry about anything, which might be consistent if he believed the attack at the end didn't matter, being in a loop and all, but he seems to care about the people of the city dying a good deal.

I'm not all saying your wrong, just that Zach is an idiot if your right. Which he is. So that's fair.
