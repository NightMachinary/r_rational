Or how the hell they became a looper. Assuming it is Veyers, I'd guess that Panathex intervened somehow, but one would expect the Sovereign Gate to prevent that kind of thing. I mean, that's pretty obviously something one of the primordials would want to do, so it would have happened in the past uses of the gate if it was that simple. Right? Unless there's something special about Panathex specifically.
