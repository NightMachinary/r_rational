I definitely agree that it's performance appeared subpar for a superintelligence, but that's probably what it wants you to think. /s

I was assuming that since it got Silverlake so easily it was just feeling the others out. Especially given its time dilation powers, that seems like an easy strategy to prepare for the next conversation if there is one and leave the best chance of convincing ZZ it's safe to try again without Silverlake.

And overall I still think it displays good intelligence--Zorian is strongly hostile to Panaxeth so he didn't waste much time on him initially, but by his second encounter Panaxeth has a very tempting offer in place and is playing mind games.

But it's possible there's some other reason- maybe it has limited processing power so it didn't waste any on members of the group with limit usefulness (Taiven, Nora). Maybe you're right and it's performance was underwhelming because it's just a weak AI with tremendous resources (e.g. the Chimp in Peter Watt's Sunflower setting).

P. S. : Actually, on a re-reading Xvim asks why it wasn't more effective at tempting them, and the speculation was that the primordial didn't have total awareness of individuals in the loop / sees them as alien.
