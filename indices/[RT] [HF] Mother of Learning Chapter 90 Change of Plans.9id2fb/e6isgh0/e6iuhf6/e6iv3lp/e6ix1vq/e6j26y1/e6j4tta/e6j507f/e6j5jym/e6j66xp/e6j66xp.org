Not that I've ever heard of, no.

He probably can by now. That was a matter of personal soul perception, not marker damage. Actually, they've established that Zach's marker is much /more/ intact and functional than Zorian's.

Plus, the Guardian has run a system check now, confirmed Zach as the sole Controller, and recognised Zorian as an anomaly. I wouldn't rely on Zorian having full privileges any more.
