I still don't totally trust Zach. The fact claim that his mind has been altered and the refusal to get it checked mean that he's at best potentially compromised, if not actively deceiving Zorian.

One possibility is that Silver lake did not take the deal, but was soul-killed by Zach when she was vulnerable. He then burned the body in a "fit of rage" to avoid any potential discrepancies.
