Veyers was abnormally volatile after his ritual unlocking, whereas Zach has always been emotional and is very justifiably stressed out. Throughout the story he's actually not demonstrated much of a temper, so if anything I'm more inclined to think he's not Veyers.

Obviously I'm not ruling out Veyers having done something to Zach before the story's start, but that's weak evidence.
