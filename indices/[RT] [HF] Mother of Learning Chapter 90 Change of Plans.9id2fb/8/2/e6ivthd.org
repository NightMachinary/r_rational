I'm relatively certain that Panaxeth isn't half as capable as he leads others to believe. I like that he uses the exact example of viewing ants that Zorian and company had just used.

Also, using simulacrum certainly removes the real Zach from danger, but that would hardly make the simulacrum agree. If Zach would never agree to it, you can assume the same is true of the simulacrum. And there's no way you could force a simulacrum into that situation without hiding it from Zach himself, and he would likely take that just as violently as if you'd tried it on him.
