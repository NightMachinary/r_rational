It seems odd that Panaxeth is able to recall Zorian's various friends and family, but not that he is a powerful mind mage in the previous chapter. I don't think Panaxeth actually has perfect recall, because he doesn't even address their plan to physically walk out of the loop.

In regards to the actual offer and Zorian's suspicion, I think it's a solvable problem. Zorian himself doesn't need to be the one to look into Zach's head, just a decent telepath. Zorian should tell Zach to get some of the Aranea to look into Zach's head, while Zorian stays at a tea shop or something under supervision of one of Zach's simulacrum. Since no one else would know about the offer to Zorian without Zorian communicating with them, Zach could simply ensure Zorian can't communicate and then have himself checked out.

Alternatively, assuming simulacra would inherit any compulsions the original is under, Zach could just make a simulacrum and have Zorian check it out for compulsions. Zorian couldn't do any damage, because the simulacrum could be immediately dismissed after Zorian checks it. Zorian is satisfied, and Zach doesn't need to endanger himself even if Zorian is hostile.
