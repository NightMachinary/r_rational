I don't think it does. The Gate can place souls back in the real world, and if the gate isn't barred then it can put souls of people other than the controller outside, but putting physical bodies back into the real world has never been part of the Gate's power. Maybe Panaxeth can make the body and then transport the soouls with the Gate, but Panaxeth must have some ability to influence the real world. I guess it's just never worth doing so unless he can have a soul to help free him by piloting the body he makes.
