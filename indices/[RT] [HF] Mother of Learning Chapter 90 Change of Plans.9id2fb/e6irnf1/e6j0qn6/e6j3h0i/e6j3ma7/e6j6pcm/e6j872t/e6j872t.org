Killing Zach is useless. Only mind/soul attacks achieve anything against a Controller. Plus, killing him would reset the loop and wipe Zorian out, so there's no way Zorian would agree to do that.

What Panaxeth actually asked for was to scramble Zach's mind so he wouldn't be a threat: "Wreck the Controller's mind as much as you're able". Sealing away 99% of his memories should achieve that just fine. Then Panaxeth lets Zorian out - under threat of Zach being unsealed - and the hidden trigger activates, compelling mind-wiped Zach to unbar the Gate and let himself out. Zorian then tracks Zach down in the real world and unseals him.
