Locking the stable after the horse has bolted is a saying which implies you no longer have anything to protect. Letting a mind mage in his head still holds all the dangers it would always hold. His deepest secrets revealed, his personality and memories altered, and his permanent death. A more accurate metaphor would be to having someone break into your house and steal a vase, then not letting someone you already severely distrusted come in to investigate the theft. That's something that happens ALL THE TIME in the real world. Many people distrust the police, and most of them don't call the police when robbed. That's not even irrational if you have reason to distrust the local police.

And I think everyone has good reason to distrust mind magic.
