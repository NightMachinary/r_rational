Why would being the original host matter? Reacting violently to things he views as a threat is Zach's go to response to things, and it's very easy to see how he would view mind magic as one of those things.

Would it be rational to allow someone you trusted to check your mind for tampering if there was evidence of it? Of course. Is Zach a rational agent? No. Emphatically no. His reactions line up exactly with how I would expect his character to react without compulsion. That doesn't mean there ISN'T compulsion, but there certainly isn't gaurenteed to be any.
