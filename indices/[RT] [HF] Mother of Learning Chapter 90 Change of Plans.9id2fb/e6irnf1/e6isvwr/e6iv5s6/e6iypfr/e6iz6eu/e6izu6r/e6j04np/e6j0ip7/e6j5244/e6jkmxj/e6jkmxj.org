Locking your car is rational. But if you have clear proof that someone has previously broken the lock and stolen valuables from your trunk, then refusing to let the police inspect the interior is not rational.

Zach is locking the stable after the horse has bolted, and in doing so he's preventing Zorian from potentially recapturing the horse. That is suspicious.
