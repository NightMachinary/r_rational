I didn't mention Zorian's expectations, I mentioned Zach's. Zach is naturally distrustful of mind magic, and it's not hard to see him rationalize away the memories as lost and irretrievable. Zorian doesn't try much to convince Zach that the memories themselves could be returned, focusing instead on convincing him that he needs to remove the compulsion, if my memory is correct.

Also, we have no evidence that Xvim would do so, given that he constantly holds a mind shield in place, he may very well be as paranoid about it as anyone. You aren't thinking about the stigma involved with mind magic in this world. It's like inviting a thief you trust in, while your not watching them, to investigate some other theft. It's worse, because the thief can remove your ability to remember asking them about it. And they can kill you without resistance.

And Zach has personally witnessed Zorian doing just that to others.
