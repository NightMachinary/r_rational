The others defended their minds, yeah, but /they/ didn't have clear proof that someone had erased a whole bunch of their memories, probably including lots of highly valuable information about the loop's origins and purposes.

Given that kind of proof, you bet Xvim would march himself straight to the nearest trustworthy mind mage and do everything possible to recover those bits of himself.

Also, you are mistaken about Zorian's expectations; he did indeed think that it was likely he could recover Zach's memories, if RR (presumably) didn't do a thorough job. See chapter 57.
