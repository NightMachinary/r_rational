remember that zach has deliberately missing memories. he specifically doesn't remember RR-candidate who disappeared from their class.

and still, he acts completely unreasonable when discussing letting zorian probe him. iirc, he doesn't even acknowledge that zorian could get valuable information, or remove a geas if it exists.

i think the refusal to acknowledge that a geas /could/ exist, in this situation, is evidence towards its existence.

...but i really ought to track down the chapter to make sure that was how their conversation went.
