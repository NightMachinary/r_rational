I appreciate this 5 month old response. I didn't think it necessary, but there are literally thousands of alternative explanations as to why someone wouldn't allow someone to invade their mind. Especially someone who you have personally witnessed scrambling people's brains. Was a compulsion the most likely explanation given the information available at the time? Quite possibly, but that's hardly the point is it?

Choosing the result you personally believe is most likely and listing it as the only possible result is just silly. What you have done is called, "Making an educated guess". Calling that guess a 100% certainty was the thing that I did, and continue to, object to. The actual result does not retroactively make your actions at the time, given the information you had at the time, any more rational.
