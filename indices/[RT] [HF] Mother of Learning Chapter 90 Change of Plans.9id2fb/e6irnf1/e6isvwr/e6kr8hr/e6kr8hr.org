The one difficulty facing Zach is, if he doesn't exit during this iteration, he'll have a much harder time gathering the Key in future. The crown, for example, largely depends on Zorian, since QI's mental defences are a bit rusty.

I suppose it's possible to unbar the Gate before the end of the iteration, but then wait to use it.
