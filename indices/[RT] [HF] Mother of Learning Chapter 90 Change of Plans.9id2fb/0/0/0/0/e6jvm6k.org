I think the best explanation here is that since PX is best at flesh and mind magic, he plans on making some mechanism that binds the soul to the flesh more thoroughly than normal bodies so a soul mage can't easily escape. It doesn't have to be an unbreakable bond after all, it just needs to last a month.
