The soul is a repository of magical power and experience and a backup copy of the personality for the convenience of gods, but it needn't be the only backup copy. Zorian could probably take over his original body via mind whammy. That way he'd have his new mind, but his original body and soul. That would have the downside of losing him all of his hard-won shaping skill, but he could fall back on the spell formula expertise that he had originally intended to specialize in in the first place.

Alternatively, there might just be a soul magic method to photocopy souls. If you can imprint your personality onto raw unshaped magic to form a simulcrum, then maybe it could be possible to imprint a copy of yourself onto an existing soul instead. That route also has the advantage of being more likely to lead toward lich!Zorian, which is a path I've been advocating for for a very long time now.
