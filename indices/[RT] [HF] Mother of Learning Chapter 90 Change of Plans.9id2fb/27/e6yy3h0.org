How does Paxaneth perceive time? He technically isn't part of the time loop, so he should be unaffected by the time dilation. Does that mean that he actually has godlike intelligence that allows him to have several conversations at once in one quadrillionth of a second? That would also explain some of his limitations.

He seems to be unable to physically affect the world inside the loop, but has no problem creating a body in the real world, despite the fact that he is still imprisoned.
