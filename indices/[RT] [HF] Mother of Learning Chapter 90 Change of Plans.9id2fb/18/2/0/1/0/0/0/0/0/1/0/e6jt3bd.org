You showing me video of it happening isn't that much more than my knowledge of the past umpteen times this exact event has happened. I'd still check. Humans are not rational creatures. Our minds are flawed at best.

The question isn't how irrational the action is (I can find you a man who argues with ghosts on the sidewalk and while he might believe the government is controlling his brain, I doubt that's the case), it's how different the behavior is from your normal behavior.

That being said, it's hard to gauge in Zach's case, because he's consistently been quick to judge, hot headed, and irrational in almost all cases. His actions are consistent with his character. Hell, Zorian's brother has been just as protective of his mind as Zach. It's not weird to be paranoid about letting people troll through your deepest secrets, give them the ability to manipulate who you are at the very core of your being, and also kill you.
