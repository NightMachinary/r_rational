Right, that's why I said "thief you trust". Zach has personally witnessed Zorian use his mind powers to steal knowledge from people. He's definitely a thief, even if he is one Zach trusts.

And no, it's not like protecting the vase. You let a mind mage in, and he turns on you? You lose everything. Welcome to being a vegetable. In Zach's case, he would quite literally be better off dead.

Edit: I said "thief you trust" in a different post. My bad. When I was talking about the thing you distrust I was referencing mind magic specifically, not Zorian. And once again, we all should distrust mind magic being on used on us.
