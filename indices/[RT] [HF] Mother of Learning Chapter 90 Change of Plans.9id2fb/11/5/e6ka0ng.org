It probably isn't possible to extend Zoain's time with a temporary marker, and even if it is trying it would be a huge gamble.

​

The marker has to be placed /before/ the end of the current loop, and the force reboot of Zorian is scheduled for /after/ the current loop ends before the next loop starts, and the reset is specifically intended to override Zorian's permanent marker. Since there is no opportunity to place the temporary marker after the cleanup but before Zorian's soul is discarded and recreated to begin the next loop and the reset is intended to remove aberrant markers including Zorian's permanent marker it probably overrides all the usual checks for markers.

​

If there is a cheat with temporary markers Z&Z have not yet learned enough about the inner workings of the actual reset process (specifically what the gate does to destroy and recreate souls when it resets the loop, and how the planned reset of Zorian differs form the usual reset) to know about it, so they'd have to be throwing a "hail Marry" to even bother trying it.
