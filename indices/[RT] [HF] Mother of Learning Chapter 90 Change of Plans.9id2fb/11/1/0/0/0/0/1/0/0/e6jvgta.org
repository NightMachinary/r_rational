That's a fair point, but I think that's moreso due to the worlds being separate thus he considers real world QI as the same as himself, whereas in a situation where both are absolutely separate (because hes been incarnated into the real world) then he would be at least a little distrustful.

But it's entirely possible he could simply work together with the 'real' one with no issue as a rare peer on the same level. It really could go either way (though I cant imagine zorian and the rest recruiting him except as an absolute last resort, since giving him that knowledge and having 2 of him to deal with makes him even more dangerous to them).
