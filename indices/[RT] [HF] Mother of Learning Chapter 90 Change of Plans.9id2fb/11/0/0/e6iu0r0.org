[[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist][Watsonian and Doylist]] are two terms I like to use for making predictions based on in-universe info or out-of-universe info. Here I'm talking about out-of-universe stuff like story structure and narrative to justify my speculation rather than anything in-universe, so my predictions are Doylist.

And when I say that it's possible the crown could be used that way, I mean that it's unknown whether it /would/, but it sounds possible given what we currently know.
