They went out of their way to put forward the idea that fooling Panaxeth is possible. I think it's perfectly reasonable to meet all the requirements you've stated, by having Zorian leave by agreeing to be Panaxeth's servant. I wouldn't be disappointed if we get the mega happy super ending that you're mentioning, but it seems a bit too predictable. Plus putting Zorian under the death bind would be an interesting device to propel the story. There's plenty of research into modifying soul markers, that would be largely irrelevant development unless they used it in some way. The author has an out for Zorian that seems to be fairly satisfying.

Maybe none of that will happen either, but it's certainly plausible. Along with countless other ways forward.
