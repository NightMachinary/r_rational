You're right. I just went though chapters 52 - 90, and there is nothing explicitly stating that Zach's marker is damaged. I guess I assumed that Quatach-Ichl's attempt to merge Zach's and Zorian's souls together would have damaged Zach's marker.

That said, I have two points:

1) It was never explicitly stated that Zach gained access to his soul marker's switches, and he never ended a restart at-will (even when Quatach-Ichl was soul-bombing them, Zorian ended that restart.)

2) Trapping a simulacrum is theoretically possible.
