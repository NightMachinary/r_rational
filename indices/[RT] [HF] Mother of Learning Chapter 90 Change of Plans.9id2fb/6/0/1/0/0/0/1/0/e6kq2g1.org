+Zach's soul marker is broken in such a way that he cannot restart the loop at will. That feature is exclusively Zorian.+

[[/u/addmoreice][u/addmoreice]] brought up a good point, that simulacrums can self-cancel, as demonstrated by Zorian. But, again, a simulacrum could be created directly inside a trap / ward that prohibits all the counter-measures you've listed. For example, instantly rendering the simulacrum unconscious. Or slowing time.

The only potential counterargument I see is being unable to read the simulacrum's mind, for whatever reason.
