Quatach-Ichl doesn't want to /permanently/ release Panaxeth. I really think they should team up with him too, especially in the real world. After all they'll have to deal with Silverlake, who is a very good soul mage.

The problem would be to find a good enough deal for QI to not attack Cyora back in the real world. Maybe Zorian could use his skills as a mind mage to access to his demands.
