Z&Z have the location of the remaining 4 artifacts of the first emperor, and exactly how to get them. And they can give them up to the real QI in the real world.

It would be worth it on QI's side to call off the invasion for even a single artifact. It would be worth it on Z&Zs side to trade them away in the real world, since they're not of fundamental importance once you're outside the loop.
