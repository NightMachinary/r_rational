My argument to Zach about a memory dive would be something like:

Look, if the primordial really just wanted you out of the picture, then it wouldn't make sense to tell me to attack you /right in front of you/. It knows how powerful you are; that's why it's afraid of you getting out. It has to know I'd have a better chance of beating you if I surprised you. If that was all it wanted, then it would have separated us for that little chat, but it didn't. Clearly, what it really wanted was to turn us against each other.

If I betrayed you and wrecked your memories like it told me to, I'd be playing right into its hands. And if you don't trust me enough to let me try to fix your memories, /you're/ playing into its hands. Knowing what you've forgotten about the loop and the angels is going to be vital for /anyone/ who makes it out.
