I think it's a bit too late to be introducing new, important characters to the story, although I regret that I have to use Doylist reasoning to say so. I think they will use the Orb as a black room to get more time and improve their dimensionality up to the point where Silver lake isn't needed as much, as well as let Zorian fill up the Crown with his own mana so that he can have even more simulacra helping out (he doesn't need to maintain positive mana regeneration if he has a lot of mana stored up to burn)
