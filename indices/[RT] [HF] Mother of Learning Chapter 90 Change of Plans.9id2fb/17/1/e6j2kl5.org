I'm in favor of keeping Silverlake in loop. Devil you know is better than devil you do not. Current disastrous mistake is part misfortune. Not entirely on Controller and Anomaly.

Oh, dang, I like using Anomaly to refer Zorian. I will use it from now on.

Edit: I assume you're talking about past decision. Because unless Zorian can somehow extend his stay, contacting new dimensionalism mage has no merit.
