Doylist just means "looking at the story from the perspective of the author," as opposed to Watsonian, which is "looking at the story from the perspective of a character." Doylist perspective assumes things like narrative convention, the existence of tropes, and the bias of the author. Watsonian ignores those things and assumes the events of the story happen as they would in the real world, with nothing like plot armor existing.
