Panaxeth's offer seems half-hearted at best. Even if Zorian agreed, Panaxeth has little use for actually seeing the bargain through. He knows Zorian would probably work against him, so he's got no reason to make a fully functioning body for Zorian on the outside. If Zorian actually went ahead and mindfucked Zack, Panaxeth would probably just let Zorian die anyway, or plop his naked soul outside of the time loop with no body just as a means to get rid of him. For Silverlake, he had to make her a body so she could be an agent, but he has no reason to do the same for Zorian.
