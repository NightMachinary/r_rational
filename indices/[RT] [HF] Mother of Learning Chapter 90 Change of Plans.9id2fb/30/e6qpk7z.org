All ZZ-guardian interactions should be considered compromized.

Consider: Panaxeth is powerful, the scope of this power should not be based on what he shows/tells ZZ. Since both under selling his power level and over selling his powerlevel can be used to further his goals the safer options is to assume he is underselling his power.

​

If Panaxeth is underselling his power then the statement of cost when controlling the guardian is immediately suspect. If controlling hte guardian has little/no cost then all guardian statements are suspect.

​

Additionally the fact that he ejected ZZ at the end of the dialogue means he could have eject Zach at the beginning of the dialogue and given zorian the new deal without putting Zach on the defensive.

​

​

Therefore:

if Panaxeth is underselling his powerlevel then it is likely that zorian is not in immediate danger of loop reset and ZZ should continue their escape plan as normal.

​

If Panaxeth is overselling his power then the guardian statement is true and Zorian is in immediate danger and ZZ shoould try their escape plan as normal.

​

Regardless Panaxeth behavior does not create trust between Zorian and himself. if Panazeth wanted Zorian to succeed against Zach he would not have allowed Zach to overhear. If Panaxeth wanted to create trust between himself and Zorian as a conspirator he would not have allowed Zach to over hear. Therefore his statement should be discarded.

​

Many people are discussing how intelligent Panaxeth is or isn't. I think he's not trying very hard to appear intelligent beecause he does not need to. He needs to prevent ZZ from exiting the loop, he may not be able to stop Zach from exiting (Guardian statements are suspect) any longer. If Panaxeth came accross as very inteligent or powerful it would confirm ZZ's suspicions of him and increase their likelyhood to cooperate. By portraying himself as less intelligent and powerful he makes it more likely that they will defect and damage each other. This is the only course of action that would prevent Zach from exiting the loop through the gate.
