This chapter makes me question whether Silverlake actually made a deal with Panaxeth at all.

Consider: towards the end of this chapter, Panaxeth admits that its primary goal once the key was assembled was to prevent Zach from exiting the loop and wrecking its escape attempt. Its chosen method to try to prevent this was to attempt to cause infighting and division among the ranks of Zach, Zorian, and their allies.

Given that we know this now, how confident are we that Silverlake actually betrayed them and made a deal with Panaxeth? Sure, her doing so is somewhat plausible. But that also means that if Panaxeth planned to sow discord and prevent the loopers from exiting, knocking Silverlake out of the loop whether she agreed to any deal or not is an excellent strategy to make them all distrust one another.
