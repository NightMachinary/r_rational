Yeah, I also figured Zorian would have fully exploited the rats hive-mind abilities and figured out how to boost his mana reserves with divine magic and give himself a whole slew of blood magic abilities before he tried to directly take on the primordial.

I do think it seems like Zorian would stand a chance though. Panaxeth doesn't seem very powerful with the restraints on him, and he isn't much of a super intelligence. My original assumption was that he was a Cthulhu-type godlike creature, but he seems to be quite limited while in the gods prison.
