I definitely agree as well.

The fact that when they return from the conversation *the Guardian isn't there* hints at this as well. My guess? Panaxy-boy fundamentally broke the guardian in order to pull off his conversation. The guardian not being there when the conversation was over highly suggests *something* is wrong there. When they came back, it doesn't seem to match up exactly to its previous behaviors.

I'm betting it's just Panaxeth from there out pretending to be the Guardian and now is trying for a quick scam to cause discord between Z&Z. No loss if it fails, but even a disagreement which offers no harm between the two results in reduced effectiveness in the long run. The fact that a real disagreement between the two could result in mind wipes or soul destruction or just complete disillusionment of their work against Panaxeth...it's a cheap and worthwhile scam even if it fails. Better, it also removes a source of information, the Guardian, from the board *and* even if it fails, it still offers a possible source of disinformation in the future. win win win!
