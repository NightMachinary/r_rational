That would be an interesting take. The Cult of the Dragon Below thought they could MC Panaxeth, and Zorian was able to out Mind Control all of their mind mages put together like 40 chapters ago.

At first I assumed this wasn't a possibility because I thought Panaxeth as an all-knowing supremely powerful superintelligent being... but honestly he seems fairly limited in terms of what he can know and understand based on what we've seen this chapter. He wasn't very good at convincing Zorian and the others, he can't seem to use mind magic on anyone in the time loop, and it doesn't seem like he considers Zorian a huge threat, though we know he's concerned about Zach getting loose.

It may be that it would be impossible to out mind-magic Panaxeth outside of the time loop on an even playing field, but Zorian is essentially already inside of Panaxeth, and Panaxeth is restricted from using mind magic so he can't fight back offensively using mind magic. It seems to me that the circumstances are perfect for Zorian to take Panaxeth on.

I actually think this might be Zorian has a chance of winning a mind magic battle between him and Panaxeth. If only for the few moments it takes for Zorian to escape.
