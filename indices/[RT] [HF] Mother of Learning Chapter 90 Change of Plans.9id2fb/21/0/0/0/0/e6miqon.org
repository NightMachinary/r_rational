  figured out how to boost his mana reserves with divine magic
#+end_quote

I doubt he'll be able to do this. Even Qatach Ichl says he has trouble affecting divine magic. Maybe if they had another 50 restarts to work with. Or maybe if the time dilation of the orb gives them years to work with. But as things stand, they're having trouble even modifying existing divine magic, let alone creating their own. Regardless, they'll need a lot more time to make that part viable.

  I do think it seems like Zorian would stand a chance though. Panaxeth doesn't seem very powerful with the restraints on him, and he isn't much of a super intelligence. My original assumption was that he was a Cthulhu-type godlike creature, but he seems to be quite limited while in the gods prison.

One can only hope, however it's entirely possible that he's restrained from doing much while still retaining all his protective abilities. If that's the case, they probably don't stand a chance at mentally compelling him. If the gods had trouble killing primordials, they almost certainly don't have any natural weaknesses.
