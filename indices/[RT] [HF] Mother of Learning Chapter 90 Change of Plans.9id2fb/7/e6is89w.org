I don't think it makes sense for Zach to have destroyed the body. He wasn't aware of the offer the primordial made at the time right? He didn't discuss their experiences until after the bodies destruction. So why would he be so enraged that he would destroy the body? For all he knew silverlake could have been the only one to be atttacked succesfully by the primordial.
