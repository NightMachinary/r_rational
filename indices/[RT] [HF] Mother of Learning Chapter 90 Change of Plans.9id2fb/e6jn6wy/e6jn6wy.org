Two thoughts on this chapter (apologize in advance if they were already mentioned here before):

1) When the characters discern that since Panaxeth didn't use the form of any relatives and such of the party that they haven't interacted with in the time loop, then he does not read minds but is simply aware of what happens in the loop, they miss an interesting follow up question.

They could have possibly deduced what Panaxeth later explains to Zorian about how his memory works (with that whole anthill metaphor thing). Let's assume that for some of the temporary loopers, there are people they interacted with during the loop, but only before they became loopers and not afterwards. If Panaxeth took the shape of any of those people, then he can probably read everything that happened and is happening in the time loop like some sort of record - gleaning very specific details about certain individuals in retrospect, since he had no way of knowing in advance which individuals will be turned into temporary loopers in the future. If he didn't use these forms, maybe his awareness of the time loop's past is more like a normal human's memory, in the since that if asked for very specific details of something that was not considered important in the past, he/she might not be able to recall them.

Obviously it turned out to be the former.

2) I'm a little disappointed that it is hinted that the Sovereign Gate can work using any primordial, and it just happens to be Panaxeth this time around. I thought the fact that Panaxeth was the ultimate shape shifter had something to do with how the time loop works. Since the time loop is basically a hundred percent accurate simulation of the real world (occurring in an instant), I thought it was made out of Panaxeth himself, somehow super-shapeshifting in some cosmic sense to turn itself into the shape of the world in the exact state it was when the loop has begun. Its a cool idea, philosophically speaking. But maybe it will end up being even cooler mechanism when revealed X:
