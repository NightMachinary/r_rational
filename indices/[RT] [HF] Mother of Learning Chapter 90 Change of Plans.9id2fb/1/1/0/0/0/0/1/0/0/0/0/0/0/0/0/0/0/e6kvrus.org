I vaguely recall the primordial (I can never remember which letter is an a or an e. I'm just sticking with "it".) expressing surprise about them gathering the key. You might be right in him assuming they wouldn't be able to and thus being unable to leave. I'm fairly certain it knew the key existed though. It seems to know a fair deal more about the Sovereign Gate than Zorian and Zach. Though what exactly it knows and what exactly it's pretending to know is hard to parse at this point.
