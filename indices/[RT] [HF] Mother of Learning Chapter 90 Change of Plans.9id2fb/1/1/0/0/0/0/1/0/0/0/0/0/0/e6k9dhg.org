He leaves the loop for fear of mind or soul mangling, but assuming he's working for Panaxeth at the time, which he seems to be (though it's technically possible that they only met upon his leaving, that's remarkably unlikely) he would know others working with Panaxeth can also leave. That means he's giving up further loop time to face an enemy with several years of extra time to prepare to face him. The only reason he'd do that (besides being an idiot) is if he believed these people weren't working with Panaxeth and therefore couldn't escape. Does that follow?
