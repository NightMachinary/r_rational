I would prioritise getting into Zach's mind. So long as Zorian doesn't attack, that's a win-win; no matter who gets out, they will benefit from knowing what Zach forgot. Just need to establish enough trust.

Maybe they could set up explosives so that if Zorian defects during the investigation, Zach can kill him with a mana pulse.
