In Zorian's place, what would you do with Panaxeth's deal? Barely any time before the loop ends and you die, with its assertions that Zach is ultimately your enemy (or at least your successes are mutually exclusive) hanging over your head.

The thing is, obviously there're still a great deal of Knightian unknowns remaining and Zorian is essentially being prodded by a probable superintelligent being. Those random phrases and off-topic discussions Panaxeth was saying to some loopers? I'm fairly certain it was throwing low effort stimuli at them to improve its mental model of them, which implies it probably already has a good one of Zorian (having been through many more unique loops means a larger dataset). Combined with its superior knowledge and processing power, if it wasn't for narrative reasons I would assume this was a guaranteed losing situation.

Personally,

  I feel like there's really no point in agreeing to Panaxeth's deal because ultimately you're disabling the Controller for what might be nothing; Panaxeth isn't obligated to follow through on his end of the deal.

  Broader analysis notwithstanding, I feel like at this point I would need to somehow disable Zach and take a look at his mind with an aranean guide to verify Panaxeth's claims. There are risks, but it's worth it.
