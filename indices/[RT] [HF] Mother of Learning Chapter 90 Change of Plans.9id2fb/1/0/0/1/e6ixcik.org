That's a fair point, but the only conversation we get to see actually happen is the one with Zorian, where it fails miserably. That's on top of the fact that it used it's conversation with Zorian's brother entirely to help get information to convince Zorian. So it managed to convince Silverlake to betray people. That seems like something a subhuman could accomplish given you could actually save her, let alone a superintelligence.
