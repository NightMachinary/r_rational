The "controller" is Zach, but if you mean the guardian, Red Robe didn't necessarily bring the key with him. The gate wasn't barred until the first person left. Also, I highly doubt Red Robe could have gotten the pieces of the key without everyone hearing about it. He, at the very least, didn't break into the royal treasury.
