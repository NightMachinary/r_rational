Lots of excellent points to convince people to self-police their negativity and also feels over-the-top for what I think are some simple messages:

- Don't be a dick.
- Unnecessary public criticism spawns negativity and negativity takes away people's enjoyment.
- Criticism is not always true, valid, wanted, or helpful. Think before you hate.
- Everyone has different opinions and tastes.
- Positivity makes the world a better place.

Personally, I like seeing lists of what ought to be disliked, as long as it's constructively critical rather than invective or kneejerk resentment. It provokes discussion plus, from a more cynical perspective, people like complaining and echo chambers of positivity are so stale. I feel like I'm shaking my finger here and saying 'flaws have flaws have flaws', but I think this post is a great reminder to the community that positivity is almost always worth more than negativity.

On the actual points, I thought 2C, 4A/C, 5A/B/C/F/G were the most useful addendums to Holm's callout.

Points 2A, 2B, 3 + 6 basically = If what you're really saying is 'Well, /I/ thought that part of the story should've gone differently', then it's better to call it your opinion rather than a flaw, since nothing^{^{^{exclusions}}} ^{^{^{apply}}} will ever be tailored to your exact preference.
