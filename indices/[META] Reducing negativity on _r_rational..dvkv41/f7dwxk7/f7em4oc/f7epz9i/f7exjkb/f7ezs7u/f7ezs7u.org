  I think we can all agree that making people feel bad is bad, and that being able to have conversations about the relative quality of entertainment is good, the difficulty is to figure out the optimal point where one is allowed to highlight potential improvements in something without massively stepping on the toes of someone else's enjoyment.

Agreed.

  People with thin skin may not like it at all when even the slightest aspersion is cast towards the media they consume.

Yeah, you can especially see this in any kind of fan subreddit. It's anecdotal evidence, but I've seen it quite a lot that considerate, well-versed criticism (even when combined with praise) tends to hover around zero upvotes or less.

In general, I think the only way we can avoid the extreme negative reaction many people have is by somehow training people from a young age for a higher threshold (in a humane way), though that's obviously easier said than done.
