Contexts I like negativity:

- Recommendation threads. If someone [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2sbzdg/rt_ff_security_a_worm_selfinsert/][Recommended Ack's Security]] to me, I would want to receive a counter recommendation before I wasted an hour on it to realize that it leaned heavily into feel good fix-fic with Author Fiat and Fanon helping the author insert. In general, if a bit of negativity can help someone sort through recommendations and find what they want, that is good.
- Building in-group loyalty on easy targets that no one will be offended by. When someone makes fun of the DCEU Superman or Justice League in favor of the Metropolitan Man, everyone can share a laugh together.
- Sexism/Nazism/Racism. If someone wants to push a blatant agenda in terms of white supremacy or hating women or anything like that, I am okay with mocking them a bit.
- Low effort brainstorming. If someone's throwing around random open ended ideas, I feel okay with shooting them down

Contexts I (partly) agree with you. (But I am not sure it if a big enough problem to be worth making a rule over)

- First time authors linking their stuff here. If someone's actually written a few chapters and they are looking for feedback, I think we should incentivize that by giving encouragement and making sure any criticism is constructive. If there writing is absolutely not a fit for [[/r/rational]] perhaps ignoring their posts or referring them to more related fandom subreddits is a better choice than hating on them
- Content creators providing overall good content (I think you fall into this category) getting bashed repeatedly. Yes, although HPMOR is the originator of the rationalist fanfic concept and yes there may have been better examples written since it, I don't think everyone needs to put it down when bringing up another fanfic just cause HPMOR can be a little cringe here and there.

Also why you are on that topic

  If I was doing HPMOR over again, I would try to send clear(er) signals starting from page one that HPMOR was not meant as a delicious takedown of everything Rowling did wrong.

There is an audience for a making fun of Rowling fic (pooping in the hallways and vanishing it deserves a good sneer). But yeah, if you attract that audience you are likely to repel other audiences (people that absolutely love Harry Potter, but consider themselves discerning (picky) about what fanfics they like).

You may have attracted a large number of sneerers... but I think strong fandoms tend to do that regardless of content. The extreme example is Star Wars. Hardcore Star Wars fans often hate Starwars. They hated the prequels... up until the sequels came out and then hatred shifted targets enough that nostalgia and memes outweighed them. According to older star wars fans, apparently a lot of fans hated the Ewoks when they first came out. I think HPMOR is in a similar position. The whole meta-contrarian thing along with the nature of fanfic fandom means that of course the readers are going to nitpick and such. You do kind of amplify the message with provocative statements [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/a21jrp/what_was_the_purpose_of_this_description_of_the/eaxfm6n/][like]]

  It's OK to be imperfect, just not so imperfect that people notice. So I challenge you (or anyone) to exhibit any paragraph in HPMOR, and delete a sentence from it, in a way that makes it better.

Also, minor messaging note... this post is pretty heavy on metaphors, unique terminology defined in post (Holm's Maxim), and weird sentence constructions (slap not the happy), almost to the point of making it hard to parse the ideas. I know in the sequences you've gotten okay mileage out of using counter-intuitive wordings and such to encourage deeper thought but in this context of a community post aiming to articulate a relatively simple idea, it comes across as borderline [[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Deepity][Deepity]] (or to use your own terminology back at you [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jeyvzALDbjdjjv5RW/pretending-to-be-wise][Pretending to Be Wise]]). This post is bad enough that if my loyalties were just a little different I would post it to sneerclub myself.
