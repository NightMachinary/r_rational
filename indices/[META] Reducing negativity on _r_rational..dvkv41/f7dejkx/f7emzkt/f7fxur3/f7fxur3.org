If the writing is bad on a basic level then that's immediately obvious. But maybe the writing is mediocre while the plot, story devices or humor are all gems in the rough. Or maybe it's the opposite, where mediocre writing meanders to nowhere and has initially interesting premises destroyed by sudden plot holes or unfounded changes in characterization, leading to great disappointment.

Personally I have become sensitivite to certain types of story telling mistakes and I'd rather be warned off of a story that is going to disappoint me before I am invested. And investment can go fast if I really dig the premise.
