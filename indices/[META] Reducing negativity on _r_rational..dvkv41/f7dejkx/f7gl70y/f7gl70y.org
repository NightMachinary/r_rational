  It's just as useful for me to read why someone disliked a story

Arguably, it's even more useful. There's sessentially unlimited amount of fiction that's trivially easy to access. There are also many things I (and most others) need to divide my time between. At that point, reading (subjectively) bad fiction is a net negative. There's a lot of value in being able to see immediately if a fic ticks off any of my immediate turnoffs so I know to avoid it entirely (and probably also the author's other works).
