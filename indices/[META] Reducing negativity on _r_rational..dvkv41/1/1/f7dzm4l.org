I agree. In fact I think I'll go further and say that this subreddit could do with a bit /more/ (well-thought-out) criticism from time to time.

Story recommendations benefit a lot from people posting counter-points. A recommendation "this story is great and very well written" is far less useful than a recommendation that reads "this story is great and very well written, but contains quite a few rather cliche plot twist".

And this is true is the second part is a separate post too. If a story has 5 potential reviewers, I'd much prefer 3 positive and 2 negative reviews over just 3 positive reviews and 2 reviewers who remain silent because they don't want to be negative.
