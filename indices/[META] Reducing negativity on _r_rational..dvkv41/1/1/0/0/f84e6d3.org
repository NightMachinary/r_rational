Good points! Don't have much to add to this, but wanted to give some positive feedback :-)

I do 't like downvotes very much. They are admittedly very useful in getting rid of genuinely bad content, but they are a very blunt tool. Sometimes you spend a lot of time and thought on a post, and then get downvoted just because people disagree. I sucks.

Not sure I have a solution. You need some protection again genuinely low-quality content, and against trolling and spam. If that were an easy problem to fix we wouldn't be living in the world we're living in.
