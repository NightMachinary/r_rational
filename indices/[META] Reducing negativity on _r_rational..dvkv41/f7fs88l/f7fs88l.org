My currently trending thoughts on this topic, written at short length:

It sounds like the major considerations to be balanced are:

- Preserving an environment in which people feel like it's okay to be enthusiastic about works in public, despite the inevitability that at least one out of a thousand viewers will feel like the work doesn't deserve that much liking. (Having had the chance to observe the way this actually plays out in practice across many discussions, I am reasonably sure that one mildly negative commenter who chimes in with a Wellackshually implying that it was wrong to like the work, results in /much/ less public enthusiasm during the rest of that conversation.)

- People who prefer tempered recommendation processes, being able to hear about possible negative views of a work before trying to read the first chapter of it. (This practice comes with dangers that should be obvious, but has some real upside, especially if scheduling the read of a first chapter or abandoning a work after starting comes at a high cost to somebody.)

- Being able to consider and optimize literary qualities.

Being a nerd, I've imagined a partially-technological solution to this political problem; if [[/u/Lightwavers]] (or someone) is willing to implement [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/dvoq4i/meta_are_the_low_quality_tags_too_harsh/f7eyixy/][a bot that automatically links to wiki pages allocated for each work]] recommended on [[/r/rational]]. (I am potentially willing to pay somebody to do this.) We could then have the following etiquette:

- Holm's Maxim governs recommendation threads, open threads, and enthusiastic mentions in passing of another work during a thread not about that work specifically. When somebody says they like something, don't respond with a reason why they or other people shouldn't like it.

- On the wiki page of a work (which will be automatically linked by a bot), people are welcome to discuss their own reasons for liking or disliking that work, without the appearance of replying to anyone else, and with etiquette saying that you are not allowed to imply that other people shouldn't like something - only discuss your own reasons and leave the generalization up to them. Yes, even if the author killed a guy.

- On discussion threads for a work's particular chapter, people may debate the well-executedness of some particular feature of that work's particular chapter. Comments saying that nobody should enjoy this whole work are still verboten. Replies here should still follow the etiquette of saying "Mileage varied: I thought character X seemed stupid to me" rather than saying "No, character X was actually quite stupid."
