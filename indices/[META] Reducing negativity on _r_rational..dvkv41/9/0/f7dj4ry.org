  this post is pretty heavy on metaphors, unique terminology defined in post (Holm's Maxim), and weird sentence constructions (slap not the happy), almost to the point of making it hard to parse the ideas

  ... it comes across as borderline Deepity (or to use your own terminology back at you Pretending to Be Wise).

Of all the little quirks about [[/r/rational][r/rational]], these have always been the most noticeable to me. It builds up pseudo intellectual walls around the community and just strikes me as arrogant.

I doubt that's what it's intended as, just how I interpret it.
