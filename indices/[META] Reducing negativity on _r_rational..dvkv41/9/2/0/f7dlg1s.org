Unique terminology: Holm's Maxim, The Cool Stuff Theory of Literature, Broadcast criticism

Odd sentence construction: Slap not the happy. Say not irrationalfic. But don't show off policing of negativity.

Other weird sentences, word choices: Art runs on positive vitamins. Flaws have flaws.

In-group references: Negativity deals SAN damage.

Using an equation instead of words to explain something...

In general a "Contents" outline summary should provide the reader with an idea of what they about to read, not use a bunch of in-group jargon that requires that you read ahead just to understand what is being said. Eliezer made this work okayish in the original lesswrong sequences: he defined terminology as he went and then linked back to the terminology. I think it mostly worked in the sequences, each article would introduce about one new term in an overall manageable rate. Even then though, critics pointed out that he often reinvented existing academic terms in a way that made the community inaccessible to actual academics and completely incomprehensible to people reading isolated posts. In this reddit post, even the Contents summary is saturated with terminology, jargon, obscure references, etc. I can read it, because I have followed EY's stuff long enough to recognize most references, but it still makes it a pain to read. For someone who came from another fanfiction community and hadn't followed years of EY internet history, this post might be even more of a pain to read.
