I can't think of a single work of fiction I consider "great" that doesn't use words, phrases, and sentences in a creative and original manner. The things you've highlighted here are much of what I enjoyed about the post, that drew me in and kept me engaged.

So for me, as a reader, it's weirdly as if you're complaining that the piece is well-written, and suggesting ways to make it unreadably boring to me. Now, maybe you are more representative of the intended audience, and tuning it for you is better, I don't know. But these things should at least be discussed as trade-offs (flourish/style vs. simplicity/ease of reading). Whereas you are acting as if the post has committed a pure flaw of being "a pain to read", and it could/should easily have just been written to not be a pain.
