  I can't think of a single work of fiction I consider "great" that doesn't use words, phrases, and sentences in a creative and original manner.

That's all fine, for the fiction.

If we are taking about rule proposals which need to be parsed (and hopefully followed) by people new to the community, I think it behoves us to limit such cleverness.

Some of the references I did get, and found amusing. But the odd sentence construction did get in the way of my understanding.
