I disagree with Holm's Maxim. If you go on Reddit to post about liking X, we should be able to discuss X and it's faults (which will most likely come across as trying to convince you of that, whether that's true or not). And I definitely don't see what's assholish about that. Quite the opposite: You might realize why X isn't as good as you thought, learn something and possibly even get recommendations for things better than X.

Of course, you can post why you like X and then simply ignore the responses.

PS: Love the stuff you do and really liked your podcast with Sam Harris.
