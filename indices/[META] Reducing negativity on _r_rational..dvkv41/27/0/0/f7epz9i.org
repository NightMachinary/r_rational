First of all I want to mention that I agree with your 1 - 4, and I'm definitely against telling people they're dumb (or else) for liking X. If that's all Holm's Maxim is stating then I agree, but that's not what it actually says.

Let's repeat the last two lines:

3) It's okay to say you liked or didn't like a thing.

4) If, however, you try to convince someone who liked a thing that they shouldn't have, you're being a dick.

The fourth line doesn't state anything about feelings, but even if we assume that to be its meaning, it doesn't contradict my argument. If anything it shows that the Maxim is logically inconsistent.

#+begin_quote
  What you want to avoid is making a person who enjoyed X feel bad about enjoying X.
#+end_quote

You cannot know what makes people feel bad about enjoying X. Most people feel bad when you just state why you think X is bad (or what you didn't like, or that you didn't like it), so your version of the 4th line, and the resulting inability to voice your opinion, contradicts the 3rd line.
