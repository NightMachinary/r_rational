Fair, one nitpick.

#+begin_quote
  Most people feel bad when you just state why you think X is bad (or what you didn't like, or that you didn't like it)

I think that depends on how you say it. If you are directly or subtly impugning their taste or intellect, then yes. If instead you are diplomatic and highlight why that opinion is respectable, then maybe not.

I think we can all agree that making people feel bad is bad, and that being able to have conversations about the relative quality of entertainment is good, the difficulty is to figure out the optimal point where one is allowed to highlight potential improvements in something without massively stepping on the toes of someone else's enjoyment.

It's made entirely more difficult by the fact that different people have different threshold for what they find to be uncomfortable. People with thick skin can be told that what they like is stupid, and they'll give you the finger and continue to unabashedly enjoy whatever it is they like. People with thin skin may not like it at all when even the slightest aspersion is cast towards the media they consume.

It's all very complicated. So maybe the proposed blanket rule isn't that great. Fair fair fair.
