Negative reviews are useful to readers. Both when they make good points and especially so when they're wrong - when I click on negative reviews for, for the latest example I personally encountered, the recently released instant classic CRPG Disco Elysium and the negative reviews are all either "too much reding ughg i dunwana read" or "oof yikes there are prejudiced characters in the game - and portrayal is /obviously/ endorsement, 0/10, cancel the dev", those are actually more likely to make the target audience for the game and me personally buy it. Same thing with novels. If someone complains about economics in xianxia and I don't care about economics in xianxia, I am not affected by that negative opinion in any way and might, in fact, want to read it more.

Now, if someone actually posts their work here I strongly encourage being tactful in your feedback and perhaps not even posting anything if you didn't think it was good. But otherwise having people share their positive and negative opinions is very useful to others.

I think we could do without the passive-aggressive [Story You Mentioned](It's Low Quality Lol) Bot, though. It's not bringing any value and it's kind of petty.
