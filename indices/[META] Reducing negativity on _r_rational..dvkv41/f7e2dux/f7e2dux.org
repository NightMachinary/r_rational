Message from your friendly human-computer moderator team: remember that we're building and curating a community, togther!

If you see something you don't want for our community, downvote it. If it's egregious, report it and consider modmail if you think giving us context would be useful.

Think twice before criticising someone else's comments - could you dilute it with a better comment instead?
