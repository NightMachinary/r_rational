I'll be honest, I feel none of this is needed and you're trying to over-engineer a solution for a problem that doesn't exist.

And if anyone wants a database of works that contain whatever it is they find objectionable, I don't feel it's a good idea for the sub itself to be involved in this, but I encourage anyone who's interested to set up whatever they want off-site and it can get linked in the sidebar.
