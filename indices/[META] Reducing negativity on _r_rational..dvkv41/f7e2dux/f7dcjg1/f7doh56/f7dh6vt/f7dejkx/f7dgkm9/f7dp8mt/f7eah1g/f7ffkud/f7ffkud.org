/Since written text and internet communication aren't very good at conveying tone and attitude, I'd just like to state that none of this post is intended as a criticism against you personally, that I do not have any negative feelings against you, and that I am thankful for your role in the creation of HPMOR, lesswrong, and [[/r/rational]]./

  and I would like to see us do better.
#+end_quote

What you define as "better" is not necessarily what other members of this community would appreciate as "better". I like seeing criticism of stories that get recommended. Criticism allows me to be better informed what story is being recommended and make a more accurate decision on whether or not I should give it a chance. Please don't ruin this sub by forcefully turning it into yet another, polite-to-the-degree-of-meaninglessness, safe space.

#+begin_quote
  I enjoy seeing recommendations of positive aspects of rationality-flavored stories that someone liked. I would like to see fewer people responding with lists of what ought to be disliked about that work instead.
#+end_quote

Again, just because /you/ enjoy it, doesn't mean everyone comes here for positive-only reviews and recommendation information.

#+begin_quote
  ideally, you read the first chapter of a story you turn out not to like, and then stop. If it was a really bad recommendation, maybe you go back and downvote the recommending comment as a warning to others - without posting a reply showing off how much better you know.
#+end_quote

Again, ideally for /whom/? You? I, for one, would like to know what made that other person to stop reading that story after one chapter. And would also like to get a summary of the story instead of a near-meaningless number next to the post linking to it.

#+begin_quote
  Positive selection is when you can win by doing one thing very well. Negative selection is when you have to pass a lot of filters where you do nothing wrong. .. It's okay to positively select stories with a high amount of some cool 'rational' stuff you enjoy, rather than demanding that every element avoid any trace of sin according to laws of what you think is 'irrational'. Literary community is more fun when it runs on positive selection.
#+end_quote

The very premise on which this subreddit was originally formed was about filtering recommendations through /both/ positive and negative selection criteria. "The story must not have deus ex machina solutions." "The characters' behaviour should not be inconsistent." "The setting's worldbuilding should not contradict itself." All these are negative selection criteria.

#+begin_quote
  ... is that often such people fail to question their own criticism. ... Flaws have flaws.
#+end_quote

1) If a criticism is flawed, then nobody is stopping /other/ members of the community from criticising the criticism itself. Through multi-level criticism discourse arises, and through discourse a better and more accurate description about the subject story is created.

#+begin_quote
  I have seen a lot of purported "flaws", in my own work and in others', that were simply missing the point.
#+end_quote

2) Just because /you/ think a criticism was "missing the point" or was flawed doesn't mean it really was. You yourself could have been a biased side (especially given how you'd have vested interest in your own works). If you think a criticism is missing a point, feel free to join in and reply to it, or let others criticise it instead. Don't just declare it to be missing the point or flawed by your authoritative word alone.

#+begin_quote
  ... Then if you read a Reddit thread that thinks it's supposed to be about calling out flaws, the commenters you see may be selected for (a) having unusually low thresholds T_i before they speak and/or (b) having high upward errors E_i in their estimates of the target's mistakenness.
#+end_quote

This would've been a problem if criticisms / reviews presented on dicsussion forums like this weren't a qualitative analysis instead of a quantitative one. People don't just inform others that a story contains a flaw once that flaw passed through their "low threshold". They describe exactly what they think the flaw / mistake was. And others are welcome to disagree with them if they deem their opinion to be inaccurate or incorrect.

#+begin_quote
  If I was doing HPMOR over again, I would try to send clear(er) signals starting from page one that HPMOR was not meant as a delicious takedown of everything Rowling did wrong.
#+end_quote

But you did not, and HPMOR ended up being perceived at least partially as criticism of things done /wrong/ by JKR, and then this community emerged --- at least partially to address the interests of those people who were interested in discussing the /negative/ selection criteria as well as the positive ones. And I am glad you didn't, because otherwise this sub may not have had existed in its current form and spirit. This sub is outside of your control now, even if your work was among the things that helped create it. Please don't try to forcefuly redefine it because it feels unsatisfactory to /your/ tastes and values.
