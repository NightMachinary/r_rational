I'm not following your thinking. If a significant fraction of people choose to stop downvoting outside of blatant violations of social norms, the downvotes that remain aren't particularly more indicative of anything than they were before.

If those people also choose to upvote things that others have voted below 1, again outside of blatant violations of social norms, comments that remain downvoted would be a stronger indication of â€˜bad enough to report', but only in cases that are obviously report-worthy anyway.
