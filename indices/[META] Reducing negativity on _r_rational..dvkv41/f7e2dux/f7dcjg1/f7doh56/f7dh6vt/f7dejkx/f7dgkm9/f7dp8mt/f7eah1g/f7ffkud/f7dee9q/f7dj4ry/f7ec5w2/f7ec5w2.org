  According to older star wars fans, apparently a lot of fans hated the Ewoks when they first came out.

It was super mixed. They have a great Little Fuzzy vibe, and cute murderers are a popular trope, but they were also obviously a marketing ploy. I had a love-hate thing going with them, but I still cheered them smashing up troopers with log traps. What really bugged me about that movie was Vader's free ticket to Jedi Ghost Heaven.

I also don't think that whiney young Snape in any way mitigates the horror of young Anakin.
