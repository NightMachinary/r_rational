So you're saying that for a new reader of [[/r/rational]] the contents of EY's proposal would be unnecessarily hard to understand? A good summary is [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/dvkv41/meta_reducing_negativity_on_rrational/f7djmye/][nytelios' comment]] ([[/u/nytelios]] pinging because link). To me, it's very intuitive and required basically no effort to get through.

As you may see I am making this comment from a motivated position as I support the proposal. It doesn't mean eliminating constructive criticism, it just means phrasing things in a slightly different way so as not to give people the implication that you're looking down on them in some way, because that's not OK in an egalitarian society as [[/r/rational]] should be. Again, I'm totally /for/ constructive criticism, but as EY says, it's more credible that it /is/ constructive if given in private. Too often people say things just to gain (perceived) "status" from pulling others down. Again, all this policy is saying is that this particular thing is not OK.
