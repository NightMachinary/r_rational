  The underlying idea that anyone can convince anyone else to not like a thing, or that anyone even tries to do so is so bizarre to me

What if we modify it a little, and say the claim is rather that "People guilt and shame each other for what they like, for example by explaining how the story they enjoyed was actually not `rational`, implying they shouldn't have enjoyed it."

I think this is more what OP meant, as well as a claim that I can personally get behind. It's less that A tries to convince B "you should stop liking work X", and more that A pedagogically explains to B (who liked X) why X is not truly `rational` and why, in their expert opinion, A should not have liked X, but rather liked Y and Z which A likes much better.

The result is not that B is convinced that they don't actually like X, and more that B feels ashamed of liking X, feels like they violated group norms, and need to better conform to the groups evaluation of what works fit its theme. B feels embarrassed to admit they like a work without having checked whether the work fits the community guidelines, and in the future, regardless of their personal enjoyment of a work, is less likely to publicly state their opinion without checking for a known community evaluation. Which is a terrible, terrible result that destroys diversity of tastes, destroys the ability to take unbiased samples of reader opinion, and reduces everything to a Girardian mimises / Communist Party "I can only publicly say I like things that more important people said they liked" world.
