If you want to back that up that worldview with some decent evidence okay, but otherwise i'm going to take that as your own view on group psychology. But here and in other "ratfic" communities there is constant disagreement and arguing over the merits and demerits of stories being discussed, and the thought that reading a criticism of a story I like would impact my own enjoyment of it is absurd.

This again feels like points are being that are tangential to the policy proposed. Trying to /shame someone/ for not liking a story is not healthy discussion, and is a separate issue from /criticizing/ it. I should certainly hope that people in a subculture have a thick enough skin that hearing disagreement about what they like is not enough of a blow to their self esteem that they feel about liking it, and if they do, that's the kind of fragility that needs to be dealt with in relatively low-stakes settings as an internet fiction community compared to dealing with that in the workplace.
