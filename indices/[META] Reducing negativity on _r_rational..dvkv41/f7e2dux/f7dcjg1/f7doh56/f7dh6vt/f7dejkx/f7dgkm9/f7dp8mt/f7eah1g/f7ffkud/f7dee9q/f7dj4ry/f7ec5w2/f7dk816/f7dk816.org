  Also, minor messaging note... this post is pretty heavy on metaphors, unique terminology defined in post (Holm's Maxim), and weird sentence constructions (slap not the happy), almost to the point of making it hard to parse the ideas. I know in the sequences you've gotten okay mileage out of using counter-intuitive wordings and such to encourage deeper thought but in this context of a community post aiming to articulate a relatively simple idea, it comes across as borderline Deepity (or to use your own terminology back at you Pretending to Be Wise). This post is bad enough that if my loyalties were just a little different I would post it to sneerclub myself.

Can you elaborate more on the problem with it? I thought the post was extremely clear and well-written.
