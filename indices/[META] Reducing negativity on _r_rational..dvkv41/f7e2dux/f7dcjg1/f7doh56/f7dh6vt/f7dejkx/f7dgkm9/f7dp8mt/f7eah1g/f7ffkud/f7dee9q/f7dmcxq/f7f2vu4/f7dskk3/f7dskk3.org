I generally agree kinkshaming is not cool. But wow, what a wall of text! The post and the comments! I gather you want people at [[/r/rational][r/rational]] to not overly harsh in criticism, or at least recognizing that delivering criticism can take enjoyment out of people if not done skillfully. That I agree. But two points I don't.

  Literary community is more fun when it runs on positive selection.

But [[/r/rational][r/rational]] has hoops to jump through to get recommended here. It's not a lot, it's only five bullet points going by sidebar. One of them (rationalist) is not even a requirement. It's just there to mark a special sub-genre. Any fiction passed those hoops deserved to be talked about extensively here. Both to be loved or to be hated. Fictions that do not, get told "I (dis)like your work, but finding this and this in it, this subreddit is not the suitable place for it. See you again in other sub." I did this when mooderino's Deeper Darker get recommended.

Basically, this sub is rational fiction sub. If we're enjoying beauty of poetry, we're not doing it here.

  Credibly helpful unsolicited criticism should be delivered in private.

I've upvoted others' comments that expand on this point. I'm not sure what trigger your post, not being here for about two months. But I know we're a bit of a snob. I'm very snobby myself. But reading snobby reviews helps me avoid yet another fiction that felt like a waste of time. I like to think both author and reader benefit from reading all these snobby reviews. Recognizing which to be taken to heart and which to be ignored entirely. I mean, I still going to give a fiction a read if the reviewer (her)himself is not trustworthy.
