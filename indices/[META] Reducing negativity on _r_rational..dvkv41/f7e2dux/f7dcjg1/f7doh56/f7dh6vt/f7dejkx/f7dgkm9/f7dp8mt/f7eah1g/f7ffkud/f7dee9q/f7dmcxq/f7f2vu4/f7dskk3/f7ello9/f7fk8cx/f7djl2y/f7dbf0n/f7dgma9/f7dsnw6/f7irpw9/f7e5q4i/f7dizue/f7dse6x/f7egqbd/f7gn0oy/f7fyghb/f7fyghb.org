  I mean really, describing a comment section as a “public commons that anyone can burn” by saying you didn't like a story. This is disingenuous at best and hilariously overdramatic.

You seem to be completely ignoring the substantive structure of the critique, which is that humans are social animals who band together in tribes with shared values, and hence the many silent readers of a Reddit actually lose utils by reading criticism of things they liked. This is not a vague dramatic statement but a concrete and (IMO at least somewhat substantiated) statement of psychology.

I believe it is a fact that humans who enjoy work of art X, and then read that other members of subculture A who are close to them in values felt that X is garbage when viewed through the values of A, lose their enjoyment of X, lose their ability to publicly state they liked X (it feels like affiliating with a loser who is hated by their tribe), lose their ability to independently evaluate their enjoyment of X, etc.

And in that world, obviously there are different optimal norms for stating disagreement with what people enjoyed. So, I would argue that it's your map (and the default map) that don't match the (actual human tribal psychology) territory. This is not saying that "we should never say anything bad about stories" or "criticism is bad" or anything like that. Which sometimes some people say and is a problem in it's own way. But if you want to make good community norms for recommending and critiquing things, it's good to understand these failure modes and default to an analysis method that is more understanding of diversity and less about totalitarian declarations of "what is rational" and "what is irrational" and shaming ppl for what they like.
