The underlying idea that anyone /can/ convince anyone else to not like a thing, or that anyone even /tries/ to do so is so bizarre to me. I've seen a lot of conversations online, a lot of arguments, but not once in my admittedly faulty memory do I remember an argument where someone was trying to convince someone else that they shouldn't like something. People argue merits of the work, or (in the worst cases) insult the other person for being a great big dum-dum, but that's about it. The fact that apparently some people /do/ see some arguments like that makes me honestly uneasy.

Further, the implication is that since there are arguments like that, presumably sometimes they are successful? Otherwise nobody would have them, right? So what, there are people out there who like a thing, a stranger tells them "no don't like that thing", and they stop?

Have you considered taking opinions of literal strangers online a tad less seriously? At least not to the point where it actually dictates the things you are allowed to like?

On a subreddit level, if a new work is posted and I am looking for stuff to read, I may check out the comments. If someone in the comments mentions points A, B and C about the work that they really liked, this is information for me - it tells me what kind of things people like about this work. Now, on a subreddit like this, I can also rely on other people having broadly similar tastes to mine. If I then see a comment critiquing points A, B and C as a response, and the response seems coherent, I know that maybe the original commenter wasn't all that accurate. On the other hand, if I see /no/ substantial critique to a positive post in a frequently-visited comment thread, then I know all those positive points are solid, because in the counterfactual world where there were factual points undermining the points A, B and C, /someone similar to me would have already complained about them./ Here, the culture of complaining about factual inaccuracies in comments directly affects the information about a book I get from reading some comments. That makes it easier for me to search for things I'll like, and I don't want this to go away.
