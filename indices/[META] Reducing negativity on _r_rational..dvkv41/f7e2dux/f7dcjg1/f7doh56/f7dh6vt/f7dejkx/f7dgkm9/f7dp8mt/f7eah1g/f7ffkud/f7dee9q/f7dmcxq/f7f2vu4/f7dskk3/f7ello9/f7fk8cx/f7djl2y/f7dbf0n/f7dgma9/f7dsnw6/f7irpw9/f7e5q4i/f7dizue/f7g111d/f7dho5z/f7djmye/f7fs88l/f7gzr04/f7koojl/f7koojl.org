You signal that this cost is small. As an author, you see your work as a unit; people can spend constant effort to maybe gain linear reward. As a reader, I see the communities output as a unit; expecting to like only a small number of stories, I can spend linear effort to gain linear reward.

A reddit optimizes the time spent reading opinions better than a wiki - the most agreed opinions rise to the top, their flaws and associations are pointed out in replies.

I expect that an external site to gather readers reactions would remain mostly unused due to trivial inconvenience. If you disagree, we could have the external site that the bot links to be the safe space, and reddit norms remain as they are. Aspiring authors could post there and ignore reddit if they need such.
