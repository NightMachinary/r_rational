  f you go on Reddit to post about liking X, we should be able to discuss X and it's faults

If you read the original post carefully, there's nothing that contradicts this (see 3rd line of Holm's Maxim). What you want to avoid is making a person who enjoyed X feel bad about enjoying X.

1. Taste is subjective. Maybe you like prose that is terse and direct. Maybe I don't. If I tell you you're wrong about enjoy terse prose because florid prose is clearly superior, I'm just "yucking your yum" by appealing to an arbitrary standard of taste.
2. Even if something is "bad" under some objective metric, it might still have redeeming qualities. By telling me to feel bad for enjoying that thing because of its bad qualities, it undercuts my (rightful) enjoyment of its good qualities.
3. Different people are at different points in their journey of taste development. You don't tell a 13 year old that they should feel bad for enjoying a McNugget more than a perfectly sliced serving of mackerel sashimi. Instead you acknowledge that perhaps for the stage of palate-development the person is in, the McNugget is perfectly fine.
4. /Umwelts/ are different. This is a rehash of point 1 in some ways, but it's a stronger statement because it means that some tastes are not malleable. If you lack some isoform of a taste receptor that I have, you might never develop a taste for cruciferous vegetables or the fiction of HP Lovecraft.

Concrete example from my actual life.

  *My Wife*: "I really enjoy the fantasy novels of Brandon Sanderson!"

  *Wrong response*: "That shit is puerile tripe."

  *Correct response*: "I gave them a go, and while I appreciate the intricate world-building that has rightfully won him a loyal fanbase, his prose and narrative structure do not particularly appeal to me."
