Geek hate has always been a thing, but it really feels as though, over the last few years, across a broad range of geekdom, geek self-hate has become a thing; as though some kind of line has been crossed from gentle self-mocking to unhealthy joking-but-not-really vitriol.

For this specific forum, I have many issues with this particular policy as stated - I find the reasons why someone didn't like a thing super helpful when deciding whether I'm likely to enjoy the thing or not - but I do think there is a real underlying problem here.

I've certainly found myself producing rants about the feeling of unexpectedly negative statements making one realise that a space they thought of as safe and a people they thought of as ingroup are actually neither of those things recently, and I've seen an uptick of similar sentiment from others ([[https://www.somethingpositive.net/sp10172019.shtml][e.g.]]).

I don't know if it's just a factor of the geekdoms/groups I am part of, or if it's something general. I also don't know what an actually sensible thing to do about it might look like, or even if I've done any better at articulating what seems to be the root issue than all the previous attempts. Still, putting it out there in case others have ideas.
