  It's a long time ago that I read A Hero's War. It's the story about a guy single-handedly starting the industrial revolution right? I thought the story was too over-the-top, the main character is way too perfect. But I think the world building and prose were decent. Never finished it though, so can't say anything about the overall narrative.

The first two things don't go away, unfortunately. They blow up to such a huge extent that it completely overshadows any potential the story has.

  Relative estimates are much easier than absolute estimates.
#+end_quote

Indeed. This is especially true with numerical estimates. However, I do not provide numerical estimates. "X is a good story" may not say much, but it's something I'm much more comfortable saying than "X is better than Y."

#+begin_quote
  The story is way too long. It's a million words and counting.
#+end_quote

Okay ... I can ... sort of see this, if you have absolutely no investment in the characters.

  The narrative is bad. The main character has almost no agency, the plot keeps happening despite him not because of him, and in many battles he plays almost no role.

Uh...

  There also does not seem to be any overarching story or main villain or anything like that. They have a vaguely defined goal of finding someone (Uther), but are doing nothing to further this goal, and they don't even have the beginnings of a plan on how to do it. - The main character is very unlikable. He's arrogant, cares very little about others, and is a complete dick to his companions. - The characterization is inconsistent. Characters basically behave how the plot wants them to behave. At some points things are outright stated by author fiat that completely contradict earlier events. For example at one point the MC looks into the soul of one of his companions and finds that the top 5 things she cares about are herself, her freedom, power, and two other similar things I forgot. Yet earlier in the story she allows herself to be taken prisoner and most likely killed to safe her friends. So the author is just informing us about character traits (remember, always tell, don't show!) that completely contradict earlier behavior. - The narrative itself is inconsistent, with setups made that are abandoned or contradicted. - The writer keeps putting in flashbacks to earth, which are fine, but they are often in weird places, or come at a weird timing, breaking the flow of the story or setting up / foreshadowing things after they have already happened.

Okay, you seem to have a very specific view of what Worth the Candle is, and I doubt I'll be able to persuade you to change it. If I were to argue the point, I'd say most of the issues you list are simply /not there/, and those that are such as Juniper's bad character traits are there so there can be character growth over the course of the story, and then I'd provide evidence from the text contesting these claims. However, I don't have the time, and that's not the original point of this conversation, so I'll leave this be. Just as it's not a crime to like something bad, it's not a crime to dislike something good.

But we were talking about the (Low Quality) tag's I've applied. If you can find examples where I've applied this tag in error, and you can support this, please inform me.
