I love all of this and it corresponds really well with my own feelings. I especially like the part about negativity dealing SAN damage; I've definitely experienced that myself in multiple ways. To pick the most relevant: sporking communities are honestly kind of terrifying, not because they're dangerous or anything, but because of what it does to the mentalities of the people in them. I've gotten sucked into some before, not nearly as much as the more prolific users, but still enough to feel the negative sanity effects. It's some kind of manifested evil, like a reverse lotus eater scenario where people continually eat a plant that drives them mad with paranoia and hate because they don't want to "forget" their "insight" that they're living in Hell and everyone else is stupid and worthless; they constantly look for more reasons to hate the things they've already found reasons to hate, and they constantly look for more things to throw on the hatred bonfire. Be really careful of that self-congratulatory cynical feedback loop.
