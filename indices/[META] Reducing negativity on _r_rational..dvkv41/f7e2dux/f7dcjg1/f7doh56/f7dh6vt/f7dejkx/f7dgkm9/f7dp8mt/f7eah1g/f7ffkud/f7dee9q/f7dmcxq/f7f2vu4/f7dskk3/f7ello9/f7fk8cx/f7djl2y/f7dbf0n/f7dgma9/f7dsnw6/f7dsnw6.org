I agree that telling people they shouldn't like what they like is generally something to avoid. But I am not sure that the negative criticisms of this subreddit take on that form all that much. They tend to discuss the work at hand instead of telling people why they shouldn't like it.

Another point to consider is that negative criticisms are much more useful for filtering out things we would not like. The positive comments tend to be similar to each other, even to the positive comments praising other books, but negative comments are generally specific to a work, usually with examples to demonstrate their point. In my opinion, online reviews in places like goodreads or royalroad make this imbalance between positive and negative clear, and negative reviews are what I consider when deciding to read. Of course low quality negative comments exist, ones that should be ignored, but I do not think they are a problem in this community.

I am also not sure if criticisms of irrationality in fiction are a bad thing. Perhaps “not rational” is a better way of saying that than “irrational”. Since it would be more neutral. But not criticising that irrationality would be quite difficult, as vast majority of fiction is not rational and this community is in a way a reaction to that. Though I do agree stating a book being irrational is generally not a useful statement by itself, as not being rational doesn't equal to not being good.

It could also be argued that since rational fiction is a tiny minority of fiction, it remains mostly reactive to all the other non rational fiction out there. And trying to remove the reactive/critical attitude towards these would be removing a crucial part of what being part of this community is. Indeed, I would argue rational fiction community is less about reading rational fiction, as there is precious few of those, and more about our shared dislike to what we deem irrational in fiction.
