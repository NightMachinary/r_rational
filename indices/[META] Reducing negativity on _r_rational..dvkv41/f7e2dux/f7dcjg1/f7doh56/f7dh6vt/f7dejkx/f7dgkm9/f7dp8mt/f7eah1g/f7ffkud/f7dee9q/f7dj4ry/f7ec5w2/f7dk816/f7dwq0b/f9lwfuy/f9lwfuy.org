You realize those have fans, right?

Personally I quite like them, and wish people didn't performatively crap on them to seem cool - in general, I actually haven't noticed that here - just because they've acquired some kind of "acceptable target" status in the media. I actually think that my favourite parts of the DCEU have a lot of parallels with ratfic (e.g. Batman's motives in BvS are similar to Metropolitan Man's Lex.)

Given that they're quite financially succesful, and the least successful one was also the least DCEU-like (Justice League), I'm pretty sure there are quite a /lot/ of DCEU fans who probably feel bad when they see this. Although I could be typical-minding.
