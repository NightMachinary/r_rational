Intuitively, it makes sense that criticism and skepticism follow similar neural pathways. This, combined with the Internet's tendency to exaggerate the worst parts of people means your undertaking might be a difficult one indeed.

Why not automate our way out of this? Sentiment analyzers exist, and most people in the sub use standard English and full sentences. If a bot gives you a sentiment score on your comment, you'll know to keep it high. ( same as how weight watching naturally causes weight reduction?)
