I think it's much easier to vaguely imply that people aren't rational if they enjoy friggin gummi bears, than to actually make that claim explicitly.

And that a lot of status competition with subcultures happens via that kind of vague implication rather than explicit discussion or claims which can be challenged.

And that this is a bad thing when trying to recommend utility-enhancing consumption to humans who are very spookable into feeling bad and ashamed of their tastes if other tribe members mock them.

Another way to think of this: we have all kinds of theories and systems for handling tragedies of the commons and market failures like pollution or underproduction of commons resources. But people seem to talk much less about the market failure of mimesis where people shame other people for what they like.
