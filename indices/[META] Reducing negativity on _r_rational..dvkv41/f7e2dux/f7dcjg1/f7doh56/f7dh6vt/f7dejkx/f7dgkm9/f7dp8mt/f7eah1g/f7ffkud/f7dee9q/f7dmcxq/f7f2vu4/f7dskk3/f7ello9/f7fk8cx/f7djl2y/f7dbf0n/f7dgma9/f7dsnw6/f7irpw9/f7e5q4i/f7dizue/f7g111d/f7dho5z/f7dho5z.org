Thank you. I find much of what you've written here accurate and helpful.

Specific things that stick out for me are that positive vitamins are crucial to my creative psyche, and I suspect they are to most. And I hadn't thought it so clearly before but, criticism reflects upon the critic as much as the criticized (and it's hard to often see that).

I try to model the behavior I want to see in others...by being positive, even when I disagree, and when I have criticism to offer either to the author or to the community, doing so in a way I think is supportive rather than destructive.

(Personally, math analogies are useless to me. The broadcast criticism paragraph left me confused)

I haven't felt as much overt criticism here as maybe there is implied in your post (though you qualified that early on), but I don't always read all threads closely.

However, when I see a 3,000 word chapter posted and a comment (or the only comment) consists solely of: "You misspelled 'parallel'.", I cringe. Tell the author you like the story! Or (if that'd be a lie) what you found interesting enough to want to improve it by correcting a tiny mistake. And do that via PM.

I try to frame a dislike as a personal response rather than a universal one and couch it in socially mediated phrasing. That goes a long way. ("It didn't make sense to me that the girl's dress..." vs "It's stupid that...") And it's more accurate, 'cause, maybe I missed something.

I'm not always successful, I fail and respond with kneejerk comments, but I'm trying.

Again, thanks for caring enough to put this out there.
