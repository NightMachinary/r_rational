The trouble is, what if the negativity is against negativity? I think it's reasonable to criticize a work for something like bigotry, for a few reasons:

1. Anyone who would be turned off by that really ought to know first, especially if it's targeted at them.

2. This community is [[/r/rational][r/rational]], and bigotry isn't rational thought (or at least we don't live in a world where bigotry has good evidence backing it, and any story set in such a world isn't going to teach any good lessons on the subject). We should treat it the same as if someone wrote a story with deeply religious undertones and no rationality on that subject.

We should at least have content warnings, but I think the bot that brought up this controversy doesn't do a good job of that. And author content warnings are also useful, especially for an in-progress story. Death of the author in an absolute sense is impossible, the work is the thoughts of the author. It can be evaluated outside of that context, but if your goal is to predict if the story will make someone uncomfortable (and not in a useful way)...

A content warning isn't a criticism so much as, you know, a warning.

Also, what's with all the justifying transphobia with [[https://preview.redd.it/bbjghma4mhy31.jpg?width=638&auto=webp&s=538be4430619cd0e71f5ce36a43affe4cef7ae01][cultural relativism?]] Just, *no*. Someone's right to exist trumps someone else's right to be uncomfortable. Just because slavery/racism/whatever is commonplace doesn't mean it's okay. In fact it makes it /worse/. Reminds me of that scene in the Yudkowsky story where someone tries that to justify the baby eating aliens and gets a slap, if I'm remembering that right.

EDIT: Thanks for the silver.
