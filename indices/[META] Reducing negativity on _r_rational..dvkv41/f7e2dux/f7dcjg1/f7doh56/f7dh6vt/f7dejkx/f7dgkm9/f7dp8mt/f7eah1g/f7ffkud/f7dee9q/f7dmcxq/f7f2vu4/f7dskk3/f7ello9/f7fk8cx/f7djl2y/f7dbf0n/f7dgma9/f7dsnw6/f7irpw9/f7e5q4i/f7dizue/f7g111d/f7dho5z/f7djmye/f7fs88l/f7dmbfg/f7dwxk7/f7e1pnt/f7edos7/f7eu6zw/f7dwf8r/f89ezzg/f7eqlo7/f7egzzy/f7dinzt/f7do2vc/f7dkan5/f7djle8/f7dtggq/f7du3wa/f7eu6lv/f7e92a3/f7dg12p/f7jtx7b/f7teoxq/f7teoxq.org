I'm inclined to agree about the positive selection up to a point. Some things should be negatively filtered, usually because if they are not they end up dragging down society, or at least some segment that is exposed to the thing.

Maybe the question isn't "which absolute should we strive for" but "where should the line be drawn." Should we allow the sub to support stories which parrot statements made by public figures specifically with the goal of harming trans people? It'll be painful to read for about 6 in 1000, and maybe upsetting to another 4 or 5 so by the numbers maybe they're not worthy of consideration. But if that's the case, saying they shouldn't voice their upset or pain points you're really just creating a safe space for those sorts who would cause others harm if they can find a way to escape the externally enforced consequences.
