I agree with all the observations and analysis in your comment, every sentence. Where I don't necessarily agree is that those modes of reflection used in the public space lead to optimal outcomes.

In grade school, in college, and now in the professional world, a lot of the criticism I see contained a lot of violence, including the ones that led to these results in the entertainment industry you're citing. A lot of people were injured mentally and physically when you consider lost sleep due to overwork and stress, which I'm sure the sonic team had to do. Is {Sonic, GoT, Star Wars, Pokemon} fandoms being at war or those franchise's corporate handlers not eking out as much profit as they would be via better decisions a cultural reality worth defending? All the energy that pours into those franchises both positive and negative helps sustain what is otherwise not a vibrant expression of culture: sequel after sequel of the same stuff recycling different tired tropes. Which is fine for many people, it's not tired to them, but for me it is so I just "don't read" it.

Although the fandom of Steven Universe has its problems like any other, in general I think there's a higher tide of human wellness there because positive-natured effort is so core to the canon material. Is criticism absent there? Not at all, but it's not the focus. It's not something that happens on the regular. You are right, criticism itself isn't bad. Criticism done by humans is often bad except in very narrow circumstances between parties whom share considerable culture and are capable of dialogue. Since that's so very hard to achieve on a public forum with no barrier to entry, I think better results spring from simply focusing on being positive in general.
