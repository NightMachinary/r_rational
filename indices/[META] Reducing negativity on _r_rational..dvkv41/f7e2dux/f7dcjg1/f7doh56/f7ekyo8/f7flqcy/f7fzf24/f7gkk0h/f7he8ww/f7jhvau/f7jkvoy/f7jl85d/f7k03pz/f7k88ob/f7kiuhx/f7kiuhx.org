Eh, I think the thing I mentioned happens so often with "resignations" in government and corporations that I'm not really sure why you'd be that skeptical of it. All it takes is a closed-door meeting or a phone call and them being allowed to say they chose a different path so everyone saves face.

I'm not saying I think for sure it happened mind you, but I'd put something like 5:1 odds on it if there was some way to know for sure.
