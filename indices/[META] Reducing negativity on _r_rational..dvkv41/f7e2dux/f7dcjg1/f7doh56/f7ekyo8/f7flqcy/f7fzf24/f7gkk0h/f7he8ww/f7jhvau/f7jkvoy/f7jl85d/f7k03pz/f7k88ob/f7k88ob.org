Nah, the guy they brought in for the redesign (who was involved in the Sonic character design for the past however many decades) already made a tweet saying explicitly that there is no conspiracy, and I'm sure that all the VFX artists who went into crunch to redo all the work they had to throw away probably don't appreciate the conspiracy idea. It's something that's probably not true, it just feels like it ought to be true due to cynicism. I mean, you can kinda tell that the crappy original design was rendered better than the redesign, but the redesign looks better for not being so well rendered because cartoons aren't meant to look photorealistic. I was just relaying a conspiracy because /you/ were relaying a conspiracy. I think the GoT guys really did just make an incredibly ridiculous decision.
