  The only winning strategy is not to play.

This seems /way/ too similar to a sentiment of "give up on something because it's hard," to me. It makes sense to adopt this strategy on literal MAD scenarios, but I would not want to live in a world where everyone just gave up on there ever being high quality mass-media productions of any kind, and people just default to silo'd communities that only feed each other uncritical positivity. It's low on the list of "things that make something a dystopia," but that's still fairly dystopian to me.

The only reason this community /exists/ is because the OP concentrated enough critical sentiment to create something that built on those criticisms and learned from them. Could HPMOR have been written with 0 canon bashing and been a better story? Probably, yeah. It also would turn less people off. Again, I'm for avoiding bashing and negativity.

But could people have /discussed/ HPMOR and similarly rationalized fanfiction without acknowledging any criticism of canons, and the general trends in fiction that mark this genre's ideal distinctions? Color me skeptical.
