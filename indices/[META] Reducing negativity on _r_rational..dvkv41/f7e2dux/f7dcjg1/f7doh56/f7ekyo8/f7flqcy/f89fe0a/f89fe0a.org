  Instead we live in a world where people call their likes "super dumb" and "bullshit" in public places. Could you not have been informed about this in a neutral way that doesn't pour negativity on others who do enjoy it nevertheless?

I think depending on how stuff is said I tend to pick up if the person who said it thinks along the same lines as me or not. If they don't, then it's likely that their opinion isn't much relevant to my tastes. If they do, then it is. Calling something "bullshit" isn't all that serious, come on.
