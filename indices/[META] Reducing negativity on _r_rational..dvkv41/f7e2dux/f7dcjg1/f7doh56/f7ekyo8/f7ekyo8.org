  seem to me inherently contradictory and even stifling to a community of people who celebrate...

Negative criticism and identification are different things. I've seen multiple times in the comments here that without others' criticisms, one wouldn't be able to identify the "good" from the "bad", but that's an issue of identification is it not? With objective identification comes the ability for another to interpret and apply their own valences accordingly. For every person who is "helped" by the negative criticism because their valences align with the critic's, how many others are hurt? If instead the input is neutral for the sake of identification, nobody is hurt and yet still anyone interested in finding and consuming their interests is helped.

  "lol yeah that was super dumb"

  ...

  And despite me feeling like this is one of the few communities I can get such perspectives in, even other people from in this community who have liked the book didn't warn me about that issue. Every time I had seen the book come up it was still praised without criticism. So I think we're not yet at a point where things are being too heavily criticized

  ...

  ....more of the same bullshit

And yet, there are probably other people that liked that thing! Maybe even *most* people who consumed that work. Why couldn't they like that thing and you like your things? Instead we live in a world where people call their likes "super dumb" and "bullshit" in public places. Could you not have been informed about this in a neutral way that doesn't pour negativity on others who do enjoy it nevertheless? Although nobody "warned" you, if we lived in a world more like what OP is suggesting, chances are we'd have better ways of positively selecting for things we like.

I don't know what the thing is since we're speaking abstractly, but I don't see why you couldn't have been informed via neutral identification ("constructive criticism") in one of those threads. "I really liked <art>, especially it's treatment of Y and Z. Note the author uses M to advance blah blah blah which made me feel like the integrity of Y was weakened if their goal was to engender feelings of A." Or you could have been that person that "saved" others like you who didn't get a clear enough identification from the others praising the work being referenced.

I really like OP's stance and I'm having fun applying it to more than just here. It's challenging to imagine how our communications and workflows would differ from what they are today, but I think the long term effects of leaning positive, sharing identification work neutrally, and nullifying negativity would be quite magical in comparison to the status quo. I truly believe there would be a lot more great art as well because so many fewer people would be afraid of putting themselves out there. Currently there are wolves everywhere, both within and without any given tribe.
