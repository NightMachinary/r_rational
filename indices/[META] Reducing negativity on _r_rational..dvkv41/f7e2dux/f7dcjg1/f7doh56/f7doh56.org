Ergh. I want to praise this for the direction it pumps in while still pointing out that, internally, a lot of its maxims seem to me inherently contradictory and even stifling to a community of people who celebrate writing fiction-that-tries-to-do-something-demonstrably-different-than-other-fiction-with-regards-to-writing-smarter-characters-and-consistent-worlds/magic-and-so-on.

Whether we call that "rational fiction" or stories that fall particularly far from that ideal "irrational fiction" is less relevant to me than that this community continues to be one that facilitates the creation of this kind of fiction by /holding each other to a standard,/ loose as it may sometimes be.

I think it's really bad for people to be uncharitable, to presume beliefs about an author, to criticize without careful thought. It would be good if people did those things less.

But I don't know how often that happens in [[/r/rational]] compared to people just pointing out the things that they don't like about a story (stating it as such) or criticizing the aspects of a story that don't fall under [[/r/rational]]'s criteria. Usually when the uncharitable or mean stuff is done I see it being downvoted. But it seems to me that you are actually pointing just as much at the discussion of a story's flaws, at /public criticism as a whole,/ justified or otherwise, as you are just being mean or uncharitable.

I recently read a fairly famous book by a fairly beloved author. I have heard nothing but good things about it beforehand, and while I've been burned by the author before, I gave it a chance. And it contained absolutely the most infuriating bit of contrived tension and "what a twist!" bullshit I've seen in years.

And no one warned me of this. Until I ranted about the plot point on the discord, after which a few people were like "Oh that? lol yeah that was super dumb" I had no idea that anyone else might have picked up on it.

And despite me feeling like this is one of the few communities I can get such perspectives in, even other people from in this community who have liked the book didn't warn me about that issue. Every time I had seen the book come up it was still praised without criticism. So I think we're not yet at a point where things are being too heavily criticized.

I don't know if I would have avoided reading the book if I'd known ahead of time, or if I'd regret that on net: the sequels get better but still contain the seeds for more of the same bullshit, so we'll see. But I do not want to live in a world where people are afraid of pointing out stuff like that because it's too close to yucking other people's yums. I agree with not telling someone who liked a thing that they were WRONG to like a thing, but my experience so far has been that people in [[/r/rational]] do a good job of criticizing what THEY dislike about a thing without doing that.

So yeah. +1 to "don't be a dick," but my take is more "gatekeeping and criticism can be good when you're not a dick about it." I don't know if that's a realistic ideal to try and propagate without it just devolving into sneerclub, maybe I'm just not seeing the threads where all the negativity is happening. I'll try to keep an eye out for that more.
