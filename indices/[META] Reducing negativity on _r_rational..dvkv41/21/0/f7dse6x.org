  Overall, this feels like a very wordy rephrasing of the "Just turn your brain off" mentality

Not your whole brain. Just the part that feels good about showing off how smart you are by explaining how terrible everything is.

Just like, when constructing a diet, you don't want to turn off your entire palate, you just want to learn not to listen to the part that wants to eat infinite doritos and gummi bears.
