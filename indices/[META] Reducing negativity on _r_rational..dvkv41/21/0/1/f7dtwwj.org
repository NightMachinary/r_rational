What sort of rational-minded person would /actively desire/ to recreationally consume /gummi bears?/ They're like the worst food-like product, a thing you consume only out of necessity because they happen to be a relatively decent compromise between cost and simplicity as a medium of CBD delivery?

Edit: I've realized that the wording of this comment might make it appear to be some sort of exaggerated food analogy and that in that light it could be interpreted as an attempt at /poking/ one side or the other of this issue, and I'm going to bed and don't want to wake up to any angry comments, so I want to clarify that - while I really /do/ just legitimately /hate/ the very gumminess of gummi candy - I do not think that someone enjoying gumminess as a texture means anything about them as a person. The wording I used was just an instinctive tendency toward hyperbole because I personally find treating trivial issues with unwarranted seriousness to be amusing, I do not actually believe that you aren't rational if you enjoy friggin gummi bears.
