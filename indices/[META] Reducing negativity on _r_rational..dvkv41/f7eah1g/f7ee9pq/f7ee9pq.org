It's gaming jargon. SAN is shorthand for sanity in some games and tabletop roleplaying systems, particularly ones related to Call of Cthulhu (the tabletop roleplaying system) where witnessing horror can cause your sanity score to be reduced. I think in this case it's specifically calling back to the passive drain of witnessing an eldritch creature, to claim being in the presence of negativity subtly harms us.
