I find reasonable negativity valuable. I feel the internet is overflowing with empty positivity already, as weird as it souds. For example, most books on Goodreads are within .2 points from four stars, and the published authors are wont to indiscriminately praise each other's works and never say anything bad. Anyone can like anything for any reason, and even the people who appear most similar to me often turn out to have vastly different tastes in what's sufficiently cool to look past the flaws. The variety of perspectives when it comes to recommendations, both positive corroborations and negative counters, "flesh out" a recommendation, as opposed to being a meaningless signal boost "I liked a thing, it's a cool thing".
