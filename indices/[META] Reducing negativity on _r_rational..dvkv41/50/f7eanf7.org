Overall I'm really eager about this proposal. I agree with others that I don't want to lose critical comments, but this post hits the right spot IMO. I do have a bit of disagreement with this one thing, though:

#+begin_quote
  then just link them to this post, and maybe downvote the original comment
#+end_quote

From what I can tell personally, downvoting---particularly downvoting below 1---is generally just a negative impact thing. It pretty much never maker conversations better, and it's unhealthy both for the receiver and as a mode of thought to be doing with any regularity. There's also [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1429][this one study I would not promise is accurate]]. If a post is bad enough to go below 1, you should probably just report it instead.
