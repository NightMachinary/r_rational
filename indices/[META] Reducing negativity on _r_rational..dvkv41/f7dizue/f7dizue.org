This is a bizarre policy proposal. Why do you think policing negative feedback is something that has any place on a forum for posting literature? Let's go down the list:

- Slap not the happy

This is assuming that discussing the negative points of a story is inherently "sad", which I can personally say is bunk. Please don't interfere with my happiness in my experience of critiquing stories :(

- Art runs on positive vitamins

In my own lurking at /r/r, I don't see anyone saying this. I think it's a pretty basic theory of literary critique to accept strange premises as they are and consider instead their internal consistency and realism, and it's one that gets followed here.

- 'Rational X' is an idea for a new story, not a criticism of an old story.

This is literally just a form of /ad hominem/, or more loosely, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergo_decedo][/ergo decedo/]].

+* Criticism easily goes wrong.+

I'm not a math-y kind of guy so i'm not gonna try to read this part.

- Negativity deals SAN damage.

Half of these examples are entirely tangential to the point you're making. Derailing threads to talk about a part of a story you didn't like is undesirable and completely separate from the solution of censoring that kind of talk entirely. Downvoting a previously-upped recommendation post provides zero "warning" against it, since reddit doesn't display up/down ratios of comments. Replies are the only way to do so.

I find it just slightly ironic that you say "hypersensitivity is unhealthy" and then apply it to scold readers who don't like a story. Is it not unhealthy to propose that authors live in a positivity hugbox? Lastly, the point about "stop reading things you don't like" is actually entirely in-line with a pro-negativity stance. If someone replies to a story rec that they stopped liking such-and-such story because of X, that is entirely useful data for both authors and potential readers to judge why one story is more popular than another.

- Say not irrationalfic.

One-word criticisms are generally not useful, I agree. But this is not something that can only be "fixed" by bringing down the banhammer on negativity as a whole, but encouraging it to be more thought out.

Overall, this feels like a very wordy rephrasing of the "Just turn your brain off" mentality, and I'm not seeing any real improvements on the arguments for it since I last saw it brought up. Free discussion is good, criticism can lead to a more nuanced understanding of a work. If someone doesn't their engagement of a work "ruined" by someone replying to them with bad things, it is as easy as not engaging.
