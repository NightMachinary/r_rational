Oh but the woosh was like specifically because the original comment I made included a longwinded explanation of how I wasn't doing the thing ironically because I recognized that it might look like I was doing the thing ironically.

And if I'm misreading, and you're saying "sugar products are capable of triggering the brain pleasingly" is the thing, like, idk what to tell ya, bruh. I swing strongly towards chocolate and chocolate-based cookies/candies/pies/cakes, and I wouldn't really even call chocolate-based candy "candy" I'd call it "chocolate" or "chocolates." But it does the same thing as /candy/ candies, which I guess are based around artificial fruit flavor? It's all sugar that triggers brain pleasure. Even though I swing strongly away from fruit-based candies, I have nothing against triggering brain pleasure via sugar.
