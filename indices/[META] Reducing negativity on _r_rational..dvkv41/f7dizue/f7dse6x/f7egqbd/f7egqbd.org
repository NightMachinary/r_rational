I dunno man, seemed a lot more to me that this was more in line with “turn your brain off to the bad things of a story so everyone can enjoy the good things! :D”

The whole section about there being enough sadness in the world so don't talk about things that could make readers sad, or authors sad seems pretty clear that there would be no negativity allowed by default. Sure, he tries to hedge that claim with “there wouldn't be no negativity allowed period! It can be useful for brainstorming!” but that just makes it more obvious that this would create Negative Speech Zones /a la/ the free speech zones of college campuses, which is a bullshit way to run a forum.

I mean really, describing a comment section as a “public commons that anyone can burn” by saying you didn't like a story. This is disingenuous at best and hilariously overdramatic.

To extend your analogy, stories (pre-constructed diets) in general contain some amount of various healthy greens and nuts and such, and some junk like Doritos and gummy bears. While it is certainly important to look at the nice parts of the diet when discussing or recommending one to your friends, talking solely about the good parts of the diet and none of the bad is going to give an inaccurate view of how the diet actually is.

/You are making a map that does not match the territory,/ as some people are oft to say. If someone really hates Doritos then you are doing a disservice by not mentioning a diet that has a lot of them (akin to the eternal “beware, extreme BDSM/sexual assault inside” warning for Time Braid).
