I find the existence of this post, and the subsequent general approval from other users, /extremely/ surprising, since I've always viewed [[/r/rational][r/rational]] as /too/ nice and /not elitist/harsh/gatekeeping enough/. Like, the sheer rarity of clear-cut, intentionally rational fiction (not to even speak about rationalist fiction) is so great that any community based upon enjoying it /must/ have higher standards or otherwise it will eventually either a) die off, or b) become flooded by stuff that is less and less plentiful in the 'rational' characteristics, eventually turning into just another vaguely 'dark/serious/""intelligent"" fiction' recommendation group. People really shame and sneer on gatekeeping (which, to be fair, is a bad thing much of the time), but I've also seen [[https://i.imgur.com/sdOkUVr.jpg][this]] happen /many/ times before. And really, I would say that it's already kinda happening here.

I agree with "let everyone enjoy whatever" completely and I can kinda get the "more members of X means more content that X likes", except that writing rational fiction is too difficult for that to scale in our favor and there are already many communities with stories with subtler rational elements (LitRPG, HFY, and so on), so there's no /need/ to make [[/r/rational][r/rational]] more open if people are satisfied with those.

What I mean to say is, I agree with the sentiment in the OP entirely, but I don't agree that it's universal; I don't see why it has to be enforced /here/ or in other highly-specific communities enjoying highly-specific types of content. If I posted this in [[/r/youtubehaiku][r/youtubehaiku]] and said that videos /over/ the length of 14 seconds are also fine and shouldn't be criticised (obviously true), wouldn't that be kinda missing the point?
