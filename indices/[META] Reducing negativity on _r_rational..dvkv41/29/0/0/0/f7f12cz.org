If you post a comic that includes a part about "females" ruining hobbies with their presence, and then say "what's in this comic is happening in this sub," it comes across like you're endorsing the sexism. Since that's not your intent, it might communicate your stance better in the future if you briefly described the idea you're going for in words rather than using the comic.
