yeah, TONS of negativity on the internet.

a lot of what OP is saying, boils down to 'dont be a dick'. if we have a large community with a vocal minority, that vocal minority can drive people away with their negativity and rudeness. and the people they attract are those who join in with that vocal minority.

when you only get negative replies, it makes you want to stop interacting with the community where people upvote the negative responses. I have already given up on trying to start intelligent discussion on the weekly posts.

If i try to discuss a setting with giant robots in it (battletech), and the only response i get is how much people hate giant robots... that means everyone ignored the 'game of thrones in space' part i was actually trying to discuss.
