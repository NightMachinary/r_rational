I feel like this is all WAY overengineered and in response to a single person rocking the boat ([[/u/Lightwavers]], right?) and their supporters.

All the controversy I've seen recently seems to originally emerge from their well-intentioned rating-snowballing links. Why not write a post about them or DM them instead? My apologies to Lightwavers for putting the spotlight on them, but I really believe [[/r/rational][r/rational]] was near perfection until they started adding more than links

Also, OP, I've seen irrationalfic used to describe fics like CORDYCEPS in a good way, haven't really seen it used otherwise.
