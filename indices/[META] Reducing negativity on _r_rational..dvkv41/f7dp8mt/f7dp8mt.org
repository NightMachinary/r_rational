Personally, I want people to tell me why they didn't like a story. I just don't want them to belittle the author or the fans.

If you tell me why you bounced off something, that helps me figure out whether I'd like or dislike it.

But if someone says bad things about the writer, or their fans, that doesn't help me have fun at all.

I have a limited patience for bad Chinese translations, I rarely want to read political screeds, and I only sometimes want to read kinky sex. But there's one thing I never enjoy reading: people hating on any of the three for existing in the first place.

Specific dislikes, good; judgmental rants, bad.

The critics I like best? The ones who say "I didn't like it, but there's this other work that I did like." Then I know where the critic is coming from, and maybe I got a new work to check out for myself!
