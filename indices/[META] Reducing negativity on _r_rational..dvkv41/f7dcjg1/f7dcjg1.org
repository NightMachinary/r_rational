As an overall approach to life, I very much agree with this post. However, as it pertains to this subreddit specifically, I will say that the positive or negative feedback about recommendations, specifically in the Monday recommendation thread, do help me make more informed decisions about what to read next. So I'd say that while slightly turning down the negativity may be a good thing, I'd hate to see one of the useful aspects of the subreddit that I appreciate be reduced because of that. Just my two cents.
