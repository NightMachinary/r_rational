I'll piggyback on this chain I'd like to support.

Anecdotally, I recently made my first post to this subreddit, a suggested reading. My motivation was to provide utility and engage with the community.

The immediate downvotes were not so frustrating, it was the total silence. As per the section /"Negativity deals SAN damage"/, this was the right way of agreeably disagreeing with my post.

:(

I had to address the situation before someone spoke up, from which a conversation finally formed, and in which I posted some embarrassing rants.^{it was an honest expression of my desire to attempt to communicate}

While the silent downvotes served one purpose, metadataless integers measuring the validity of my post, the lack of tangible feedback rendered them useless to my personal growth. *Furthermore*, I propose that a comment expressing why the suggestion was unappealing provided more utility to the community than all of the downvotes.

In conclusion, and keeping in mind that this is a niche of the internet with a focus on critical thinking, I find that criticism and negative feedback plays an important role in subreddit discussions, and should not be replaced by downvotes. The online community site Tildes' design document provides a rationale for removing downvotes [[https://docs.tildes.net/philosophy/site-design][here]], and generally strikes me as an ideal home for [[/r/rational][r/rational]] if the community ever migrates away from reddit.

As expressed by [[/u/Ozryela][u/Ozryela]], the same argument can be made for positive feedback over upvotes. From a broader perspective, higher quality feedback in general should be prioritized, and learned perhaps through exemplary feedback promoted by the community.
