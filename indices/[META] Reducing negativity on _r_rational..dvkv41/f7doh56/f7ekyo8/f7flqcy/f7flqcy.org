  Negative criticism and identification are different things.
#+end_quote

I see the OP as explicitly calling out "identification of things the person does not like" as similar enough to negative criticism as to be discouraged. I don't think there is a reasonable case yet made about how we can reliably distinguish these things.

This example:

#+begin_quote
  I really liked <art>, especially it's treatment of Y and Z. Note the author uses M to advance blah blah blah which made me feel like the integrity of Y was weakened if their goal was to engender feelings of A.
#+end_quote

Is a good effort, but I can still see people treating this as slapping the happy and injecting negativity in the proposed cultural norm.

#+begin_quote
  And yet, there are probably other people that liked that thing! Maybe even most people who consumed that work. Why couldn't they like that thing and you like your things?
#+end_quote

If I can ask this of you, please don't presume that I don't understand the difference between "taste" and objectively bad writing? It's one thing to dislike something someone else likes, and it's another for a writer to /write badly./ To "cheat," in a sense. I didn't explain the example because I didn't want to spoil things without warning, but I'm happy to go into specifics if this is a crux for you. To me this reads like "And yet there are probably other people who liked the way characters just teleported to wherever they needed to be without explanation in Game of Thrones later seasons!" If I'm not allowed to call that bullshit because some people enjoy things like that, then I feel like we're genuinely stifling criticism and making art worse, and not just letting people enjoy what they enjoy.

#+begin_quote
  Instead we live in a world where people call their likes "super dumb" and "bullshit" in public places. Could you not have been informed about this in a neutral way that doesn't pour negativity on others who do enjoy it nevertheless? Although nobody "warned" you, if we lived in a world more like what OP is suggesting, chances are we'd have better ways of positively selecting for things we like.
#+end_quote

I'm not just using these strong phrases without thought: I am explicitly pushing back against the idea that, /in this subreddit,/ there shouldn't be any sort of common understanding of what makes for /bad rational fiction./ If it's the words themselves that you object to, then maybe there's merit to refraining from using such words. But I still very much want to have a community that is comfortable calling out not just bad writing, but writing that violates the standards of the genre.
