  What good comes from dissecting objectively bad writing in a public, social setting if all we're doing is "calling out bullshit"? Virtue signalling?

I think criticism shapes culture. I think criticism helps art evolve and grow. I don't like this idea that all criticism is "negativity" and I think in the world we live in, without public criticism you just get worse art.

Look at the Sonic movie. They released a trailer with a model that many viewers thought was creepy and totally divorced from the source material. If everyone who saw that thought "well, whatever, I guess I just won't watch this movie and will keep my criticism to myself," then the movie would have come out and probably flopped.

Thanks to the massive negative reaction, the studio decided to redo the model completely. That criticism may have saved the movie.

There are plenty of examples of this. The later GoT seasons were so bad that there's a public meme now of the showrunners being bad at their job. They were given the new Star Wars trilogy, but that decision has apparently been reversed. Had everyone who hated the GoT seasons kept their criticism to themselves, that may not have happened. Maybe some people are upset about that, but clearly they're not AS upset as the people whose disappointment over what was done to GoT.

Look at what's happening in [[/r/pokemon]] right now. The company has made some objectively bad decisions for the new game coming out. It's causing a massive outcry and deep division in the community. Maybe it won't make any difference, or maybe it'll keep the franchise from descending into more and more bad decisions, because the sad reality is that there are actual gatekeepers for most media, and we cannot just create our own at a whim if we don't like what's currently being created.

Do I wish criticism could be levied without negativity? Yes. For sure. Let's reinforce that norm.

But do I think /criticism itself/ is bad? Not in the slightest. Speaking of mindfulness, the equivalent to me would be rejecting your own pain, rejecting your own anger, rejecting your own sadness, as "bad emotions." It's stifling, and stunting, and I don't think it actually leads to a better person or world.
