Methinks we still get max profit endeavors coming out of hollywood and similar. They'll always try to minimize inputs, including the need for creativity, for max returns. It's an abusive relationship in both directions. The only winning strategy is not to play. Go create new communities that are founded on better principles. OP is actually pretty well know for doing just that, I find him pretty believable in the Ray Dalio sense of the word.

As for this subreddit, yeah I've seen it some but it's not endemic. I wouldn't bet on that remaining the same as it grows however, unless it somehow becomes formalized into the culture, which brings us back to the OP.

Just looking at the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/dwd5lp/rtmk_erfworld_part_i_the_battle_for_gobwin_knob/][current top of Hot]] though, said OP recommended a work on the one hand, and then recommended not reading past part 1 on the other because the rest is "awful", "introduces characters I don't give a shit about" and it "slows down to a crawl... takes 80 pages to get through one goddamn door." Which has been upvoted (4) relative to the parent (1) which asked why not recommending past part 1. Maybe that will change as the day goes on, the absolute upvote numbers here are small. Funny enough, they then received a response that seems wholly relevant to Holm's Maxim.

  I didn't notice anything particularly bad but I guess it's just a matter of taste, none of these things were that big a deal to me because of what I was looking for in it but I see how those things could be a big issue with it to someone else.
