  So this is your own list of stories you consider to be good or bad?

Not quite so. It used to be only me, but now I have a process. First I start with personal experience or a third party claim. Then I investigate a text as objectively as possible, trying not to consider the genre, themes, likeableness, or other factors that aren't specifically about the quality of a story. Then I share the title, and nothing but the title, with two friends who are voracious readers and ask their opinions of the quality of the title in question. If all three of us agree that the title is of low quality, I search out third party comments/reviews and collect them, then apply a low quality tag to the work in question that links to the collection of comments/reviews.

Do note that this process doesn't account for the rare titles that may grow to be quality works later on. Often we stop reading after the first chapter.

I and another user in this comment section believe that this action is responsible, at least in part, for this post.
