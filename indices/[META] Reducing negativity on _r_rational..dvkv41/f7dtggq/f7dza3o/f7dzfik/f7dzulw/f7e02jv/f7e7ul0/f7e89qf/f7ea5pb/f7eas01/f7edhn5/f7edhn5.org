It's a long time ago that I read A Hero's War. It's the story about a guy single-handedly starting the industrial revolution right? I thought the story was too over-the-top, the main character is way too perfect. But I think the world building and prose were decent. Never finished it though, so can't say anything about the overall narrative.

I think I don't agree with your point about wanting to look at individual works and not comparing two works with each other. Relative estimates are much easier than absolute estimates. "X is a good story" doesn't say much, but "X is better then Y" says a lot more. On IMDB a rating of 8 does not say much about whether I'll enjoy the film, but if very similar films have ratings of 7 and 8, then the latter is almost certainly better, and if I enjoyed the former I will almost certainly enjoy the latter.

The reason I didn't say too much about Worth the Candle was that I didn't want to turn this debate into a "Ozryela rants about Worth the Candle for 300 pages". But to quickly summarize (based on the first 50 or so chapters): - The story is way too long. It's a million words and counting. - The narrative is bad. The main character has almost no agency, the plot keeps happening despite him not because of him, and in many battles he plays almost no role. There also does not seem to be any overarching story or main villain or anything like that. They have a vaguely defined goal of finding someone (Uther), but are doing nothing to further this goal, and they don't even have the beginnings of a plan on how to do it. - The main character is very unlikable. He's arrogant, cares very little about others, and is a complete dick to his companions. - The characterization is inconsistent. Characters basically behave how the plot wants them to behave. At some points things are outright stated by author fiat that completely contradict earlier events. For example at one point the MC looks into the soul of one of his companions and finds that the top 5 things she cares about are herself, her freedom, power, and two other similar things I forgot. Yet earlier in the story she allows herself to be taken prisoner and most likely killed to safe her friends. So the author is just informing us about character traits (remember, always tell, don't show!) that completely contradict earlier behavior. - The narrative itself is inconsistent, with setups made that are abandoned or contradicted. - The writer keeps putting in flashbacks to earth, which are fine, but they are often in weird places, or come at a weird timing, breaking the flow of the story or setting up / foreshadowing things after they have already happened.

I'll stop here. I've already broken the spirit of this thread badly enough with this rant :). But I will add that I'm not the only one thinking some of these things. A surprisingly high percentage of the comments on the story are people asking "Is the main character supposed to be unlikable?".
