Community voting, now that's an idea. What happens with the low quality tags is entirely dependent upon the votes in [[https://redd.it/dvoq4i][this poll]] but if someone challenges a tag I could then set up a poll for it...

Actually, that would be subject to all sorts of bias, incentivizing those who just enjoy the story but aren't considering actual quality to participate, while people who just don't care about registering their opinion or who see it, don't like it, and move on would fail to see the poll.

The goal of the tag is to save people time, since time is invaluable. Earlier you said you violently disagreed the tag's application in some places---would you mind finding an example and explain how the quality actually isn't subpar? If the process is flawed than it would indeed do more harm than good.
