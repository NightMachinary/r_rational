  Worth the Candle, Worm? Really? How does that rhyme? The main criticism of Wheel of Time is that it's way too long-winded, but worm is at least as worse in that regard. In fact WoT and Worm are very similar in my opinion, in that they are both have very good and interesting world building, very interesting characters, and competent prose, but they just go on and on and on forever. And I probably shouldn't say too much about Worth the Candle in polite company, but how it doesn't get a low quality tag is beyond me.

Your criticism of Worth the Candle is strange enough that I almost believe you're a troll. In an effort to maintain good faith, I will assume whatever gripe you have with the title makes sense. However, be aware that despite your personal disapproval of WtC and Worm, the writing flows well and the characters are well fleshed-out for both novels. In other words, the positives /massively/ outweigh the flaws, and the reverse is the case for A Hero's War. I'm not going to accept any argument that is essentially "you thought /this/ was good but not /that/?" Please make your case about a specific work itself.

However, while A Hero's War is just /bad/, you do have a point in regard to the WoT series. The tag was applied to that work before my system was worked out, so I'm going to remove the low quality tag attached to it.

Now as to your last paragraph, the simple truth is that I haven't added some of them yet. Of the ones in my list, HPMOR is /deeply/ divisive, so I've held off on adding an endorsement to it. The main character of Luminosity is similar enough to that of HPMOR that the same logic holds true, but The Waves Arisen and Friendship is Optimal do indeed deserve the endorsement, and that is being presently corrected.
