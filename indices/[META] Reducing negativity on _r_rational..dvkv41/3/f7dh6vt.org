This post kinda touches on one of my biggest irritations in rationalsphere relating to the use of the word "rational" or "rationalist" to describe the culture in general. The "rational/irrational" division is hard to avoid simply as a categorization scheme. I don't have any better alternative names and the cultural momentum behind "rational" is strong enough at this point I don't think it would matter if I did. But getting a group of people who enjoy something called "rational fiction" to not call things they don't like "/ir/rational fiction" feels tricky in an unstable-equilibrium sort of way.

Maybe this post could be described as, "criticism tends to skew negative so try to adopt a moderate positivity bias to counteract that when writing critique"? Good negative criticism is important, especially to newer authors but framing the delivery can make a /huge/ difference. Even just, "I found this plot point confusing and frustrating" instead of "this plot point was poorly written/bad"? I'm not sure how far to go in the "reduce negativity" direction but I feel like the answer is somewhere between "whatever is intuitive" and "all the way/eliminate all negativity".

Finally,

  If I was doing HPMOR over again, I would try to send clear(er) signals starting from page one that HPMOR was not meant as a delicious takedown of everything Rowling did wrong.

Personally, I am glad you wrote it as you did. There is a particular sort of person who benefits from a story like HPMOR, someone who reads the first few chapters and is a bit confused why everyone thinks Harry is being so ridiculous, who is pretty sure Professor Quirrel is the Best Teacher Ever, and who loves laughing about snitches and gold exchange rates. Perhaps the negativity turned some people off and perhaps others took exactly the wrong lesson about cynicism (I've no idea how one would go about comparing the relative sizes of the population here) but I find a lot of value in the story as it stands.
