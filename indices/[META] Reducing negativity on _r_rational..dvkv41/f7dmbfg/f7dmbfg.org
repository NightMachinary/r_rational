I like this post. I think it's important as a writing community to consider how we give and receive criticism. Every author needs to hear it, and readers need it too, but in what manner is the question.

This sub in particular is rather comfortable with giving and receiving harsh criticism. It isn't like that on all writing forums. Some are much more positive in general, and geared more towards moral support than actually improving writing.

I will say, however, that this sub does tend towards being negative and highly critical, even when they LIKE something. This can give an author (and potential readers) the opinion you don't like the story when it's the opposite. I'm all for being rational in critiques, but learning to encourage others is a skill I think we could improve upon.

Since writers thrive on positive feedback, one way to do that is the "feedback sandwich." It's basically like this:

State something you liked--"I read your story and really enjoyed the characterizations"

State one thing you'd like to improve--"I don't like how things turned out with the main character"

Restate something you liked "All in all, it's a good story, I just have a few questions about the ending."

It might seem simple, but it goes a long way in showing respect to the author and the readers who enjoyed a story. It can also open up a dialogue that answers questions. I see a lot of people in the comments who don't want to tone down their use of criticism. Then don't--just remember to provide positive feedback also.
