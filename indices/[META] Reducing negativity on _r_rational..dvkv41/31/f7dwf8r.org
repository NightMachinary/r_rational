  Credibly helpful criticism should be delivered in private.

So if I and others disagree with or want to improve a post (including this one?) I should dm it instead?

So the only comments on something are supportive?

By your own post no one can comment publicly not supporting your position.

Also this seems you assume re the enjoyment people get from making critical comments, being criticised and reading other criticisms. The absolute dearth of video essays which are almost attack pieces on certain media should demonstrate that a significant amount of people enjoy fixing up by way of removing the bad stuff not adding good stuff. So I don't see why you can sourcelessly state other people don't enjoy it around you. Any studies on net happiness?

If someone wants to post a deconstruction of Banks who is suffering there? Even if they're mean about the original are we meant to consider the possibility of fans being upset for someone being snide towards a work they like? I don't know if hpmor would have been as enjoyable if it was carefully stepping around every possible insult it could conceivably make.

Anyway even if we take what you say to be true it seems that the answer is zero criticism, not criticise in private. There can be no justification for negative comments if we assume the average writer is demotivated and suffers from them. Even if such a comment would improve the work who cares about the work quality of some fun writing over happiness? If that's the scenario we might as well do away with comments.

Still there's little harm in being nice so sign every post with a heart. â™¥
