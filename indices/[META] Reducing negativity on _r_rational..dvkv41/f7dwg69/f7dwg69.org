One personal takeaway I got from Umineko when I read it all those years ago was: /If there is no cognitive truth value to the proposition, you should believe whatever makes you happy/. Fiction necessarily contains no cognitively meaningful statements, because it is fiction. It has other kinds of meaning though; emotional, religious, poetic, thematic, or even just entertainment meaning. But those kinds of meaning are not subject to any kind of positivist framework.

What is subject to such a framework is the objective observation that someone /did/ or /does/ find emotional, or poetic, or thematic, and so on, meaning in the fiction. Trying to argue against that is a futile attempt at denying reality. It has always surprised me how frequently and fervently people wish to externalise and objectify the personal meanings they experience; for some reason it isn't enough just to like something, for some reason we have to project that onto the universe.

Evidence of other meanings obscures our projection, and thereby feels like an implicit attack on /our/ meaning, thus negativity. The answer is to simply recognise that projection is a sin, and that you need to throw in the rubbish along with splitting.

If you want to project, at least come up with a complete and consistent theory of the mind first. Then you can tell me about exactly how the colors on the screen, as received by your eyes and transmitted to your brain, caused a peculiar change in the voltage gradients leading to the sensation of catharsis.
