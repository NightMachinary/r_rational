I'm fine with the "don't be a dick" part.

But I'm strongly against the implication that I shouldn't tell others why I dislike a story, and that others should also not tell me why they dislike a story.

A simple example would be the MC being switched to someone else 70 chapters in. I'm not against multi-MC stories, but I prefer that the majority of the MCs get introduced within the first 10 to 15 chapters. So I appreciate being told that the MC of the story changes.

Another example would be a comedy I'm reading turns into a dark tragedy halfway in. I read my comedies for a purpose, and I don't want them to change into something else. So I'd be pissed if censorship prevents me from discovering something important like that.
