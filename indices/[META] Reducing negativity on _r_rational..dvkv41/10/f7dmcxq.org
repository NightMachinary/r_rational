Some of the following is tangential but I'm not sure how much of it, so I'm just leaving it all in.

I definitely agree when it's something like "this kind of thing is cool" or "I don't like this kind of thing, regardless of how well-crafted it is" but I don't agree if it's "this story is well-crafted in this particular way" or "this is a plot hole". If I like something I believe it is able to withstand criticism, and accepting and learning more about its weaknesses makes genuine appreciate better because if you like something without needing to shield your eyes from the bad parts then you like it more than if you don't. If you will dislike something because of a certain criticism then the criticism must contain something you care about, right? Isn't it better to be informed about the things you care about?

I tend to think on the subreddit specifically that it's essentially impossible to enforce the clear separation of "here's a criticism" and "people shouldn't like this". Maybe it's worth the effort to try anyway.

I think that negative reviews are useful because their absence in a popular thread is evidence that it's good. If there's a culture against such comments then it makes that evidence weaker.

For example, I often anti-recommend Homestuck when it comes up because I believe it is deceitfully good, that it looks good at first and gradually becomes a mess that I didn't like at all and I feel my time was wasted and I certainly would have wanted someone to warn me about it before I started. In the same way that it is useful for people to positively recommend things it is useful for people to negatively recommend them.

It's certainly good to discuss the appropriateness of stories to this forum, the extent to which they are rational, but it's also good to discuss their merit in other ways, because people's interests are not so chaotic that other people's reviews are useless, especially conditioned on being subscribed here.

  It's fun to enjoy something in public without feeling ashamed of yourself. If you're part of Generation Z, you may have never known this feeling, but trust me, it's fun! But most people's enjoyment is fragile enough that anyone present effectively has a veto - a punishment button that not only smashes the smile, but conditions that person not to smile again where anyone can see them. In this sense we are all in a multi-party prisoner's dilemma, a public commons that anyone can burn. But even if somebody defects and tries to kill a smile, the situation may not be beyond repair; a harsh reply will have less smile-prevention power if the original comment is upvoted to 7 and the harsh reply downvoted to -3. If we all contribute to that, maybe you'll be able to be publicly happy too! Public enjoyment is a public good.

I think this is the strongest counterpoint to what I'm saying. I'll have to think more about it. I /guess/ people unwittingly liking things against their own values could be a good thing. I have conflicting intuitions about that.
