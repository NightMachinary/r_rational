IMHO the important thing is not to fall into that very common trend of implying that people who like something you don't are either stupid or immoral because of it. That is what really gets people pissed off, and for good reason, because it's really getting up and personal over something relatively trivial.

I think criticism shouldn't be withheld too much. Too many communities of creatives just turn into self-congratulating bubbles where everyone just pats each other's back in the hope that they'll be patted in return when they do something. I get why that might be pleasant, but it's also kinda pointless and tends to inflate too much people's sense of their own ability - then as soon as they step out they're up for a bitter disappointment. So I'd rather people don't feel /too/ worried about offending with their criticism, and the subjects of said criticism take it gracefully, than the opposite.
