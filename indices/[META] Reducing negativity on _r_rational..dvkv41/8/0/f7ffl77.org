  .. besides missing the entire concept of the Cool Stuff Theory of Literature
#+end_quote

You've introduced that theory only several paragraphs higher, haven't proven it yourself to a sufficient degree, and now are already trying to use it as a basis for validating other points you make.

#+begin_quote
  The world already contains a sufficient quantity of sadness. If an artistic experience is making somebody happy, you should not be trying to interfere with their happiness under a supermajority of ordinary circumstances.
#+end_quote

This feels to me like one of those arguments that are so bad that one doesn't even know where to start with the counter-arguments against it. I'll try: 1) the statement made in these two sentences sounds technically so vague that at face value doesn't even have anything to do with the thread's subject matter. 2) If we assume that its intended meaning is "you should not criticise something if that something is making somebody happy", then I disagree because with a reasoning like that the recommendations-as-valuable-information would at best quickly and significantly drop in quality and at worst turn into noise.

#+begin_quote
  going around declaring that some other piece of work contains a flaw and is therefore "irrational"
#+end_quote

Definition of what is "rational" and what is not varies between different members of this community.

#+begin_quote
  The word 'rational' is properly used under very restrictive circumstances to refer to properties of general cognitive algorithms, not to particular acts or events.
#+end_quote

Words can have different meanings in different contexts and subcultures. Clearly in this subreddit / subculture "rational" has ended up acquiring a meaning to depict a specific literary genre. There is nothing "improper" about using that word to convey that meaning. Although, different users of this sub do have different definitions of what a "rational" story is and is not, and there can often arise miscommunications when they use the same word to mean different things. But that's a problem for another discussion.

#+begin_quote
  when public criticism runs amok, people end up living in a mental world where it's low-status and a sign of vulnerability to admit you enjoyed something.
#+end_quote

That conclusion doesn't follow from that premise at all.

#+begin_quote
  I personally just get the shivers (not good shivers, metal-screeching-on-a-blackboard shivers) almost every time I hear somebody declare that something is 'irrational'.
#+end_quote

Again, that's on you. And it's not an objectively made argument.

#+begin_quote
  It's fun to enjoy something in public without feeling ashamed of yourself.
#+end_quote

1) Just because "it's fun" isn't an argument in this case. As an example, meme-posting is fun for meme-posters. Meme-posting still creates noise and has to be regulated in quality subreddits. 2) Nobody's saying anything about enjoying the stories or even doing that in public. If someone's feeling ashamed from others criticising the story they like, that's on them.

#+begin_quote
  But most people's enjoyment is fragile enough that anyone present effectively has a veto - a punishment button that not only smashes the smile, but conditions that person not to smile again where anyone can see them.
#+end_quote

This is a bad argument. If we prioritised "fragile enjoyment" of every person out there over content and discussion quality, the sub's content would turn into meaningless (even if "positive" and "fun") noise.

#+begin_quote
  a harsh reply will have less smile-prevention power if the original comment is upvoted to 7 and the harsh reply downvoted to -3.
#+end_quote

And now you're encouraging to downvote comments that would be perceived as negative based on your previous bad argument. Bad arguments / replies, unless they are /really/ bad, should be criticised as bad, not downvote-brigadded.

#+begin_quote
  If you are voluntarily having a non-gainful unpleasant experience, you should stop. .. The credo "Don't like, don't read" is simple and correct .. Don't like, stop reading.
#+end_quote

You are presenting your opinion as truth. As examples: someone can be both liking and disliking the same story, someone can be out of really-good things to read, someone could be reading a bad story just to be able to accurately criticise it, etc. Possible goals and motivations can be very different, and the credo you've mentioned didn't even consider them at all.

#+begin_quote
  To shake a finger and say, "Ah, but you see..." does not always make you look smart.
#+end_quote

You're assuming they're criticising it to look smart. Try to assume good faith instead of presenting an unsupported ad-hominem and moving on.

#+begin_quote
  It's so awful, in fact, that you probably don't want to hang out on any Reddits that think their purpose is to call out flaws in things.
#+end_quote

If you don't want to hang on reddits then just don't hang on reddits, instead of trying to convert the subs into facebook fan groups.

#+begin_quote
  If a comment somewhere seems to be written in clear ignorance of our bias toward people saying what they enjoyed, and is trying to counter that enjoyment by saying what should have been hated - then just link them to this post, and maybe downvote the original comment.
#+end_quote

Even in a hypothetical case of a subreddit rule being passed that would disallow taste-shaming, I think linking to this specific thread would've been a bad decision, because most of the arguments made in the OP-post are bad.

  when somebody says they enjoyed something, and you respond by telling them why they were wrong to enjoy it.
#+end_quote

I agree with this. With the provisions that criticisng that work in turn is not the same as telling them they were wrong to enjoy it --- especially when the discussion was happening in a recommendation thread.

  In a lot of cases it's just being used to mean, "Well, I thought that part of the story should've gone differently."
#+end_quote

I agree on these.

#+begin_quote
  we do not have solid information about what goes on inside of other people's heads .. please don't tell me what bad things the author was thinking unless the author plainly came out and said so. You're not an author telepath.
#+end_quote

I agree with this. Making baseless assumptions about others (including story writers) is not a nice thing to do. More than that, I'd argue that stories should be criticised as-is. What the author of the story has or has not done should /not/ be treated as relevant information or a valid point of criticism.

#+begin_quote
  The economy in xianxia worlds makes no sense, you say? Perhaps xianxia readers are not reading xianxia in order to get a vitamin of good economics.
#+end_quote

I agree that opinions like this can't count as valid points of criticism, but I disagree that users should be encouraged to not mention such opinions at all. It's better to have a warning that "economy in xianxia worlds makes no sense" than not, since for those readers who /are/ "reading xianxia in order to get a vitamin of good economics" such information will end up being very valuable and useful. I agree that it should be stressed by the reviewers that such opinions should not be treated as pieces of direct criticism.

#+begin_quote
  When tempted to go on angry rants in public about fiction you don't like, it would not do to overlook the larger context that your entire civilization is going mad with anger and despair, and you might have been infected.
#+end_quote

I don't get what this has to do anything with literary criticism. Unless you mean culture wars infecting things. In which case I agree that people should "self-scan" against such infections.

#+begin_quote
  Even if you are genuinely able to gain purely positive happiness from angry negativity without that poisoning you, other people around you are not having as much fun.
#+end_quote

You seem to be using negativity and criticism interchangeably (unless I am misunderstanding you). If you are not, than I agree that toxicity should also be self-censured and community-censured.

#+begin_quote
  "But I just meant to help the author by pointing out what they did wrong!" If you try delivering your critique to the author in private, they may find it much more credible that you meant only to help them, and weren't trying to gain status by pushing them down in public.
#+end_quote

My problem with this thread is for the attempt to censor negative story reviews. I don't want to address author-reader feedback one way or another. I'll just say that different authors may have opinions on this that may be different from yours, so you shouln't be speaking for them all.
