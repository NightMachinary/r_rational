I'll start by seconding the critiques other people have given. The ability to do this is one reason why "credibly helpful criticism" shouldn't only be transmitted privately. If I take my role as a critic seriously, but have no idea what others have said, then I have to bring up every possible point of criticism I can think of, even if the author has already heard it from someone else. Not only does this create an unnecessary burden on critics (whether criticism is solicited or not) it can also be tiresome for an author to read the same critique over and over again, all of which can be avoided if critique is offered publicly.

  Telepathic critics don't distinguish their observations from their inferences at all, let alone weigh alternative possibilities. Not as a matter of rationalfic, but as a matter of this being a literary subreddit at all, please don't tell me what bad things the author was thinking unless the author plainly came out and said so. You're not an author telepath.

This is fine, however...

  There may sometimes be a positive purpose for public criticism, but almost always that purpose is not purely trying to help the targets.

/You're not a critic telepath./ You do not get to request that critics assume good faith of authors while simultaneously advocating assuming bad faith of critics.

  If you're part of Generation Z, you may have never known this feeling, but trust me, it's fun! But most people's enjoyment is fragile enough that anyone present effectively has a veto - a punishment button that not only smashes the smile, but conditions that person not to smile again where anyone can see them.

This does not ring true to me and is probably unfalsifiable (not to mention needlessly condescending), and it weakens your argument. You could downgrade "most" to "some" and base your argument on empathy ("We have no way of knowing who these people are, so we should err on the side of caution!") rather than utilitarianism ("Odds are you'll hurt someone's feelings, so the safest choice is not to do it!") and it would still make your point.

  It is still true, in general, that it is possible to do even worse by feeling even more upset about it.

In general, criticism is not a product of anger, nor are people who offer criticism generally upset about the thing they're criticizing. I would argue that such a worldview is potentially far more mentally harmful to authors than whatever criticism they might receive.

Even it was and they are, what does "hypersensitivity" have to do with it? Hypersensitive to what, exactly? If something about a text bothers someone because they're "sensitive" to it (things that might be included in content warnings, for example), odds are they will follow your next piece of advice and simply stop reading.

Should people just surrender to the tides of their emotions and give up on trying to regulate them to some extent? No, of course not, and harassment is never okay. But even if some people /are/ upset about a text, framing it as simply "hypersensitivity" on the part of the audience absolves authors of any responsibility they might have.
