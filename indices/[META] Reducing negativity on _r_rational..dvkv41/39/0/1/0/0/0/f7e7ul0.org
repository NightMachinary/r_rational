Okay, I appreciate that you put in a lot of effort, but it still sounds like it's mostly your own opinion, or maybe the opinion of you and a few friends.

I think that's maybe a little bit at odds with the bot you have that automatically supplies links to stories whenever someone mentions them. Even if it's just your personal bot, it becomes an important part of the community, and this elevates it to a level of authority beyond just your personal opinions.

That bot is awesome, don't get me wrong. I love it. But how does the saying go again, 'with great power comes great responsibility'.

I would recommend maybe changing the the provided link to "Personal opinion: Low Quality" instead of just "Low Quality". Or alternatively try to get a community vote going on stories and provide that: "Community Rating: x out of 10".
