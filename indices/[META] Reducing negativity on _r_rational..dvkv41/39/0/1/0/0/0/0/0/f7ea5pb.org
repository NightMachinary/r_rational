  Community voting, now that's an idea. What happens with the low quality tags is entirely dependent upon the votes in this poll but if someone challenges a tag I could then set up a poll for it...

  Actually, that would be subject to all sorts of bias, incentivizing those who just enjoy the story but aren't considering actual quality to participate, while people who just don't care about registering their opinion or who see it, don't like it, and move on would fail to see the poll.

Yes, that is always a problem with those kind of polls. If something like this was set up some thought would have to go into how to do it. But even flawed ratings are often still useful - IMDB is a good example.

  Earlier you said you violently disagreed the tag's application in some places---would you mind finding an example and explain how the quality actually isn't subpar? If the process is flawed than it would indeed do more harm than good.

It's not so much the 'Low Quality' tags I disagreed with but some of the others. I've actually only read two stories you marked as low quality (A Hero's War up to chapter 100 or so, and all of Wheel of Time). Both of those stories have their issues, no disagreement there, but neither is terrible.

So ok, maybe you have really strict standards. But then I look at some of the stuff you marked as recommended. Worth the Candle, Worm? Really? How does that rhyme? The main criticism of Wheel of Time is that it's way too long-winded, but worm is at least as worse in that regard. In fact WoT and Worm are very similar in my opinion, in that they are both have very good and interesting world building, very interesting characters, and competent prose, but they just go on and on and on forever. And I probably shouldn't say too much about Worth the Candle in polite company, but how it doesn't get a low quality tag is beyond me.

Some of the most recommended stuff on this forum doesn't get a recommendation (HPMoR, Three Worlds Collide), or don't get mentioned at all (Luminosity, Pokemon: Origin of Species, The Waves Arisen, Friendship is Optimal).
