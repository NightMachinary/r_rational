    The narrative is bad. The main character has almost no agency, the plot keeps happening despite him not because of him, and in many battles he plays almost no role.

  Uh...

Not sure what you're trying to say here. If that's disagreement it's rather weak. And you really can't deny this point either. In the prologue it's fine, since the main character is new to the world and still getting to grip with his reality.

But then afterwards his companions keep doing all the planning and setting everything in motion. In the fight in the bathhouse the MC fights two mooks and then runs away (and that entire plot is then dropped and never mentioned again). The fight against the anti-magic-hound he only manages to get himself injured. The next confrontation the princess saves the party by giving herself up as prisoner. The plan to rescue the princess, and the necessary scouting etc, is then all done by his companions. He has zero input. In the actual fight to rescue her (against the gold mage) he's at best a minor distraction to the enemies. Next is the unicorn I think? Again his companions do all the planning and all the execution. The main character is so useless that he literally takes a break in the middle of combat to do some training. The next few subplots and fights are all similar, with the MC having very little input or influence on the result.

The only fight I remember where the main character actually wins the day is the one against the soul mage, and that one he only wins because the bad guy decides to pick up the idiot ball and literally walk into melee range while unarmed and unarmored.

  Okay, you seem to have a very specific view of what Worth the Candle is, and I doubt I'll be able to persuade you to change it. If I were to argue the point, I'd say most of the issues you list are simply not there

I'm certainly open to being persuaded. I'm not so arrogant that I think I can't misinterpret a story. Nor have I read the entire story, so maybe it does get better.

But I can say that you're not going to convince me by mere contradiction. I'm not sure how you can claim that the things I'm saying aren't there, considering I mentioned some very specific examples from the actual story.
