  On a subreddit level, if a new work is posted and I am looking for stuff to read, I may check out the comments. If someone in the comments mentions points A, B and C about the work that they really liked, this is information for me - it tells me what kind of things people like about this work. Now, on a subreddit like this, I can also rely on other people having broadly similar tastes to mine. If I then see a comment critiquing points A, B and C as a response, and the response seems coherent, I know that maybe the original commenter wasn't all that accurate. On the other hand, if I see no substantial critique to a positive post in a frequently-visited comment thread, then I know all those positive points are solid, because in the counterfactual world where there were factual points undermining the points A, B and C, someone similar to me would have already complained about them. Here, the culture of complaining about factual inaccuracies in comments directly affects the information about a book I get from reading some comments. That makes it easier for me to search for things I'll like, and I don't want this to go away.

Agreed. With how much time I have available to read, being able to better prioritize which stories I'm likely to enjoy most is already hard enough to do without removing extra information from discussions.

If that information constitutes a "sanity harm hazard," maybe we can instead push for a way to list all criticism of a posted story or discussion under its own thread, so people can just minimize the top-level comment that they would be grouped under without having to see them if they don't want to?
