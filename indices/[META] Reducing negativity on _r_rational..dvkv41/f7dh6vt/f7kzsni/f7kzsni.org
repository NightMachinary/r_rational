  If I was doing HPMOR over again, I would try to send clear(er) signals starting from page one that HPMOR was not meant as a delicious takedown of everything Rowling did wrong.

There could be value in both, but it seems like it might damage the "realism"/characterization, unless there was a substantial divergence.** (E.g. Voldemort being negative makes sense.* Voldemort not being negative would have been totally different! So yeah, more positivity might seem "more good", but HPMOR isn't just a story about people being perfect to begin with, and there's something to that.)

*Especially because of canon.

**Hufflepuff Harry? Different MC?
