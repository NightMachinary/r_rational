  I don't think there is a reasonable case yet made about how we can reliably distinguish these things....

  I can still see people treating this as slapping the happy and injecting negativity in the proposed cultural norm.

Fair enough. Though I do think it's entirely possible to bias ones communications in good faith such that shades of grey are likely to be received neutrally by others. (I suspect we don't disagree on this.)

  If I'm not allowed to call that bullshit because some people enjoy things like that, then I feel like we're genuinely stifling criticism and making art worse, and not just letting people enjoy what they enjoy.

  ...

  I still very much want to have a community that is comfortable calling out not just bad writing, but writing that violates the standards of the genre.

You're allowed to do whatever you want. I just think that OP's stance is more likely to lead to the health and growth of the art community. Your example is perfect: so the writers cheated in /GoT/? I was let down along with so many others, but that doesn't mean we ought to shit on the people who nevertheless still had fun. Maybe they're younger, maybe they're ignorant, whatever the case it's a better world if they can still enjoy what's essentially harmless art without having others suggesting their happiness is wrong. Very similar to the /LotR/ example. We're all better off in this case to just not give /GoT/ any more energy once it's clear it's gone downhill. All that bad publicity is still rewarding those writers for their choices, in a way. Couldn't that time and energy be spent on creating or consuming something better? What good comes from dissecting objectively bad writing in a public, social setting if all we're doing is "calling out bullshit"? Virtue signalling?

I think this is the core of OP's suggestions which is that all one need do is ignore the "bad" or the "wrong"---if the community acts via positively reinforced sharing and praising, all that junk will just get fade away like so many other creations, without damaging the creators any more than lack of praise and interest /will already do/. This is very similar to concepts in mindfulness meditation and therapy, where "negative" thoughts shouldn't be repressed or hated or called out if one wants to be rid of them. Let it come, let it be, let it go, and it's much less likely to come back.

Fostering the good with the very limited energy each of us has begets more good. And that includes coming up with a shared corpus of identification methods so that the sharing of information is efficient, everybody is finding and getting what they want. Negativity though, even within some narrowly defined arena like this subreddit... what's the point? I used to get bent out of shape and complain about shows where a character did things out of character to advance the plot. Now I overlook it if it was brief and forgivable, or stop watching if it's egregious. But I definitely don't go and sew negativity into the universe as a result. At most I'll give a downvote, but even that only if it's not out of my way.

Anyways, food for thought I hope. Even before OP's post, I was convinced philosophically of the wisdom of reducing negativity for health and profit, and instead focusing on the good. He just helped me better understand why in a new way. :)
