  Is {Sonic, GoT, Star Wars, Pokemon} fandoms being at war or those franchise's corporate handlers not eking out as much profit as they would be via better decisions a cultural reality worth defending? All the energy that pours into those franchises both positive and negative helps sustain what is otherwise not a vibrant expression of culture: sequel after sequel of the same stuff recycling different tired tropes.

My point is that without public criticism, the recycling of tired tropes and minimum-effort-for-maximum-profit is exactly what you get. I'm not sure how you see the causality lines going the other way?

  Since that's so very hard to achieve on a public forum with no barrier to entry, I think better results spring from simply focusing on being positive in general.

Do you think /this/ community is bad at criticism-without-negativity? I could be convinced I'm failing to see a real problem if enough people point it out, but if this is a case of "criticism is so bad everywhere, I just don't want to see any more of it in this community" that feels to me like a different claim and not a fair imposition on the community culture.
