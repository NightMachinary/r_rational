Personally I do find it easier to wax poetic about the flaws of a story than the good parts. Perhaps partly because the good parts are immersive, and get folded into "It was a good story, I enjoyed it." While the flaws grab my attention like splinters.

I think a guidance encouraging mentioning positive features would be great, but there shouldn't be a policy preventing criticism (except possibly unhelpfully vague and crude criticism, or purely ad-hominem attacks on the author).
