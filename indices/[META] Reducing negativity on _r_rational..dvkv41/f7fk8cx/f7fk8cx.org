Maybe it's a bit mean-spirited of me, but I kind of enjoy reading snarky, acerbic takedowns of middling works, specifically in those cases where their authors feel to me to be undeservedly arrogant, or claim writing quality beyond that which is merited by the text. It evokes feeling similar to seeing (fictional) bullies themselves get bullied. And maybe when they champion positions I don't agree with -- then it's more tickling those 'boo outgroup!' parts of me, I guess. But I can also see areas where "try[ing] to convince someone who liked a thing that they shouldn't have" is warranted, if the thing they like is problematic in some shape or form. If someone's eating food that poisons the body, we should discourage them from further consumption, even /if/ they really enjoy it; so too should we discourage enjoyment of works that poison the mind, or at least encourage further introspection on why those things are enjoyed and what that enjoyment says about ourselves.

(and I enjoy reading criticisms of things I like more than things I don't, because the latter tend to be more challenging and novel, forcing me to consider matters from a perspective further from my own. If anything, it makes me enjoy the thing I like more!)

(and I do agree that if people are reading things they dislike and seething in unpleasantness -- while also not being challenged -- then they should probably not read the thing that they dislike. But watching bad movies or reading bad fiction can be entertaining in its own right, too!)

It also feels a bit vindicating when you've not liked something others have; finding like minds means you're not alone in your displeasure. And it's often interesting to probe why you don't like something, especially if it's just a small part of a work that you've otherwise enjoyed. That probing seems like it requires examination through a critical lens. It can also serve as a springboard to explore possible improvements -- and you're a lot more likely to kick off a discussion with a public audience than 'delivering your criticism in private', which is almost certainly going to be ignored (and I'm not a fiction author, but if I were I'd think I'd much prefer public discussions, since then I'd be more able to gauge consensus opinion and distinguish common views from uncommon ones. When I've, say, circulated a manuscript for critique, I much prefer discussing it in a group over 1-on-1, because then people can jump in and say "yes I agree" or "no I disagree" over me having to guess, and I think this would be even more important if I were writing for fans' enjoyment). And there are the benefits described elsewhere nearby -- at the margin, criticism helps readers decide whether they should read something or not much more informatively than more praise.

If readers or authors are being negatively affected by criticism (or, err, being swallowed by "an insane, debilitating, addictive, mental-health-destroying, civilization-wrecking cascade of negativity" -- not sure what this is referring to, maybe like death threats? those certainly should never be allowed), though, it seems there are plenty of middle grounds to investigate, like:

- authors providing explicit statements of skin thickness -- how much criticism they'd prefer to see from readers, and how gently or harshly that criticism should be presented. Deviation from authors' stated preferences could be met with community shunning or withdrawal of work

- trigger warnings before any critical statements, with offending text obscured by spoiler tags like this Then authors and readers can decide to read or not to read the text, informed of its flavor beforehand

- promoting community norms for sandwich criticisms inside compliments to soften the blow of the former. You want to say something mean about something, you need to say two nice thing about that thing too

edit: also, I swear I've read something similar to this on here before, but I can't seem to find it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ and I'd say this forum is generally a lot cuddlier than most of the others I've seen, at least when it comes to established, recurring works, though there'd be an obvious filter at play there
