What I'm saying is that there are multiplicative interactions between the biases involved in the proposal, and that the introduction of a heuristic like that relates downvoted comments to rulebreaking, which magnifies the social stakes in the interactions. I don't believe that people would effectively stop downvoting, but rather that they would be incentivized by the perceived social push to consider the unpopular comment in a worse light, which would lead to more downvoting and more social penalties for whoever posted it, as it becomes more and more "report-worthy". In effect, what's currently worth downvoting would become report-worthy.

Just my opinion, though.
