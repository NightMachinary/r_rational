I agree that people shouldn't post pointless negativity. But I very much disagree with any attempt to discourage genuine criticism and contrasting opinions.

It's just as useful for me to read why someone disliked a story as it is to read why someone else liked it. Both give me information I can use to decide whether I should consider reading it. I wouldn't want either side's voice diminished.
