Liking xianxia and much fiction encountered here, I will begin reading!

Immediate impression before opening the first chapter: In the blurb, I would recommend(/prefer) a clear 'hook' to grab a casual blurb-skimmer's interest. "Former genius turned waste but probably not going to be a waste forever, yes, you and /Battle Through The Heavens/ and /Divine Throne Of Primordial Blood/ and uncountable other stories that use this trope, plus all the ones where the person was a waste in the first place who got a fortuitous encounter, plus all the ones where the person was a waste in the first place and got their soul replaced by a transmigrator, plus the ones...". What sets your story apart from the rest? What's different about your protagonist, or your world, or your story, that someone will read the blurb and think "This sounds like a sort of story I haven't read before"?

Xianxia isn't new. Weak-to-strong isn't new. Was-strong-and-is-now-weak-but-will-be-strong-again isn't new. Resigned-for-the-moment isn't new, recklessness isn't new, desperation isn't new, cleverness isn't new, entanglements-from-the-past aren't new. These things can be fun, but they can also be read elsewhere, and a blurb-reader who is building an internal model of your story before deciding whether to try it has only an impression of genericness. What originality have you conceived, what is it about your story that you feel is worth telling? If someone reading the blurb has a hint of that, it can raise their impression/interest and draw them in in search of it.

Now to start the text proper...

[Impression after the first chapter: Impression of the protagonist is neutral, neither high or low yet. My main emotional movement is the sinking feeling that the promised 'mistake' is getting closer. Continuing...]

[Partway through the second chapter. Interest not having yet been hooked, an internal groan at the follow-up trope of the genius fiance. Whether it's the standard breaking-the-engagement line or the less-common still-devoted subversion, the skin crawls a little as the potential originality-to-genericness ratio drops.]

[' "Let us settle matters with a duel," he said, "in three years' time." '--Even the length of the three year agreement is taken without change from /Battle Through The Heavens/? Not because he's a transmigrator who has read BTTH, not because of some explained reason why he thinks three years is a particular good idea, just directly the same for no reason? I fear this is my limit, but reading on long enough to see why it's described as a 'mistake' when he's so certain at the time.]

[Skipping ahead to chapter 10, to see whether the 'ambition' is of a form of interest. --Hmm, I see now the form of his ambition. Somewhat interested as to whether this will allow him to exceed the abilities of others, not just reach them. Oh, and the title makes more sense to me now!]

[Skipping ahead to the last available chapter, chapter 16, to see if anything I find noteworthy/enthusiasm-kindling has happened by this point. --Okay. It seems that it will be some chapters yet before events I'm interested in observing take place. I hope that these give some food-for-thought of use; good luck with writing!]
