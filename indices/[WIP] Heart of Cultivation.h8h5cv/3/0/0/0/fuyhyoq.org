  And why isn't it? Do institutions and culture exist independently of power relations? If you posit a cultivation-based system and a snowball effect to advancement, what does it mean for humanity to have extreme differences in personal strength and extreme "capital accumulation"?

This would suggest tiered, caste-like societies but is mostly orthogonal to asshole factor. In fact if talent is not completely hereditary successful societies would likely involve a significant degree of charity from the strongest families to weaker ones; as having more population beholden to you increases the chance of striking gold in some extremely talented child, whom you can then take into the 'main' family.
