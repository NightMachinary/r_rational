I agree and think it's quite believable that he chooses to avoid them. My qualm is the fact that the letters were brought up and never addressed again. It seems like their use in the narrative is done but there doesn't seem to be any closure.

After getting called out on it does he decide to continue ignoring the letters? It appears that that's the case, but, for such an important plot device they lose all relevance once the duel is mentioned. It feels more like he just kinda forgot about them and as the reader we're also expected to forget about them.
