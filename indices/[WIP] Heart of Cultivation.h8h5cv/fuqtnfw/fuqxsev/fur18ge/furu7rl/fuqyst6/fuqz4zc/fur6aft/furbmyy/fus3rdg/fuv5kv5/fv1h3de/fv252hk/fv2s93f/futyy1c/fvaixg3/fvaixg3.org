I read up the the 13th chapter. My impression so far is similar to other's who posted here. The writing is decent the pacing feels a bit slow and I'm feeling pretty neutral on the protagonist. I don't think it's my kind of story but I can see the appeal.

My nitpicks because stuff bothers me:

Why hasn't Jian read Meirong's letters. How often were they writing to each other and how long has it been since he stopped responding? What was the last thing she wrote that made him decide he wouldn't write back let alone stop reading her letters?

I feel like this is important information that should have been explained to the readers especially considering how much the engagement affair has been bothering him.

It's clear that his ego and pride was the initial reason he stopped responding to her but I have a hard time believing he wasn't curious about what she wrote especially after she publicly called him out on not writing her back.

Jian isn't a stupid person. He seems to have actual feelings for Meirong. It's only been his speculation about his comparable worth that's been eating at him. It's clear that she's mad at him for ignoring her letters but wouldn't being called out raise some guilt and force him to confront his mistake that he has already acknowledged? Does he not feel like he owe her an apology for his shitty behavior? What exactly is stopping him from reading her letters?

I don't understand Meirong's actions at the meeting. She either still likes Jian and doesn't actually want to annul the engagement or she's lost hope in Jian and want the annulment to go through.

If she still likes Jian why did she speak out in support of the annulment? I get that she was mad because he was ignoring her but speaking in support of the annulment isn't getting her what she actually want. That is unless she wasn't thinking and just wanted to evoke a reaction from him out of anger, but again that's counter productive and if she was going to speak out anyway she might as well just addressed Jian directly to get the answer that she wanted.

If Meirong did want to annul the engagement she shouldn't have accepted the duel. Sure one can argue that she just doesn't want to be bother with other suitors but after making a speech about having a say about the course of her life you'd think she'd fight back against any engagements she didn't want to partake in.

Regardless of her feelings, it's not like she had any actual say on the matter in the first place since it's been established that it's up the the guardians of said people to decide who they get to marry, a point that is especially true for people in high status position (Meirong).

To me the whole sequence of events doesn't feel like it should play out the way that it did if people were behaving in a way that was portrayed by the world building.
