Sure. I'll give you the broad strokes. In the story I try to parcel the setting details out as they become relevant in order to avoid drowning the reader in exposition.

The story takes place in an empire that resembles ancient China. Where it differs is that most of the feudal nobility has meditation-fueled superpowers. There are also a few sects that answer directly to the Emperor that are made up of people who have sworn loyalty to the sect and also have meditation-fueled superpowers. The sects were founded within living memory but aren't brand new.

Generally speaking, advancing along the path of meditation-fueled superpowers causes social advancement. Positions of power give you better access to the shinies that can boost the speed of your progression, so there's something of a snowball effect at the top end of society.

The story begins more specifically in a city near the northern border of the empire. It's on the border both because it is remote from the capital and because there is a supernatural phenomenon that makes conquering any further territory impractical.

The protagonist is a member of the dominant family in the border city. His position by birth is fairly high, but his constitution prevents him from cultivating beyond a very basic level. His overall social position is thus a mixed bag, and he has to rely on the protection of others to shield him from petty bullying.

The same supernatural phenomenon that makes conquest impractical also provides lucrative if dangerous opportunities. Accordingly, there is a sort of wild west town north of the border, as illustrated in the map. Think of ancient China mashed up with Deadwood and you won't be too far off.

Other areas of the empire have not yet become the focus of the narrative, and will be fleshed out as the story goes on.

The most notable departure from the standard xianxia genre in the worldbuilding is probably that the world isn't fully populated by greedy assholes.
