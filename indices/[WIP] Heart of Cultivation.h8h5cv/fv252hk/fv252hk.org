I've read it, but it's hard to tell if it will be to my tastes. I felt the pacing a bit slow and there's been nothing really driving the plot or pushing the MC into doing anything interesting. Just things he'll do in the future, things he will try when he's got the time and what his goals and personality are.

I feel there's been no real hook in the story yet. And we're 17 chapters in, most stories get one on the first episode, or soon after but this one still hasn't had one for me. Nothing happening, nothing pressing, nothing hooking me, just decent writing you can follow along if you want to. I'll give it a few more chapters but that's about it..
