Basically people can have the ability to become more powerful their special medication along with special items. The more power you gain the closer you are to godhood. The powers have two categories, 1 where your just more superhuman (stronger faster longer life) and 2, magic/superpowers were you can use your gained powers to shoot lightning and other cool stuff. Most MC in these stories get a really good meditation ability early on (because not all medication makes you stronger at the same rate) and just meditate for insanely long periods. They are pretty much power fantasies were the best trait of the MC is the discipline they have (not hard to write they meditated for 10 years straight).
