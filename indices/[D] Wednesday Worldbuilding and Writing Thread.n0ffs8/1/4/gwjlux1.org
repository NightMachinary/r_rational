I've been pondering what would Star Wars with more force user varieties would look like myself and personally, I would just take the cue from Magic: The Gathering and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravnica#Guilds][Guilds of Ravnica]] it. Come up with five different ways (cough, colors) to use the Force, each sect of force users focuses on combining two of them. For funsies, also force them all to coexist and cooperate in the one galactic society without outright war.
