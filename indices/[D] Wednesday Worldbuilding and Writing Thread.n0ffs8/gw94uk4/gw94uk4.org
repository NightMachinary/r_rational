My housemates had Star Wars on the brain recently, and they proposed a thought experiment: what would Star Wars look like if there were several different Jedi orders with different competing philosophies about the force, instead of just one all-encompassing order?

1) I'd like to know what kind of Jedi orders you can dream up! What kinds of philosophies might Jedi reasonably espouse? How would they interact? Which ones would cooperate nicely, and which ones would conflict?

2) We came up with a list of factions of our own, and I went and wrote up a series of interviews with fictional characters from each faction. It's not a "story" in the traditional sense, as there's no plot, just philosophical explorations of different ways of being a Jedi... is this something that the [[/r/rational]] community would be interested in reading? Would it be appropriate to post on this sub?
