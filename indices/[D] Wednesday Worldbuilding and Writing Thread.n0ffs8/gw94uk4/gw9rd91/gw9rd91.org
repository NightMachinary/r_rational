- *The Brotherhood of the Force:* a communist collective that uses the Force (especially the ability to communicate over large distances) to form an utopian communist society, and finally, achieve a Force Hivemind. They oppose megacorporations, trade guilds, and oftentimes clash with local governments. The Republic tolerates them because they also provide free healthcare and social care to the downtrodden masses.

- *The Lifesingers:* a society of extreme anti-technology Force users, who believe only biological life and its connection to the Force should exist. They reject most technology, and destroy droids on sight. To them, artificial intelligence and cybernetics are the worst abomination, and only a return to a pastoral, simple life can save the Galaxy and unite all beings in the Force. Members are all vegans, but ultimately aim to nourish themselves with pure Force. They use very curious spaceships: hollowed asteroids pushed around by sheer Force. The entire lifer support of their ships and stations is based on natural ecosystems. Many other factions consider them terrorists. Republic technically considers them criminals, but does not pursue them unless they happen to accidentally kill someone (which happens occasionally when they damage vital technology).

- *The Pyramid of Light*: a lose society of professional duelists, only a fraction of them are Force users. The entire goal of the Pyramid is to train, teach, and then duel using light-sabers. Their philosophy is that only fighting with a light-saber and defeating an opponent in a fight to the death is a true manifestation of the Force. They believe that by pitting all Force users and other warriors against one another in mortal combat they will finally find the Pinnacle of the Pyramid,a true Savior, someone who is perfectly in tune with the Force who will then guide the galaxy. A traditional mark of their brotherhood is a lightsaber scar across the face.

- *Freeholders of the Galt Cluster:* a loose coalition of former Jedi, former Sith and non affiliated force users who reject their former sects, reject the rule of the Republic/Empire, and in general, wish to be left alone by the powers that be. They believe that the galaxy and its society are inherently corrupted by the needy masses that strain the economy and the Force, and await its downfall. They are all consummate capitalists, who believe only in free exchange of value and reject both the selflessness of the Jedi and the evil of the Sith. Currently, the occupy a small clusters of systems hidden behind a natural Force Storm. There is just one safe route through the storm, and the access to it is granted on "invitation only" basis to fellow "freedom loving" Force Users.

- *Hand of the Void*: a tiny, mostly unknown cabal of Jedi that believe that conscious Force use is an abomination against the natural order, and wish to exterminate all Force users (and themselves, right after). They are a fanatic death cult that hides among other Force factions, only rare surfacing to assassinate the most powerful Force users they can find. Their modus operandi is usually to gang up on the victim, using not just the Force and the lightsabers but things like explosives, poison gas and assassin droids.
