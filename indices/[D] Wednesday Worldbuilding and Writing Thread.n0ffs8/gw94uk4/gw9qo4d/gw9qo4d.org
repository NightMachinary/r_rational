That scenario is already true to a limited extent in the old Expanded Universe, with sects such as the Corellian Jedi having divergent beliefs to the main Order.

You might enjoy a recent fanfic called Using the Force Made Easy, in which a young Jedi abandons the Order to travel the galaxy and decides to publish videos telling the public about how to use the Force.

I'd be interested in reading the interviews, personally.
