I'm not seeing how you're avoiding the setting-breaking here. My concern is that if I let one witch erase or rewrite memories here, that means she could do it with other people in other places, and other witches could do it too, and that'd give them far too much unbalanced power. I'm still not seeing any limiting principle that'd prevent that?
