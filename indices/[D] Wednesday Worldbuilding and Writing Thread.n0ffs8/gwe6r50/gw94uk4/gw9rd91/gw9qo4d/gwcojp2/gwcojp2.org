Spinning off from the themes of Using the Force made easy:

A faction dedicated to “open-sourcing” the force. As we see from the Monk character in Rogue One, non force sensitives can still access the force with enough training and meditation. Perhaps with guidance from natural sensitives and bio-feedback and monitoring technology, the average person in Star Wars could manage to use the force to a moderate extent. Even a minor bit of luck, empathy, and intuition could make a massive difference if spread through a large portion of the population. This faction would thus go about teaching how to connect to the force to anyone that wants to learn. Actual force sensitives end up primarily acting as teachers and as force-guided planning committee members (although the actual upper levels of leadership is decentralized and is supposed to select for leadership skills more than raw force sensitivity). Less sensitive members learn what they can and then return their every day lives, keep up with enough training to maintain their skill. On the few planets were they have the most influence, children learn enough in public schools to consistently perform the occasional act of force guided empathy, luck, or reflex by the time they are adults, but on most planets they are more like a hobbyist group and are often looked down on as Jedi-wannabes, minor party trick users, and/or as plebeian knockoffs of proper force-sects.
