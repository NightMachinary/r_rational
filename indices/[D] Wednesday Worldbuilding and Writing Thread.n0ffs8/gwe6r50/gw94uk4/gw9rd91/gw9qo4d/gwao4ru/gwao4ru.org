I'm not well versed in Star Wars lore, but here are some things I'd expect to exist:

- Utopian technologists using Force-driven intuition and "luck" (and maybe prophecy?) to guide research and development of novel technologies.

- Force users who use mental/psychic Force techniques to create a gestalt/hivemind, perhaps including non-force users. These could be aggressive/expansionist or peaceful/voluntary.

- Devotional religious orders that worship the force directly and figures who are purported to have become one with the force. You could get some nasty conflicts between groups who exalt different prophets.

- Artists who use Force techniques in live performances to create sublime experiences for their audience. Since we're talking about art, there's any number of different ways the Force could be used, but there could be a more or less cohesive faction that considers Force-enhanced artistry to be the highest form of artistic expression.

- Pacifistic healers. Basically a Star Wars version of the Red Cross (possibly also including talented droid technicians?) whose mission is to use the Force to save lives. Even if direct Force Healing isn't a thing, there's any number of ways a skilled Force user could accomplish ludicrous feats in this domain.

- Explorers. The resilience, mobility, reflexes and intuition available to Force users, not to mention ancillary enhanced skills in things like piloting or what have you, could be invaluable to people trying to explore star systems, or planetary frontiers. These could be anything from plundering grave robbers to legitimate historian-archaeologists to wilderness guides to cartographers. Maybe not enough to be a fraction on its own, but they'd share enough in common it seems likely that some faction somewhere would show up to offer training in these abilities and support those that apply them this way.
