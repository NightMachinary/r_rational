I'm trying to brainstorm ideas for a CYOA and a possible story that takes place in a world governed by Fighting Games logic and physics. But I could use some help making the world building more weird and interesting. Here's what I have. Anyone have ideas or details to help flesh out this world and make it feel interesting/weird?

Title: Sucker Punch -- Making the world a better place with your fists.

A Fighting Game World CYOA. The main god happens to look and act like a parody of a dude bro. With a world that someone like that would have designed.

Narration: So it looks like you died. Yay! That means you get to come to my awesome cool world with all the best fights and ass kicking. Who am I? Well duh, I'm god. Isn't it obvious? Oh, ignore the beaten-up face I've been challenging a few other gods to fights and kicking the absolute shit out of them. WUUUUUUuuuu! Up top! Come on, don't leave me hanging...come on...you know you want to. Thanks. You know I don't usually get too many reincarnates to my world and it looks like you unlocked your power already thanks to the whole dying thing. So, I'll let you pick your own character as a reward. Yeah, I'm just that fucking awesome man. Be sure to say a prayer to me while you beat the shit out of your opponents. You don't like fighting? Hah, that's fucking hilarious.

Hey, want to know a secret while you're deciding? If you manage to win the big 4 Tournaments, I'll let you challenge me to a fight.

Explanation: You have died and been reborn into a world that seems to follow the logic and physics of a fighting video game. In this world, anyone who masters martial arts to a certain degree and wins enough fights can awaken an aura that makes them stronger, heal faster, and do far more damage to nonliving things just by hitting things. It also makes them far more resistant to non-hand to hand damage to the point it requires explosives and artillery to knock out or wound them.

This aura can be trained like a muscle and can eventually reach a point where you become outright immune to all non aura damage. In rare circumstances and for unknown reasons, several aura users will develop a special power that explains away some of the weirder abilities some fighters have in fighting games.

But this is world that worships strength and talent above all else. A world where martial arts duels are protected by law, where teenagers get tattoos and scar themselves to look tougher, and disabled people are looked down upon and mocked. Social services don't seem to exist, bullying and child abuse is explained away as training, and intelligence/creativity is not valued except for how it can help support fighters. If you're strong the world is your oyster but if you're weak, well this world is probably not very fun what with it being far less technologically advanced, filled with arrogant assholes that like to bully or kill people because they can, demons are starting to show up and eat people, secret conspiracies that are threatening to destroy everything, and tournaments that can affect the course of the world. It's time to fight.

Choose your fighter: Fighters come with their own individual quest line that can improve and expand their special power, but you are not required to follow it and there are other ways hidden in the world that let you expand your abilities. Here is a fully fleshed out character to give you an idea of what I'm going for.

*The Joke Character-* Appearance: Picture you but a shorter, frailer, and uglier you. Well not ugly exactly, you look the same but the oxygen tank, thick glasses, and leg brace screams weakness which makes the world consider you ugly by default. You also get to be born with a nasty lung defect that makes it hard and potentially dangerous to exercise. So, add a wheezy and ragged quality to your voice. But on a second glance your glasses and phone look strangely stylish and advanced.

Power: Machine Interface -- allows you to merge with and upgrade technology.

Talent: None, zero, zip, zilch, nada.

Quests:

Revenge against the Bullies.

Revenge against the Parents.

Revenge against the System.

*The Assist Character-* Appearance: Your face but slightly stronger features and add two feet to your height no matter how tall you are. Your eyes will glow white when power is active.

Power: Mentor System -- allows user to identify weaknesses and shows projected effects of possible trainings.

Talent: Low

Quest:

Raising a champion

Top of the World

*The Shotoclone-* Appearance: Pretty much you with an average height except always barefoot and without sleeves to all your clothes since they always fall apart before too long.

Power: Energy Blasts.

Talent: High

Quest:

To Master Oneself

*The Fighting Clown -* Appearance: You but dressed a bit whackier or sillier. Maybe add some clown makeup.

Power: Toon Physics -- Random changes to reality that only affect you and you can't quite reliably control. Though they are always in your favor if you are dressed as a clown or something at least one person considers amusing.

Talent: Varies day by day

Quest

The Last Laugh

*The Secret Character*

Appearance: You look exactly the same except for your hair. As it will be a slightly lighter or brighter color and grow much longer once you activate your power.

Power: Gutsy Fighter -- The more damage you take the stronger your attacks become.

Talent: Average

Quest

The Mysterious Stranger

*The Guest Fighter -* Appearance -- A cross between you and the looks of a younger version of a chosen character from a fighting game. You also have the option of changing the sex of said character and you will look normal enough to still pass for human so nonhuman characters will be drastically changed.

Quest: None

Talent: N/A. You can't learn new techniques at all.
