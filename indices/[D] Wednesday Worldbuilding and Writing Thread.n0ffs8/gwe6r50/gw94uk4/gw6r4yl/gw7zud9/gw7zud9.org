Let me break it for you. Militaries would just train soldiers, have tournaments all the time, then they'd optimize the aura training and done, the premise kind of breaks. Few people will be stronger than professional soldiers, and depending on how you structure society the rulers will be quite strong or employ very strong people.

​

If you want to do fight game type of plot it's better to go with, hidden martial arts masters fighting each other for 1 million dollars in a somewhat normal world. I mean just doing it in a different era would already be novel enough.

​

Also you need a proper plot, win many fights so you can fight god is not really a plot. Make money to pay for medical bills for a relative works as a basic motivation. Then enemies threaten family so you can keep the plot going etc.
