The gold standard lighthearted battle-royale concept is, in my humble opinion, /Mobile Fighter G Gundam/. It's a free-for-all mech combat using Earth as the arena. Each country enters one mech, its pilot, and the support crew. The teams fight each other until there's one mech left with its head intact, at which point that team's country wins the right to rule all the space nations for a year. There are other rules, too, like not attacking the cockpit.

So: - give the contestants something to fight for, outside the battle royale island - make "kill" metaphorical or symbolic, like by using paintguns or playing hand-tag or by trapping opponents so they can't move outside a square meter area for more than 12h - give the people outside the battle royale island a reason to be invested in the success of individual fighters
