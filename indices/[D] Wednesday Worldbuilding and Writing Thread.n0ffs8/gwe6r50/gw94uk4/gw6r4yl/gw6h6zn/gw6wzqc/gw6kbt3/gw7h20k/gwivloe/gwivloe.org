Just make it a game in-game. They're brawling for sport either in VR or, like, a nanotech wonderarena.

Also, Overwatch just kinda avoids reflecting on why bitter enemies fight on the same team, and why everyone is respawning after dying, and why both teams might have the same character, and how dying some of these deaths should actually be a horrifically traumatic experience, y'know? Just do the same.
