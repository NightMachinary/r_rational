I'm writing a novel set in a vaguely-medievalesque fantasy world where (to make a long story short) the most significant magic involves "witches" making deals with spirits that came from another world. (Other forms involve using plants that came from that other world, et cetera.)

When I was designing my magic system, one of the rules I set myself was that magic can't affect people's minds. It can affect your general mood, like cheer you up or make you tired, but nothing more specific. Being from another world, the magical spirits can't see your mind that closely, and the magical plants can't interface with it. Anything else seemed to me like it'd be just too powerful.

That said, I've now got a plot point where it'd be really convenient for a witch to be able to (temporarily or permanently) suppress some specific memories in someone. She knows the person decently well, and the memories are a couple weeks old.

Can you think of any way for that to be possible without breaking the setting and having witches erasing all sorts of memories to hide their plotting, disrupt their enemies, and so on?
