The best way I can think of to make it less dark is to just make death less permanent. This Utopia has the technological means to have people download into a new body whenever they are killed but limits citizens to a certain amount of lives because of resources required. With higher ranking or skilled citizens getting more lives. But now there is some type of virus or contagion that is causing madness, which doesn't necessarily mean violence, and the condition is not something that is fixed by respawning. But one man has found a cure for the condition- extreme amounts of adrenaline. Which is taboo in this utopia. Thus they have started the battle royale to help citizens cure themselves. The authorities treat this as a ring of thieves for the theft of resources since death is less permanent and its hard to actually kill someone enough times that they stay dead.
