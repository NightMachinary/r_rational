I'm trying to make a simple battle royale game. I think I want it to be set in a utopian/optimistic version of the future, kind of like Overwatch or Star Trek. Maybe it takes place during the first days of apocalypse, when the utopian society begins to fall apart.

The main goal of battle royale games is to kill everyone, and be the last one standing. I'm struggling to justify it in fiction. I know that it's not necessary for making a game, but it would be fun to come up with a story in which this behavior makes sense. Under what circumstances would it make sense for people to turn on each other like that?

My game is pretty lighthearted and colorful, that makes it extra difficult. I think it should probably have some dark humor, to make sense (or make fun of) the premise of running around and killing everyone.

The obvious solution is a "rage virus" that just makes everyone super violent, or some device like in "Kingsman: The Secret Service", this idea makes sense, but I don't like it too much.

Does anyone have thoughts on how to make the battle royale premise make sense? Without making it too bleak/dark/depressing?
