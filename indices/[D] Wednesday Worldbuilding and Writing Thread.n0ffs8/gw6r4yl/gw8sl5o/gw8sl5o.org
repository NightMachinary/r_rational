[[/u/fassina2][u/fassina2]] covers a lot of the broad strokes issues, but I'd like to add:

This seems really weird. Like, I feel like you've never met a “bro” before.

I *think* you should try watching like, Adventure Time(?), because that does a really good job of “taking itself too seriously without taking itself very seriously.” (venture Bros is another example).

A better way to structure this would be to scrap the CYOA feature (if you've never written before, CYOA is an exceptionally difficult format), and have your MC have a power based on his previous life OR have him accidentally unlock a power because his father was a fighter in The Tournament or something and now he's on a quest to find his dad.

Whatever. A great place to start would be playing 90s Fighters, and reallllllly leaning into the tropey shit.

Maybe like rewrite the 90s mortal kombat movie as a rational fic?
