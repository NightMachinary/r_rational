I loved that movie.

The books it was based on ("[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Destroyer_(novel_series][The Destroyer]]" series) are a lot of fun. Cranked out by ghostwriters and formulaic to the point of literally copy/pasting paragraphs between books, wildly unrealistic, often funny, and generally tremendous fun.
