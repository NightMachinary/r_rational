Very nice chapter, finally found time to catch up. I really enjoy the story so far. Its getting way more fluid, but i am also very interested what implications telepathy will have on the general students university lifestyle. Will normal tests still be effective ? I see some sort of challenges ahead... are there materials to inhibit telepathy? etc..
