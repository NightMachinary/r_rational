While I have no idea what DaystarEld intends to do with Blaine, I will note that in the Pokemon TV series, Blaine meets potential challengers incognito, forcing them to solve riddles to challenge him in an active volcano. In the games, Blaine initially keeps the riddles but eventually loses his gym and all of his gym trainers in the aftermath of the destruction of Cinnabar. He becomes a hermit who holds gym challengers in his cave near the ruins of his old gym. Traditionally, Blaine is a quirky old man who could not care less what people think of his gym.
