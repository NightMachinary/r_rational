Part of me is just imagining his loved ones each knowing the specifics, people that he trusts, and having them each tell him the same thing: that he is not only wrong, but horrendously and obviously wrong. He's wrong in a very human way, born out of his grief and pain for his lost friend. But he made a judgement call when he was lashing out, and has yet to let go of it. He told his best friend that it would be better if he was dead, and he needs to beg for forgiveness.
