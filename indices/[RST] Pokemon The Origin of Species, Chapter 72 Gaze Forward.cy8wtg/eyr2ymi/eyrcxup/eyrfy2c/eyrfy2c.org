I am having this same reaction - obviously it's totally fine for the character to be this way, but I am just emotionally thirsting for his Die for Honour style attitude to blow something up bad enough that he realizes what a total moron he has been. Until then he sits in this liminal zone of being both protagonist and villian as I read his chapters.
