Yep, turns out I'm still salty about Blue not feeling a drop of regret at how he treated Red and indeed still holding the same exact mindset, even after his temper cooled. Outright telling your friend that between them being not heroic enough and them dying, you prefer they died, and then standing by your words two months later, way to go Blue. Somehow I doubt Daisy or Gramps would be so pleasant about your â€˜disagreement' with Red if they knew a little bit of the specifics

It's the same exact situation as with dead trainer in the Beedrill meadow, only that time Red successfully talked them out of the suicide run, on the account of them being not prepared at all. And looks like the reason he couldn't talk Aiko out of going into collapsing building with no plan was (shockingly) that she didn't want to be not heroic enough. But sure, being angry at Red is reasonable, can't fault Blue's logic /salt
