  He absorbed the lesson "You lost your parents because you weren't heroic enough"
#+end_quote

See, if he were just overreacting in one direction, then that would be quite understandable and I could respect it.

What I don't respect is his hypocrisy. Because at the same time as demanding Red be heroic /even when it's suicidal and doesn't achieve the objective/ - expecting and requiring Red to choose a meaningless, pointless death - Blue is trying to prevent his grandfather from making an actually meaningful sacrifice. His attitude is, "People at arm's length from me must sacrifice their lives for my principles, but a person close to me, no, he has to be kept safe even if it means lots of others die." His only consistency in this situation is selfishness.

He wants Red to reassure people, let them know that he'll lead them right and be loyal? Well, how about the fact that Red is showing good judgement of risk and warning those around him of overwhelming danger? I know I'd feel better about following someone who can /accurately judge/ whether or not it's safe and worthwhile to enter a burning building.
