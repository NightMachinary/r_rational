Yeah, I definitely don't know enough about developmental or traumatic psychology to be strongly confident about what particular responses are likely in this situation, but I feel like anger and revenge aren't mutually exclusive with fear and physical insecurity. If anything I feel like they're the "normal" reaction, trying to reassert an ability to control and protect yourself and ward off potential future attacks.

The Stormbringers feel like a natural disaster, but natural disasters don't have embodied presences that hang around continuing to kill people. In that way they're more like a big terrorist attack, and we can see a separation in response to terrorist attacks based on whether they seem to be ongoing existential threats to the victim.

In post 9/11 America, there was certainly a lot of what looked like white-hot anger and desire for revenge, but the undercurrent was still "We have to prevent this from happening again" consistent with a fear reaction. In an anger-without-fear reaction, I think the narrative would have been much more explicitly punitive, in the way that the Austrian response to the assassination of Franz Ferdinand was. Austria certainly thought they had very little to fear from Serbia, and just wanted to keep the Russians off their back.

If Blue wasn't scared, he'd have no reason to insist that everyone else also be trying to be as heroic as possible. That part in particular strikes me as fear based - a reaction to a belief that his own efforts are unlikely to be enough to ensure safety.
