Totally agree.

/“And it wouldn't be killing him now if he hadn't then. You're just intent on protecting him, and I get why, but all he was doing was the same thing you asked Red to---”/

/Blue reaches up and switches off his earpiece, face a mask as he presses his forehead against her back none too gently and closes his eyes. He's already tried explaining to her the difference between what Gramps did and what Red didn't do. And she wasn't there, after, didn't hear the way he was justifying it. Blue's not in the mood to hash over it all again./

I would be interested to know how Blue justifies not wanting his grandpa to sacrifice himself for his grandson and bystander while thinking Red should have sacrificed himself for his friend. But he buried his head in the sand instead. It just sounds like he believes Red should feel a lot of survivor's guilt as he does and Red's rational explanation just creates a lot of cognitive dissonance for him. Yeesh, as if Red doesn't have enough psychological issues as is.

On another note, I really liked the contrast between Blue's and Red's social savvy. Both are hella smart but while Blue is killing it on interpersonal and PR fronts, Red is just... well he's learning, that's the important bit!

I couldn't remember the promise Blue thought Red disclosed to Professor (where he thinks Red is a coward). Can anybody remind me, please?
