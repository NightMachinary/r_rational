Blue could think Red is a coward for telling the Professor that they plan to hunt the Stormbringers. In Blue's mind, this could mean the Professor stops them from doing so (or comes along). So if Red was afraid of the Stormbringers and didn't want to keep his side of the promise, he could tattle to the Professor or another adult, who would then stop them from going.
