So, just a thought, but how much does Snorlax costs to maintain? Stats:

1014.1 lbs. 460.0 kg

Heck, from Bulbapedia:

Snorlax is often found in mountains and forests. It wakes up only to eat, requiring 900 lbs. (400 kg) of food per day before returning to its slumber. It is not a picky eater, as its strong stomach allows it to eat even moldy food without feeling any ill effects. It can even handle thorny plants or Muk's poison. It can also eat while it is resting. Snorlax is docile enough to let children and small Pok√©mon bounce on its large stomach.
