It sounds like the Leader and team will always be the wild Pokemon, and the point is that it's not just a 6v6 battle, the challengers will have some particular objective they must fulfill while the scenario is playing out. It isn't stated but I could imagine that each challenger would have a particular individual goal that just be achieved in addition to the overall group good to avoid anyone being carried.
