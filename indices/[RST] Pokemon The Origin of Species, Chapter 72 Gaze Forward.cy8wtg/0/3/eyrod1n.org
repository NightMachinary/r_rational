So like Blue clearly feels about as much guilt as anger about Aiko dying, at least partially because of the whole Red didn't die *with* her, but also that he wasn't there either. I mean part of it clearly reminds him of the whole promise to stop the three Stormbringers from hurting anyone ever again, and there Aiko is just a mockery of his aspirations, well their aspirations. Also it doesn't seem like Blue is currently seeing a therapist which i'm vaguely surprised isn't like mandatory from Surge.

I wonder how much Surge knows about this, cause Sabra was the one that found Red after the previous Second and Aiko went in, that plus the current situation of the group being split up, and her being right there as they ask Blue about a new hospital.
