Blue is wrong, but I think it's mostly a holdover reaction from losing his parents. He absorbed the lesson "You lost your parents because you weren't heroic enough". Or, more viscerally, "You lost everything that kept you safe because you weren't heroic enough".

He isn't reacting to the rational balance of risk to Red's life vs potential to save the people in the hospital, he's reacting to a fear that his world will be torn apart if people aren't maximally heroic all the time. He lives by the maxim "Heroism is the only thing you can count on to keep yourself safe" and anybody not being maximally heroic is selfishly placing their loved ones at risk.

Anybody chastising him for his disagreement with Red wouldn't be heard as "You're not weighing your values appropriately", it would be heard as "Your safety isn't worth risking anyone else's life for".
