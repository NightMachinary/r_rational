I'm not convinced about this reading, I didn't get that from Blue at all. He was kept safe and supported by both Red's family and his own, he didn't feel unsafe or afraid, it was (and still is) mostly anger & anger management issues.\\
Blue has the same reaction every time Stormbringers are as much as mentioned, his motivation for killing them isn't fear that his world/safety will be torn apart, it's hatred, revenge and white-hot anger.

This sounds like I'm roasting him, but I am not, I like him a lot and root for him, I'd be angry at the birds too in his shoes
