In the scenario where the two teams battling against each other, as far as I can tell, the badge still goes to the team that won the match, but it's regardless of whether they are attackers or defenders. The win condition is still based on, well, winning. The gym leader doesn't decide who gets it off pure judgement.

And yeah, the attackers aren't using /all/ the skills that trainers should practice, but that's exactly the point the official brings up. Blue argues that other gyms will teach those skills more, the league official has concerns, and the rest of that debate plays out.

But to be fair, it would probably be helpful for trainers to learn how to make do when they only have one pokemon available to use (in case at some point that's the last one they have left in a wild attack) and how to fight against other pokemon when you can't communicate with your allies. Not sure of a good example for that last point but I'm sure there are uses there.

At least, that's how I read it.
