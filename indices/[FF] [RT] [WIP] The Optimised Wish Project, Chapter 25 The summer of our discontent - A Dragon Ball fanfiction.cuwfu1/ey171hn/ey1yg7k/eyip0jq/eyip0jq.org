IIRC, there are other people named Bulma in canon, according to the episode where Goku first goes to West City. There's also some stuff Toriyama did for... I forget what, Shenron Times? Some "where are they now?" Q and A shorts for past opponents, in which Lanfan was said to have married a guy named Trunks.

So if multiple underwear-based named people are out there, there's no reason there can't be multiple stationary-based named people.
