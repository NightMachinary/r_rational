This one is a breather chapter, and I wrote it with my mood dominated by rather dark thoughts - mostly, the contradictory feelings born of enjoying a very hot summer while knowing that this very hot summer is indeed the hottest ever recorded, and that is the harbinger of very unpleasant things. I think you can well see how the contrast between fun and looming sense of doom underlies the whole chapter, which makes it perhaps the most personal yet.

I also posted it rather quickly because, well, during the holidays I had time to write and bring myself a bit ahead with the work. And considering that nothing much of actual consequence happens in it, I thought it'd be better to just post it quickly, in order to keep people waiting less for the next, more plot relevant chapter (which will come hopefully in two weeks as usual).
