It never happens in canon, but no one seems to think they're invincible. Taopaipai does indeed hit one with the Dodonpa and that shields Goku, but it only means they're stronger than that (which is indeed pretty strong). Namek!Krillin /tries/ to destroy one, but Guldo snatches it from him before he can actually do so. All present at the scene give for granted that yes, he /could/ destroy it in theory. Later on, Piccolo tells Gotenks to go easy when he starts rampaging to kill Majin Buu, remembering that if he goes overboard he might destroy a Dragon Ball and so no resurrecting anyone (now that I think about it it's a bit weird he should mention that since at that time they ought to believe that Dende is dead; he really isn't, Popo tossed him off the Palace, but they don't know that).

So in other words it's a big question mark. I'd say it's at least reasonable to assume they aren't indestructible, in which case, if one is broken, whether the whole set goes back to stone or not they're unusable anyway. If they're indestructible then there's a whole another class of uses possible for them other than granting wishes...
