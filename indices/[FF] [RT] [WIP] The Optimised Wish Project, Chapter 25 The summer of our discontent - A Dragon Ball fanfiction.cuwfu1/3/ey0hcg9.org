Honestly, I understand the goal, but I think that in this particular case their approach to not telling people abou tthe danger is foolish. They found out their current supers squad just by /asking/. In an ad. As far as they know, there are plenty more people like Spike or whatever just bumming around, which isn't entirely right but isn't far off; even if we discount the lookout group, there's the crane school with Tao, Tien, Chaiotzu, Shen, as well as lone actors like Krillin (will be recruiting himself, but they can't see that coming) and Yajirobe.
