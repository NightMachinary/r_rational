They know about Krillin, he's with Muten. But for the rest, well, the King's councillors aren't entirely sold on the reality of this whole affair, so it's also about saving face for them if in the end nothing happens. The crisis they /do/ know about is the RR vs. Instruments situation, and that they see mostly as a convenient opportunity to get rid of both in one fell swoop.

(but obviously I agree in general that not telling people /was/ wrong and foolish, it's kind of the whole point of the chapter. It's just that Bulma isn't at liberty to change that)
