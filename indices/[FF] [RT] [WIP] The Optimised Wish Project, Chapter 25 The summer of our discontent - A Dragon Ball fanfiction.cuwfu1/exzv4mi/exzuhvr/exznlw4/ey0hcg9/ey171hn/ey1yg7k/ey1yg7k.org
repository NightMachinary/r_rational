Wait, what? No, sorry, that was just a mistake. What happened was the following:

- all the names of characters in Gohan and Videl's class followed a pattern of Engrish words representing items of stationery;
- I didn't immediately find a reference/remember that specific girl was already called Erasa;
- I just made up an Engrish word for what was supposed to be an /original/ character that also happened to be a high school girl, as a homage to that pattern, using the word 'eraser' as a base.

So it was just an episode of convergence. Well, more than one person can have the same first name, so I suppose it's fine, if slightly confusing. Sorry for that!
