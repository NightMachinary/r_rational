There was a discussion a month or two ago about ways to utilise a totally indestructible object. Seems to me that it must either have perfect elasticity, which means it could store arbitrary amounts of kinetic energy, or else perfect rigidity, which... I'm not sure of all the ways that would break our normal understanding of physics.
