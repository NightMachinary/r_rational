I recall some supplementary factoid somewhere that stated a damaged dragonball is restored to normal either after a wish is made, or after the cooldown year is up. This was to explain Roshi and Yajirobe apparently making them fit on necklaces. I think it came from Toriyama, but it really doesn't help answer the question, since how can they block a dodonpa but be pierced by presumably weaker, mundane means? How could they heal after the year if being shattered makes wish-granting impossible? Does that render it inert as though a wish were made?

Sometimes, Toriyama's out-of-panel tidbits just make things /more/ confusing. See also: "tails are recessive," which would mean that either Chichi is a Saiyan, or Saiyans and Earthlings are more closely related than the fact that they can reproduce would suggest on its own.
