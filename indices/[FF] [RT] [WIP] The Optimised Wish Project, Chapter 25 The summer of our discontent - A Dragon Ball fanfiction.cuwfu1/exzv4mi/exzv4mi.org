And then Goku used what he learned in this chapter to invent the Taiyouken independently from Tenshinhan, and their inevitable encounter wherein both variants are demonstrated will be kinda awkward, depending on what mood Ten is in at the time. :)

The full magnitude of how much crap they're in, just for being in this universe, is one of those things that reminds me of the author's note from HPMoR that said something like: "To my knowledge, no manuscript has ever been returned with a message from the editor saying 'this villain is too powerful and needs to be weakened.'" It being the Dragonworld... Dragonverse? Zenoverse? ... dampens that somewhat, because the solution in the original was to get really mad and hit things really hard. It makes the tension less "can they win?", and more "can the author make it work in a satisfying way that feels right by the original, while still being more rational?" Which seems kinda unfair, but it is an illustration of how much better tension works in this fic, since it takes threats seriously.
