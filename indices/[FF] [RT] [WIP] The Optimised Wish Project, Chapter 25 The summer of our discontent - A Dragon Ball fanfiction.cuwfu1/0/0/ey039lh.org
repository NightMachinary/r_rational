Dragon World is usually the accepted term in my experience. I think the original also had some actually quite interesting parts in terms of tension and struggles other than straight up combat. The first part of the Namek arc comes to mind, where Gohan and Krillin have to act stealthily and build alliances with Namekians under the threat of much stronger enemies they have no hope to fend off in a direct confrontation. But in the end, it always boiled down to "and then Goku punched people really really hard", which while it made for some pretty spectacular fights, yeah, it's not always super compelling from a narrative viewpoint.

I think all shounen manga that came after learned that lesson and integrated it in their plot, giving greater relevance to characters other than the protagonist and conflicts other than straight up brawling. Then of course many came up with their own sort of problems, but that's another story.
