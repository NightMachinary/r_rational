I've gotta say, I like this fic a lot better than most "rational" fanfics. Usually, I feel like the phrase "rational fanfic" translates to "come watch this precocious child conquer the world with the super power of being able to name logical fallacies!" It tends to result in a protagonist that's pretty flat, makes the rest of the characters look very stupid, and causes the story as a whole to come off as rather soapboxy.

This story isn't like that. Goku and Bulma are both pretty smart, but not in the traditional "rational fanfic" way of ranting about being rational while everyone else looks on in awe. Goku's a deep thinker more interested in the philosophical than the material who tends to get lost in his own head, and as a result he's usually fascinated by other people's ideas and arguments, more interested in hearing them out and learning more about them than proving them wrong. Bulma is, in many ways, his opposite. Brash, headstrong, and quick tempered, she has very little patience for people who won't see things her way or help her achieve her goals. They're both complex, interesting characters who are smart, but are also /more/ than just "that smart kid." They help explore the idea of "what if this setting actually made sense" while also having their own stories and conflicts, instead of being reduced to just mouthpieces for the author.

Basically, I really like what you're doing here. Keep up the good work!
