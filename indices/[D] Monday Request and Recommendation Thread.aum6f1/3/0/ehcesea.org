Have you guys read non-Russian greats? In particular, Polish sci-fi/'hard fantasy' authors that I'd expect to have good Russian translations:

- Stanislaw Lem (I don't think he had an unimpressive book)
- Jacek Dukaj (Other Songs was translated as Иные песни; I don't know if Ice was translated, quick google only finds Ukrainian and Bulgarian releases ;/)
- Janusz A. Zajdel (Limes Inferior, translated as Предел)

Also, I bought an audiobook reader for my granpa a while ago, as his eyesight is also going. Not sure how good/available russian audiobooks are... But there's simple readers out there like Ace Milestone that can be used by feeling alone.
