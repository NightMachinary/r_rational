I think I was vague enough and the events happen early enough that it's not that big of a spoiler. Also I was on mobile and always forget how to do spoilers. But anyways the events are:

First when he killed Quirrel. He didn't know Quirrel was evil at the time, so that was really just cold blooded murder. Next was when he invaded the ministry with Hermoine who drank the luck potion, although it's strongly implied Hermoine's luck made Harry kill people so she could be convinced he's the evil one not her.
