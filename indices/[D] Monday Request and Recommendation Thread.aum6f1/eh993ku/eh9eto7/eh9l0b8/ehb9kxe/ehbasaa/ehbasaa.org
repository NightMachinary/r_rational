  How can a story in which the main antagonist and the main protagonist have become the same person remain on the rails of canon??

By the same mechanism most "alternate character interpretation" fanfictions do it: a bit of contrivance. The same happens in "Oh no, not again!" (Harry's 20-something mind travels back to his 11 y.o. body), "The Arithmancer" (Hermione is a genius of maths and thus spellcrafting, and effectively becomes the protagonist of the series) and "The Changeling" (Ginny Weasley is sorted in Slytherin). In all these cases you'd expect major divergences but the plot beats instead end up remaining more or less the same. It works better for comedic/parody stories IMHO because it's never about finding it all believable, in fact the contrivances themselves can be funny if lampshaded.
