SPOILERS: So basically Harrymort hears the philosopher stone is in the mirror and goes down to get it. Quirrel is already there and tries to attack him but Harry instantly kills him and Harrymort obsesses over the fact he'll get in trouble. Dumbledore later tells Harrymort that it is fine that he killed Quirrel because he did it out of love to a confused Harry.

This bit is funnier cause when they meet again in the 4th book the resurrected Voldemort is pissed that Harry killed him while Harry says it isn't his fault since he didn't k ow Voldemort was possessing him at the time.

If you read five chapters in it really gets funny but I understand if the humor isn't your cup of tea.
