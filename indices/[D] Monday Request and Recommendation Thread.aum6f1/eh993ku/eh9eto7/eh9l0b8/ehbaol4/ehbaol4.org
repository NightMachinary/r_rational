It's never actually made super clear whether it's really Voldermort though? It may be that a bit of Voldie's personality and memories rubbed off Harry, but I think it's Hermione who suggests it might as well just be that Harry is his own person anyway, distinct enough from Voldemort to not count as a literal mind clone? More of a mind-merge than an overwriting.

But yeah, Seventh Horcrux /is/ hilarious.
