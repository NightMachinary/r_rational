  I read it more like some kind of personality disorder. Voldemort's consciousness got absorbed by Harry. I don't remember Harry doing anything evil, he just interprets his actions as such. That just looks like his inner monologue satisfies the mind subagent which is Voldemort, but all his intentions and actions are actually good hearted.<!
