Thanks for the recommendations! I've decided to give reading a webcomic a go, the images are loading a bit slowly would this just be due to my poor internet connection? Or is there a way I can reduce quality of images all have them all load while I'm reading the first page? I'm reading the boy who fell. Thanks
