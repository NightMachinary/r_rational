You know, I noticed that back when I first read The Boy Who Fell but I just though it was something wrong with my conection. I didn't have the fastest internet back then. Since both of us have the problem, and I still have it now, I guess it must be the websites fault. I am not supper tech savy so there is probably a better way of doing this than what I am about to say.

The best solution I have found is to cover your screen in some way so you can't see the page*, go the start of the next chapter, and then hit the 'previous' link over and over untill you get to the start of the current chapter to load all the pages for that chapter, then use the Go back button go back though the pages this time in the right order. This method is a pain in the ass, and dosen't work all the time, to the point that it's probably not even worth it depending on how much you hate the loading times.

*Not strictly necessary as if you click fast enough you can go the the previous page before the currant on loads but doing that is safer as it stops spoilers. The best way of covering the screen is makeing the window smaller.
