I've just finished reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11015476/1/Event-Horizon-Book-1-Autumn-s-Frontier][Event Horizon Book 1: Autumn's Frontier]], part of a series of fanfictions that explore the idea of a lot of fantasy properties existing as different planets in a system that gets eventually explored by future humans. This one focuses on the Game of Thrones world (the others are Lord of the Rings, Warhammer 40K, and I think Avatar TLAB). It's nice and introduces some interesting deviations from canon as well as a light satire of colonialism, but the writing is occasionally a bit eyeroll inducing (specifically, the many 20th and 21st century pop culture references that you wouldn't expect to appear so much as they do), and unfortunately, the series as a whole is incomplete and seems abandoned.

This has awakened my interest though - are there any other good recommendations about *modern/sci-fi military forces and magic fantasy empires* interacting? Preferably complete, and preferably about interesting, balanced interactions, not just "tanks roflstomp everything". Either fanfiction or original works.
