I'm happy that someone reposted it after the original owner took it down, because I am not a Deletionist.

But. This one did not age well at all.

I haven't gotten to Harry's third year yet (the year where Neville enters Hogwarts as a first year) and so far:

- Ollivander sells Harry the Elder Wand
- Harry is an unregistered cat Animagus
- 6th-year Tonks has the hots for Uncle Remus Lupin, /still/
- Gringotts lets Harry do pretty much with his money via mail order, including at age 11 buying Remus a building in Knockturn Alley
