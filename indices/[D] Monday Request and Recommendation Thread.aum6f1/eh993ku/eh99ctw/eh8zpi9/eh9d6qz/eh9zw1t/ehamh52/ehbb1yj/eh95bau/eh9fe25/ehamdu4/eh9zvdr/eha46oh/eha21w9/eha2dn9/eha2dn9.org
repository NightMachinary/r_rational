Ah, OK. I really enjoy the Optimalverse and was hoping it might be similar in some way. :)

I did read some Hunger Games fanfiction by several authors that all formed a coherent universe (it was the first novel told from all the other Tributes' perspectives essentially), and though they were good and all I wouldn't say they'd be of interest to anyone who wasn't like me in 2012 and really wanted to devour all the Hunger Games related content she could. (If anyone does want to find it though I found it in the TVtropes recommendation pages).
