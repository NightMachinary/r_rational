I'm looking for recommendations for (mostly) pop-sci books in Russian (translated or otherwise) for my grandpa, whose primary interests are in space and cosmonautics (a few more details [[https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/etu2s/i_was_born_in_shchigry_ru_in_1932_i_worked_as_a/][here]]). Would also be happy to accept fiction or other non-fiction book recommendations -- probably sci-fi, preferably, but fantasy, romance, etc. also work, so long as they're good. Translated web-fiction would also work, but would be less preferred -- he doesn't care much for e.g. the sorts of themes liked by this sub, and webfic generally lacks the polish of professionally translated / edited works.

Specifically, this is all part of daily "homework" I assign him. On my daily walk into work, I'll call my grandparents up for a 10-20 minute chat, and to keep things fresh and interesting, I've stipulated my grandpa has to read each day a handful of pages from one of several books of my choosing. These tend to be translations of English books I read and enjoyed in highschool, since later reads are more specialized and niche, and he's very well read wrt the Russian "Greats" so anything I can offer there would be old hat. I think it's maybe been helpful in keeping keeping his mind sharper; hard to say... (he's in his 90s... I also make him solve mechanical block puzzles, assemble lego figurines (e.g. the recent Saturn V one), and so on, and otherwise he keeps fairly active with gardening, walking around a lot, etc.). Books that I've gotten for him so far include:

*The Martian (Марсианин)*

Stardust (Звездная пыль)

The Martian Chronicles (Марсианские Xроники)

The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Автостопом по Галактике)

The Restaurant at the End of the Universe (Ресторан у конца Вселенной)

The rest of the HGttG, I think (Автостопом по Галактике. Опять в путь)

The Ancestor's Tale (Рассказ предка)

The Demon-Haunted World (Мир, полный демонов : Наука - как свеча во тьме)

*Contact (Контакт)*

A Briefer History of Time (Кратчайшая история времени)

The Selfish Gene (Эгоистичный ген)

XKCD's What If (А что, если?...)

Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! (Вы, конечно, шутите, мистер Фейнман!)

Surface Details (Несущественная деталь)

Dune (Дюна)

Red Mars (Красный Марс)

Blue Mars (Голубой Марс)

Green Mars (Зеленый Марс)

*Cosmos (Космос: Эволюция Вселенной, жизни и цивилизации)*

Pale Blue Dot 2E (Голубая точка. Космическое будущее человечества)

Bolded entries are ones he's especially enjoyed.

Also, a specific book request: I tried yesterday to find a translation of Mary Roach's "Packing for Mars", since I think it'd be right up his alley (I've not read it, though). I think the Russian translation is Обратная сторона космонавтики, for some reason. Can anyone find me a lead (I'm not super familiar with the Russian-speaking internet, and I know there are Russian-speaking posters here, in case some have inroads to possible options)? Either a (less-sketchy) place where I could buy it to ship to a US address, or a digital file (sorry if the latter request is not allowed, mods! Unfortunately, grandpa's vision is failing, and he's way too pigheaded to 1) wear any of the reading glasses I've bought him, 2) use any of the magnifying sheet's we've gotten him, 3) use any of the e-reader or tablet's we've gotten him that let you arbitrarily magnify text. So despite having purchased all of the above, I've now taken to just printing them out blown up 3-5x and bound in large 3 ring binders. For a physical book, I'd probably just order it to myself and then digitize it :S. Let me know if I should remove the sentence before the parenthetical pls).

Also, on a related note, he requests that I watch movies / television shows he's enjoyed in exchange. However, my wife's Russian is pretty poor (she's learning it well! but not yet fluent), and I don't have time to watch them without her, so we need versions with English subs/dubs. I'm generally decent at locating these, but can't seem to find a good copy of "The Adjutant of His Excellency" (Адъютант его превосходительства). There's a good Russian-only copy [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZODLHs6LNoE][up on Youtube]], but the auto-generated subs are pretty bad. Any help would be appreciated!
