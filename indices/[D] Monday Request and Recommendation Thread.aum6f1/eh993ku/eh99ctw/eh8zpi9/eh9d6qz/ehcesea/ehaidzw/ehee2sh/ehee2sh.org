Thank you for the recommendations! I'll give them a thought, although I think a Pokemon Fanfic hardly seems appropriate for his interests... ;p it's been a while since I read the original, and I'm not sure how much he actually enjoys biology (he had to drop Ancestor's Tale a few hundred pages in, and iirc didn't care much for The Selfish Gene, and those are written explicitly for perhaps-not-quite-lowest-common-denominator popular audiences).

I have not read any Cold-War-themed books with him -- it's generally not a subject we talk too much about. I'll take it under consideration, too.

  Your relationship with your grandfather seems awesome! The most important predictors of elderly quality of life are socialization and exercise. Mentally challenging tasks are great, and gardening is fantastic since it combines exercise and responsibility.

Yeah, he's very active for his age -- 5-10 years ago he was actively deteriorating -- turns out due to multiple fractures of his hip/femur. Some surgeries later and he's up and about again, walking miles each day like it's nothing (although with occasional dizzy spells / falls -- nothing too damaging yet, thankfully).

RE: other healthy habits -- I try to bug him to eat better (esp. a diverse array of high-fiber veggies), but living in another state I can't exert too much control over his diet, and while grandma cooks a decent variety of food for him she's not at all keen to argue with his personal dietary decisions either (which otherwise consist of bread, butter, and pigfat (salo)).
