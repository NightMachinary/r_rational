Weird one, but have you read [[https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/][Pact]] by Wildbow?\\
The inciting incident is that Rose Thorburn, lawyer and inhabitant of Hillsglade House, dies. The residents of Jacob's Bell have been waiting for this for a long time, because they hope her heir will sell the house, allowing the town to expand and finally prosper.

Blake Thorburn never expected to be named heir, since Rose specifically stipulated that one of her granddaughters would inherit. However, when his cousin Molly, the first heir, is murdered, he is next in line.

He soon finds out his grandmother was not /just/ a lawyer, and her... other occupations has made her - and now him - a lot of very powerful enemies.\\
Turns out she was a Demonologist. And now scorcerers, Chronomancers, Enchanters, and Fae are out for his blood.

It's not... /too/ rational, but in a believable way. People sometimes behave according to certain stereotypes, because the universe literally rewards them for doing so.
