[[https://www.boywhofell.com/comic/ch00p00][The boy who fell]] is an enjoyable web comic about a kid called ren who gets draged down to hell and has to fight in a grand tordoment in order to return to the human world. The art is very good for a web comic as well, on par with most professional manga, and in the later chapters are even coloured. While it's not really rational there are some good puzzles and clever bits in there. It's also one of those stoys that treads the line between dark as fuck while still haveing a fun and upbeat tone.

[[https://project-apollo.net/mos/mos000.html][A miracle of science]] is another great webcomic. In the world of the future, where Science Related Memetic Disorder is a condition that turns people into mad scientists, the story follows benjamin prester who tracks down and deals with mad scientists and his new partner in the form of a body of the hive mind of mars. It's main problem is the art is a little janky but if you can look past that it is a great read.

[[https://mspfa.com/?s=132&p=1][Beginner guide to the end of the universe]] is the best MS paint Quest I have ever read, especialy at the beginning. I don't wan't to say too much as that would spoil it.

So I while ago I read [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/puella-magi-adfligo-systema.2538/][Puella Magi Adfligo Systema]] a shity SV quest that starts of good and then very quickly just becomes boring. The main thing that stuck me was how, at times, the main character comes across as a delusional benevolent psychopath. This was the most interesting part of the story to me. Her way of negotiating with people she disagreed with was telling them that she is right and they are wrong and, due to how powerful she was, they would join her, which renforced her delusion. All of this was due to poor writeing but it got me thinking of [[https://lsdell.com/table-of-contents/][Taint]] and [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-prison-of-glass-worm-cyoa.486424/][A Prison of Glass]] both of who feature likeable nut jobs as the protag. Do you have any recomandations for stoys with slightly insane but likeable main characters.
