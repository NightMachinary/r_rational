The Winningverse is a large collection(hundreds of thousands of words) of My Little Pony fanfiction that's all set in the same universe. There are 3 main authors who work closely together and write most of stories and their word is final on what's official canon, but there's also a lot of other authors who write stories in the universe as well. There's a wide variety of genres in it from semi-random comedy to slice of life to adventure, but it all maintains the same worldbuilding. I don't /particularly/ recommend it unless you're already a fan of My Little Pony fanfiction, I enjoy it but it's not super-amazing or anything.

Are there any similar expanded universes in other fandoms?
