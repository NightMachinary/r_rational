[[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/UndocumentedFeatures][Undocumented Features]] is a lot like your Winningverse, though way older.

I think [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/Glowfic][Glowfic]] and the Infinite Time Loop fics on Spacebattles would probably fit too.

Got into none of them, though. It's already hard enough to find good fanfic writers in the wild, let alone a team of them, and all co-written fics I've found have some big flaws.
