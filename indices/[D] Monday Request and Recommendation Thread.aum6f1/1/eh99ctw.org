So yesterday I read *[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23173/the-simulacrum][The Simulacrum]]* on Royal Road, our protagonist Leonard wakes up with amnesia and then does his best to rationally figure out the slightly odd world he finds himself in.

Light spoiler description would be Leonard quickly learns he is the idiot friend of the protagonist in a harem romance comedy. The world closely follows narrative tropes from the genre and he uses his genre savviness to avoid awkward situations that typically arise out of these stories, and figure out whats going on and why he is there

Mild spoiler description Leonard begins to trip some romance flags and ends up inadvertently in his own harem romance comedy situation by accident

Heavy spoiler description Turns out he is actually in a supernatural shonen harem romance comedy, so add magic battling stuff too. Also Leonard has random superpowers too

Overall I recommend the story it has a /mostly/ rational MC that was interesting and funny enough to keep me engaged through all the current chapters.
