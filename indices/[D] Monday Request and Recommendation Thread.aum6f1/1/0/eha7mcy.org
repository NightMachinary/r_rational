One downside to The Simulacrum, post first interlude (about halfway right now): it eventually seems like the main character starts acting like a stereotypical dense romantic comedy protagonist. It's not handled particularly well by the author so far, but the main character does note that he's aware of people's feelings for him; I think what's going on is that he just doesn't want to deal with it. However, I would have preferred that he take his own advice and deal with the burgeoning situation with the mature approach that he normally advises other people take

Aside from that, it's definitely worth reading; it's like the best fanfic of a romcom that never existed.
