I think GeneraIKenoA is simply using it as an example of an [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse][Expanded Universe]] where an author or more is doing some serious world-building beyond what exists in the world of the series and there exists some lengthy stories from him to enjoy. A fair number of them tend to also be AUs.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/group/203805/the-triptych-continuum][The Triptych Continuum]] is one example in MLP:FiM which features a version of Equestria where all of the episodes of the first three seasons still occurred, but in a more realistic manner by often examining the /consequences/ of many of the episodes' events. One such example is Spike's greed growth results in him having to work to regain Ponyville's trust instead of everyone accepting him back immediately after he transformed back from being a berserk monstrous dragon.

[[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TranscendenceAU][Transcendence AU]] takes place after most of Gravity Falls where a plot by Bill Cipher to merge the dream world with the real world fails, but in the process Dipper becomes a demon.
