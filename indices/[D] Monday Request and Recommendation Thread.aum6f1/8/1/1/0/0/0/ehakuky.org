This is one of them for sure: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6499081/1/The_Flaw_in_the_Plan]]

And from the author's notes of the linked story:

#+begin_quote
  This story is intended to be a companion piece to the fanfics "A Fox's View" and "Love is a Battlefield" by Caisha702, as well as "Cripple" by be-nice-to-nerds, all of which can be found on this website. Many of the "missing moments" scenes (as well as the non-canon names outside of District 3) are borrowed from these stories (and associated one-shots) in order to generate continuity.

I think there are a few more fanfics in that "universe", which you can probably find by looking through authors' favourites sections.
