You could read "On the Orgin of Species" for pop-sci, the examples he uses are fun to talk about and some of the theories seem absurd now.

Sci-fi: The "Ian Cormac" series by Neal Asher might be of interest for sci-fi, it has the most interesting "progenitor" space race I've ever read and a solid universe with only two major setting weak points in my opinion.

I personally haven't read them but I've seen a lot of recommendations of "The Expanse" series here as a harder sci-fi series.

Question: Have you read any cold war veiled books with him? There's a lot of literature of that's much better done than Animal Farm but feature similar underlying themes of west vs east and capitalism vs communism. I'm not suggesting you do this, just wondering.

Your relationship with your grandfather seems awesome! The most important predictors of elderly quality of life are socialization and exercise. Mentally challenging tasks are great, and gardening is fantastic since it combines exercise and responsibility.

The only thing I would add is to make sure he's drinking enough water and encourage him to eat fruit, it sounds silly but water is a major nutrient of concern for elderly populations. High coffee consumption is correlated with good outcomes if he's a coffee drinker(hydrating, socializing, caffeine, and antioxidants are some theorys why). Fruit is a big one also, keeping nutrient and calorie intake up in the elderly is difficult since chewing and taste get worse with age. You might try some different fruits with him for fun, it's amazing how many different ones you can find at specialty/ethnic stores and older generations appreciate it even more.
