I can't help you with the literature stuff, but I might be able to help with the subtitles! I use [[https://www.opensubtitles.org/]] , but I'm not sure how much Russian content it has subbed on there. I don't know about windows but on Linux it's a VLC plug in so you just open VLC and click "download subtitles" and then it downloads the subtitle automagically, and often it's already synced (though you can sync it manually). Otherwise, have you considered a VPN and Russian netflix?
