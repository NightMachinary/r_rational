Here's a few that meet the funny insane character requirement(warning - many are incomplete or dead):

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21410/super-minion][super minion]] is a good ongoing fiction, defining his insanity without going into spoilers is hard but I can say it is pretty funny.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/i-just-love-killin-worm-rick-and-morty-crossover.446513/][I Just Love Killin' (Worm/Rick and Morty Crossover)]] I think this one was funny? can't remember. Good regardless, and while the main character isn't insane, the alien in her head is.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-dalek-lantern-doctor-who-green-lantern.225074/][A Dalek Lantern (Doctor Who/Green Lantern)]] again, can't remember if this was funny or not, and the main character isn't really insane, just an alien. Still good regardless, though it is incomplete and hard to navigate.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-womans-political-record-youjo-senki-saga-of-tanya-the-evil.660569/page-151#post-55238560][A Young Woman's Political Record (Youjo Senki/Saga of Tanya the Evil)]] I think this one is kinda niche, but I enjoyed it immensely.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/19610/dah-ork-life][Dah Ork Life!]] If you can stand Self Inserts and like warhammer, this is for you.
