I loved it as well. You might also like another Tanya fanfic, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12429349/1/The-Leader][The Leader]]. IMHO, A Young Woman's Political Record is more true to the original material and better written, but there's significantly more content in The Leader. Both follow separate paths, but towards the same end.
