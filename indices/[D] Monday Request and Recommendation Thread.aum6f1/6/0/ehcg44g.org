Here's a good one, unfortunately not complete but updated regularly:

It focusses much more on character interactions and not so much on "tank stomp", and is fairly well written so far. The sci-fi forces operate under real constraints and limitations, have actual motivation and are fairly well fleshed out.

That said, they're not the nicest bunch around, which by GoT standards makes them real stand-up people.
