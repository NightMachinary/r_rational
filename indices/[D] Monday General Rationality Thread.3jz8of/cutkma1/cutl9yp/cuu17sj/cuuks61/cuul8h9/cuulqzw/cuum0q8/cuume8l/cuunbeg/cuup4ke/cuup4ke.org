The only bot we've got is [[/u/AutoModerator]], which was created by [[/u/Deimorz]] ages ago and is now baked into reddit itself (because he got hired as an admin). More at [[/r/AutoModerator/]]. If you'd like information on coding/hosting, go check out [[/r/redditdev]].

(It's possible that we could configure AutoMod to run Nomic, or that you could configure it within another subreddit.)
