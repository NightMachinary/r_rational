I've played around with it a fair bit over on [[/r/3Dprinting]], we get a lot of spam. I've also looked at it's code a very small amount.

It's pretty procedural in what it can do, and doesn't have any recursion or way to store state.

So pretty sure. It's not so much that there's features that make it not turing-complete, more that it lacks any mechanism for establishing loops and passing data around.

The regexes you embed into it might be a bit closer, but evidence suggests that they're not, and they definitely aren't from a practical point of view.
