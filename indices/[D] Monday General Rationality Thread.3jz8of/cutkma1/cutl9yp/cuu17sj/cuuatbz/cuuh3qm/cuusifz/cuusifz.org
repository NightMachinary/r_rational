We all can be, on subjects we don't study in-depth. With social stuff it's especially hard, since the real reality-function generating the apparent data is, you know, the human heart and mind, which are complex and fickle things.

Anyway, if someone wants to explain: how are most conservative and reactionary ideologies /not/ Anti-Spiral? I mean, neoliberalism is a Spiral Nemesis wearing an expensive suit and looking to tile the universe in call options. A Spiral Nemesis is still Spiral, so I can kinda understand it.

But attempting to look at people who claim to be protecting their cultures and humanity and they're /not Spiral at all/, but actually /Anti-Spiral/, does not make any fucking sense.

(FOR NON-TTGL FANBOYS: "Spiral" can be taken to mean, roughly, "lifeist, in favor of life, growth, learning, freedom, evolution, and self-improvement", while "Anti-Spiral" indicates the specific belief, which I'd once considered a fictional strawman, that /all those things called Spiral are disastrously dangerous and must be suppressed or destroyed for the sake of avoiding the universal destruction they inevitably cause./ It's as if you viewed normal life-forms, at least the ones not under your command/optimization, as the moral equivalent of paperclip maximizers. What. The. Fuck.)
