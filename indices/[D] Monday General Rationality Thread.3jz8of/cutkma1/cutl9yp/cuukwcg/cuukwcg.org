  Politics is SPIDERS
#+end_quote

Yeah yeah... But come on man what kind of meme is that anyway? I love spiders! Everybody should love spiders. If I was cursed to mutate into a man sized Arthropod of my choice I would probably choose a species of spider.

We should make the national animal spiders, change the national anthem to be about spiders, fill the schools with spiders, while teaching the controversy about whether the universe was created by The Great Orb Weaver of all Things or not, only allow the immigration of spiders, and outlaw the abortion of innocent baby spiders.

Wait- crap. yeah I guess you guys were right about politics after all.
