So, how do we move in that direction? Concrete, actionable goals?

One approach would be to acquire a bunch of income, and then do micro-grants and other funding for small projects. Local infrastructure projects and such forth.

If the goal is explicitly to make more participatory economics, a friend of mine has plans for a platform similar to gratipay or patreon, but with networks of fund transfer. Like fluid democracy for economic power.

I'm not entirely certain what it provided over gratipay, aside from not being run by crazy people who are willing to implement some bad bad ideas involving anonymity for the sake of their SJW contingent.

But I digress. General world-domination strategies should commence.
