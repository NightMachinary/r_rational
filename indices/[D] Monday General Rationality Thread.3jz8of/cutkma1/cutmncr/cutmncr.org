Oh, boy. I'm going to concur with [[/u/CaraCompanion2016]], and say that everyone here should just pretend we've been appointed /EVIL OVERLORD/ of our respective areas. Calling it Evil Overlording rather than governance at least keeps things a little non-spidery.

Now, that said, I'm promptly going to make things a bunch more democratic. You see, as Overlord, my biggest problem is /information/. Sure, I'm supremely benevolent and want to fill the world with happiness, light, and other nice things, but in actual fact, what I really need is /data/.

Who needs what? Who wants what? How are people relating to each-other? (That's especially given that such relationships form /at least/ a double-digit percentage of the proper /a posteriori/ definition of Fun.) How can I more efficiently convert negentropy into Fun? Who's dying, where, of what, and what's the most efficient way to put a stop to that?

This is why I'm implementing a more participatory government, and a more participatory economy too. Yes, that's right, it's time for some democratic socialist utopia imposed by an evil dictator, yaaaaay! And then we're going to gather a few other pieces of information, namely: what're the biggest [[http://strikemag.org/bullshit-jobs/][bullshit jobs]], [[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/explainer-how-economic-rents-affect-inequality/][rents]] and [[http://www.economicsonline.co.uk/Market_failures/Externalities.html][negative externalities]], and how can I tax or expropriate those away in order to fund the massive machine of scientific and technological research I need to actually accomplish my nerdy goals like renewable energy for everyone, a sustainable high standard of living for everyone, space colonization, abolishing death, etc?

But the point being, if I can organize things so that people mostly take care of their own basic needs, and manage to signal what their unmet needs are when they /can't/ take care of it themselves, that gives me the most efficient way of meeting those needs. No matter how benevolent I am, I can't actually be everywhere everywhen, and in fact, going for the "Godhood Victory" tends to make people extremely uncomfortable and give them a sense of being existentially overshadowed. In fact, one important subgoal is going to be coming up with a solid, a posteriori definition of /agency/ so that I can proceed to maximize the agency of the citizenry on individual and collective levels, since that will /mostly/ save me a bunch of effort, and also generates much more /morally interesting/ problems when it goes wrong.

Since my endgame /isn't/ to spend eternity as some kind of god-emperor of mankind in the first fucking place, I don't really want that anyway. People don't think through how /un-fun/ that would be, especially after your son betrays you and sticks your rotting zombie on a golden throne. I ultimately want /companions/ on the incredible journey that is life in the universe as a living, growing, learning sapient creature, and I /especially/ want to make sure I can engineer some kind of anti-inductivity into my subjects and companions so that we neatly produce Fun for /each-other/ rather than having to constantly conquer exponentially moar and moar raw space, mass-energy, and negentropy just to keep novelty levels up. In fact, that whole latter condition simply /cannot be met/ if I constantly keep other people below my own level.

This will probably mean quite a few centuries of working behind the scenes to infuse every major cultural meta-narrative, from religions to economic ideologies, with a bit more Spiral Spirit, but a race of powerful, spirited equals whom I can trust /as such/ rather than trust only from a position of dominance is worth it in the end.

TL;DR: THE FUN! WILL LAST! /FOREVER!/ AHAHAHAHHAHAAAAAA!!!!!
