It's Tuesday, so I might not get a whole lot of replies, but I have a politics question.

Have you found the whole feminism/SJW/gamergate/whatever debate to be entirely one sided? Recently someone who's opinion I respect by osmosis (they're part of a group that generally makes good decisions) very firmly came out as pro social-justice-warrior.

I'm not asking for a debate on the topic, partially because it's not something I really discuss for concern of SPIDERS (also witch burning), but I would be interested in hearing if you've found the debate to be completely one sided, or if you have problems with SJW tactics or goals.
