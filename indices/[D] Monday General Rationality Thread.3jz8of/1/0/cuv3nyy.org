My experience of this whole shebang on Reddit and other places was one of walking into a room and finding people hurling molotov cocktails at each other and blasting blood curdling insults. Oh and SPIDERS EVERYWHERE.

And this question seems to be trying to find the group inclination on a political issue, by asking about perceived balance of evidence from others. Well, why base a decision on that? [[/r/rational][r/rational]] isn't some kind of arbiter on Rational Thinking, or of a Good-and-Righteous political platform.

If the question is about balance of evidence, well, go imagine yourself as that-label-you're-using-to-represent-those-who-disagree-with-you, spend some time collecting the strongest evidence possible (like half hour at least), and /desperately/ try to counter your own position. That may approach a teensy bit of the sufficient amount of de-biasing and honest assessment of evidence that's probably required.

Tbh, I haven't had the time to do that and such hostility as I usually see makes the whole thing unpleasant and seeming like it requires significant personal effort to expend concentrated thought on. Accordingly, I don't hold an informed/strong opinion yet.
