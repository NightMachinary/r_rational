From what I've seen, it's outrage culture on both sides, combined with some in-group/out-group dynamics that have made both sides pretty damn toxic. A bunch of keyboard warriors have found a thing that they can be shitty to each other about. Because the people who are the most outraged have the most to talk about, they're the ones who dominate the discussion. This is in addition to bad conversation driving out good and extremists driving out moderates. It's nothing that's unique to what their particular spat is about.
