Is the emotional state known as /desperation/ ever a good state for a human being to be in, in real life?

Why or why not? Thinking of it as a consequentialist / munchkin, is there some /optimal/ amount to experience, say 15 minutes per day, or one 24 hour day per year, or something like that?

Thoughts:

1. Desperation implies stress. So for heart health and neurological health reasons, it's probably bad to have too much. But then, exercise also causes stress, so perhaps it's fine to have a little.
2. Desperate people are easier to sell to. Does that imply it makes you suggestible and vulnerable to trickery? Or is it just that one is more inclined to make a purchasing decision / rational trade off (to the best of their ability to determine such a thing) in general?
3. Desperation can make a person stop putting off resolution to some kinds of conflict, e.g walk away from a bad situation like abusive job or relationship.
4. Bad decisions made out of desperation can trigger additional desperation when the results show up. So perhaps there are cycles where desperation/stress is maintained over the long term, resulting in more harm than if the person were to completely avoid the feeling of desperation. For example, a person may initially borrow money out of desperation, then miss the payments, and later borrow money at a higher interest rate due to their lack of credit.
5. Desperation is painful. So hedonic utilitarianism might imply that it should be eliminated in an ideal world. But then, using it to overcome a source of suffering (aging, etc.) would still be justifiable (assuming it is the most effective tactic).
6. Acts performed out of desperation can be seen as less bad, or more heroic. For example, stealing a loaf of bread is acceptable to prevent one's family from starving, but evil if done merely to save money.
