My first thought was of course it can be good: Desperate times call for desperate +measures+ /emotions/. Desperation is very good at convincing a person to take immediate and direct action on simple and straightforward problems. Yes, there are side effects like bad decisions and being painful in itself, but they aren't necessarily worse than the ultimate results of decision paralysis or other emotional states.

My second thought was that I just skipped half of the question you wanted answered: If we could remove all desperate situations, /should/ we? My gut is saying that small amounts of desperation can be an overall good thing, as it teaches people about themselves and a broader range of human emotions, can give confidence in slightly-less-than-desperate situations, and entirely removing an emotion from human experience is part of a slippery slope that I don't like. My head was reminded of [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/k8/how_to_seem_and_be_deep/][this quote]]:

  At another point in the discussion, a man spoke of some benefit X of death, I don't recall exactly what. And I said: "You know, given human nature, if people got hit on the head by a baseball bat every week, pretty soon they would invent reasons why getting hit on the head with a baseball bat was a good thing. But if you took someone who wasn't being hit on the head with a baseball bat, and you asked them if they wanted it, they would say no. I think that if you took someone who was immortal, and asked them if they wanted to die for benefit X, they would say no."
