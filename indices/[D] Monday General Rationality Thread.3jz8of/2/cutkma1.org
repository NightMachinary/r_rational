I keep contemplating an [[/r/rational]] constitution. I understand that we all probably don't have the same axioms that define the purpose of a government nor I imagine if we were turned into maximisation super-intelligence would the worlds that result from our individual global dominance be the same, which always stops me from posting about it. None the less it feels like that rewriting a government from the ground up in the 21st century can only be beneficial, but I am curious how in particular you guys would do it, if you say woke up one morning as the celebrated beneficial dictator of your country (or some random amalgamation of countries like the African continent that would benefit just from everyone support the same government).
