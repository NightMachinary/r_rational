Hmm, this somehow reminds me of a very interesting game that I haven't yet had the opportunity to play: [[http://legacy.earlham.edu/%7Epeters/writing/nomic.htm][Nomic]].

Here's a small tidbit: "If law-making is a game, then it is a game in which changing the rules is a move. Law-making is more than changing the rules of law-making, of course, and more than a game. But a real game may model the self-amending character of the legal system and leave the rest out. While self-amendment appears to be an esoteric feature of law, capturing it in a game creates a remarkably complete microcosm of a functional legal system."
