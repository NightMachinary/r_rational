Wow, that literally is a game designed by and for rules lawyers.

I'd be curious to see if there is a version of the game which turns away from an antagonistic power play through rules loopholes. It'd be interesting if it alters itself to turn everyone into a cooperative collective that shares points and resources, or some similar mode of play in redefining "winning"
