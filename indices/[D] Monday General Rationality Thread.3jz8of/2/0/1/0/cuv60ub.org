  If the goal is explicitly to make more participatory economics, a friend of mine has plans for a platform similar to gratipay or patreon, but with networks of fund transfer. Like fluid democracy for economic power.

I actually really like this idea.

I mean, I've always wondered what the fuck we could have done with crypto-currencies, for instance, if someone was basing them on participatory-anarchist principles rather than on trying to make digital "gold".

When I was a kid I read [[http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100238350][/Making Mondragon/]] and wanted to start a workers' cooperative when I grew up. Nowadays I rather think that business is /SPIDERS/ and I don't want to deal with it, but it still seems overall like cooperatives and cooperatives-of-cooperatives offer good ways to build participatory, democratic economic institutions without having to pray desperately for The Revolution to come.

On the internet, we've got a thousand gajillion Starving Artists and university students with hobbies. We've also got loads and loads of (sorry to toot my own horn) moderators, curators, and admins who keep sites running. Other than the occasional Patreon account for someone with generous internet-friends, /all/ of this is done /completely unpaid/, while "start-up" businesspeople like the ones running Reddit bring in ad revenue.

Admittedly, /reddit isn't actually profitable/ as an ad-based business, let alone if they had to pay wages to all the moderators!

What would be a way to start and run a community website of some sort as a users' cooperative, with content creators actually getting revenue and owning the site alongside the admins, mods, and whatever other form of active users there might be? There's all kinds of crypto-currency, crypto-ID, and open-source stuff, and I feel like if we somehow put it together with the right kind of legal charter, we could get something that self-sustains at least as well as other websites (eg: runs on a shoestring, always at risk of dying) /but is actually owned by the people who make it work/.
