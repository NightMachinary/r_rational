Are you talking about a "Science is Awesome" epistemic rationality or a "We Will Unite Under a Single Goal" instrumental rationality?

[[http://lesswrong.com/lw/31/what_do_we_mean_by_rationality/]]

I think we'd all agree that #2 gets uncomfortably political, if we have deviating values. (Chances are, you and me actually don't deviate significantly, since we are posters on an Internet forum on "rationality", but our theoretical citizens would.)

To pull Instrumental Rationality values into a "Rational Constitution," I'd like to cite the Atheist mind/Humanist Heart crowd-sourced winners for the "10 non-commandments." It's a great start as a Bill of Rational Rights.

1) Be open-minded and be willing to update your beliefs

2) Strive to understand what is most likely true, not what you believe to be True

3) the Scientific method is the most reliable way to understand the natural world)

4) every person has a right to control over their body

5) God is not necessary to being good or leading a fulfilling life

6) be mindful of your actions and own up to the consequences of your actions

7) [the Golden Rule + awareness of the fundamental attribution error]

8) we are responsible for us, and for the future

9) there is no one right way to live

10) leave the world a better place than you left it

(1&2 are the Litanys of Tarski and Gendlin, 3 gives a shout-out to Bacon, there is an accounting of the fundamental attribution error, with some cultural relativism with notes of tolerance and acceptance... But there might be a direct rejection of the assumptions of #10 by transhumanists who want to make the world the best place ever, because they want to live like they plan to live forever)
