In order to produce a reasonable argument supported by that article, you would have to show that feminism is good and helpful to some while the movements that deride and attack feminism are good and helpful to some. But even then you'd be left with a difficult task of determining whether more harm is being done in the current scenario than would be done if we suppressed one side or promoted the other.

In order to show that it's two sides talking past each other, you would have to demonstrate subsets of the major talking points for each side that are mutually disjoint.

I look forward to reading your results.
