Sorry for the super late reply; unfortunately, it wouldn't. There was a lot of things revealed in the last 30-ish manga chapters that would be needed to understand fully what's happening here.

You could give reading it a try but I don't think it would do much for you other than give a few massive spoilers. Plus the AoT manga's last 30-ish chapters are CRAZY. Super worth a read.
