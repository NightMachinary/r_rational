Not in any variety of English I know about. It's true that "unseen" has a long vowel while "kin" has a short one, but the vowel quality is also different even if similar enough to cause some confusion, particularly as the one in "unseen" only occurs as a long vowel.

You can check this in the vowel section of the Wikipedia article on English phonology.

Alternatively, if you have correct pronunciation you can try saying "kin" and "keen" and see if the root of your tongue moves. "kin" should be more central.
