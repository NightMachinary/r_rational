/Of how brave Harald Cleftface had slain a terrible Troll that preyed on the folk of Trondheim, avenging his brave companions and winning the admiration of all./

Amidst the land of frost and snow,

where neither ferns or mosses grow,

terrible beast prowl'd unseen,

craving the blood of Northern kin.

​

Tis was a Troll of strangest spell,

for if ones eyes on its hide fell,

it turn'd as mist or empty air,

present, alas! if was not there.

​

Many a warrior hath stood its path,

brandishing steel against its wrath,

most disappeared, the others worse,

left naught of them but headless corpse.

​

Tales say the troll was Honor-Bound,

leaping at warriors like frenzied hound,

putting brave hunters in early grave,

but would not hurt a maid or a babe.

​

Along came Harald in bright maile clad,

on a fastest longship one ever had,

with him he brought companions ten,

all battle-forged, Bear-Shirted men.

​

A band of Heroes by Norns Fate-bound,

their black-sailed ship had came a'ground,

a storm of swords had spilled forth,

every man eager to prove his worth.

​

The Troll did saw their weapons fine,

and in its heart plot'd dark design,

to slay them covertly one by one,

till Harald's hird is all undone.

​

First man to die was brave Einar,

who joined the halls of Einherjar,

marked with the Troll's scarlet light,

he dropped butchered without a fight.

​

​

Next came the beast's invisible claw,

and gutted old Rolf from groin to jaw,

spilling his guts on blood-soaked snow,

slaying the man with one savage blow.

​

Soon the scythe came for warrior third,

when Sven was plucked from among the hird,

yanked straight up into the trees,

where all waited him was Hel's final kiss.

​

'Hirdmen haro!' came Harald's bellow,

'brace wall of shields, protect your fellow'!

'The Troll casts spells, and might climb high',

'but comes the morn we'll see it die!'

​

Angered thus, the Troll cast thunder,

and wrought the wall of shields asunder,

between the warriors it lept amidst,

and shed aside its spell of mists.

​

In hearts of men crept icy fear,

to see such awful beast come near,

its hide of stone its hair of snakes,

its clawed paws like razor-rakes.

​

Burst forth did pair of blood-crazed twins,

Eino and Ose, two snow-born Finns,

they stabbed the Troll with mighty knives,

and though they drew blood, they paid their lives.

​

'Witness it men, the fight's not in vain!'

'if the beast bleeds it can be slain!'

roared brave Harald lifting his axe,

to cleave his foe a bloody tax.

​

Spears struck like a swarm of angry bees,

but Bjorn was brought down to his knees,

When troll-cursed blade had pierced his eye,

he died in battle , like heroes die.

​

When Harald dodged a mighty blow,

and landed in a a heap of snow,

he saw that cloak of snowy sheen,

made him to the monster's eyes unseen!

​

Egil the swift and Sigurd fair,

fought the vile creature as a pair,

with Danish axe and spear most swift,

in its defense they found a rift!

​

They gave its belly a nasty gash,

but soon their throats were scarlet -washed,

the troll cast a blade from a sheath on hip,

and sliced their necks in a single whip.

​

The sole survivors Harald and Gorm,

engulfed the troll like winterstorm,

slathered in snow and icy water,

they set their blades on invisible slaughter.

​

​

Thus fell Gorm brave with wounds awashed,

and though the troll was also slashed,

alive it stood, against all reason,

against the laws of Gods, a treason.

​

​

'Face me o beast' great Harald spoke,

'take of your helm, untie the yoke',

'today thou will perish, and shall you die,

let me first look thee in the eye!'

​

The mighty Troll his helm unstrapped,

took of the mask that its face wrapped,

its eyes like stones were gray and firm,

its fanged maw like crab or wyrm.

​

'Thou be one unsightly móðirfokka'

jested thus Harald and a fight broke out,

with stabs and slashes and cuts back and forth,

the Spawn of the Stars and the Son of the North.

​

As blades flew a-flash, and weapons raced,

the Troll's blade cleft Harald's handsome face,

but gravely wounded, Harald ever-swift,

caught the beast's blade with his teeth!

​

To take his advantage to its full,

brave Harald charged like a bull,

pressing beast's own blades against the Troll,

he took a vengeful bloody toll.

​

The star-forged blades cut meat and bone,

the edge by Troll's own magic honed,

sliced its own head quick and clean,

splashing the snow with fae-green sheen.

​

​

'The deed is done' quoth Harald Brave,

and buried the foe in nameless grave,

then gathered his slain men on a pyre,

and gave them to Allfather's fire.

​

Some say, the Troll's own star-born kin,

still lurk the wilderness unseen,

but who would listen to such tale,

time rise the cups and drink some ale!
