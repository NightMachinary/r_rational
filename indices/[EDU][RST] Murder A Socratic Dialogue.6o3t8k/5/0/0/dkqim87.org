The problem with saying "America is already great - the stockmarket is doing fine" is not that there's a problem with the stockmarket, but that it completely fails to reach the average Trump voter, who are justifiably not excited by how well the stock market is doing.

Globalisation has been a huge boon for people in China, for example. And that's great. But you can't expect people in America who suffered from it to vote for you on that account. Making that argument just makes it seem like you're telling people you're not on their side.
