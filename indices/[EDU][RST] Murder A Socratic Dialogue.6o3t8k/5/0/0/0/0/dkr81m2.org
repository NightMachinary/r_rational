Fun fact: Women's happiness has steadily declined since the 1970s. Also, there was like a five-fold increase in the imprisonment of black people between 1980 and 2000. Are you going to tell me it's racist to long for a time when people were happier, the media wasn't lying to you every day, politicians weren't all horrible like they are now, and the country wasn't fighting 6 wars at once for basically no reason?

Let me explain what I mean by the classic consequentialist error: Yes, it seems like you can increase total happiness by harvesting people's kidneys against their will and giving them to others who need it. But if you think about it for a second, it becomes obvious that this would not /actually/ result in better outcomes. In the same way, taking people's jobs and culture away from them and demanding that they're happy because others are doing better now could result in unintended consequences, i.e. Donald Trump being voted into office.

Listen, you just can't expect people to be Jesus. Most humans are selfish creatures who value themselves and their family first of all. If you design policy without taking that into account, you're going to be in for a rude awakening.
