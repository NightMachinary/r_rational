Caplan falls prey here to the classic consequentialist error: Looking only at absolutes instead of deltas. There is a vast difference between not allowing people into your country versus banishing them, just as there is a huge difference between not giving someone any money vs. giving it to them and then stealing it back a few years later. Under this very basic logic, rounding up all the Muslims in the country is wrong, but vetting your immigrants is a-ok.

It's a classic mistake made by both libertarians and liberals / democrats: "Why are you complaining? You have more money now than you used to! Why would you long for the past? You had less stuff then!" Yes, Ms. Democrat, and that's precisely the problem: It's not what you have right now, but whether or not things are getting better. Hope for the future is harder to measure than GDP, but it's a heck of a lot more important when it comes to happiness.
