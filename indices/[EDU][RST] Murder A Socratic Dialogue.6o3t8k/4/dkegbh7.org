There's a fine line between a Socratic dialog and a straw man.

"Spartans are fellow Greeks, and Persians are not, so we should not do things to prevent Spartan crime that we should do to prevent Persian crime" does not imply that you can just redefine "Greek" and make the argument about anyone. "Greek" is a preexisting category; you don't get to pick what goes in it; and if you honestly think being a fellow Greek has no implications for how you should feel or act towards someone, you're not only weird, but weird in a way which only exists in Aspergers patients, sociopaths, and internet-rationalists.

It's also odd that Socrates says that he doesn't care much because he doesn't personally know the victims--why does he think that "personally know" is a meaningful reason to care but "is a fellow Greek" is not?

Also, if I take this argument literally, it's opposed to effective altruism. Socrates is arguing that he shouldn't care about all murders, not that he should care a lot about all murders.
