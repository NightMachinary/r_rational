"Internet rationalists" is not a tribe, it's a description.

Would you be happier if I just said that I didn't find anyone except Internet rationalists, period, who think like that? (It's not as if I go around specifically asking people if they have Aspergers or are sociopaths.) Also, I didn't mention autism.)
