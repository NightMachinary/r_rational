And /my/ point is that you did /not/ make that claim. You did not confine yourself to saying, "No, people don't think that way"; instead you called anyone who thinks that way either autistic, sociopathic, or a member of [tribe I dislike]. Under no sane interpretation can a remark like that be construed as merely claiming that most people don't think that way, and I find your attempts to substitute a less offensive claim extremely icky. Please endeavor to maintain higher standards of discourse.
