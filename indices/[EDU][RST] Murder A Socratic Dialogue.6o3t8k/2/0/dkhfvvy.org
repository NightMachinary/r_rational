Ugh, that entire exchange frustrates me so much. Caplan says that the left hates free markets. EY comes to the rescue and says "no no, the left doesn't /hate/ free markets - they're just too stupid to understand them!" Thanks a bunch, mr. rationalist.

Here, let me try my hand at defining the two sides: The right is afraid of loss of socio-economic cohesion, i.e. as brought about through immigration or radical policies. The left is excited about the potential for socio-economic progress, i.e. as brought about through income redistribution and social justice. One side is young and intuitively risk-taking, the other tends to be older and risk-averse.

And guess what? Both sides have an entirely valid point! Inviting a million unvetted refugees into America ala Germany really does sound incredibly stupid. There really is an income inequality problem in America, and there really is still systemic racism. What irritates me is that both sides constantly try to pretend that the other side's point doesn't even exist: "It's not that Trump voters are all racist - they're just sad that they don't get enough government handouts." The people linked to above somehow fail to understand /either/ perspective.

I'm starting to see why Yudkowsky wrote that politics is the mindkiller. Bloody hell.
