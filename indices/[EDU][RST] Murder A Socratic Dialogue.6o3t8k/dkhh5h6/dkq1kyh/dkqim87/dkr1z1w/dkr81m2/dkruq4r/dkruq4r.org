  Women's happiness has steadily declined since the 1970s. Also, there was like a five-fold increase in the imprisonment of black people between 1980 and 2000.
#+end_quote

I'd be interested in seeing a source for that.

Edit: Forgot to address the bit about black imprisonment, and yes, that's pretty bad. At least we're moving towards an end to the "War on Drugs".

  Are you going to tell me it's racist to long for a time when people were happier, the media wasn't lying to you every day, politicians weren't all horrible like they are now, and the country wasn't fighting 6 wars at once for basically no reason?
#+end_quote

Back when it was just the Pentagon Papers and Watergate and Iran-Contra, or some other time when politicians weren't horrible and we weren't militarily involved elsewhere? Yellow journalism isn't new, either. Although I can believe that some people were happier, so I'll come back to that later. Some I know would attribute it to animus, though I'd argue rose-tinted goggles.

  taking people's jobs and culture away from them
#+end_quote

Doesn't that seem a little melodramatic? Sure, new jobs due to trade aren't necessarily in the same industry/location, but that's why (liberal, at least) consequentialists are arguing for retraining/relocation assistance and social safety nets. I'll confess I don't even know how to respond to the culture part.

  Listen, you just can't expect people to be Jesus. Most humans are selfish creatures who value themselves and their family first of all.
#+end_quote

Certainly I'm no Jesus, or I'd presumably sell all I have and give it to the poor. However, I do have some baseline expectation that people will realize that others are also worthy of moral consideration, even if they are strangers, or of a different ethnic group, or live far away. Atavism isn't necessarily bad, I suppose, but when it involves overlooking so many people's interests, let alone their rights, that is something I don't understand.

  If you design policy without taking that into account, you're going to be in for a rude awakening.
#+end_quote

I guess I have faith that people can be better. That we can look beyond our instinctual heuristics and make better decisions. In the meantime, why not do what we can to create a better world?
