  I'd be interested in seeing a source for that.

A quick google search for "woman's happiness" results in multiple corroborating sources. Also, if even the Hufflepuff Post admits it, I figure it's probably true.

The explanation for this is more ambiguous, of course. But Scott's "having to work sucks" sounds pretty logical to me.

  Back when it was just the Pentagon Papers and Watergate and Iran-Contra, or some other time when politicians weren't horrible and we weren't militarily involved elsewhere?

I'm not saying things were ever perfect, but don't you think Nixon and Bush Sr. were better than the current batch of republicans? Nixon at least created the EPA, and now his party wants to destroy it. And at least with Watergate, people actually /cared/. Now it's like every day is worse than the last one.

You can argue that Nixon would have been even worse if the situation had allowed for it, but you can't help but see a declining line. Of course the irony is that this is precisely what empowers Trump, as he's supposed to be the 'fixer'.

  Doesn't that seem a little melodramatic?

To you and me, maybe, but there's a definite bubble going on here. People in the south have an honor culturue which is totally different from ours, somewhat similar to islamic honor culture in fact (though they'd hate to hear me say it). And the so-called coastal elites have been very systematically and intentionally working to destroy that way of life. I mean, we're literally tearing down their flags and statues. Can you imagine what that would look like if we did that to another country? Do you not see why this would cause people to feel attacked, and respond accordingly?

Try going to a Native American reserve, declare them to be a bunch of superstitious primitives, and tear down their religious icons. See how that goes over with the Left.

  I guess I have faith that people can be better.

Ok, sure, but doing better in the future is not the same as being better right now. The point is that if you try to implement your ideal utopia right away, it's not going to work because people are going to balk at being forced to conform to your ideas. You can't just skip the step of having to actually convince people.
