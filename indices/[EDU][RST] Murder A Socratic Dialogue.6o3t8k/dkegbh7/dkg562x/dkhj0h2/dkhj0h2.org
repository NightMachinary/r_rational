I've never run into people who think this way except on the Internet; you'll have to do with anecdotal evidence.

Furthermore, the blogpost itself was, in making that argument, implicitly claiming that its audience thought that way (or should think that way). It didn't cite any sources for this implicit claim, so I don't feel obliged to cite sources for the opposite.
