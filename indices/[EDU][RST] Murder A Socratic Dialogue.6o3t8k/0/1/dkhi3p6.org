I actually agree with this one. The biggest problem with information gathering used to be a lack of availability. Nowadays we have the exact opposite: We have so much junk information flooding our systems, that it's impossible to effectively sort through all the information, [[http://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/the-library-of-heaven][effectively making it so that each extra bit makes us less informed than before]].

The reason I still read the news is because if I don't know what /just/ happened, everybody else will think I'm an uninformed lout. But I far prefer to read a single encompassing piece that exhausts all of the arguments on both sides of a political issue, rather than having to sift through a hundred crappy opinion-pieces in search of one that has something worthwhile to contribute.
