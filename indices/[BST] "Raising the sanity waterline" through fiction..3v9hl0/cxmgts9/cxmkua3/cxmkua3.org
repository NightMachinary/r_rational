  I need a nontrivial experimental setup to verify Newton's Law of Gravity at a high-school level

It was amusing to try to even /approach/ the value of 1g from our experimental setups. It /never worked./

  using made-up statistics instead of intuitions, which are worse than made-up statistics

I haven't internalized this lesson very well, probably because I haven't encountered it very frequently. It's the /actual relation/ of the result to the premises that surprises your intuitions, not the exact result from precisely correct premises. If the relation is continuous and has low partial derivatives, you can rely on the result being /only somewhat less accurate/ than your assumptions.
