I think HPMoR actually /started out/ very well. I really loved the bit about McGonnagal levitating Professor Verres as an experimental test of the existence of magic.

Now, the thing about the sanity /waterline/ is that it's a waterline: a /baseline/ that we want the supermajority of the population to actually reach. Where LWian "propagandizing" tends to go wrong is in targeting people who've already heard of what LW calls "Traditional Rationality" and just targeting the subcultures existing LWians happen to belong to: we wind up with a community that has a lot of overlap with the Bay Area tech industry, substantial overlap with the postgraduate in mathy subjects crowd, and substantial overlap with the took a degree in philosophy crowd. There is then an attempt to teach these people "advanced"-level rationality skills, like handling cognitive biases or [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/02/if-its-worth-doing-its-worth-doing-with-made-up-statistics/][using made-up statistics instead of intuitions, which are worse than made-up statistics]].

Problem is, the current sanity /waterline/ is substantially /below/ the level necessary for those lessons to work in the first place. The sanity /waterline/ is just about at the level where "check the existence of magic through an experimental test rather than breaking your family apart with a holy war" is an interesting, useful, novel idea.

For most people, "reality" is still socially-mediated and socially accessed. I don't mean that in a postmodern way; I mean that they simply cannot check most of their beliefs for themselves in any way. Consider how you would test a claim about electric voltage, or lift, when you lack both training and lab equipment! As such, their concepts of sanity and rationality involve determining /whom to listen to/ and how to "defend themselves" from malicious memes.

Which brings us to the issue of fiction. Raising the sanity waterline through fiction is... actually pretty hard, because in fiction, it's almost always easier for main characters to directly access reality for themselves than it is for real people (part of what makes fiction so much more fun than reality). Tiffany Aching can just pick up an iron skillet and go whack Jenny Greenteeth over the head to determine the existence of alternate-dimensional reality-parasitizing fairies; I need a nontrivial experimental setup to verify Newton's Law of Gravity at a high-school level.

Sooooo... whatever happened to books like "101 Science Experiments for Kids"? Maybe a more adult version of that would be helpful? I mean, if you're thinking in terms of /ultimately/ presenting statistical reasoning down the line, it's a lot easier to formalize and conduct proper statistics when you're not including "I'm being lied to" in every hypothesis class, which is a lot easier when you've got your own experimental apparatus (or other access to underlying reality) instead of talking about which authority figures to trust or reciting lists of logical fallacies.
