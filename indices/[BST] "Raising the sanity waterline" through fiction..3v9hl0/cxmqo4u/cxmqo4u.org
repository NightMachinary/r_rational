Some of the themes I've used in the Doc Future stories: What sorts of mistakes do people make despite being smart and rational, how do you balance rationality with emotions and moral judgement, and the dangers inherent in tearing down Chesterton's fence--even if it seems like a good idea at the time.

These are all interesting and entertaining in their own right, which means people are more likely to internalize them than parables or lectures.
