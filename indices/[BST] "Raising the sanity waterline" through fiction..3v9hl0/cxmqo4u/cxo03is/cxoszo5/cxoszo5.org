A paraphrase of something G. K. Chesterton said is "Fences aren't accidental. Don't tear one down unless you know why it was put up."

I'm more inclined to say you don't necessarily need to know all the reasons why it was originally put up if it was generations ago, but you should try to find out everything it's doing (or preventing) now.

An example that gets people all the time is removing or altering something that mitigates damage during rare floods.
