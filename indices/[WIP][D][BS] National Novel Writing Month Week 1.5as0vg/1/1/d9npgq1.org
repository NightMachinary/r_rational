  I've liked a fair amount of the dialogue written so far. H/S stuff seems like it's hitting the right sort of intellectual playfulness (but will need to read again to see for sure).

I've really enjoyed the dialogue between H/S. It's playful and would work well in a romantic comedy :) They have distinct voices and the layers of deceptions (S pretending to be F and H pretending not to know) works really well.

I'm kind of curious, you sometimes end the day in the middle of a sentence (I remember you did that last year too) Is that because you give yourself a strict limit for the number of words written in a day or is it because it makes it easier to continue the next day?
