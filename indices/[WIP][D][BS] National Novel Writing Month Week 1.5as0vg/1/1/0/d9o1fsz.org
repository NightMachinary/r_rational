  I'm kind of curious, you sometimes end the day in the middle of a sentence (I remember you did that last year too) Is that because you give yourself a strict limit for the number of words written in a day or is it because it makes it easier to continue the next day?

Usually when I stop in the middle of a sentence it's because I'm thinking about what the second half of a sentence is, or getting ready to go find a synonym to prevent a repeated word, or unhappy with how that particular section is going. But that pause in the flow is /also/ usually when I go take a look at the clock, check reddit, etc. so it sometimes ends up being where I stop for the night.

It's not uncommon for me to just delete those fragments as the first thing that I do when sitting down to write for the day, depending on whether I know what the rest of the thought was going to be and/or whether it was going in the right direction.
