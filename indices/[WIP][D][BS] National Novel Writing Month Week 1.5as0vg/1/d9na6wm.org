[[http://alexanderwales.com/darkWizardNaNo2016.html][/The Dark Wizard of Donkerk/]] is approaching on 10,000 words written, which means that I'm ahead of schedule (this is my 2014/2015/2016 project, so I'm only counting stuff past 100,000 words for this year).

Pros: I think everyone is where they should be as far as keeping the (now) three main event tracks going forward in parallel, though I think for the sake of balance it might be better to have one of them take up the bulk of the word count heading forward.

I've liked a fair amount of the dialogue written so far. H/S stuff seems like it's hitting the right sort of intellectual playfulness (but will need to read again to see for sure).

There are quite a few lines and scenes that I'm looking forward to, both in terms of "oh shit" moments and things I think are clever. It's always easier to write when you know those things are ahead, and worst case scenario you can just write the stuff you're most enthusiastic about and skip the connective tissue until later. (Not looking forward to writing the stuff that comes after all of what I want to write most, but that's mostly comedown, and people tend to be lenient about skimping on denouement.)

Cons: I've been trying to do more show, less tell for relationship development, but that /also/ needs to be mixed with character and plot development, which is tough. H/S are going to the Citadel, but there needs to be some breathing room there so that it's not just "H/S arrived at the Citadel two weeks later", especially since their relationship needs to be in the right place in preparation for what's going to happen there (and just after).

I'll probably need to do a dialogue pass after NaNo in order to make the "voices" of the characters more distinct; not really sure that I have them quite right yet, and I worry that Sofia/Henry in particular are too interchangeable. That's one of those things that's /way/ easier to change after the fact than during writing, and I probably wouldn't want to devote effort to it now if I'm going to do a pass to focus on it afterward. (Also a concern is that there are deceptions involved, so it's not just "make S sound like S" but "make S sound like S sounding like F".)

Not sure that 10K words has moved the plot as much as it should have. I need to map out the remaining chapters to see how long they should each be in order to end the book at under 150K words ... but that cuts into writing time. R is dropping out of the narrative after one more scene I think, which speeds up velocity toward the end. But V/M/C need more scenes (which I'm not too sure on) and those will take some word count.

(Writing this was helpful, I think; as always, comments and criticism are much more helpful /after/ NaNo is over, because during NaNo I can't really respond to them and they risk making me stressed and unhappy about what I'm writing. I would like for them to be given to me after NaNo is over though, if you'd like to give them.)
