I understand exactly what you mean, and I'm trying to work on very much that; unfortunately, the word-count pressure of NaNoWriMo is working against me, given how much easier it is to come up with words that fill a given fan-service-y niche than it is to come up with a brand-new sci-fi-y concept every day.

I think I'm going to have to resort to "And suddenly NINJAS!!!" more than once to break out of the mould here.
