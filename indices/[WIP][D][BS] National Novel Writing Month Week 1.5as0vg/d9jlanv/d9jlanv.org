Attempting NaNoWriMo: [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jPU6QKEohcrw6l6O3SxorIxf2Tnq54h36LtQO6Qv86w/edit][Extracts]]

Main goal: Resume habit of writing narrative daily. Secondary goal: Explore a future I wouldn't want to live in. Have managed two days of meeting word-count goal, and have enough ready to write for today's. Am making much up as I go, with a few particular points I'd like to hit. Comments/ideas/suggestions appreciated.
