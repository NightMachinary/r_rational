Yeah, /The Dark Wizard of Donkerk/ is supposed to be finished this year, fingers crossed. [[http://alexanderwales.com/darkWizardNaNo2016.html][This year's link here.]] I've installed the Chrome extension StayFocusd to block off reddit, Youtube, Facebook, Netflix, etc. in the evenings in the hopes of increasing productivity, and I feel like I'm probably going to introduce some continuity issues by not quite remembering details accurately, but I'm fairly hopeful that I can push through to the end and then start on actual editing and rearranging.

(To anyone wondering, the .html file there is generated by Scrivener, which is why the formatting is more traditional novel style than web style in how it does paragraph breaks. After the daily compile, I run a simple .bat file to insert all the anchor tags and chapter links.)
