So far on track with my goal of 2,000 words per day. Last year I did the same, but missed three full days close to the end. Still met the NaNo goal, of course (crushed it), but my personal challenge is to just write 2k words /every day/ regardless of how much I've already written.

I'm continuing my story that I started last year, Mapmaker, Mapbreaker - the alpha readers edition of Part One available here [[http://goo.gl/gBzwCC]] as an ePub (I'm on mobile, otherwise I'd insert the link the cleaner way).

I've found out that writing while I'm working out, between sets, greatly increases my concentration and ability to stay focused. As well as counteracting any mental fatigue that usually impedes my ability to write in the evening. Anyone else have any interesting writing techniques?
