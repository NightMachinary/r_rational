Without having delved into the studies re: pure g vs culture myself, I vaguely remember discussions back on lesswrong where people who did are convinced that its not just culture.

Then theres also the whole modell of how selective breeding works, and the fact that with any selective breeding program humans so far have run, we have achieved to concentrate natural traits by multiple sigmas in a very short time - you'd need VERY good and VERY costly explanations in terms of bayesian inference why intelligence is the one single trait thats not breedable.

Lastly, an interview podcast by James Miller with Steve Hsu, on of the worlds top geneticists in regards to intelligence. He says, yes, of course we can make humans much more intelligent by flipping a few hundred genes.
