Saying a slave race is being bred in the book is a bit of overreach, I think? It is fairly dark if you look at it, but not quite that dark? Is it?

Albert's efforts managed to improve overall mental capability, overall (natural) health, and managed to maintain humanity's ability to be violent in defense if necessary.

The fact that it was a program forced on humanity does hold all sorts of negative connotations, and the initial implementation was pretty horrific for the first few generations.

I'm nearly finished with my current writing project, which will let me start editing Set in Stone again. I'll definitely need to consider addressing some of that darkness a bit more. It is touched on, but it could be touched a bit more directly, in a few more places.
