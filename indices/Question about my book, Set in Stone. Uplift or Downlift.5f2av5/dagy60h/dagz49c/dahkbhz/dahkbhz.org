I mostly meant that I hadn't analyzed it under uplift criteria, but docility = slave races is an incredibly established trope. Since the humans also have a great number of restrictions in their personal live due to albert, the novel read to me much more as dealing with "being alberts slave" than as "here is all the interesting stuff that results from being uplifted".

This doesnt even contradict literature precursors; Brins Uplift-Universe has the uplifted species acting as servant race to their uplifters for millions of years before emancipation.
