Oh, the other project is 'Business as Usual' a fanfic where Vlad Taltos from Stephen Brust's Jhereg series crosses to Wildbow's Worm universe. I am very near completion. The next chapter to be written (hopefully tomorrow) will be the final conflict. Then a epilogue to clean up a few things.

Working 80+ hour weeks for nearly a year doesn't leave much time for writing, and when I do have time to write, a lot of times, I want to do other things.
