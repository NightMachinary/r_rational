  Albert's efforts managed to improve overall mental capability, overall (natural) health
#+end_quote

Did they though? I'm presuming neural implants where a technology that existed, and tools can do a lot to improve mental capability, as can access to books. I'll accept that we've seen an improvement in raw g factor, but I expect there's been some pretty huge decreases in the amount of statistical understanding in the population, or at the very least a decrease in all kinds of research.

Since Albert is burning sanity/stability to pull off miracles, he's not making up for that lack of research.

Also, what other writing project?
