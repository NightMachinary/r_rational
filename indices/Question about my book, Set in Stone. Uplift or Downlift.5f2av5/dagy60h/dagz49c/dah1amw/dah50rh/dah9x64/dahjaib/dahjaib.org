The aspect of humanity that Albert was most concerned about was aggressiveness. In animals, what he did would be called domestication. The Russians have shown that with some animals (foxes) it is possible to rapidly domesticate a wild population. (If you have not read about the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Domesticated_Red_Fox][fox domestication experiment,]] do so, it's fascinating.) Canines, however, are pack animals that have millions of years of cooperation guiding their social and genetic development. Humans are not. Primates are not as cooperative (EDIT word choice) as canines. Farm animals are also subject to genetic "mean-ness" Temperament is at least partly genetic.

Humanity ended itself in the home system for all intents and purposes shortly after the colony ships left Earth. A single colonist nearly destroyed the population on route to Nirvana.

On the other hand, Nirvanans went nearly a thousand years without a war, in a preindustrial society. I'd call that temperamental improvement. Rational problem solving that avoids violence except when there is no other way to preserve the life of friends and family. Isn't this at least anecdotal evidence of improvement?
