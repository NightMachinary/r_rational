I've thought about it a bit more.

I'm not /entirely/ convinced that humans aren't in a local-maximum intelligence wise. That is, I have a suspicion that we got close to as smart as we could be via the one particular evolutionary pressure that got us this far. It's not like pigs where there's a lot of low-hanging fruit still available, as far as improving intelligence goes.

That's why I think memes are more important then genes. Cultural teachings and educational traditions are one of the few paths to improvement we have available.

I guess that's why I'm unsympathetic to the argument that Albert improved general intelligence. I think selection pressure can move the average up for a while, but as soon as that pressure goes away it's going to shift back down.

Now if it was a cultural improvement, I'd buy that a bit more. Maybe during editing show the colonists as less competent? It seems like that culture the current generation has is the old culture, with a few changes. If you can show that they've improved...
