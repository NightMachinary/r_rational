Good stuff here. Insights like this help me understand what others see, and give me the opportunity to address variances in what I was hoping would be seen.

Neural enhancements were not considered in the books, but they were probably around, to some degree. When the human race is released from Albert's project, there is no reason why humans couldn't resume using them.

In fact, nothing that was once known is gone. Albert has stored all human knowledge that he encountered, and not just in his own active memory.

Knowledge-wise, humanity was basically just put in a corner for a five-thousand-year time out. When Albert thinks people are sane enough as a race, they get all their toys back, at a rate far more accelerated than they got them the first time around.
