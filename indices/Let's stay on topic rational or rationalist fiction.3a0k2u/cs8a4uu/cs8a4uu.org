As a poster of the unrelated foreign policy question, I have to ask, is it really so important that we stay on topic? It's not as if the other links are falling through the cracks and I, for one, enjoy the discussion links. I like contributing my opinion into an intellectual debate. And this community is one of the larger rationalist communities on reddit. Both [[/r/LessWrong]] and [[/r/LessWrongLounge]] have much less traffic than this sub. The Lounge's most recent post was a week ago and, before that, a month ago. Not exactly productive to discuss anything.

Regardless though, I see the point. And I understand that off topic posts aren't fun for people who have more specific focuses in regards to this community. :)
