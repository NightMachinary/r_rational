Just as a reminder, if you see a sub with low activity in it, you should still subscribe to it (if you're not already). Subscription costs you nothing, and in the event that someone starts up a conversation there, it can get propelled to your frontpage rather easily. That helps to break a sub out of the "it's dead because no one uses it / no one uses it because it's dead" cycle.
