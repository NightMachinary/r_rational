I think the fact that we focus just on fiction and the fact that we're a large rationalist community that hasn't dissolved in the way that rationalist internet communities often do are strongly related. This subreddit is like super focused on things I find entertaining and as it stands now it does a pretty good job of staying on those topics. I think this narrow, deep focus is also what causes this community to grow and stick together, though I have no actual data or reasoning to back this up.
