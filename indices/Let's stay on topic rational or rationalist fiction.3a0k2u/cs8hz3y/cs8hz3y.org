Can there please be a common-sense exemption for this rule? I'm thinking of my dyson sphere discussion post, which isn't directly about fiction, but has enough implications for worldbuilding, HSF, and munchkinry that it might be community-relevant. Maybe counts as a deconstruction as well (albeit of a nonfiction story).
