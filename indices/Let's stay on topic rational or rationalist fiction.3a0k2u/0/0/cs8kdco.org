There are common-sense exemptions; talking about the mechanics of a Dyson-sphere falls under them, and that post hasn't been touched. Same goes for continuity of consciousness, which is a common transhumanist theme and central to a lot of rational stories.

Where you start getting into trouble is when you start posting things that would be more at home in [[/r/politics]], [[/r/worldnews]], [[/r/atheism]], etc. (We're always going to have some overlap with subs like [[/r/books]], [[/r/movies]], [[/r/scifi]], [[/r/fantasy]], [[/r/Futurology]], [[/r/transhumanism]], etc.) Your mods /do/ possess common sense.

(If you want to do an end-run around these rules, you can do it in the form of rational fiction. I'd probably remove a post asking for discussion of the Israel-Palestine conflict, but there's no way I would remove a rational story about humongous mecha patrolling the border of the Gaza strip. I'd probably remove a post talking about class warfare, but never a rational story which has class warfare as one of its themes.)
