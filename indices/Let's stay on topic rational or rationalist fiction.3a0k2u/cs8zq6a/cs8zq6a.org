Hrm, I just posted a link to a TED talk by James Randi, in response to a short story written with James Randi as the antagonist.

James Randi, at least in the TED talk, is very rational. Is this sort of cross-fertilization of topics acceptable, where they cross real life and rational or rationalist fiction?
