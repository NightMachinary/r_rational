I'm not putting on my mod hat to say this, but I think if you want to discuss SFnal or fantasy things, you're probably good. The problem comes when people start posting things that they just want to talk about without first thinking about whether that discussion belongs here. There are thousands of subreddits with a variety of focuses, and I personally think it's better for them to remain focused. Our focus here is already a bit sloppy, which is fine, but if we start in on politics, religion, pets, how your day was, Japanese game shows, etc. we start getting on shaky ground.

What we should probably do is have a weekly off-topic thread as a release valve for those things that you want to talk about with your pals in [[/r/rational]] but which don't relate to the focus of the subreddit. Off-Topic Tuesday?
