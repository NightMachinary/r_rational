It's not possible to rename the subreddit; reddit doesn't allow it. We could take over or create a different subreddit and all move there, but that's (almost always) a death sentence for a subreddit. (The only time you ever resort to that is if the mods go rogue and seriously screw things up.)

The best we could do is a CSS rename, but that might just be confusing. The title of the subreddit is "Rational Fiction" though, the description is clear, and the purpose is explicitly laid out in the sidebar.
