Cool short story! I feel like you really nailed the early parts balance of description and flavor. "A tough old place to break into, lots of long sitting-spots, and a stone slab to hide behind at the end." was a great example of this for me, enough info to picture the scene with enough of the POV flavor to be thematic.
