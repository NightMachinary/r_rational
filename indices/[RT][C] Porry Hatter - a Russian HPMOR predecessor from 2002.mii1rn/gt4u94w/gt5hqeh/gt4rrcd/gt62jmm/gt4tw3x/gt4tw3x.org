I was thinking on submitting it too as one of the favorite books of my childhood! The invention/tech angle is kinda stereotypical, so don't expect too much from that, but the Pipe magic system is pretty well explored in the sequels.

Edit: although beware, due to it's age and country of origin it's full of non-PC jokes.
