OK... So what was the purpose of your original post? To tell MadScientist95387 that they were wrong to put forth a hypothesis about Kabuto's motivation?

I would add that predicting smart or subtle or rational characters' motivations isn't that difficult, because in most cases, their intelligence shapes /how/ they express their motivations, rather than giving them radically different ones. The idiot savant canon!Naruto and the prodigy rational!Harry might have very different ideas of /how/ to bring about peace and happiness for humanity, but it is nevertheless a motivation that both share, and one which is in no way strange or alien to the reader.

You're right. I couldn't possibly predict that. But what has that to do with motives? For the exact same reasons, I would be unable to predict that a rainstorm is being caused by a dimensional rift linking Earth to Alpha Centauri rather than by conventional weather patterns. Missing information =/= inherent unknowability.

  Post scriptum, also realize that we don't know how much of Kabuto you have changed from the original.

Yes. But this does not make it any less legitimate to say "based on the currently available information, I hypothesise that X". /All/ hypotheses are based on currently available information, and are capable of being overturned by the discovery of new information in the future.
