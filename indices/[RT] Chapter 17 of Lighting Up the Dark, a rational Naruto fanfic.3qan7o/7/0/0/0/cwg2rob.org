Nnnnnno. What I'm saying is that people can predict characters' future actions, to some degree of accuracy, once they know their motivations, but to understand a character's motivation is a whole other matter.

What I'm saying is that if you met a person on a street, and this person was throwing dice on the sidewalk, you could have a simple explanation, maybe five if you're full of inventiveness, but you can't possibly predict that those dice are a construct produced by a multidimensional being in a contest among multidimensional beings to see which blue is bluer on a series of planets originated with an algorithm including twelve prime numbers, and that the guy who is currently kneeling on the sidewalk is a former KGB agent under cover, who casually found himself in this situation to try and bring back to life his lost love.

What I'm saying is that we can come up with *some* /motives/ for why people do what they do, provided they are common and obvious, and we are usually right because they are the most common for a reason, but we couldn't get the motives of above average smart or subtle or rational characters because we won't ever be able to have a sufficient model of their reasons, who can be many and strange, just like we won't understand the reasons behind particularly unusual events or behaviours.

Had /you/ understood why [[#s][spoiler HPMOR]] before the author explained it to you? Sure you could have found a reasonable enough explanation for the choice of her, like "she has some bad influence over Harry", but had you guessed why Draco? Had you guessed that [[#s][spoiler]]? Had you guessed that [[#s][spoiler]]?

To extrapolate why a person does something is harder than to know what is the next move of a chess player, but we usually get the right answer on the first one because people share the most common motives.

*tl/dr* Kabuto can have a whole bunch of plans, more that is easy to imagine and guess. Author may not realize this because thay are the on the side who chooses the motives of their characters.

Post scriptum, also realize that we don't know how much of Kabuto you have changed from the original.
