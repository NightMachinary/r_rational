It's not above Kabuto's clearance to know about Naruto's chakra control.

Remember in the first chapter, Naruto says the Kyubei is famous for its intelligence and chakra control, so if Kabuto knows Naruto has the Kyubei inside him (and Naruto himself said it was a very poorly kept secret) then he knows about the chakra control.

I think Naruto was worried more about Kabuto showing that card to ninjas from other villages and wouldn't have minded if Kabuto had kept that knowledge to himself.

EDIT: Just noticed now that Kabuto knows Naruto is competent at ninjutsu. That should probably worry Naruto more.
