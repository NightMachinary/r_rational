As I understand it, there were practical issues involved as well - after all, if the writers were the same as for S1, then all else being equal we should have expected the same quality of stratagems as in S1. If I may quote TVTropes,

- The original plans for R2 were changed when it was announced that the series would be moved to an earlier, primetime slot. Fans believe that this mainly affected the first half of R2, for the purposes of re-introducing the show to a new audience instead of picking up right after the first season's cliffhanger like the staff had intended. As a general rule, how much a fan thinks was changed is inversely proportionate to said fan's opinion of R2's quality.
- It's known that the Time Skip itself was a result of Executive Meddling. Other elements that are commonly suspected or assumed to fall under this include introducing the character of Rolo and removing aspects of C.C.'s and Suzaku's backgrounds without a full explanation.
- The level of mecha use seen in R2 may be considered a product of the aforementioned round of meddling, with the show becoming closer to Gundam as a result.
