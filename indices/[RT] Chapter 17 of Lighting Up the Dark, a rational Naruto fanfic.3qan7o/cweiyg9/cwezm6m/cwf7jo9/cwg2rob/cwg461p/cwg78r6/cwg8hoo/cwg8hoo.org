Fair enough, I suppose. But I still think coming up with such explanations and refining them as more information becomes available is a valuable exercise, as it can generate new insights, develop one's predictive skills, and on occasion give an author ideas which are better than what he had to begin with.

  Well, to answer that, would you have predicted in the original Naruto that Kabuto was a spy of Orochimaru, when you didn't even know about Orochimaru's existence?

No, but on the other hand people don't collect information for the sake of collecting information (hobbies notwithstanding), and had I been a bit more genre savvy, I could have correctly theorised that Kabuto was playing some kind of deeper game, especially if I'd watched something like Durarara!! beforehand.
