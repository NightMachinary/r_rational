  OK... So what was the purpose of your original post? To tell MadScientist95387 that they were wrong to put forth a hypothesis about Kabuto's motivation?
#+end_quote

Nah, just making conversation.

  I would add that predicting smart or subtle or rational characters' motivations isn't that difficult, because in most cases, their intelligence shapes how they express their motivations, rather than giving them radically different ones. The idiot savant canon!Naruto and the prodigy rational!Harry might have very different ideas of how to bring about peace and happiness for humanity, but it is nevertheless a motivation that both share, and one which is in no way strange or alien to the reader.

Uhm, well to be more clear, let's say that /value motivations/ are nearly always the same (barring reasonably constructed aliens and crazy people), but /instrumental motivations/ are not. For example, canon!Voldemort wants to kill Harry, rational!Voldemort wants to [[#s][spoiler]].

  Missing information =/= inherent unknowability.
#+end_quote

I wonder. But surely the less you know the more you fail to reach a valid hypothesis, even more so when /instrumental motivations/ are held by smart or subtle or rational characters.

#+begin_quote
  Yes. But this does not make it any less legitimate to say "based on the currently available information, I hypothesise that X". All hypotheses are based on currently available information, and are capable of being overturned by the discovery of new information in the future.

Well, to answer that, would you have predicted in the original Naruto that Kabuto was a spy of Orochimaru, when you didn't even know about Orochimaru's existence?

It's obviously easier to guess motivations in fanfiction, since you already know a good deal of backstory, but less easy in rational/creative fanfiction, when a smart author may have found reasonable causes for the same events, like: we read about a Kabuto showing stat-cards around and we know that in the original was a poor move, but we know how you deal with poor moves and we expect of you to have changed something to make this work. The reason for this move can float in a sea of possible hypothesis, like, I don't know, Kabuto had an aneurysm, or Kabuto is following four-level-deep orders from Orochimaru in a bigger scheme, or Kabuto is trying to recruit Naruto like MadScientist95387 speculated, or Kabuto is trying to scare Naruto into forfeiting, or Kabuto wants to feign superior intelligence gathering abilities while e just had a stroke of luck in getting those stats, or Kabuto...

This is what I was trying to say, we can't possibly get the whole picture. We can try to guess what /you/ where thinking, based on our knowledge of your style, smarts and the rational fiction guidelines, and the fact that this will be somewhat Naruto, just like we guessed that the first test was a Kobayashi Maru because it is a common trope and it wasn't some smart character's scheme, but to guess what the hell Kabuto is trying to accomplish is a whole other story.
