The problem is that there is an infinite sea of hypotheses for every phenomenon, and our brain has not evolved to find out every one, nor even the majority nor a high probability subset of them. In other words, you, like every other human, are blind to the causes of things that happen, unless they are really common and obvious.

Just sayin'

EDIT: It has been drawn to my attention that people infer from what I wrote things that aren't there. What I meant to say is that to understand the motives behind one single action of a smart, rational character is a trickier endeavour than most, because in the case of particularly smart, rational characters the motives behind their actions are seldom common or obvious, as opposed to the actions of everyday people.

I wrote phenomenons because, at the same time, laws of physics and natural events are very common, but not so obvious, and in fact for example it took many years and a vast number of experiments to arrive to the theory of... pretty much any theory, because that would narrow dawn the sea of possible hypotheses. It also helps that in nature the simplest explanation is usually the right one, while this is not always the case for smart people and characters.
