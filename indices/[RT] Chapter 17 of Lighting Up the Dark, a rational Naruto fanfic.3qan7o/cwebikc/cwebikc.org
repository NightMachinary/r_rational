I've never understood the thing with Kabuto. I haven't read the canon, so maybe it's explained there -- my understanding is that he's a spy for Orochimaru, but I don't get why he's walking around showing people cards. What's he trying to gain that is worth drawing attention to himself?

Can anyone more familiar with the canon lay it out for me?
