I kind of mentioned this in passing in another comment, but in canon Kabuto is one of those characters where the reader is /told/ that they're some smart, cunning mastermind, but when you actually look at the character as a whole and the actions they've taken, they seem really, /really/ stupid.

I've seen people try to explain in other fics that Kabuto's info cards are a method he uses to get close and gain the trust of certain participants in the Chunin Exams, Team 7 and Sasuke by extension in particular. In the original, Kabuto /does/ approach Team 7, not the other way around like here. But besides the fact that there's a million other ways to gain the trust of the impressionable 12 year olds Team 7 are in canon /without/ looking like a suspicious security leak, it's clearly an example of authors taking somthing that didn't make much sense in the original and trying to come up with a rational reason for it in their story. I don't actually think there ever is a real explanation in canon for what the heck Kabuto was trying to accomplish with those cards except for the weak "he's a spy for Orochimaru," where we have to assume every weird, unexplained action he took was on some strange order that the reasoning behind will never be explained.
