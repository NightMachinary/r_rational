Yeah, which is one of the reasons why I'm so curious with the direction Kabuto is going to be taken in this story. Velorien hasn't made any /glaring/ errors like this yet (and I'm not saying this story hasn't had smaller problems), where they keep something in the story just because it's always in the story (and Kabuto with his info cards are /always/ in Chunin Exam fics). So I'm fairly confident that /something/ is going on with Kabuto, and he'll end up being more than the "smart" but actually pretty stupid plotter he is in so many stories.
