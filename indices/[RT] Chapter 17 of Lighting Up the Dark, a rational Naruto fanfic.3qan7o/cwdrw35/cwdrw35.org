So Kabuto knows some things about Naruto. More than just secrets like him being a jinchuriki, but things Naruto has been deliberately hiding from everyone else. He obviously got this information by spying, but I wonder who was he spying for at the time? It seems like Kabuto spends time as a spy for pretty much every "bad" faction at some point in canon, and I'm interested in seeing how him being a spy for Root/Orochimaru/Akatsuki/whoever he feels like that week will go down in this story.
