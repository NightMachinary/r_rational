Our alternatives are limited? Does that mean you rescind the blue centaur's prior offer to simply leave, if we ask you to?

I would just like to note that according to the blue centaur, we are the first non hostile sentients out of the /one/ other species you encountered, who unlike us, made contact with you /first/. You knew other life could be sentient. You had every option to observe to find out before acting. You knew enough about our intelligence to realize that you had to hide your presence from us. You /successfully/ hid from us for a long time, indicating that you did not grossly underestimate our intellectual power. You, seem to have successfully acquired enough cultural and linguistic knowledge to have /this/ conversation with more skill than the average human, very quickly.

You therefore know enough to understand that it does not sit well with us that your stance has changed so quickly from "heartfelt apology" to "generous concession".

What would you say to those of us who simply do not believe the notion that you did not know what you were doing? What criterion for sentience, or moral relevance, did you use? What sorts of beings /did/ you think we are, that explained your observations of us without attributing sentience? How did you acquire your cultural proficiency, despite taking so long to figure out our sentience? What exactly made you change your mind that you consider us morally relevant /now/?
