Humans have postulated that their leaders are controlled by alien conspiracies since even before Yeerks showed up. A guarantor against paranoia is not achievable. The best we can do is to gradually move toward mutual trust by a repeated series of positive interactions, gradually increasing in stake.

Conversations about specific verification protocols can be productive. Blanket ultimatums and challenges to prove ourselves, though, are impossible to satisfy. Having a conversation on such a basis isn't productive. You don't get the option of absolute trust - and if that makes you uncomfortable, then think how we feel. You're the first non-actively hostile sentients we've ever encountered. That we're not currently trying to infest you represents an insane leap of faith for us, and it's immensely frustrating to have it treated as some kind of default minimum standard any humane party would respect, rather than a generous opening concession.

Productive relations between our species are only going to be possible if we're willing to see things from each others point of view. I understand where you're coming from and agree that your concerns are legitimate. Ventura was a senseless tragedy, and it's unfortunate that we didn't initially grasp your nature as sentient beings. That's a large part of the reason we're now standing down. Ultimately, for this to work, we need you to be willing to extend your trust to us in turn. The best, and only, way for us to get it is to point out how limited your alternatives are. Otherwise, you'll endlessly demand the perfect and make an enemy of the good.
