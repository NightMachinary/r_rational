Ok, given this thread has had way less attention than the last two, and is losing what little momentum it had, I'm going to call it quits now. It was fun while it lasted, and I'm sorry for everyone who participated, but there just isn't as much interesting discussion happening as I hoped.

For those curious, the following events were going to be:

--------------

*WEEK 3 - PROPOSALS Round 1*

*Themes of the week*

- Terms for alliance between Earth and the Yeerk Federation
- Plans for the arrival of the Yeerk fleet.

*Events*

China declares they have analyzed the communication log from the Yeerk fleet released by US military. They have managed to estimate speed and distance of Yeerk fleet using the Z-space equivalent of the Doppler effect, and confirmed that, if it maintains its current speed, the fleet will arrive within three months.

--------------

*WEEK 4*

*Theme of the week*

- Balance of power

*Events*

A joint military raid has been operated by the special forces of Germany and Japan on 28 facilities (14 in each country), which, according to the now-defunct Serenity Z-space tracker, had been regularly visited by space-capable fighters in the past.

These facilities turned out to be spaceship manufactories, manned by unindentified bipedal aliens. These aliens have been captured and are currently detained in secret locations by the German and Japanes militaries. Attempts to communicate with them have proven mostly unsuccessful so far. The Yeerks controlling them have been returned to Telor, who in exchange promised not to retaliate for the raid.

Engineers from all over the world are examining the factories, and comparing their technology with the documentation released by the US military detailing the spaceships in their possession. Preliminary analysis suggests that it will be impossible to build the core components (Z-space drive, high-power dracon beam) without Yeerk assistance.

US announces they have one-off ability to destroy yeerk homeworld as a last resort, using the same method the Andalites threatened Earth with.

--------------

*WEEK 5 - PROPOSALS Round 2*

*Themes of the week*

- Yeerk personal philosophy
- Will Integration be beneficial for humans

*Events*

The last of the Ventura survivors who were released from Telor's ship has been released from quarantine. Authorities ask journalists and other parties to leave them alone.

As part of a recent thread, another Controller has been arrested for drunk driving by the PMERJ. The Controller refused to submit to alcohol and drug tests, and, when threatened with incarceration, insisted that she be repatriated to the Pool ship.

PMERJ officer Vasco Torres has declared that, while the Yeerk delegation had to benefit from a degree of diplomatic immunity to ensure proper negociations can take place, that immunity may be loosened for auxilliary members of the delegations. "We don't want to send the wrong message. If we're going to cohabit in the near future, it's important that the Yeerks remember, both as individuals and as a faction, that their actions have consequences".

--------------

*WEEK 6*

*Theme of the week*

- Yeerk personal philosophy

*Events*

UN representative demands Visser 3 participates in the Summit, or failing that, clarification by Telor on Visser 3's status.

Brazil starts preliminary construction of a giant housing complex on /Restinga da Marambaia/ that will house the upcoming Yeerk Pool.

*WEEK 7 - PROPOSALS Final Round*
