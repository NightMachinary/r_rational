*WEEK 2*

*Theme of the week*

- The Andalites and the greater war.

*Events*

A shocking leak by a US Army whistleblower reveals that US military has contacted the Andalite homeworld, and that the Andalite high command has threatened to blow the Earth up, but hasn't followed up on it for unknown reasons. All communications with Andalites are currently blocked off. Threats of retaliation by the US military have received no response.

Multiple world leaders call US military "irresponsible" and "reckless" for hiding that information from the public and other countries. Congressional committee is being formed to address the issue.

US military declares they have been intercepting encrypted Yeerk transmissions through unspecified means for weeks. They publish a log of all recorded data for anyone to interpret.

BBC releases overview of Yeerk-Andalite war. The overview is collected from interviews with ex-controllers, Brazilian controllers, and US military spokepersons, and covers broad events, with many interrogation marks and no specific strategic information. [What the overview actually says is up to your imagination; Visser 3 is not mentioned]
