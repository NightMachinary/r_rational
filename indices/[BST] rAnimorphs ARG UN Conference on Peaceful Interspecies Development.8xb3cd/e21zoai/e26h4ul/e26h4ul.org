How long has the yurk extraterrestrial society been aware of earth, and how long have you made active attempts at interaction with our system, openly or otherwise?

Are you aware of any awareness or attempts at contact with earth on the part of other extraterrestrial societies?

What do you know about the possible veracity of claims by David Icke, Erich von DÃ¤niken and others concerning extraterrestrial contact with earth in the recent and distant past?

The Bohemian Grove is in California, not inconveniently far from Ventura but easily distant enough to survive the Ventura impact or any likely impact on Ventura which wouldn't destroy the western USA or more. Is there any connection between the Bohemian Grove and your extraterrestrial society or any extraterrestrial society known to you?
