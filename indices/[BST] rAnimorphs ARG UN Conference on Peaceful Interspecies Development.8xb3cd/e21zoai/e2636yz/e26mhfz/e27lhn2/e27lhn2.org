Excuse you?

Your blue centaur came here with a rather impassioned speech about how extremely apologetic your people were for the invasion, enslavement, and mass murder of our species - that it was an accident. The language he used makes clear that your species and ours share an understanding of what it means to be culpable. The premise of our diplomacy is /entirely/ based upon this understanding - that it was an accident, and that you are /sorry/ and want to make it right between our species. We assured us that all possible measures would be done to ensure peaceful engagement and inter-species cooperation, and that if we did not agree to these terms, he promised us that you would /all leave and "meet us among the stars as equals"/.

And now you have the audacity to call the very real concern that you will continue to secretly engage in further invasion and enslavement as "our problem", and not yours?
