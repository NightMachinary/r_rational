Livestock are inferior to humans, I hope you'll agree. You wouldn't want to be a cow any more than I do. Our senses scale to the capabilities of our hosts, not to mention that opposable thumbs are quite nifty.

Acknowledging your sentience, I still don't think that getting there first entitles human minds to a stronger moral claim on the human body than that which Yeerkish minds possess. Ideally, we'll move forward in the future with large scale voluntary cohabitation programs, with Brazil serving as an international model. In the future, it might also be possible that your governments will grant us access to the bodies of those in medical comas or who are suffering from personality destroying ailments like Alzheimer's or lobotomies. Once trust has been established, we could also potentially serve a limited role in the penal system, potentially resulting in billions of dollars of savings.

We don't have access to the sort of bioengineering or cloning capabilities you suppose. If we did, you're correct, an interstellar voyage wouldn't have been a practical decision. Yet here we are.
