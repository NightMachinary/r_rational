  Vocals sufficiently complex for speech, I suppose, but that's trivially overcome with sign language and so on.

Would you say dismiss the concerns of a human with a speaking disability as trivial? If not, why do the same to an alien with multiple disabilities orders of magnitude worse than most humans ever experience? This is chauvinism, pure and simple.

  It is a moral good to provide you with bodies, but displacing a sentient being just so you can have thumbs seems to be placing the scale pretty heavily towards yeerk comfort.
#+end_quote

You are fundamentally misinformed. Human hosts do not experience any discomfort, nor are they somehow displaced or erased. As it happens, I do value Yeerk comfort above human comfort, but to think that inhabiting humans is desirable I merely need value Yeerk comfort at a value above zero.

  Even if you don't want to be a cow, we already have a huge infrastructure for growing animals for agricultural purposes, which can be modified to suit other species. It would be trivial to provide yeerks with millions of farmed animal bodies of species of their choosing, with senses and physical abilities superior to that of humans - and with their shorter generation times, it would not take long for their numbers to exceed the entire human population.

I expect that making such modifications will be more difficult than you expect, but such project should certainly be pursued in parallel to our other efforts.

  You can buy a monkey right now for only 4 thousand dollars, imagine how cheap it would be at mass produced scales. And you know what's neater than thumbs? Flying. Birds are dirt cheap, many of them can produce speech, and all their senses except smell are better than ours.

Why is it that when we talk about humans, you're greatly concerned about the pain and suffering of hosts, but not when we talk about animals? Even when we didn't think humans were sentient, we took care of their needs out of simple self-interest. Earlier, you asserted that Yeerks should have known humans were sentient by some criteria. Are you that eager to have us repeat our mistake, so long as it's with a species other than your own? Your callousness is amazing. Given the magnitude of this discovery, that perhaps we are not alone, our entire worldview needs to be re-evaluated for errors. In the meantime, at least we can be confident that when a human announces it wants to participate in a voluntary infestation program, their consent has not been violated. In a sense, humans are probably the least unethical choice of hosts available to us.

Birds are cool, but I wouldn't want to be a bird full time. Yeerks desire self-actualization too. We have to /do/ things and be productive and achieve useful tasks, not just exist and fly around all day. You're very quick to think of us as subhuman, rather than nonhuman, and the sooner you get over that the better for all of us.
