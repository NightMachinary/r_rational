Your centaur was a "cow" level sentience, indicating that it is the body that matters, not the mind. Being a cow sounds kinda gross to /us/, but I'm really not sure why a yeerk would have an aesthetic preference for a human.

Whereas if it's a question of function, humans dominate this planet primarily due to our minds. There is nothing particularly interesting about human bodies, save for long distance running and thumbs. Vocals sufficiently complex for speech, I suppose, but that's trivially overcome with sign language and so on. It is a moral good to provide you with bodies, but displacing a sentient being just so you can have /thumbs/ seems to be placing the scale pretty heavily towards yeerk comfort.

Nevertheless, if /thumbs/ of all things are what matter to you, humans are /still/ not the ideal species to infest. We have plenty of species of primates with shorter generation spans /and/ stronger, faster, nimbler bodies. Even if you don't want to be a cow, we already have a huge infrastructure for growing animals for agricultural purposes, which can be modified to suit other species. It would be trivial to provide yeerks with millions of farmed animal bodies of species of their choosing, with senses and physical abilities /superior/ to that of humans - and with their shorter generation times, it would not take long for their numbers to exceed the entire human population. You can buy a monkey right now for only 4 thousand dollars, imagine how cheap it would be at mass produced scales. And you know what's neater than thumbs? /Flying/. Birds are dirt cheap, many of them /can/ produce speech, and all their senses except smell are better than ours.

Look, farming is a simple technology, you do not need bioengineering. I'm not sure why you are not already farming your existing hosts. I'm not sure why infesting humans is even on the table here? Even if you don't want to be a cow, since the brain isn't a factor why would you want to be a human?
