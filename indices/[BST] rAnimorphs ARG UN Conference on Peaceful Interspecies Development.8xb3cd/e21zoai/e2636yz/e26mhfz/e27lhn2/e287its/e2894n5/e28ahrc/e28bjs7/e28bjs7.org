But, even if we accept that you did not recognize our sentience, you have still not explained /how/ you've acquired cultural proficiency so quickly.

Next question: Why did you come all this way for human hosts? You already have (we can only assume - for all we know, this is not your first mistake) non-sentient hosts, which are presumably /self replicating/ life forms. And I suppose you'll say that the human looking form of your centaur is coincidence and not bioengineering specifically made to appeal to us, but surely you've figured out some form of cloning?

And now that you are here, why do you still so dearly want human hosts? This planet has many species, more numerous and faster breeding than us - our livestock in particular.
