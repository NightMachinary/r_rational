  You therefore know enough to understand that it does not sit well with us that your stance has changed so quickly from "heartfelt apology" to "generous concession".

These are one and the same. When you question the legitimacy of the apology, it's because you're coming from a frame in which ceasing our activities and announcing our existence to the world is the obvious, morally obligatory action. That frame is not self-evidently correct.

When a human and Yeerk inhabit the same body, the number of beings experiencing a life worth living is two. When a human tells a Yeerk that they prefer for the Yeerk to go off and moo in a pasture somewhere rather than share such experiences, it's really hard not to interpret that as pointless, vicious selfishness. I'm convinced that it's not malice but ignorance behind what you're saying, but when ignorance is expressed harshly it can be hard to keep the distinction straight.

Ceasing our activities was supererogatory, not obligatory, because the activities did no damage except in a deontological sense by violating your consent, while the cessation of those activities has come at significant consequence to ourselves and against the natural preferences of many of us. Once we've taken a host, we have just as much right to the body as the host does. The least bad option upon learning of your sentience, in a vacuum, would have been for us to maintain infestations in existing hosts while otherwise going dark. But we decided that such an approach would make a poor basis for future relations, and so bit the cost now in the hopes of achieving greater cooperation in the future.

  Our alternatives are limited? Does that mean you rescind the blue centaur's prior offer to simply leave, if we ask you to?
#+end_quote

Not at all. You've misinterpreted me completely. When I say that the alternatives to trust are limited, I mean that were you to make the choice to turn us away, it would represent a tremendous destruction of the agency you currently possess. You expand your agency by acquiring opportunities, not by throwing them away in fear.
