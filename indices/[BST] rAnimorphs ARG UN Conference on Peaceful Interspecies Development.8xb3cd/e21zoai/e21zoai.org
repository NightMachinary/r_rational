*WEEK 1*

*Theme of the week*

- The Yeerk Federation and its long-term goals.

*Events*

Nuclear missiles are still being pulled for the US, Russia and China. Soon, there will be no nuclear weapon left on Earth.

The /United Nation Conference on Peaceful Interspecies Development/ (UNCPID) is now starting. On the human side, the newly-formed UNIRO will be tasked with guiding negociations with the Yeerk Federation, and drafting a proposal for mutually beneficial cooperation for the years to come.

To guarantee transparency, and reduce risks of foul play, the UNIRO's comission will decentralize its decision-making, and partially rely on crowdsourced input: journalists from all over the world are invited to submit questions, proposals and observations for the Yeerk delegations.

While the final proposal and agreement won't be decided by vote, the UNIRO hopes that exposing the decision-making process and integrating popular requests will guarantee a certain degree of accountability and fairness in the final treaty.

For the duration of the conference, the Brazil government has selected 100 volunteers for Integration. Some of these 100 Controllers will act as diplomats for the Telor coalescion, while the others will be free to act as they please within the confines of Rio de Janeiro.
