Yeerk here.

I have to disagree with you that there is "nothing particularly interesting" about human bodies. My host has something of an interest in biology and nature, and naturally, this fed into my own desire to learn more about the human body and its functions. Both my host and I agree that humans have some of the [[http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6338/eaam7263][best]] [[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10329-015-0456-4][senses]] on Earth. (As an aside, I must say Earth's evolutionary history is rather remarkable, and your own in particular).

Untrue. Humans are unique in the musculature of their forearm and hand - the extensor pollicis brevis and flexor pollicis longus allow modern humans to have [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22640954][great manipulative skills and strong flexion in the thumb]]. Your precision and power grips are unrivalled among apes.

I can't speak for other Yeerks, perhaps, but I personally wouldn't want to exchange hosts so often. An analogy here would be ... like cars, I suppose. Some humans like trading in their cars every so often, while others prefer to maintain and keep their same car for years.

While it's true /some/ birds can produce speech and some /may/ have better eyesight (not all birds see better than us; in fact, this applies mostly to diurnal raptors), and /some/ primates can grasp things (though not with the same degree of precision or power as human hands), neither possess the full range of capabilities that humans have to offer.

You are versatile, intelligent, exist in large numbers, have the capability to understand and make use of technology, have language and culture, and have good senses (maybe not the best of the best, but certainly ranking high compared with Earth organisms overall). Frankly, I am surprised you would discount your own species so readily.
