  What would you say to those of us who simply do not believe the notion that you did not know what you were doing?
#+end_quote

Honestly, I'd probably believe something similar, if I was your brain. This has obviously been a bad start for interspecies relations, and trusting us fully would be idiotic. We don't want your immediate capitulation in exchange for a bunch of empty promises, though. We only want you to give us a chance at redemption, and we fully expect you to insist on a bunch of caveats and restrictions. A guarantee of our good intentions can't be offered, or else we wouldn't be having this conversation. The only thing we can guarantee, that you'll believe, coming from where your headspace is now, is that if you choose to treat us as hostiles we'll be forced to respond likewise. Let that, if nothing else, be your impetus for grasping the olive branch.

The problem with your questions, aside from the fact that you've seemingly made up your mind in advance, is that you're making a lot of assumptions that are natural from a human point of view but not from a Yeerkish one. There are things you need to know that I don't know how to say, and I'm worried that you'll take my missteps as evidence of bad faith when really they're the consequence of trying to be as open as possible, even if doing so reveals something unsettling to you. Nothing but time and exposure can give you the assurance you want. If you stop making so many demands so quickly, it's probable you'll end up a lot more satisfied. Try imagining how we might be telling the truth, rather than only ever considering how we might be advancing a deception. Then, once you've thought about it without ideological preconceptions for five minutes, feel free to be as skeptical as you like.

  What criterion for sentience did you use? What sorts of beings do you think we are? How did you acquire your cultural proficiency so quickly, despite taking so long to figure out our sentience? What exactly made you change your mind?
#+end_quote

Take sentience, for example. You asked what criterion we used for it, but the truth is that we didn't even think to have one. Unlike humans, Yeerks don't have a rich tradition of science fiction stories and unsettling philosophical thought experiments. For the longest time, we couldn't even see the stars in the sky. We don't have legal institutions or ethics review boards or best practices for interstellar contact - at least, we didn't a few months ago. Maybe soon that will change.

Fundamentally, we're not culturally or biologically equipped for thinking about sentience in the same way as you, because the default way we relate to others is so different. The concept of sentience is strange to me, at times obvious and at others bizzare, and ultimately I respect your personhood not because I'm entirely convinced you have a soul but because I'm deeply unsettled by the possibility that you might. My decision, and the decision of every other Yeerk I've discussed this with, was not the consequence of some mathematically rigorous proof or lightning-bolt realization. Rather, it was the product of a million dispersed doubts. More and more, I'm coming to be comfortable with this view as I interact with you while trying to keep your status as an independent existence in mind, but it's still very strange and I can't promise that what I mean by sentience is necessarily the same as what you do.

  seem to have successfully acquired enough cultural and linguistic knowledge to have this conversation with more skill than the average human, very quickly.
#+end_quote

Case in point, I don't understand why you would expect there to be a connection between cultural literacy or vocabulary and empathy. That might be the sort of correlation that makes sense to think about in the context of humans but not in the context of minds in general. Wikipedia knows a million times more of human culture than I do - is it thereby more empathetic? Presumably, I'm misinterpreting your point in some facile and shallow way, but knowing this doesn't actually help me to figure out what it is you do mean in postulating this connection. I'd appreciate getting some clarification so that I can better understand your meaning.
