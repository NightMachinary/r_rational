"Can" is a murkier concept than most humans think, especially when it comes to resource expenditure. There are dozens of constraining assumptions lurking in the background of most questions of possibility. When we ask whether it can rain tomorrow, for instance, in one sense the answer is obviously yes - there's no Cosmic Prohibition precluding the possibility, and given uncertainty weather can reasonably be thought of as a dice roll. But in another sense, the answer is determined by variables that are already fixed - such as the current temperature, prevailing wind patterns, and so on. In the same way, while it's in one sense possible that we could go to enormous expense to uproot ourselves and our hosts from all planetary surfaces in order to become risk resilient Space Nomads, given realistic constraints - political, military, economic - it's not an option. There's no sufficiently strong reason NOT to live on the surface of planets to overcome all the forces incentivizing us to do otherwise. It's not like colony ships are a negligible expense. I can't go into detail about our force's military posture for obvious reasons, but a small spacefaring population is sufficient to guard against the worst case scenario of total extinction and ensure retaliatory capabilities. Anything more is excessive investment against one particular risk, when so many others have to be considered.

We contacted you because you live here. You seem to be thinking as if political and economic isolationism is the default option, against which all deviations must be justified, and it's not clear why. Gains from trade are widely understood as good by human economists. The only reason we could have not to contact you would be if you represented a significant military threat, so that the risk of interaction outweighed the reward. Bluntly, your tech isn't anywhere near that level yet.
