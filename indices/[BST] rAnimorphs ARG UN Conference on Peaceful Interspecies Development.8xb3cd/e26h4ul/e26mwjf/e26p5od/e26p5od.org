Would you consider it unlikely that humanity has been contacted by extraterrestrials in the past, or are you simply unaware of any specific incidents? If you were to gain information about previous encounters, on what basis would you be willing to share it?

Separately, can you describe to us any agreements you may have with other extraterrestrial societies? Do you have any close relationships which do not involve hosts?
