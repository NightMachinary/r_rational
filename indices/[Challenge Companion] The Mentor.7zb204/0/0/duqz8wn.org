Thanks! I've been running the challenges for almost three years now, and have been trying to not have it as one of the things that gets put on the backburner, which it does from time to time.

I'm trying to think of what I want to do for the three year anniversary, which will be 6/17/18 (but probably not actually that, because it doesn't fall on a Wednesday). "Nothing" is certainly tempting in its simplicity, but if not nothing then maybe a showcase of the 'top' winners or something from all previous ~80 challenges.
