The recent challenge themes were all very, very good. If I hadn't been extraordinarily busy recently, I would've submitted way more stories, because those themes all deserve to be illuminated from multiple angles. (For example, I have a half-finished story for Infighting in which eight Cedrics Diggory rob a casino in Vegas. Well, maybe I'll finish it for a future challenge.)

Thank you for your excellent work in providing the prompts. It is much appreciated.
