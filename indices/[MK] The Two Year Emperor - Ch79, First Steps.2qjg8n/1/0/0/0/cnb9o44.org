I think that would be a short book. If he made it home with just the Rule of Size, Jake would be infinitely wealthy instantly -- buy a chunk of gold, Enlarge it, sell it back for a ridiculous amount. He could Shrink space payloads so that one launch could put up 4096x as much volume / mass of stuff. He could smuggle things undetectably -- just Shrink them and turn them into a piece of cloth.

That's just the first three things that pop to mind. Could be a fun series to write, actually.
