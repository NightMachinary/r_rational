  According to Bucket, saying something is bad without having a good reason to will lead you to bad conclusions.

I think you missed the third, pun-ish and tautological interpretation here: concluding that something is bad without good reason will lead to a bad conclusion.

We implicitly impute different meanings to the word "bad" when it's used in different parts of the sentence (saying something is bad -> value judgement of a thing; bad conclusion -> invalid conclusion), but it's just as reasonable to use the same meaning of bad in both places (saying something is bad -> value judgement of a thing; bad conclusion -> conclusion about the value of a thing).

So, literally. Saying that something is bad (for any reason) is, itself, a conclusion that the thing is bad. Or in other words, a bad conclusion.
