I know narratively that the story is about an Evil Wonka and that he's not going to say that 'Oh I was just lying to you about my nature and operations to creep you out so you would prove you were worthy righteous beings to assume universal power'

But if this was real, wouldn't you assume this was what he was doing? Even with Wonka's vast power, operating a Tardis-like structure of near-infinite suffering seems a bit high-effort. It is much easier to /say/ that you've done that than actually do it. If I was actually there, I would roll to disbelieve. I would expect all the other children to return and the facade to be removed once the true valiant hero stood up to the omnipotent lord of chocolate.
