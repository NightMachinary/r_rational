One thing the remaining +contestants+ /contestant/ besides Mahuika hasn't tried, even as the plot has taken a turn for the serious, is to actually engage Mahuika in the events. She is, to say the least, fairly passive about everything so far, but per her family and some evidence in the text, she can be made to do things if you relate it back to vaping. Something like "would you please help us escape Bucket while you vape" might not work, but it seems worth a try, at this point.

Also, what are the chances that, when there's only one contestant remaining, Bucket simply doesn't give them the factory, seeing how he's some kind of presumably immortal candy construct, just like he's stated the entire time?
