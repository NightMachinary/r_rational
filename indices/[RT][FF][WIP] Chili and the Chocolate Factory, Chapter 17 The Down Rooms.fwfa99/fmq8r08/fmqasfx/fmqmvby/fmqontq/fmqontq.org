Sure, but it's in a wacky/fun way!

...yeah, sorry. I think that's the fluffiest I have to hand. I'll let you know if I think of anything else.

Edit: Oh my gosh I was locked in "web fiction" mode and didn't even consider what I should have recommended from the beginning. Go watch Joe Pera Talks With You, /right now/. That's a show that's /intensely/ worth watching, horrifically underrated, which is 100% devoted to the idea of slowing down, enjoying the little things, and finding calm quiet joy in a world that's gotten too fast and loud and abrasive. [[https://www.adultswim.com/videos/joe-pera-talks-with-you][Season 1 is free to watch on Adult Swim]] (warning: AS's video player tends to skip around, make sure you watch the episodes in the right order.) Every episode is ~11 minutes long. It's a true delight and a rare shining light in these dark times. I feel intense guilt for not mentioning it immediately. No murder, torture, dissection, or violence of any kind. Just wholesomeness, clever writing, brilliant cinematography, and some helpful life philosophy of the sort I know *I* desperately needed when I watched it. In fact I think I'm going to go watch an episode right now.
