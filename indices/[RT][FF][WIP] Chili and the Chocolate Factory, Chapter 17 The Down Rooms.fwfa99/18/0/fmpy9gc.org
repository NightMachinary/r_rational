Wonka had Wonka-vite and still rustled up an heir. He says in /Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator/ that Wonka-vite, a drug which reverses aging, is too precious to waste on himself, but doesn't explain why. (Perhaps because he has taken a dose recently enough that he's waiting another ten years to take his next dose and return to his preferred age.)
