Charles Bucket has stopped being Charles Bucket in my head. Charles Bucket is now Thamiel. There is no difference.

edit: Morally... it is plausible to me that the slaves are not different enough to have unique cognitive experiences. So the amount of total suffering states possible in this configuration may be inherently bounded. This may cap the horror at mere holocaust levels, possibly sub-holocaust.

edit: Hang on, how does this morality work? Anything Bucket does to people, they deserve. So why does Bucket choose to arrange for people to deserve bad things? Isn't that evil?

edit: No it's not, because nothing bad happens to him over it... blagh.

edit: Okay, but it's aesthetically unpleasing, surely? Is Charlie the demiurge? I think there's a reasonable question as to why Charlie has an inherent preference for suffering.

edit: Is this experimental theodicy?
