See, that might be true but Charlie might also just be straight insane. To be honest, I'm not sure how he manages to be at all functional. I think there's some part of the brain that tracks reality, and some part that tracks morality, and I don't think either parts are working for him, possibly because he's in a position where they're not reality-predicting. "Reality is the thing that sometimes makes our perceptions come out different from our predictions." I think Charlie has enough power that reality is forced to meet him halfway, and he perceives, in a Mother Theresa like way, that suffering beatifies pleasure or some such thing. I think after in the first stage consequences were decoupled from emotional valence in his worldview (amor fati wielded as a weapon), this is the second stage of this deconstruction; another level that could have saved his mind destroyed by corrosion through the power he holds. And underneath that, what?
