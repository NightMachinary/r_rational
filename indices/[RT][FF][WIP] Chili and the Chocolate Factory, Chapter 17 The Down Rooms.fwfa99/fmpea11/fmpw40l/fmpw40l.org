In my Second Readthrough edit of my main comment, I expand a little on what I gleaned about Bucket's worldview from this chapter. In a nutshell, Charlie considers the avoidance of suffering to be inherently evil: if you're avoiding your own suffering, you're lazy, and if you avoid causing suffering to others, you're foolish. His worldview is built solely on the pursuit of pleasure via chocolate. He's CelestAI swapping out "values optimization" with "pleasure" and "friendship and ponies" with "chocolate." In his worldview, there are no inherently evil acts-- only the evil of inaction and actions taken in support of that evil. This dovetails nicely (horrifyingly) with his just-world axiom.
