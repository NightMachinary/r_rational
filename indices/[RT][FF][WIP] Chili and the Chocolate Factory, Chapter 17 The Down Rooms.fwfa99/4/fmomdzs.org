Man, this room was a total........ /DOWNer./

And here I thought that my exclamation that "BUCKET YEETED A BABY" was pretty close to a perfect sentence. But of /course/ it could trivially be improved by a megawhomping factor of Wonkillion by appending a yoot to the yeet. Phenomenal.

I'm looking forward to discovering how Tide gets eliminated. I like [[/u/hyphenomicon]]'s theory that Mahuika is actually Marama in disguise.

So. This is how chocolate gets made. Which begs the question....

What about DARK chocolate?

  "Vermicious," she said. "It means something, but I do not remember what."

  "No," said Chetan. "It is a pretend word. People sometimes squashbunt pretend words in their sentences because they think it makes them sound smarter. It doesn't mean anything."

  Keerthi knew Chetan was wrong. She had heard it before. There was no doubt in her mind. As the double doors to the Great Glass Elevator reopened, only one question was on her mind.

  What did vermicious mean?

[[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vermicious][Of, pertaining to, or characteristic of worms.]] I wonder what this breadcrumb leads to. Vermicious Knids featured prominently in The Great Glass Elevator, and some of the prominent theories about anti-astronomy's relation to the Knids seem to have been confirmed this chapter. We'll see.

#+end_quote

There's a couple things going on here I'd like to address. First, I'd like to address the exact wording and one literal meaning of the sentence. According to Bucket, /saying something is bad without having a good reason to/ will /lead you to/ */bad conclusions/*. Chetan never told Keerthi to speak truth to power and inform Bucket about the moral failings of his factory. Chetan understood that doing such a thing would effectively be suicide, and that doing such a thing had absolutely no chance of changing Bucket's mind about anything or preventing any of the suffering inflicted by the factory. Whenever Keerthi challenges Bucket's morality, he goes Pennywise on her. So by the literal reading of this sentence, Bucket is saying /whiny children get got./ None of this is particularly surprising in any way, but I enjoyed the extra layer of meaning there.

Now, for the less-literal, seemingly-intended meaning of the line, which, at a glance, could be disregarded as Bucket spouting truisms or just being a typical overbearing adult rolling his eyes at a child who detests bread crusts or broccoli. However, looking at the ethical framework these three sentences imply reveals an entirely new and terrifying aspect of Bucket's worldview. Since he rejects /saying something is bad without having a good reason/, he rejects deontological ethics entirely, as well as any moral framework with axiomatically-defined evil acts. Rather, it is the /failure/ to act which is evil; failure to act stemming from avoidance of one's own suffering is lazy, while failure to act stemming from avoidance of someone else's suffering is foolish. We knew he was a murdering, clamming slave-owner, but with this line Bucket reveals that he truly has /no/ limits of any kind. Later in this chapter we learn that he is perpetrating an atrocity on a grander scale than has been considered anywhere outside this subculture (basilisks, Pascal's muggings, time travel which erases existing timelines, etc), but I don't think we've seen the bottom of Bucket's depravity yet. These three lines are heavy with meaning, and I now picture Bucket's psychology as a chocolate-flavored composite of Pennywise, Hitler, and the Cenobites; no version of Satan has ever been described as /this/ evil. I think humanity might actually fare better with the Chococlipper, because at least the Chococlipper's utility function is only to produce as /much/ chocolate as possible, not the /best/ chocolate possible.

  "No," said Mr. Bucket. "The VIP Room is one small room that is designed to seem bigger than it is. The Down Rooms are many rooms stapled together in a way that makes them feel like they are only one. Down Tower itself is inside of thousands of different rooms, and it has hundreds of rooms inside of it. The four of us are standing inside of ten different rooms right now."

  Keerthi sighed.

  "Do not worry about architecture," said Mr. Bucket. "We are here for the slavery! Let's go inside."
#+end_quote

Leaving aside how great that Bucket line is, I love how he's casually revealing his absolute mastery of space here. Whether by expanding wormholes or folding spacetime, he has the ability to reconfigure the three perceptible spatial dimensions as he pleases. That means he has teleportation, that means he can make things bigger on the inside than the outside, and it means the factory's physical footprint has nothing to do with its capacity. Wonkaland? Try Wonkaworld.

  He pressed a button on his cane. The handle became a ladle. He walked over to the pier and filled it before giving it to Keerthi.

  "Take a drink," said Mr. Bucket. "Do not worry. You are too thin to get stuck in the pipes."

Hahahaha.

  Mr. Bucket took a bite from his cane.

  "You can have your morality, or you can have your chocolate. I cannot tell you which one to choose. I can only tell you which one tastes better."
#+end_quote

Avoidance of suffering is evil in Bucket's worldview. To avoid one's own suffering is to be lazy. To avoid causing suffering to others is to be foolish. Only pursuing pleasure makes sense to him.

  "Yes," said Mr. Bucket. "Quarks! Quarks all have strong tastes, which is why different kinds of quarks are called flavors. Quarks come in six different flavors! There is up, down, top, bottom, strange, and charm."

  "Stop lying to us," said Keerthi. "We aren't going to believe your nonsense. Obviously real scientists wouldn't name subatomic particles after random silly words like that."

  Tide walked over to Keerthi and whispered into her ear.

  Keerthi frowned. "Are you sure?"

  Tide nodded.

  "Yes," said Mr. Bucket. "It is easy to understand. Murdering deer makes Wonkanucleons fill up with happiness and taste worse than snozzcumbers. Slavery makes Wonkanucleons feel down, which turns them scrumptious. It's common sense."
