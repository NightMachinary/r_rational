*Wonka Industries - Slavery is just the beginning!*

On a re-read of the story, here are some thoughts:

I suspect the place Wonka was trying to access that "less then five people" know about is a world of pure imagination.

Still suspect the "fuel" for this involves the children somehow. Wonka had them all sign a blood contract at the beginning, including himself, and was very clear it had to be their real names. The method of getting there was gleaned from a translation, implied to be something he and Charlie had to translate themselves. The contract contains lots of "non-words" and instructions on harvesting and preserving cucumbers (aka pickling and/or brining), not counting what he claims is written on the back.

I still don't have any clue what happened to the President back before he was confident.

Mahuika can move her arms insanely fast for the purposes of vaping.

Chilli's real name starts with "Ch" and was probably Charlie.

Things in the running as the only thing other then vapes Wonka is second-best at: Suspenders. Peaches.

I love Tide's puns.

JUROR asked Charlie for good advice, and Charlie said to tie his shoes or he'll trip on something.

Charlie knows the VIPs aren't slaves because they don't "change the taste". He's sure they're not slaves because he knows slavery influences the flavour of things and so their situation isn't dire enough to count as slavery.

Tide has made several slip-ups in regards to following her cult practices this chapter. Still on the fence if she believes it or not. Still real curious about her parents, why she's so angry at them, and why they're so guilty about whatever happened. Whatever it was, it resulted in her being emancipated three years ago. Which...was around the time of the baby wars. Are they connected?

Charlie has made it pretty clear nobody wins anything for being the last kid standing. I don't understand why Tide thinks there's any hope of this lunatic handing over his factory at the end. Except maybe to Mahuika who is basically a saint in Charlie's worldview.

Chetan has been saying Charlie was a bad person since Keerthi first entered the factory.

I think Tide's father Dr. Glunka Cervantes is actually Marama Jewel's nemesis Senor Syzygy, the arch-astronomer.

•They're both Spanish, which the story goes out of its way to establish with Syzygy's accent and Glunka's descent from the author of Don Quixote.

•Syzygy has burning eyes, and Glunka is known for his signature "funglasses". Sidenote: Tide similarly hides her face at all times.

•Tide straight up admits (in the narration) that her dad is an astronomer.

Edit: I completely missed that there was a third party involved in Wonka's great project, either as obstacle to be bargained with or as information source. Possibly the third person with Wonka and Charlie for Wonka's last breakfast, but also potentially something else.
