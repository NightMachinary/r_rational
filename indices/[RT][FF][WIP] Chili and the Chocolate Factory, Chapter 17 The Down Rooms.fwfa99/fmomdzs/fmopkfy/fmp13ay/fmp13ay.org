Following Bucket's insane moon logic, you only need a trillion sapient slaves in order to make /the best/ chocolate. An abnormally large number of slaves will instead provide you with chocolate that is merely very good.

I'm guessing that Wonka didn't yet understand the subtlety of chocodynamics, given that the quark model was proposed in the same year as the book was published, but he did seem to understand that enslaving an entire race of small orange people was key to creating excellent chocolate. Was it the smallness? The orangeness? No, turns out it's the slavery.

And given what happened a couple chapters ago I kinda think Bucket probably freed the oompa loompas, only to discover that it makes the chocolate go bad. If that's the case, I'd bet this also greatly informed his "just world" perspective - the oompa loompas were slaves because it was correct for them to be slaves, because better chocolate is the most correct thing.
