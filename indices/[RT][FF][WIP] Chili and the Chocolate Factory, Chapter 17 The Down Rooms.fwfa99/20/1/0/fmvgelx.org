  Chill Lee had the crowd eating out of the palm of his hand.

  "When the puzzle asks for someone to 'INPUT WHAT I LIKE BEST INTO ME', it is asking what the person individually likes best: what they literally appreciate more than everyone else does."

  "But it uses the word I and then the word me in the same sentence," said Boggis. "That doesn't make any sense if the 'I' is supposed to be the puzzle-solver and the 'me' is supposed to be Bucket himself representing the bucket."

  "Wonka is using the unroyale I," Chill Lee explained.

However, the answer was to put chocolate, Bucket's favorite thing, in the bucket.

  There was brown vomit everywhere. It was on Ms. Ownreewhard's carpets, and on her floors, and on her many framed paintings of all the good deeds she had done.

  Most importantly it was on the computer screen, which it had gone inside. The bucket was now filled with chocolately vomit. Chili stared at it, not knowing what to do. He had severely misunderstood how computers worked.

  Little fireworks began firing on the top half of the screen. They formed words.

  'CONGRATULATIONS! YOU WIN :D! YOU DID A VERY GOOD JOB OF SOLVING THE PUZZLE! I OWN A CHOCOLATE FACTORY SO OF COURSE WHAT I LIKE BEST IS CHOCOLATE! AND ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS PUT IT INSIDE THE BUCKET! YOU ARE VERY GOOD AT RIDDLES! REACH IN AND TAKE IT!'

  An arrow pointed inside the bucket. Chili followed it, reached inside, then pulled out the sixth Golden Ticket.
