Bro, this chapter had me almost foaming at the mouth. I'm not even sure I can accurately describe the combination of feelings I was having, despite having purposefully cultivated very good language for describing my inner life to myself.

Thanks! I hate it.

It was unexpected but unsurprising that Wonka would get Keerthi by emotionally torturing her and then presenting her with a basic assumption (you use this device by pressing the button on it) he knew would eliminate her. Along with disarming their guards earlier via the “this chocolate is safe trick”, it's actually a really clever ploy.

It's weird how he subscribes to just world reasoning, but tries to be clever/semi-subtle/ironic about whacking the contestants. It's so obviously for his own fucked up enjoyment to do it this way, instead of just pushing a button that instantly kills someone with chocolate or something.

...please do not do that next chapter.

Also, I don't know if I'm just slow, but the fundamental irony of the situation has finally dawned on me. The original tour was, in theory, Wonka testing the kids to see which one of them was most deserving to inherit the vast power and responsibility of his chocolate factory. And he picked Charlie, who gained all that power and turned into...this. Maybe Wonka was a shit judge.

It's hard to gauge how bad the others would have been, because it seems like any holder of the factory might as well have infinite money and magic-chocolate-science international hard and soft power deployment. Maybe Charlie was the best choice of successor in the entire world, and anyone else would have done much worse than CHOCOR baby nuclear war and massively utility-negative chocolate and etc.

Maybe this is the best of all possible worlds. There's probably has a candy for that.
