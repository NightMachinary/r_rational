Ah, I was unclear if you were inventing a new term or discussing an existing term.

On precommitment: unless I missed something it seemed like what you were actually talking about was ways of avoiding situations where precommitment would be necessary in order to avoid attractors, instead of ways of using precommitment to prevent attractors from changing preferences. Is that right? I suppose precommitment is a separate issue from attractor theory.

In general it seems very interesting but I don't know what to ask.
