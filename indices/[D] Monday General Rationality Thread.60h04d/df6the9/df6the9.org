I started writing a worm fanfiction and posted it on SV, based on "With Friends Like these" my TheMadmanandre. My fic, "The Friendbringer" is about 27k words in.

Friendbringer is intended to be mostly rational, but if you spot inconsistencies, I'm just having fun with it tbqh.

I've also started posting sections of my Pokemon fanfic Night within. It's recursive with OoS, attempting to be canon-compliant.

I'm still following my original schedule of about 3 weeks per chapter after the first chapter is posted though.

Anyway, let me know what you think.

You can read it on SV here:

Until they are complete, I will be posting on SV and SB exclusively.
