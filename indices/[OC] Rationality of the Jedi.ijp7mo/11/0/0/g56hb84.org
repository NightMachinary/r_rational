Indeed, the Star Wars non-film material was filled with better writers trying to make the things George Lucas put on the screen make more sense. Like Stormtrooper armor appearing to be completely ineffective against the blasters used by Han Solo and various other Rebels. (If I were writing a justification, I'd say that the armor provides just enough protection to turn otherwise lethal shots into incapacitating ones, letting the armored trooper live to fight another day after being shot.)
