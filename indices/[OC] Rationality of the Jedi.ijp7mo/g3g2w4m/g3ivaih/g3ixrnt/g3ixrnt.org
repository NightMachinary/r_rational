I mean, they know their enemy created the army they're relying on, Shaak Ti and Anakin should both know about the brain chips if their brains didn't fall out of their ears in the beginning of season 6, and Palpatine directly lies to Padm√© multiple times to get her ambushed or captured and she knows that they were lies. Aside from Dooku giving the entire game away in episode II before the noir mystery movie becomes a gladiator/war movie for no reason, there are a ludicrous amount of hints around that the entire war is built on a sham and that Palpatine is deeply involved.

My personal headcanon of the entire Star Wars saga is that Palpatine had this really careful plan in episode 1 but then everything went to shit and yet he managed to get ahead even faster than planned. He starts doing dumber and dumber plans, giving him more and more outrageous victories. Finally he gets the Empire despite his own sabotage, causing his mind to snap. After years of rule he has toned down the crazy plans and gotten more serious, which proves to be his downfall. He rebuilds in secret and makes the dumbest plan possible now that he has proof that those always work, what he doesn't know is that this ability is genetic and he dies to Rey.
