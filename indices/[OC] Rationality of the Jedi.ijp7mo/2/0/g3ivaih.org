They know a Sith was manipulating both sides to cause war, but for what cause specifically?

According to the novelization of episode 3, Mace suspected Mas Amedda, the speaker of the Senate, of being the other sith lord. Even with that he doesn't have the control that Palpatine had. And without Order 66, it is unclear what the endgame is.

An alternate theory can be that the Sith are undermining the Republic for the separatists backed by the Sith to win akin to the old Sith empires.

Even knowing the Sith are causing it, what are they to do? They cant just stop fighting.
