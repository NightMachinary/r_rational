The worst part is in "the Clone Wars" where they finally have all the puzzle pieces and yet do nothing. They know the entire Clone Army is based on the personal bodyguard/hitman of Dooku who knows the location of the separatist secret base in the second movie. That alone is suspicious as all hell.

in the show they then figure out that Dooku is also the sith, Darth Tyranus, and that he worked with Sifo-Dyas, the man who commissioned the army. Once you have all these pieces, it becomes directly obvious that the sith are controlling both sides of the war. The Jedi, even after acknowledging that Dooku may well just be the apprentice, decide to do nothing at all about this.
