  Why are the separatists the only ones to do this given how vastly superior the droids appear to be? How has someone not attempted galactic conquest like this before?

It probably wasn't practical before. As recently as The Phantom Menace, an army of battle droids required a huge command ship in orbit in order to make them effective. And, far from being "vastly superior" at that point, many of them were laid low by the comic relief of one clumsy Gungan.

In addition, rebellion was probably easier to put down when there was more coherence to the Republic. It sounds like the normal plan would be to levy various Republic worlds for troops to raise a Grand Army of the Republic if a war became necessary. By the time of the prequels, the Republic was already starting to succumb to corruption and fragmentation; a call to raise an army probably wouldn't have been heeded, and the secession might have happened without a fight.

But, yes, I would think that supplementing the clone army with droids is probably a necessary step towards victory in the scenario above. Not that the Republic should ever have been relying on a slave army in the first place.
