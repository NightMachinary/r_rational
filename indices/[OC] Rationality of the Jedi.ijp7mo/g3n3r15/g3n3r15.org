Ha! Nice twist at the end, this galaxy might end up WORSE than the one we know, in spite of all. It would be a nice premise for a longfic, in fact. Though I wonder in what ways precisely can the Dark Side enhance the originally poor droids.

BTW this made me think of something relatively similar I'm writing in another story - more crackfic than ratfic, and with a later divergence point, but same considerations about the arrest of the Chancellor:

  "...and so here I am. You see why at this point there's no turning back for me. But if we can defeat Palpatine, at least-"

  "Now, you're rushing things," Padmé raised a hand, tapping the side of her cheek with one finger of the other in a thoughtful attitude. "Your situation isn't that bad, honestly."

  "Not that bad? Padmé, I was an accomplice in killing a Master from the Jedi Council!"

  "Anakin, honey, I'm a politician. People have gotten away with worse. Now, if you had also killed the children, that would have been tricky."

  "Sure, but-"

  "Look, from what you tell me, Master Windu was trying to perform an extrajudicial killing - he did not get a warrant or anything to carry out his little citizen's arrest, and the Chancellor has political immunity. You may even have done the right thing!"

  "Really?"

  "Sure. I'm telling you, if he had succeeded, he'd be in a lot of trouble right now. In theory, there's a rule that says Siths are exclusive Jedi jurisdiction, but there was no need of it for thousands of years, as most Siths these days are enemy combatants anyway, and there were no independent witnesses to certify that Master Windu didn't just kill a frightened old man and stick a red lightsaber in his dead hand. From anyone else's viewpoint it would have been just a plain old military coup."

  "I see. I did the right thing," Anakin's face brightened. "Huh, I guess the Republic does work, sometimes!"

  "Except for the part where we missed the Chancellor being an evil overlord and now he's just pulled a coup and is about to take over," said Padmé, shrugging. "We should do something about that."
