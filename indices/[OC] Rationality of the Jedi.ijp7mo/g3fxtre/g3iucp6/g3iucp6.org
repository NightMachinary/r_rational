Mace seems to jabe thoroughly checked out the Clones. The 150 orders arent a secret so a rational Mace would have noticed them and prepared for that contingency.

It is especially notable because Order 66 can only be triggered by the Supreme Chancellor. Given that Palpatine is a Sith Lord obviously working against the Jedi who is Supreme Chancellor, Order 66 would completely cripple the Jedi and it would be reasonable to expect him to use it.

If I was preparing in case of an improper use of Order 66, I would already plan to shut down communications to prevent the order being received. There isnt another real counter to it aside from Order 65 which was also done.
