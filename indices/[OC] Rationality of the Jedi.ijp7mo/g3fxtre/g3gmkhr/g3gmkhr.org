I certainly considered this idea while writing the story, but ultimately I didn't want to have to reimagine the entire prequel trilogy up to this point. Such are the pitfalls of starting in an irrational setting. I also tried to retcon in the idea that Mace Windu was always suspicious of the clones, and especially of Order 66, but used them anyway because the Republic fell into civil war and having an only sort-of trustworthy army RFN was better than having a fully trustworthy army even a year hence.
