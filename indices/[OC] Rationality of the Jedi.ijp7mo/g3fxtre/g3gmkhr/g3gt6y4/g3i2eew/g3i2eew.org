That's a good idea, and you are encouraged to draw what conclusions you will. Quite frankly, I have not considered the /specific/ point of departure; as far as I am concerned, this fic takes place in a world very similar, but not identical, to the established Star Wars universe. Imagine its relationship to canon as similar to that of Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality - the setting is recognizable, but the story may depart drastically from it in order to tell a more compelling story.
