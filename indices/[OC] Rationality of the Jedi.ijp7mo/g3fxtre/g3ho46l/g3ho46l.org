  That said, the way Mace Windu perfectly navigates around the pitfall of Order 66 makes it feel almost more like a Peggy Sue fixfic than a ratfic.

I thought it was believable because it comes with knowledge of Order 65 and presumably the other 64+ General Orders. It wasn't considered /significant/ previously, because they have special orders for a number of other implausible contingencies such as the Chancellor being a traitor.
