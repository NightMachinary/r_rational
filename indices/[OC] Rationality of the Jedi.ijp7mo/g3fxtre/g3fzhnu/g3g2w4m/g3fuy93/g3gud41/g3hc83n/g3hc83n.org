Love it - that the whole prequel required the Jedi order to never let go of the Idiot Ball was what drove me nuts about the series, especially the 3rd one.

When the curtain closed my final reaction was WTF - a 10,000 year old order of psychics don't teach "self fulfilling prophecy 101" as a required course? It was like whatever your head cannon, or fanfic was back in the 80s when you first saw the movies was for why Vader Fell... even if you were 8 at the time... that was better.

Is there support for droids networking? It always seemed odd that they were not all built with pre-installed wireless communicators (at least post Cell Phone it does) but it seemed a Star Wars Thing... Droids have always been a little problematic if you start thinking about them... apparently sentient, yet enslaved - act/interact like high skill people not computers. Maybe Star Wars had it's own Near Singularity event in the past and there are some absolutes droid rules now?
