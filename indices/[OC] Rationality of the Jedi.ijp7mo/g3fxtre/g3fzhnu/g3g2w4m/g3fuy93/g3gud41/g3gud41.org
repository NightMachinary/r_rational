I love how you explained all the quirks of the Droid being purposefully programmed to make human errors. Really seals up a questionable part of the canon for me.

Does anyone happen to have the link to that short story where the Jedi apprentice realizes the force has its own nebulous goals and then they are killed by Order 66?
