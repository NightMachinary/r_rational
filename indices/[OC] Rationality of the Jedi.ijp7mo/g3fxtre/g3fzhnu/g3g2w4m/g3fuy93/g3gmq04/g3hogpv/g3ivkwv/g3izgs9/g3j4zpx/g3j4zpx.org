I was speaking more of these newer capabilities with the networked killing machines. Something like that should have been doable beforehand. Although I suppose the central republic strength makes it not viable without vast investment and organization that could compare to the Republic itself without a clear benefit.

I suppose the Sith lying low may have held these droid armies back as they saved up these capabilities for when they were truly ready.
