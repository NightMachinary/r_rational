There is also the idea of adopting a droid army of their own to supplement the Republic.

Why are the separatists the only ones to do this given how vastly superior the droids appear to be? How has someone not attempted galactic conquest like this before?

The main explanation I see for at least the short term is sabotage by Palpatine to keep the Republic from using droids just in case.

The Reoublic just needs to hold off the droids long enough to begin their own production.
