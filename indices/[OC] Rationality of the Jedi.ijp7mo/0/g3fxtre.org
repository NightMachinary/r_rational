This is good as a “if they did everything definitively right” ratfic, with the weight of it resting on the punch at the end of them still losing because everybody in the situation gets to act rationally, and Sidious is in a very advantageous material position.

That said, the way Mace Windu perfectly navigates around the pitfall of Order 66 makes it feel almost more like a Peggy Sue fixfic than a ratfic. IMO a central pillar of ratfic is that characters doing their best are capable of being wrong for a variety of reasons, usually including bad prioritization, limited information, and personal blind spots. But Mace here lasers in on the one problem we, the readers, know to be central, but that he probably wouldn't focus on to such an extent without that privileged knowledge. Maybe I'm the only one getting that feeling?

It might just be the prequels not being rational causing this problem, because of course if Mace Windu is competent enough to adroitly avoid his final mistakes in the series, all of the earlier ones he made suddenly require more explanation than “the Jedi are a failing and corrupt institution blinded by dogma.”
