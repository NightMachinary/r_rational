Thank you for the odd compliment, I guess?

I found it very difficult to make a synopsis that didn't sound like the first episode of a harem comedy, even if in the writing I found myself far from that genre's tropes.

I've never really gotten much enjoyment out of that genre, an utterly whipped male protagonist with no real character traits against an increasingly unlikely number of female deuteragonists gets annoying quickly.
