How does a cat know how to put on clothes?

Well. I suppose I should be asking how and why this anthroid mind is considered feline. I thought it was going to be a literal cat. And if it used to be a literal cat, then how do they not have AGI when they do have the capability to uplift emulated minds. Did they do some sort of probabilistic mapping from a cat's brain to a human's brain? What is the relation to cats, besides the Doylian interpretation of the catgirl trope as premise? It honestly seems cat-themed, but... why?
