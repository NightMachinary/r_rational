This is a major point during attempts to HACK THE UNIVERSE. I'm going to mention it in my next post, but one thing I can say is that no, primates do not trigger the creation of realtime zones whatever their mental state.

Humans do not know how exactly the simulation knows where they are and whether they are conscious or not. At least, not yet at this point of the setting. What they do know is that the realtime zone around a living human can be reduced but never negated, ie even a person in a coma will be provided with correct sensory input.
