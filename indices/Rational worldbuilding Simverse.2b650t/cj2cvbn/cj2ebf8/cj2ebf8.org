Depending on the size of realtime zones around people and the minimum diameter, together with your idea of testing out what counts as human and what doesn't, one could force the universe to envelop the full Earth in a realtime zone. That might crack the simulation.

The principle would be Human A with a few people B, C, D around him in distance < a, with a being the diameter of Realtime Zone of A. This results in an RZ around a the diameter of 4*(a+b+c+d), if I understand the method correctly. Even if it's only a+b+c+d you can still add enough humans until the Earth is completely in a RZ.
