What counts as human? An unscrupulous person is gonna think of this and experiment on humans and other primates on whether mental diseases, brain damage and other modifications have an effect on the presence/size of their realtime zone. If what marks a person as human is nonessential, one might reproduce the marker en masse to effectively create an antimagic field that the simulator looks at /very/ closely (or even overload the simulator by raising the number of "human"s by a few orders of magnitude, for whatever purpose), or one might remove one's own marker to allow self-enhancing/affecting magic.
