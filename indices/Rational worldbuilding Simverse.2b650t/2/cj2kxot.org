I was sure I had read/hear a comparable setting, with a different background, some time ago and am guessing it was in Escape Pod.

Premise: Our world is a simulation on the server of a sociology department somewhere and the study it was programmed for just concluded. Since we [simulated humans] clear the requirement for ethical treatment the sociology department decided to keep our simulation running in the barest sense: Humans don't age, the environment will keep doing what it just did for eternity (where it rained, it will rain forever, no continental drift, wind at that time will always be of the same force and vector, you get the drift). The downscaling wasn't perfect though, and the story ends with the character finding and exploring very non-euclidian glitches.
