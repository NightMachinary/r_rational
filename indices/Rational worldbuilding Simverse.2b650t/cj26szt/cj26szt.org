Reminds me very much of a plot point in the Ed stories by QNTM guy.

Ed somehow figured out a code which destroyed a large amount of sentient space. The logistics were never really padded out as he was going for very soft sci-fi in that series.

Here's the thing, I really absolutely love the concept. But how would it be implemented in storytelling?

Would one start at the beginning of the sim or would one start with us knowing exactly as much as a character or set of characters in the sim would know?

It also gives one the opportunity to explore the nature of reality from a hypothetical outside of reality, which is a cool bit of a side dish of philosophy.
