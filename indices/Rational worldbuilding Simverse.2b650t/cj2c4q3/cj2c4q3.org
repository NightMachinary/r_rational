Pretty interesting idea. I think a key element is that errors are not always detected . . . but no one know exactly why they are not detected. Is it an issue with the state checker? Some hidden variable that affects the render but which is not directly observable? A "memory leak" or "buffer overflow"?

The implications for continuing to attempt to create and manipulate those errors may ultimately affect the stability of the entire system/universe. Oops, BSOD on the universe . . . time for another big bang.
