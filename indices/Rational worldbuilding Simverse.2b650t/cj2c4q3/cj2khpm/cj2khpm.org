After some experimentation and attempts at modifying reality themselves, humans in the setting have mostly taken up the theory that the engine that generates and simulates the reality is separate from the engine that verifies that what is being simulated isn't flawed in some way.

The reason why errors aren't being detected is a combination of the verification tool breaking down over time, and the simulator not having enough resources to go over everything multiple times to compensate for the inefficient verification.

I noted in some comment that creating a big instability in the system, intentionally or not, has mostly negative consequences for you... you will alert the verification tool and the simulator basically reviews what is going on 'out of cycle'. The ultimate aim of the simulator is its own survival, not the perfect accuracy of the simulation.
