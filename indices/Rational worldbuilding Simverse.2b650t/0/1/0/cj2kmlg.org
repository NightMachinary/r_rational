It'd be good to learn more about these things. With worldbuilding it's very important to be able to insert yourself in and to do that you need to know what sort of pressures there are.

  A good example is 1900 vs 2000. The differences might be huge in terms of technology, borders, available resources and energy ect.... but on the scale of human history, the issues barely moved.

Well, large wars mostly ended due to nuclear weapons, mutually assured destruction became a thing, large scale welfare became huge, drugs and pedophilia became taboo, homosexuality and abortion became socially popular, feminism rose as a large force, race politics started to reverse from "Beat up the minorities/ barely tolerate them" to "Socially support the minorities".

Lots of new issues and changes.
