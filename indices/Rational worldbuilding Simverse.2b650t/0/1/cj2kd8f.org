There are such threats, and will be exposed in Simverse III.

You should realize that even by HACKING THE UNIVERSE, the population growth isn't going to magically double in the next century. There won't be a galaxy-wide colonization by humans like in soap operas. Humans don't change that fast, conflicts last much longer than that and all in all, we're going to have an Earth-centric setting with problems that still contain echoes from today.

A good example is 1900 vs 2000. The differences might be huge in terms of technology, borders, available resources and energy ect.... but on the scale of human history, the issues barely moved.
