Krakonfour's physics treat human observers differently from inanimate matter. We assume that AI is possible because we already are examples of minds running on physical hardware, and we just have to rewrite them on computers instead of brains. But if brains have magical properties that computers don't... human-equivalent AI might actually be impossible without breaking into the next level down.
