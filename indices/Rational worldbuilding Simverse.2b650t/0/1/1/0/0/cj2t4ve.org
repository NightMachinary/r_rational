Hooo boy, are you in for a treat.

Ever heard of videogames? They're very long, aren't they, with all those objectives and hours of content to get through. /But/, speedrunning isn't about following the game's rules; it's about breaking the game as much as possible and abusiing bugs to cheat their ways to the end as rapidly as possible. This isn't to mean that the players are unskilled. In fact, some of the most powerful glitches and skips must be perfectly executed /to the frame/ to achieve the desired results.

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7IINwTFVw][This half-hour video]] is a combination of a really strong speedrun of Ocarina Of Time and a history of the speedrunning of that game.

I highly, highly recommend you watch it. Speedrunning is extremely relevant to a setting like yours.

edit: if the video is skipping ahead a few minutes, jump back to the beginning and watch all of it. You'll want to.
