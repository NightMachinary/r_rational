D&D Wizards have little access to revive effects directly - the best ways to get it would all involve problematic spells. You might be able to use lesser planar binding to pull in something with the desired effect as a spell-like ability (as the limit of allowed monster manuals approaches infinity, the power of planar binding and polymorph spells go to infinity!).

As far as dealing with undead directly, you might have more luck with Undeath to Death, Command Undead, or Control Undead, or for extraplanar stuff use Banishment or generic save-or-dies.

As far as Revive Kills Zombies goes, in HP canon it doesn't seem to be a thing and in D&D 3e/3.5e's undead subtype:

#+begin_quote
  Not affected by raise dead and reincarnate spells or abilities. Resurrection and true resurrection can affect undead creatures. These spells turn undead creatures back into the living creatures they were before becoming undead.
#+end_quote

That said, you can do hit point damage with the /cure/ line of spells to undead, but those spells /suck/ except maybe the 6th level harm/heal and Milo has little in the way of access to them anyways.
