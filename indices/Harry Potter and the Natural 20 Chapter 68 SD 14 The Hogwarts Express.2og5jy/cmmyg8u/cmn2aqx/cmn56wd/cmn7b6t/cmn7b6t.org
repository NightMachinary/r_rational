Dementors are from the Potterverse, so it's not clear to me that they would even have a type. It's certainly worth him /trying/ to kill them with some kind of resurrection spell, but given the strange interactions between the two different rulesets, it's certainly not a given. I'm actually still waiting to figure out whether Potterverse characters have an alignment - something that Milo should know by now, given that he can /detect evil/ at will through his prestige class.
