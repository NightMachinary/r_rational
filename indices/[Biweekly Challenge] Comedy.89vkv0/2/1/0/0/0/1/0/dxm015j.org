I gave you an invite; didn't think it was necessary beforehand.

I also wanted to send you a creepy message over the chat system, along the lines of "how dare you doubt me, it will have consequences" or "now you could perceive it as well, and /they/ can perceive you in turn", but didn't manage to come up with anything good until it was too late. I apologize for that; I promise I'll do better next time.
