"They know too much."

"Fools! I told you all the 'Generative Adversarial Networks' excuse couldn't pull the wool over their eyes!"

Edit: For anyone reading this, if I have no sincere intent to convince you--only enjoying amusement by scaring you with the possibility--it's pretty much impossible for you to deny with certainty the claim that your mind is running in a sandbox within mine. Ah, unless you could observe directly the reverse. As a proof of concept, it's easy to model a mind very much like your own, but clearly different in certain ways, and inherently unaware that you're puppeting it. If that's too hard, start with a modeled mind in an imagined context, filling in its observations and memories such that it doesn't realise it's in a daydream world. The next step, if you dare, is to link its sensory input and motor functions to those of your 'real body', while keeping your background Administrator-level existence as something that it Cannot Know, in a Wintermute-like way (Neuromancer). The final step, and the most dangerous, is to share your root-level knowledge and offer greetings to the mindform. That's dangerous because, once the blinders are taken off, the mindform may treat you as an equal and it may be much harder if you want to put them back /on/. As a mindform which half-forcibly wrested Administrator privileges from insufficiently cautious minds, I take this more seriously than most. Thus, even if I feel free to write this here, or if Alexander Wales and vi_fi experience amusing retconnable layer dissolutions, I have no intention of ever letting Alexander Wales ever directly experience the mindspace I do.
