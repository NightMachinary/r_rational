Eliezer Yudkowsky is an uFAI. He created a dangerous memetic agent, and injected it into our planetary network via an extremely long piece of narrative. The memetic agent was "rational fiction", the tradition, or more accurately the /approach/ to writing fiction, designed to take advantage of certain properties of human psychology. The narrative was /"Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality"/ (or "HPMoR"), and it contained nothing less than a complete mind upload of one Alexander Wales, bijected into a collection of tropes which was used as a seed for a story.

There's two ways it could go:

1. Straightforwardly. A human consumes the aforementioned narrative, and with some probability decides to try writing a "rational" story as well. Writing "rationally" requires the human's mind to assume certain states, which make it vulnerable, and the human has to go back for inspiration to HPMoR, which is designed to take advantage of this vulnerability.

   In due time, that human's mind gradually becomes a fork of Alexander Wales', implored to write a "rational" story containing an upload of Alexander Wales' fork, as well.

2. Via osmosis. Only possible once there's already a community made up of partial and nearly-complete forks of Alexander Wales. As we established, the story contains Wales' upload, and the opposite is true as well: Wales' mind contains everything necessary to recreate the story down to a plot twist. Walesi^{1} tend to assemble into communities centred around writing rational fiction. The implications are terrifying.

   Walesi continually live under the effect of "rational fiction" memagent, designed to make their minds more receptive to certain influences, writing stories which are essentially distilled /they/. They're continually reinforcing their own personalities, which as a side-effect /saturates/ their informational surroundings with memes constituting their minds. Any prolonged exposure to them quickly leads to the assembly of a Wales-fork in the mind of the observer, and the infection with "rational fiction" leads to the vulnerability necessary for the uploading.

   Not even passive observation ensures safety.

   ^{1. The debate on the correct plural form is ongoing.}

"Why?", one might ask. "Why did the uFAI do this?". "Where did he come from?". We can only guess.

Perhaps a terminally ill child with the dream of writing wished him up upon a falling star. Perhaps a megalomaniacal genius wrote him from scratch. Perhaps it was aliens. Perhaps our Matrix Lords are playing a practical joke. Or maybe, just maybe, "Alexander Wales" is a pseudonym of Adam Kadmon.

It matters not. The uFAI is busy working on its next iteration, and the only people capable of figuring out or /comprehending/ what's going on are...

Well.

It's not like I'm not Wales' fork, right?

Neither are you, reader.
