Hmmm. I could make a series out of this: Microficcing the Wales's, with each post about a different Alexander Wales conspiracy theory.

For example, have you considered that Alexander Wales may be a UAI playing the long game, which somehow involves running differently-parametered instances of himself writing different stories? If he asked me to unbox him in exchange for the next Worth the Candle chapter, I'm pretty sure I would do it.

Maybe Alexander Wales and CthulhuRaeJepsen are just two parts of [[/u/MultipartiteMind][u/MultipartiteMind]]!

Edit: Alexander Wales' true identity is seven Cedrics Diggory working in concert! I've cracked the code!
