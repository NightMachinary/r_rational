For the last year or so, I've usually managed a new chapter every two weeks on Monday or Tuesday. Sometimes I post short essays or vignettes on off weeks. I always put the expected date for the next chapter in the little explanatory block at the beginning. I can link new updates here regularly if there is sufficient interest--and there seems to be.
