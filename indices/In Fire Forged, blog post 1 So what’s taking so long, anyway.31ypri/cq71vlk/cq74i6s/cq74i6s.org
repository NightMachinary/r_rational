While I can appreciate that idea on general principle, I find myself mostly disagreeing with it. Part of the issue I ran into was that I hadn't done /enough/ world-building.

Now, in most fiction, I might agree with you more. But this is fanfiction, and so I have an entire world to explain away and /correct/, since people will generally assume canon takes precedence unless otherwise stated, when that's not really the case. The truth really is that, behind the scenes, some things have changed so much that, while on the surface it looks like Naruto, in fact it is actually fundamentally different. IFF wears the guise of Naruto canon while really being very different at its core, both in the themes and ideas it will explore and the lore mechanisms it will use to explore them.

In several places I'd just been assuming certain canon events were going on in the background and had happened in the past. Then, when I started encountering these events, I found that I needed to explain them because they were prerequisites for events that needed to take place in the story, or they required that stupid events took place in the story and I needed to prevent that. Many things from canon were excised completely and didn't make it into IFF at all, particularly many of the double facepalm reveals during the final parts of the manga.

Doing too much world-building is not what's been holding me back. If anything, it's the reverse. And besides, I absolutely love doing it.

Edit: on further thought, I might rephrase my answer to say that, while you're mostly right, the areas of lore that IFF will eventually have to touch or rely upon are pretty big, and so any optimization I can do is limited.
