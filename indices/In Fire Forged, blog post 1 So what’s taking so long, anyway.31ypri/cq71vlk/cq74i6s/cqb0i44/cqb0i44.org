I strongly recommend that you space the exposition out as much as you can, and bring it up only when relevant. If I recall correctly (it's been a while) you do this pretty well in your fanfic, but there's been so many rational fics where I had to stop reading because some character would start blabbing about irrelevant aspects of their society and they /just wouldn't stop/.

I'm also going to repeat the age old advice of "don't be afraid to write badly". If you first write a crummy first draft full of plot holes, you then often get good ideas in the process for how to fix them. Or it turns out to be much less of a problem than you think. Works for me at least.
