It is my plan to never, ever be in need of /such/ a degree of heavy-duty exposition in the story itself. All of my heavy exposition is relegated to either the beginning and end info blurbs (which people seem to like), or the lore posts (the chakra one is coming along nicely - I have now figured out exactly what will go into it and how, all that remains is writing the prose, which is the easy bit).

So, in essence, the exposition remains accessible but doesn't get in the way of the story.
