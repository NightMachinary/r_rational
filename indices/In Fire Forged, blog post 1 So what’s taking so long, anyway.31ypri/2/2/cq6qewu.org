That's good to hear. I intended it to be readable by somebody who hasn't read Naruto before, and I'm glad that it worked for you. I've received generally mixed reactions on this topic.

And thank you, by the way, for reminding me to add Worm to the list of inspiration links, as Worm is indeed the reason I am writing IFF in 1st person. Several people have compared Sakura to Taylor, or said that they felt similar, so I suppose there's something to it.
