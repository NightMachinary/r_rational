I just wanted to say that while I had heard of it for many years, I had no experience in the world of Naruto until I read IFF's 8 chapters back last year during Labor day weekend. I was in the Keys with a bunch of women and spent the time outside by the pool with my Kindle reading. I don't think I'll ever watch Naruto because it's a billion episodes but your story is definitely something I want to continue because just those 8 chapters built up a lot of possibility and were executed very well. Your writing channels Wildbow's Skitter with the 1st person female lead and also EY's Professor Quirrel with Kakashi, which are obviously two very interesting characters. Keep it up and looking forward to the new stories!
