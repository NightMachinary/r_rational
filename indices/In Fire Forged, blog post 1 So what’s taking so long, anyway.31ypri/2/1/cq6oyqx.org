The main reason for so many filler episodes was because the animation keep running ahead of the manga and not having material to make more episodes. Since they obviously didn't want to just stop production to wait for the manga, they made filler episodes which lead to a bit of dissonance as there should have been /some/ character growth even as everyone kept acting in the same way episode after episode.
