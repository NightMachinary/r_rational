I'd recommend trying the manga. You can read/skim it at your own pace. The anime has a lot of filler episodes that make even less sense than the canon events. At least the first few hundred chapters are quite fun. The last third (or half) is pretty disappointing, so stop when you notice that you're rolling your eyes too much.

You can find it in some libraries and many book shops. Also on the Internet if you know where to look.
