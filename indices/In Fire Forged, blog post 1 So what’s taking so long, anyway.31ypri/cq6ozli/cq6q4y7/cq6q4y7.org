Thank you for updating the entry! I did consider posting the story on the blog, briefly, but on further thought I think that dedicated reading sites such as fanfiction.net and AO3 provide an overall better reading experience than I could on my blog.

One of my biggest gripes with blog-based stories like Worm, Pact and now, Twig, is that the reader can't control the story's formatting properly and there are no legitimate non-guilt-inducing e-book files around. On ff.net, for example, I can change to a lovely dark background and half width, which is how I personally prefer to read.

That being said, given the software and workflow I write with, it shouldn't be difficult to provide formats like .pdf, .epub and .mobi on the blog. I don't want to do this before I'm done with the impending revision of the story, though, as I wouldn't want to circulate a bad out-of-date version.

There is one major change that I need to implement in what's been written so far, and that's simply an absolute necessity to remove a total idiot ball that's already made its way into the story. [[#s][spoilers IFF chapter 7]]
