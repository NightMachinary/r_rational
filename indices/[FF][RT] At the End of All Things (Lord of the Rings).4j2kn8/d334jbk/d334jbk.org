  It's amazing how much of a difference it makes when all of a story's characters, in passing, have the ability to access elementary rationality skills. It makes them so much more real to me; they can reflect on what they're doing, not just be tools of the plot. This story took a while to get up to speed and quality, but now I'm at the end and I'm like AAAAAHHHH I NEED MORE HOW DO I GET THE NEXT CHAPTER.

  Rough summary of 'hook': Our Earth is the future of Middle-Earth, and then a Silmaril is found during a fracking operation.
