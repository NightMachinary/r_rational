There was this book, /Kung Fu High School/ by Ryan Gattis, which by rights always seemed like it should be forgettable, but stuck with me for a long time. The flash step is the single "supernatural" thing in the book, and (like a lot of things in the book) it's played for horror. I can quote some of it here (mostly because it's out of print, and unless you buy one of the used copies on Amazon it's unlikely that anyone here will ever read it):

  When he quit just before his sixteenth birthday, his record was 2,412-0-0. He was a ghost. Never been injured. Never even been thrown. And for his last full year on the mat in Hong Kong, never even been hit. Get your head around that. Not a single opponent scored a hit on him. All the scorecards are kept in the main tournament hall in HK. You can go look if you want. But that's not really necessary, because if you saw Jimmy's final fight to defend his world championship in the open category (any style was acceptable), you would've seen everything you'd ever need to see. That was the day he fought The Bulgarian.

  Nobody I know knows The Bulgarian's real name and if they did they couldn't pronounce it, so everyone, even the TV announcers, just called him The Bulgarian. Supposedly he was the biggest-ever threat to Jimmy's domination in the sport. Cue and I didn't believe that for a second. We heard the same thing every year. It was all just hype. We knew Jimmy couldn't be defeated. It didn't matter that The Bulgarian had been stolen from his gypsy parents and taken off to Mongolia when he was a kid and raised in the mountains like some wild, latter-day Genghis Khan warrior.

  The World Championships were being held in London that year and there was this huge procession in front of Buckingham Palace and then down in front of Big Ben, I remember watching that. The best part though was standing room only in the giant event hall. There must have been twenty thousand people in there. Serious. The atmosphere was ridiculous. People were even singing: "Hey throw that fellah / We said a-hey throw that fellah / Jimm-y throw that fellah / hey throw that fellah," to the tune of "Guantanamera." But Jimmy didn't throw that fellah. He looked disinterested for much of the match, and it was amazing to watch him avoid full-strength spinning kicks by centimeters, and hammer-throw punches by millimeters. The timed first and second rounds ended with no points scored and the third and final round was much the same until the last two seconds.

  To this day, every person who saw that fight swears Jimmy somehow teleported himself behind the Bulgarian to score the hit that won it. They showed it on television for months on super-slow-motion replay but watching it was like watching a jumpy old movie that was missing frames somewhere. See, Jimmy was in front of The Bulgarian, not two inches from him, with his heels on the out-of-bounds line, as the big challenger opened his arms wide and was bringing them down on Jimmy. There was no way he could escape. There was really no room, nowhere to go. I remember grabbing Cue's leg in the shady bar we had snuck into to watch the match on pay-per-view at one in the afternoon. I knew he had had it. Cue knew it was over. Everyone watching knew it was over.

  The announcers were even starting the sentence, "A remarkable run has finally en---," when Jimmy disappeared/reappeared behind The Bulgarian, extended his right leg, and executed a perfect kick to the back of his opponent's weight-bearing knee and sent him sprawling forward onto the out-of-bounds part of the mat. I'd love to tell you that I jumped and screamed and shouted and was so happy that Jimmy won, but I didn't. My mouth was just as open as Cue's and we were trying to figure out how he did it. It was shocking for real.

  The cameras timed it afterward. Jimmy literally disappeared for a thousandth of a second before reappearing and winning the match. This didn't go over too well. Back in China, a leading priest denounced Jimmy as a dark spirit and people really got scared.

I've always liked the image of a discontinuity; it's not teleportation, not exactly, it's like the world changed its form in a fraction of a second to arrange itself in a different way.
