The difference is largely in presentation (which I think counts for a lot, though you might disagree).

If you want advice, I think the path of least resistance and most economical storytelling is just using teleportation. Trying to justify it in some other way is going to raise more questions, and answering all those questions is going to be somewhat ugly. Teleportation, for all that it's complicated in a physics sense, is easy for people to understand. If the power is going to look like extremely short-range teleportation, and be used like extremely short-range teleportation, then there's not much sense in pretending otherwise.
