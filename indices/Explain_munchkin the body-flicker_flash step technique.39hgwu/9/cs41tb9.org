There was a comic book called Steam Wars, where being a riff on Star Wars in a Steampunk world, their version of the force worked on some sort of uncertainty principle. A Quantum Dragoon could bend reality and teleport by decoupling cause and effect and maneuvering faster than causality will allow, among other things. It plays out as if reality has bad ping time or framerate, which is enough like a flash step that I suppose it's worth looking into. That or some sort of Speedforce analog exists in universe that allows for flash stepping, which works because Speedforce explains itself for nobody.
