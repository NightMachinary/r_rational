I figure it's like an Alcubierre drive. You move from point A to point B, but you don't actually gain the momentum or have the time dilation or anything. Also, since your perception isn't sped up, you have to plan the path beforehand, and it's entirely possible to accidentally run into someone's sword if you're not paying attention.

The problem is that an Alcubierre drive, or anything else where you mess with spacetime, doesn't work well if you're touching anything. You have your space-time where time flows to one side as well as the future, and the ground just goes to the future, so you need space in between where time flows to one side, but not to such a great extent.
