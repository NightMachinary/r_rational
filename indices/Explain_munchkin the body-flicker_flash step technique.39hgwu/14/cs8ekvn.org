Check out [[http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/82363551272/fall-of-doc-future-contents][The Fall of Doc Future]] (and the sequel, [[http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/111819789111/skybreakers-call-contents][Skybreaker's Call]]) for an involved look at how this might look. See the first [[http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/34152071413/flicker-phone-tag][non-prologue chapter]] and [[http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/63400349312/flicker-q-and-a][this bit]] for a good short version, though. Although Flicker's speed does give her increased thinking speed, and the physics of her "entropy dumping" and "inertial damping field" are [[http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/91712737751/behind-the-future-part-4-flicker][kept intentionally fuzzy]] the physical consequences of her powers and the way they interact with the world are kept within the bounds of physics as we know it:

  For her powers, I decided on a “black box” approach: The exact mechanics of how they worked internally could be vague, but the interface between her and the rest of the world needed to be well defined and consistent with physics. What she couldn't do would be as important as what she could.

Flicker can't teleport, but she can move arbitrarily fast. She has to reign that in quite a bit in order to avoid, for example, fusing hydrogen nuclei in the air via the friction heat caused by her passing. She also almost (accidentally) [[http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/58668661534/cover-concept-for-the-fall-of-doc-future-showing][broke the moon]] that [[http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/37251040413/doc-and-stella-guardianship][one time]].
