Oddly I think Code Geass had my favourite interpretation of the flash step. The character in question wasn't moving supernaturally fast, all the powers were mind based, he slowed the perception of everyone within a couple hundred foot radius down. To their eyes he seemed to be just disappearing and reappearing but from his perspective he had to run all the way over to wherever he wanted to go as normal and everyone else just kind of waited for him.
