Some time ago I actually thought a good model for super-speed that doesn't include super-strength. It included super-speeder not actually moving fast, but rapidly teleporting very short (~1mm or less) distances to get towards his destination. This way speedster never has more momentum that usual, thus not allowing heavy punches. It also doesn't allow to go through walls for obvious reasons. You can't throw fast projectiles with that. You can't even land a hits with that - "real momentum" for your punching hand wouldn't probably be aligned with punch direction. This also fixes sound barrier/friction heating. These teleportations would probably be subconscious - common user believing in "common sense" physics may not even notice anything besides speed boost.

Optimizing this includes learning to hit (for example, getting punching motion before activating super-speed, and then cease to microport so that your fist flies towards his head). Actually, if (common-sense momentum) after the technique is the same as before, it'll take a lot of time to just learn to use it not from standing position.
