  Unless, of course, the technique has a built-in speed-stopper aspect to it, but that gets a complexity penalty.

Yeah, that's how I imagined it. I don't think the added complexity is a real issue - this is a technique consciously created for a particular aim. If it was ridiculously simple and yet only used by very experienced ninja (jounin), that'd be strange.

That said, I agree the other suggestions are more elegant. I particularly like the one where it feels to the user like a bubble of stopped time. Just make it cost exponentially more the longer it lasts to prevent everyone using it as obvious cognitive enhancement, and there you go.
