Much of that makes sense, except for one thing: In Naruto, the way flash-step is used almost always ends with the character standing entirely still. That is entirely at odds with a sudden burst of speed! Unless, of course, the technique has a built-in speed-stopper aspect to it, but that gets a complexity penalty.
