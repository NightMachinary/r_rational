I remember reading a manga once that had an interesting interpretation of the flash step, and inspired by that, here is my shot:

Flash Stepping involves great acceleration, so the principal part of the technique is cushioning those forces with <magic>. Then; the user imbues one or both legs with <magic>, and can release said energy with a mighty kick-off to accelerate almost instantly to sub-sonic velocities.

It is recommended to use one leg for take-off and one for landing.

Advanced techniques include:

- <magic-ing> an arm for the landing and using both legs for movement to allow changing direction.
- Using <magic> to reduce air-resistance to allow super-sonic velocities.
- Using <magic> to reinforce take-off surface to reduce property damage.
- Applying misdirection <magic> to mask sounds, visual image, etc. to make the movement appear instantaneous for intimidation purposes.

This rather neatly expands Flash-Step into an array of techniques distinct from teleportation.

If Mind-Magic is available, it can be rendered even more impressive.

It would generally be used to /dodge/ or /disengage,/ not attack.
