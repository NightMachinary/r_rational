So a possible munchkinable mechanism that isn't a complete game-breaker, like timetravel, is that using enough ki/magic/aura/blahblah in a particular way lets you warp your body's physics/interactions/aura/blahblah. When you stop, you have to slow down to dewarp.

You and anything you're carrying through a flash step move faster. Nonliving solids become denser or stronger to you, so you can't phase through the walls nearby; gases become weaker, so that they don't drill holes in your body. Liquids act like solids or gases, depending on whether water-walking's possible. If you want people to be able to attack while flashstepping, living materials become stronger.

To the average person, like a shonen hero or a bronze age wuxia warrior, this looks and feels like they're just being fast. You can make the warping effect scale to how much blahblah is being used by a person so that Protagonistman can show how much more powerful he is than Lord Deathface or something.

Of course, you can't just warp your arm for a punch, because having different parts of your body follow different physics is a recipe for disaster. Maybe a high-level regenerator can, and they're going to be a boss-fight anyway, so it makes sense.

If you're rationalist and not rational, or if you have some sort of Negimaverse style sequel set in the future, this becomes a fun sort of magitech. You can have /ki-powered FTL/, which also explains why you need humans on board your ships and why ship captains need to be badasses. Maybe your mechs are built so that the warp effects them too, but you can't use the effect on nonhumanoid objects, which lets you have /robot swordfights in space/.
