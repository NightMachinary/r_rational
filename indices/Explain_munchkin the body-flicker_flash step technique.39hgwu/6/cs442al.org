The way I liked to think about it for Naruto is some sort of a pre-calculated burst of speed to reach a particular position. There would be no awareness while flash-stepping, and the g-forces, even cushioned by magic/chakra, would require great endurance - which sounds fine to me in terms of balance/difficulty of the technique.

In practice, this would mean that you can only really flash-step in your line of sight and you need to stop for some duration to re-orient yourself before flash-stepping again. You need to calculate/precisely learn the amount of chakra necessary to move to your target, and you could probably only move in a straight line.

Also, you would need to be /extremely/ careful not to, say, flash-step through a ninja wire and get decapitated.

Let's say you can't throw a kunai while hand because you do not have the reaction speed to release it from your hand. Also, when hitting a solid object you're not sheathing in that g-force-dampening magic miracle chakra, the technique collapses and backfires somehow. The backfire can't be so dangerous that nobody uses it, but there has to be /some/ way it can't just be used as a certain-kill suicide technique.
