I'd model it as a time stop that you can't think in: you'd have to queue the entire sequence ahead of time. For example:

- The person thinks "I will stop time, take three steps forward, then resume time." They then stop time, move, and resume, taking all of the actions properly.
- The person thinks "I will stop time, turn slightly left, go five steps, turn right, go another two steps, and then turn right again, and resume time." They then stop time, take three steps, trip and fall, and flail their legs against the ground for the remaining actions. They resume time lying face down on the ground.

There would probably need to be some limitations, like "the time stops must be exactly 30 subjective seconds" to prevent popping out in mid attack, and "you still have sub-conscious balance" so that people don't fall over all the time.
