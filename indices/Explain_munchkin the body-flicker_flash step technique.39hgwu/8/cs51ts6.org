Handwavy not-actually-physics answer: The technique temporarily suppresses the strong nuclear force, reducing the user's proton mass to nearly zero, but momentum is conserved, so velocity increases dramatically to compensate. When the suppression ends, the user's mass returns to normal and velocity drops back down.

This way you don't have to worry about megaton punches from super speed mode etc, although you have to do some handwaving about why the user's constituent atoms don't just immediately disintegrate without the strong nuclear force holding them together. Maybe you also suppress the electromagnetic force so that nuclei can just be held together by gravity. I think we can leave the weak force alone.

Anyway, so now you're 99% less massive and moving at extremely high speed. Presumably maintaining the suppression gets exponentially more difficult the longer the period of time you need to maintain it for, which is why you can't travel very far with it (but only linearly more difficult the more mass you have, for some reason, because otherwise kids would flash-step around adults like it was, no pun intended, child's play). And the suppression field has to be centered on you, I guess, so you can't use it on other people unless you're carrying them. And you something something chakra to part the air in front of you so it that friction against it doesn't set you on fire.

So that's how I'd model it. As for munchkinning it, that depends whether we have knowledge in-universe that this is the mechanism of action, or whether it's just a fairly opaque "high speed movement jutsu". If we know that we're fiddling with the strength of coupling constants, first we shit our pants in fear, and then we very carefully experiment with doing it to inanimate objects to find the limits of the ability. Also to figure out where the mass is going. Mass is clearly conserved by normal interactions, but normal interactions don't change the coupling constants, so have we found a way around conservation of mass? Or is the suppressed mass going somewhere else, corresponding to a coupling-constant increase in another area? If we don't know the mechanism of action, but we do know the exponential-difficulty-increase thing, then I suppose I look for a way to continuously turn it on and off for the shortest possible time interval, to maximize average velocity.
