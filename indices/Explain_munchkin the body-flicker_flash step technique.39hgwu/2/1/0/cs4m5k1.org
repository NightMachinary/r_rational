I actually don't think this is the best reply. It's just got a lot of text, and people like text.

Teleportation is a transversal; it's moving from one place to another without crossing the intervening space. The problem with the flash step as a concept (when people are being insistent that this isn't /actually/ teleportation) is that it implies an enormous amount of speed and strength that the writer usually doesn't want the protagonist to have for other things, like punching people. After all, if you can flash step behind someone, then you can almost certainly just punch them in the face with that same speed. (This applies to a lot of answers in this thread, which leave me scratching my head and wondering about why it's not just a ridiculous offensive power.)

Rearranging the universe is more like an optical illusion than teleportation. You know [[http://i.imgur.com/6ZkgfUO.gif][that classic image]] that's sometimes an old woman and sometimes a young girl? It's more similar to that shift in perspective than just changing someone's position in the world, even if the /result/ of one person moving some distance is the same.
