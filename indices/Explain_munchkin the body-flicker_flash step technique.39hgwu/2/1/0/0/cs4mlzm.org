The problem you describe is precisely why I posed the question: How can I make this ability as it is described work in a rationalist story, without a rationalist character immediately breaking it in the most obvious way possible?

What you describe functions, for all intents and purposes, exactly like teleportation. There's no requirement on having to move through the space in between, and the camera actually shows the person vanishing. In other words there's no testable difference between what you describe and teleportation, which means that for story purposes it would work exactly the same, unless I'm being dense and I am misunderstanding you.
