That's a very good thought.

It might be pretty tricky to control your course at the speeds involved, especially if you have to send negative energy as a packet, rather than near-continuously.

If you start out standing still, flashstep forward, lose energy to friction while flashstepping, then receive negative momentum exceeding your post-drag velocity, would you end up moving backward? That doesn't sound right, it'd be a net gain in energy. So, energy lost to friction probably has to be made up for by expressing the received negative energy in some form other than cancelling your momentum - loss of heat, maybe.

(I am not a physicist, so that was probably all wrong. Please correct me.)

Speaking of heat, might this imply that one could express the initial energy surplus in a form other than kinetic energy? Would that have any interesting results?
