Well, if you are building a magic world, you can have rules for magic. Do you want to do something that would require X energy of done in Y time? Fine, you pay for that in Z magic energy.

How do you build up such energy reserves in something like the Narutoverse? Training. Lots and LOTS of training.

You charge your chakra, your source of magic, by working hard. When you throw a thousand practice punches, a thousand small bits of energy are fed to your chakra.

It takes special training to learn to feed one's chakra energy through activities, and it can be done in several different ways, different fighting styles. Chakra retains some part of the flavor of how it was generated.

Using punching chakra to run fast might be possible, but it would be a little wasteful. This would help explain chakra points.

Someone or something that can actually see chakra, might be able to tell what sort of training someone had, just by looking at the energy levels of various chakra points on their opponent.

It could even be possible to use your chakra to communicate with, bribe, or even control magical beings, depending on your training.

If people can control or bribe magical beings with chakra, the reverse might also be possible for malevolent magical beings to take advantage of a foolish or desperate person. A person with unexplainably high chakra levels might be in thrall to a magical being.

People might be able to simply give chakra to other people as well, without payment. This might manifest as healing.
