I'd probably do straight teleportation, but have the "cost" for the technique scale up exponentially as the distance increases. Using Naruto-specific terms, it would be like "all genin can cross this room, some more than others. Most chunin can cross this room and get through the wall to the other one. Few jonin can cross the 2nd room as well. And kage can just barely get to a 3rd room. And fuck jinchuuriki, those guys are crazy."

And the technique needs to come with some setup, and follow through time. Doesn't have to be long, maybe half a second to a full second. I'm just thinking it would be obnoxious to have that exponential rule, only for some smart ass to get the idea to just chain together a bunch of little hops and become a God on the battle field. So maybe you activate it, move, and when you land, there's a brief little period where you're disoriented, as your body takes a second to get used to being put back together. This period can get shorter and shorter (but never fully disappear) with training as you get used to it.

Travel time wise, I say you could have it be near-instant, with the understanding that the user's body is converted into some sort of super light substance when moved. Maybe the momentum of the original body is transferred? Idk.

I think having the flash step technique as depicted in a lot of shonen anime is really difficult in a rationalist setting. It would mean all fights would be decided in the first few seconds, unless the combatants are stupidly, evenly matched, or there's some reason they can't use the technique.

But....for the sake of being helpful. Here's an idea. For the flash step technique, have it function such that the person is only able to move so fast because they use their energy (ki, chakra, whatever) to "shunt" their mass into another dimension. The better/more powerful you are, the more of your mass you shunt, the faster you move. Obviously, it's very risky to learn, consumes a good deal of energy and if you are disrupted mid-motion, things would be...unpleasant to say the least. And due to the mass being shunted, you can't simply whack someone at super speeds. I mean, you CAN, but make it such that the speed you could gain isn't worth the damage suffered by your hyper fast waif thin constitution mid-shunshin.

Well, that's all I got. Can only hope anything from this wall of text is helpful. Good luck :D

EDIT: Oh, and for my flash step idea, due to how it works, you can only get those super speeds if you start the motion *before* your mass is shunted, as you have little to no mass with which to influence your momentum when traveling. Experienced users, of course, know that they should keep enough mass on hand (and accept the speed loss) to be able to change direction enough that they have the time to reel their mass back in, assuming something in the situation changes. And of course, there's a price for going too fast. Little mass + less time to react? Uh oh....
