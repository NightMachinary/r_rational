Oh, I thought one above the fic itself would have sufficed. Reposting it here, I suppose:

  After the flying fortress of Akua Sahelian was brought down, Catherine gets hit with a mindwhammy that turns her introspectiveness up to 11, and realises just how much she has to change about herself. But will the time be on her side? Three short months remain until the 11th crusade hits Callow, and Heavens are bringing their best game this time.

A/N this fic has a (relatively) short chapter detailing events of the previous books at the start, to help people who didn't read the original fic somewhat catch up.
