Can I give Worth the Candle an additional recommendation? It's seriously the absolute best thing that has been posted here this year, IMHO. So many original ideas, and the author gets /exactly/ what I want out of a story.

Oh yeah, and as always, lemme recommend [[https://www.literotica.com/s/dream-drive-ch-01][Dream Drive]], an excellent transhumanist litRPG people ignore for having all of 3 or 4 sex scenes in like 200k words and being hosted on literotica as a result.
