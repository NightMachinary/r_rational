Totally agree about [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][Worth the Candle]]. Amazing story so far.

On the other hand, I read about 85% of [[https://www.literotica.com/s/dream-drive-ch-01][Dream Drive]] and can't really recommend it. My main issues with Dream Drive are:

- It features Christian religion, world-view, and mythology too strongly for my liking.
- The story runs on fate and co-incidences are strongly in the service of having a (relatively predictable) plot
- Characters take some quite dumb courses of action in interest of the plot and fail to jump to fairly obvious conclusions (and conversely, unobvious conclusions are sometimes drawn from insufficient evidence)
- Some difficulty suspending disbelief regarding the way the author portraits sci-fi tech and things like 'hacking'. There's also some inconsistency in the way the magic works.
- It feels like the author had some general idea of what to write, but meandered into side-characters and side plots in the middle chapters, failing to fully maintain pacing and realize the initial ideas (or the classical litRPG trope).

That said, I did stick with it almost to the end. It's easy to read and the world building / magic has a few interesting ideas (although it's leaning heavily on familiar cultures and tropes).
