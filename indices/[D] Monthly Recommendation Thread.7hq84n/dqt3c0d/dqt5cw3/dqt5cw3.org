I've got significant overlap.

I can recommend:

- Everything by Alexander Wales that you haven't read yet, especially his [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/4976703/alexanderwales][fan fiction]], but also his [[http://alexanderwales.com][independent works]]
- [[http://alicorn.elcenia.com/stories/stories.shtml][Everything by Alicorn]]
- [[https://wanderinginn.wordpress.com][The Wandering Inn]] if you haven't tried it before.
- [[http://royalroadl.com/fiction/8894/everybody-loves-large-chests#toc][Everybody Loves Large Chests]], light-hearted but fun. [NSFW]
- [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-erogamer-original.5465/][The Erogamer]] [NSFW]

These are in the vague corner of large realistic world building with munchkin-ey protagonists and/or interesting exploration of how a world would work.
