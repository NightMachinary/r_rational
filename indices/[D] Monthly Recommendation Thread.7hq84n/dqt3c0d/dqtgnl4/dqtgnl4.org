Overlap indeed. I'll recommend some fanfiction:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9515185/1/Retry][Retry]] is very short and good inversely proportionally to its length.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7406866/1/To-the-Stars][To the Stars]] as mentioned in the Related Communities in the sidebar.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1295005/chapters/2686486][Off the Line]]. Ah, such glorious chaos.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6864965/1/Harry-s-Game][Harry's Game]] is metafanfiction for HPMoR all about exploiting the rules of Quidditch.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4627044/1/Veritas-Oracle][Veritas Oracle]] about the power and danger of Truth Serum.
