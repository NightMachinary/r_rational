Fair amount of overlap with my tastes too. If fan fiction is what you want, I'd recommend some of the RWBY stuff from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6272865/Coeur-Al-Aran][Coeur Al'Aran]], especially Forged Destiny (the world has typical RPG archetypes and stats) or Professor Arc (Jaune fakes his way into being a professor at Beacon). You could also look up the well-known RWBY/The Gamer crossover, [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/rwby-the-gamer-the-games-we-play-disk-five.341621/][The Games We Play]], but it tends to drag after a while. Finally, I really enjoyed [[http://forums.nrvnqsr.com/showthread.php/1870-Maybe-I-m-a-Lion-%28KnK-Prototype-Crossover%29][Maybe I'm a Lion]], a Kara No Kyoukai/Prototype crossover. I wasn't really familiar with either of those going into it and still enjoyed it immensely. Sadly it looks like it was discontinued a few years ago, right before what promised to be a really good action-packed part.

If you're looking for stuff besides fan fiction, I'm a bit surprised [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/][A Practical Guide to Evil]] isn't on your list. It's a really good one about a world where Good and Evil are actual god-infused concepts and certain people earn archetypal Names imbued with power over other mortals. It's frequently talked about on this sub and has two updates a week (may bump up to three if it gets enough funding).

I also really enjoy [[https://tiraas.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][The Gods Are Bastards]], but it seems to get a mixed reception here. It's also on its 13th book, so... yeah, it'll keep you busy. It's hard to capture the full scope of the story, but it's more-or-less a high fantasy western. It has a frankly ludicrous number of characters but primarily focuses on two groups: a freshman class at a university run by an elven archmage, and a number of individuals involved in plots and politics surrounding a bishop who represents the cult of the god of thieves.
