[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/an-offer-she-couldnt-refuse-exalted.40098/][An Offer She Couldn't Refuse]] has been pretty good so far. It's an Exalted story about a Creation native receiving an infernal exaltation and having to live with the consequences.

It's not rationalist, but is rational. Character motivations are consistent with their roles/cultural contexts. Events have that feeling of "plausibility", where it seems like consequences logically proceed from the situations that lead up to them.
