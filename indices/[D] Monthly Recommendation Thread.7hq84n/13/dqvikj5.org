Not something I wholeheartedly recommend, but a story that still tickled quite a few of my preferences was Robert J. Sawyer's Quintaglio trilogy. While the books have connecting themes and characters, they /can/ be read on their own.

Basic premise: Copernican revolution in world with sentient dinosaurs (relatives of velociraptors, I think).

There's more to it, of course, and the world building is well done in my opinion, with a lot of though put into the society how a predatory dinosaur species could develop culture and how this would express itself.
