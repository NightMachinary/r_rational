I have read the Dire series, and agree with the commendation. It has elements that perhaps don't fully conform with rational(oat) thought, but overall pretty good. Just read through Threadbare based on this rec. A very enjoyable read, taking a comedic approach to a fairly standard world-theme.

Definitely agree with the recommendation.
