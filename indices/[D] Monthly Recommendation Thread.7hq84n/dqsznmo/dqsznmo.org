[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/threadbare-original-litrpg.43430/][Threadbare]] is a story in progress on Sufficient Velocity.

The protagonist is a recently animated teddy bear, the setting is an original RPG-mechanics deathworld and the story is being written by the author of the [[https://www.amazon.com/Dire-Saga-Season-One-ebook/dp/B01N53O0W7/ref=sr_1_7?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1512489685&sr=1-7][Dire Saga]] and [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dire-worm-worm-au-oc.4351/][Dire Worm]].

It is not rationalist, though I am fairly certain that it qualifies as rational per the side-bar. It has frequent moments of tension, but the focus is on humor. It is well written and up to this point avoids most, maybe even all, of the clich√©s that make most LitRPGs such unreadable messes.

All in all I strongly recommend this for all lovers of light entertainment with serious undertones, especially since it updates every 1-2 days.
