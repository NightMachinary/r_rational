[[https://www.amazon.com/Lady-Awakened-Blackshear-Family-Book-ebook/dp/B0053CTN1W][A Lady Awakened]] is a romance novel with refreshingly practical characters.

The plot starts when Martha Russell is widowed. Her husband's estate will pass to his male next-of-kin, in this case, and abusive brother.

To protect the people on her estate, she hatches a plan. If she's able to conceive in the next month, English law will recognize the kid as her dead husband's heir. So, she makes a contract with an irresponsible and disliked neighbor.

The book was interesting in how it inverted the normal tempo of a romance novel. There's no "will they or won't they." They do. It's not especially good for either of them. But he has a contract.

So, instead of that back-and-forth, the characters end up bonding over debates about farming policy and the economics of running an English country estate. I think the book will be interesting for people who want Level 1 intelligent characters in an unusual genre.
