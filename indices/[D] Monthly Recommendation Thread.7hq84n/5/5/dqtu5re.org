I'd suggest [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11228999/1/Fargo][Fargo]] as another story you'd enjoy. It is a complete Madoka Magica fanfiction. I first encountered it in [[/r/rational][r/rational]] about [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4fckpa/rtmadoka_magica_fargo_is_now_complete/?st=jaubcs9w&sh=709be518][a year ago]]. (Better summary there.)
