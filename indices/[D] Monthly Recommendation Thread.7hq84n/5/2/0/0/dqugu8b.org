You can watch enough to understand most available fanworks in a single day. The early seasons are /really/ short. I think The Games We Play and Professor Arc are worth the watch of the first two, at least.

That said, RWBY really isn't good, it's carried entirely on fight choreography and recognizable character archetypes, and the first started getting increasingly cheaper after the original creator died.
