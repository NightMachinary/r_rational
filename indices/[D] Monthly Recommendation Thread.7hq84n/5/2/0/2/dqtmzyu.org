The animation and story have struggled since the original creator passed away. Definitely has its issues (annoyingly whiny characters, persistent willful arrogance and irrational behavior), but it's better than most anime's I've seen. (Though RWBY technically isn't anime.)

Not that that necessarily means much. I usually don't like anime.
