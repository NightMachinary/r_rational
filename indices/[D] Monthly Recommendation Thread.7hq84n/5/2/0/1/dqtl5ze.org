I've enjoyed it; it feels a bit rough (especially animation-wise) in the early seasons, and there's a fair amount of episodes where the focus is on the fights and not any story movement. But as the series goes on both the story and the animation get better. The world-building is neat too. It's not the most amazing series ever, but it's worth a watch if you want something to binge-watch for a few nights.

If you're gonna read the RWBY fan fiction it helps to have some context for who the characters are. It's not strictly needed, but (for example) I read The Games We Play before I had watched the series, and it kinda-sorta spoiled some of the characters who show up in later seasons. It's also neat to have a baseline for what the story /actually/ is and then seeing how authors change it up in fanfics.
