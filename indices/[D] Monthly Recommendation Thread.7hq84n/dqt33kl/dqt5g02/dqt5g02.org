[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/43723-the-steerswoman][Steerswoman Series]] centers around the protagonist's quest to solve the Ontological Mystery of her world. I must warn it's nowhere near as awesome as /Pokemon: TOfS/ or /Mother of Learning/. It's strong with dramatic irony, i.e. the readers will see the shape of the answers long before the protagonist, and also the series seems to have died after book 4, long before conclusion, but as I said, by the end you'll be able to guess what's going on in general terms, so it's not like it leaves you hanging /too/ bad.
