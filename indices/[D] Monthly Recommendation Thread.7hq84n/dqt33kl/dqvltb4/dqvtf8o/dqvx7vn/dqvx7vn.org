It's good, not great, but that's kind of how the original TAZ started out too. The main characters were fun, though I found the world and NPCs around them to be pretty dull.

I might've liked it more if they did a more traditional superhero story arc with the same heroes, but the McElroy's improv remains as entertaining as ever so I still had a good time.

If they decided to revisit this campaign, I would definitely listen to it and continue to enjoy myself. It wasn't perfect, but neither was the original TAZ and it became a great pulp fantasy story.
