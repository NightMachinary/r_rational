Interesting. I'm not terribly fond of settings with "mythical creatures from every culture," because they tend to not fall apart when you look at them too hard, but your description is intriguing and it appears, from the name and the website's logo, that there's going to be some Mesoamerican stuff going on, so I'm going to give it a shot (eventually...since I have a lot of stuff to do...)
