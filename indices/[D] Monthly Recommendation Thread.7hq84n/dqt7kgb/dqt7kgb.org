"Malinalli is an ancient being adrift in a world that has forgotten her -- our own world, in the form of Providence, Rhode Island, 2014. Whiling away the days *until the inevitable time when the veil of secrecy surrounding the supernatural is torn apart and mythical creatures from every culture are revealed to humanity*, Mali is against her will thrust into an investigation that could very well make that new reality come sooner than anyone wishes. Thankfully, she is one of the few people with the knowledge necessary to hunt down a very special killer."

Emphasis mine.

As much as urban fantasy isn't what I'd usually consume, I'd highly reccomend this work. It's not rational per se, but characters is very much driven by internal motivations rather than plot demands, and it has some incredibly interesting worldbuilding. Plus, the main character is very sympathetic, which helps.

Also, this story is actually complete, but just being posted chapter by chapter, so there's no worries about the author abandoning the project.
