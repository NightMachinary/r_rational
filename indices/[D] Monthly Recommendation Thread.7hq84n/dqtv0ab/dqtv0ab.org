I've been playing a lot of the new version of Dominions which came out about a week ago: [[http://store.steampowered.com/app/722060/Dominions_5__Warriors_of_the_Faith/][Dominions 5, Warriors of the Faith]]. The TL;DR: The Dwarf Fortress of Turn Based Strategy multiplayer videogames.

Illwinter, the makers, are a small indie team of two people making games as a hobby. The focus is very much on depth, variety, detail, and amount of content, while UI, graphics, and accessibility are not really at all the focus. The Dominions series is basically the same game at it's core, but every few years they do a huge rewrite on multiple elements of the game and break e.g. modding, map, and savegame compatibility and release it as a new game, but keeping most of the previous game's content; in between major releases, they support the game with additional content, balancing, and bug fixes for free. If you absolutely hated Dominions 3 or 4, this version will probably not change your view. If you've been enjoying the series, like me, then this version is a welcome addition that brings a lot of new elements, including a more real-time approach to modelling combat, a new system for recruiting commanders, a completely redone and vastly more interesting and versatile set of Bless effects to empower sacred units, and a somewhat improved UI.

The game's core conceit is that there is a fantasy world full of giants, lavamen, lizardmen, humans, oni, undead, demons, ogres, fishmen of several flavours, etc. Some time in the ancient past, the Pantokrator, chief god, became the most powerful god and ruled the world. Now the previous Pantokrator has disappeared and the most powerful beings in the world are duking it out to become the new chief god. You play as a Pretender God ruling a nation of believers, and try to conquer the world.

The game draws on many real life and fictional mythologies (Norse, Judaic, Christian, Egyptian, Chinese, Japanese, Hindu, Greek, Zoroastrian, Conan, Lovecraft, etc.) for the various nations to play as; there are three different ages to play in, each with 20-30 different nations to play as, some of which represent the same nation over time growing, decaying, changing, etc. In the game, you can cast spells that range in scale from summoning Water Elementals and casting fireballs, to summoning mad undead pretender gods from the pits of Tartarus, putting out the Sun, or sacrificing hundreds of slaves to attract the attention of horrors from beyond the stars (basically Earthdawn Horrors).

The game is turn based; every turn, you get to see the state of the world as far as you can tell from scouts, diplomacy, armies, etc, and then you order your mages, priests, commanders, spies, and armies where to go, what to do in fights, what spells to research and cast, and so forth. Then after all players have played this turn, all the combat and conflict and so forth is resolved simultaneously with the armies and generals and mages all obeying your orders for battle plans, and you can watch all the combat results from that happening, and see your armies crush your enemies (or be crushed, of course). The game keeps track of every soldier and models wounds, morale, etc. in granular detail. In multiplayer games, many games are played at a rate of 24 or 36 or 48 hours per turn - so that you can play out your turn whenever and then it will all be centrally processed. A typical turn might take a couple minutes for a player to play at the start of the game, but by the end it can be quite intense at an hour or more, depending on how much you want to micromanage. The game focuses heavily on combat and war, and abstracts away almost all base-building concerns.

The biggest problems with the game are the graphics (sprites that are easy to mod in more of but are otherwise not great) and that the enemy AI is not sophisticated so the multiplayer scene is the best place to play the game. The greatest strengths are the game's insane depth and replayability - I have spent over 700 hours on Steam on Dominions 4 without getting bored, and all signs point in that direction for Dominions 5 as well.

Dominions games often go on sale for up to ~80% off, after they've been out for some time, so if you're not willing to pay full price it may still be worth adding to a wishlist for the inevitable Steam sales.
