You might want to check out [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyNtlmLB73-7gtlBz00XOQQ/videos][Folding Ideas]] - his channel is a little less "curated" than Lindsay Ellis, but they're very much in the same vein, with his take being more technically focused on film (and games). They actually did a video together about their experiences with film school (liberal arts for her, vocational for him).

[[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyhnYIvIKK_--PiJXCMKxQQ][Joseph Anderson]] does longform videogame critique, with a lot of thought put into it, even when I disagree with it.

[[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBa659QWEk1AI4Tg--mrJ2A][Tom Scott]] covers a wide variety of subjects with a technical focus and good production values.

[[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuPgdqQKpq4T4zeqmTelnFg][Kaptain Kristain]] does polished, long-form videos that are mostly culturally focused.

I like [[https://www.youtube.com/user/hbomberguy][hbomberguy]] but don't really like his anti-reactionary or social justice videos, mostly because I think they're boring, but I think he's worth subbing to for his longform cultural videos like [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnPOQr1pxY8][Halcyon Dreams]] or [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbZMqS-fW-8][The Power of VHS]] or [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkoGBOs5ecM][Sherlock is Garbage and Here's Why]].
