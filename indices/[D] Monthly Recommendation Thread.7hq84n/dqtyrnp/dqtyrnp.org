Looking for recommendations for Youtube channels: no specific focus, so long as they are good at what they do instead of being "just another x channel". Some ones I like:

[[https://www.youtube.com/user/chezapoctube/featured][Lindsay Ellis]] does long form video essays about film criticism, focusing on narrative structure and how a story accomplishes its goals (or doesn't).

[[https://www.youtube.com/user/BrutalMovieReview/featured][Nyx Fears]] is like Lindsay Ellis, but he tends to focus on horror in particulary.

[[https://www.youtube.com/user/ContraPoints/featured][Contrapoints]] is a youtuber that talks about political issues that are at least adjacent to social justice. She's funny as hell and has buckets of style.

[[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjdQaSJCYS4o2eG93MvIwqg][Killian Experience]] makes funny parodies of video game strategy guides and retrospectives.

[[https://www.youtube.com/user/JennyENicholson/feed][Jenny Nicholson]] has very casually presented videos with razor sharp wit. Most of her stuff is about Star Wars and superheroes.

[[https://www.youtube.com/user/Kurzgesagt/featured][Kurzgesagt]]. Think CGP Grey with excellent animation.

[[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaDrN74SfdT6duuVl_8qxJ5eaaPHRX_ij][Monster Factory]] is a playlist on the Polygon channel where two brothers make deliberately ugly characters in video games with character creation. Sounds simple, but it's one of the few channels to actually make me laugh so hard I was crying.
