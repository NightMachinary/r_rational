[[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHsRtomD4twRf5WVHHk-cMw][Tierzoo]] gives vital insight into which animals classes are the most viable to play in the current meta of planet Earth.

[[https://www.youtube.com/user/Vihart][Vihart]] makes very nerdy math videos that play around with concepts and explain them with fun animations.

[[https://www.youtube.com/user/RedEyesTakeWarning][Overly Sarcastic Productions]] has fun and detailed videos about history, literature and tropes. My favourite are the videos about ancient legends, presented for a modern audience. You'll probably find yourself stopping quite often to have time to read all the little comments included in each picture.

[[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZFipeZtQM5CKUjx6grh54g][Isaac Arthur]] has videos on science and futurism, treated in a realistic and detailed way while still keeping things accessible. I've learned about fun things like Orbital Rings from there, which basically are superstructures that put space elevators to shame and are what you'd use in case you want to turn the surface of Jupiter into living space.

[[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClMJgjg2z_IrRm6J9KrhcuQ][Goodnight Moon]] creates vivid and detailed Fantasy ASMR. It's mesmerising to see a fantasy world that mostly just seems nice and cozy rather than the usual world-ending threats to people have to face in epic stories. If you like ASMR, this is the best I know of, and if you don't it's still worth watching because the worldbuilding is just so good.

[[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-to_wlckb-bFDtQfUZL3Kw][Door Monster]] makes excellent comedy, often about games. Their Civ series is fun and even remotely connected, they've recently made a few videos on DnD, and so much more that I can't mention them all because this post would be too long.

And finally, if you want something brilliant yet utterly bizarre to watch, I give you [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDr8HZvJ_30&list=PLvDhAfvgg98MuP1B_Ib3InFXjWH5-B0tX][Kotoura-san Abridged]]. It's... something else. The original anime is the heart-wrenching tale of a young girl who is very depressed partly because she can read minds but really because her parents were terrible. Before they left her all alone. And then she finds friends at school, but depression isn't just easily overcome, and overshadows those new friendships. The abridged series is also all of that but somehow manages to be hilarious at the same time.
