I've listened to untold hours of RPPR and will forever be thankful for it leading me to so many things I loved, Caleb Stokes in particular with his work on Red Markets and The Mixed Six, but I have a hard time recommending it over other rpg podcasts like One Shot or The Adventure Zone.

RPPR is definitely a good example of how to play and run a rpg, but I can't say that's as entertaining to listen to as when professional improv comedians play. Their games also lean /a bit/ more on the simulationist side, whereas I'm a hardcore narrativist. I've never liked listening to the combat scenes.

I got into the show as time filler and it definitely served it's purpose as that, going above and beyond more than a few times, but for me it's become a less reliable source of entertainment as of late. I'm just not enough of a junkie for actual plays anymore, I want an engrossing story and compelling characters.
