I'd like to second [[/u/trekie140][u/trekie140]] 's recommendation for The Mixed Six. They do a great job of fun, and generally lighthearted conversation and it's one of the few things I'm a patreon for. Some of the guys from that also do RPPR which is my favorite actual play tabletop RPG podcast although the sound quality can be really really hit or miss. I'd recommend starting with the recent "Somewhere Lane".

Some other podcasts/not quite podcasts I'd recommend:

- Wait wait don't tell me

- The Good Friends of Jackson Elias

- Writing Excuses

- Daly Planet Films

- Fresh Air

I've tried to get into the Adventure zone a few times but never make it very far. Can someone make a case for it? Early on, at least, they seem to break from story/roleplaying a bit too often.

Or anyone else have good tabletop RPG podcasts?
