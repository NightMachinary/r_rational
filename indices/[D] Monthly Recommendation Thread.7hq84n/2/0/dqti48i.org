*Podcast recommendations*

Excluding partisan political commentary podcasts and podcasts mentioned by other people already:

- 99% Invisible
- The AskHistorians Podcast - official podcast of [[/r/AskHistorians]]
- Backstory - they take things currently in the news and spend an hour talking about, um, the historical backstory.
- British History Podcast - what it says on the tin
- Dan Carlin's Hardcore History - 3-5 hour long episodes on history; sounds longer but is even longer when you realize that each episode is usually part of a miniseries (e.g. WWI took ~15 hours IIRC)
- Escape Pod, Podcastle, & Pseudopod - audio short stories (scifi, fantasy, horror respectively)
- FiveThirtyEight Poltiics - political commentary, but I wouldn't call them partisan
- Freakonomics - explores topics as varied as "How do we stop terrorism?" and "Why are there so many mattress outlets, when people don't buy mattresses very often?"
- Harry Potter and the Sacred Text - a chapter-a-week reading of the Harry Potter series that approaches it like a Bible Study, with the assumption that there are no mistakes and that you can find a valuable lesson in even randomly-selected passages. there are some genuinely interesting discussions, and I also appreciate the demonstration that you can find (or rather make) deep meaning in anything if you look hard enough.
- The History of English - history of the English language
- The History of Rome - what it says on the tin
- Foodstuff - the history of rice, butter, forks, etc.
- Intelligence Squared - one-hour debates on various topics. it's gotten me to shift my views a couple of times.
- Lawfare Podcast - a lot of current events / politics stuff like "Mass surveillance after Snowden", plus some historical context stuff like the Holodomor / Ukrainian famine and how that might be influencing how Putin is dealing with Ukraine
- The Partially Examined Life - philosophy podcast
- Philosophize This! - likewise
- Planet Money - stuff like the conflict between Walmart and Amazon, and how cows helped to stabilize some aspects of the economy of South Sudan (until they didn't, which is also part of the story)
- Radiolab - a lot of random things, from CRISPR to 4chan
- Safe for Democracy - history of U.S. foreign relations from WWII to the present day, brought to you by a crapload of coups
- Stuff You Missed in History Class - odds and ends from history
- TED Radio Hour - TED talks, on audio!
- TED Talks Daily - more TED talks, still on audio!
- Very Bad Wizards - more philosophy
- Waking Up with Sam Harris - philosophy and other odds and ends, kind of a New Atheist's Rationally Speaking, though that might not be a good description because you don't have to be a New Atheist to enjoy it (at least, I'm not)
- You Are Not So Smart - cognitive biases and suchlike
- War College - like Lawfare, but more military-focused
- What Trump Can Teach Us About Con Law - a little bit partisan, I guess, but the focus is on constitutional law, even if it's usually through the lens of "Here's how Trump is skirting dangerously close to, or over, the line today"
