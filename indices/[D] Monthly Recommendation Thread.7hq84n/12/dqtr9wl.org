The premise is that a bunch of the Ranma cast get exalted and transported into creation and then violence happens. It's an enjoyable action heavy fic that so far is rational, but not rationalist.

I think people should definitely give it a try if you've really liked Ranma fics before, or if you really want to see more good Exalted stories.
