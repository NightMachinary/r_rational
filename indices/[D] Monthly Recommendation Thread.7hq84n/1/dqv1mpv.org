It's hiatus ended recently so I want to give a shout out to [[http://thezombieknight.blogspot.com/search/label/ch1#order=ASC][The Zombie Knight Saga.]]

  A young man dies, and a grim reaper offers to revive him in exchange for servitude. Responsibilities include saving other people's lives and occasionally fighting unspeakable horrors. But this particular young man is cripplingly shy. No, seriously. He can barely even speak to people. It's really bad.

It checks all the boxes of rational fiction. Superpowers are based of things like the periodic table of elements and successful applications of powers require knowledge about chemistry, physics, biology etc. You can't just materialize a working trebuchet if you don't how one is made. Factions are more nuanced then they appear on the surface. Acknowledgement that problems aren't so simple that they can be solved by beating people up. I find the whole thing to be a lot of fun. It has short updates daily.
