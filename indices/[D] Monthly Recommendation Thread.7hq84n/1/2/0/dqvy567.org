I'll be the first to admit that it's not perfect. I was mainly doing it that way for my own benefit--not the readers'--as a means of staying regularly motivated to keep writing this insanely long story.

That being said, after four and a half years of writing this freaking thing, I certainly understand where you're coming from and that your opinion is a valid one. I can, however, also tell you that the story is now updating regularly by ~500 words every night at midnight EST. And I've got enough of a backlog going such that it will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.
