Rationally Speaking is really good. The host interviews scientists and philosophers about their work, and she does an unusually good job of asking intelligent, challenging questions while keeping it all accessible to non-experts.

If you have an interest in philosophy, I recommend the episode on [[http://rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/show/rs-181-william-macaskill-on-moral-uncertainty.html][moral uncertainty]].
