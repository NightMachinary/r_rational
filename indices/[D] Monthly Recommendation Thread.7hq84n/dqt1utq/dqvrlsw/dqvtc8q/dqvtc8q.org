I can make a strong case for the Adventure Zone. The first few episodes, the McElroys are certainly caught up in their own humor, but by the third arc (not counting interludes) they begin to really explore deeper themes of power/corruption. I wouldn't ever call it rational, except that Griffin is pretty good about letting plausible things happen and not giving anyone, even the villains, plot armor. Later parts of the series feature aspects that we would recognize from rational fiction, including competent protagonists, competent villains, multi verses, and time loops.

Might I recommend listening to MBMBAM first? You may enjoy the early, jokey episodes more if you are already inoculated with McElroy style humor.
