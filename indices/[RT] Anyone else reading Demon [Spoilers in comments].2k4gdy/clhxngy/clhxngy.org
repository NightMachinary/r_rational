Oh man! I love Shiga's comics, but hadn't visited his site this year. I highly recommend [[http://www.amazon.com/Meanwhile-Pick-Path-Story-Possibilities/dp/0810984237][Meanwhile]] (I had to buy a physical copy) and [[http://www.shigabooks.com/fleep.php][Fleep]] is also very good.

This Jimmy is long on rationality and short on ethics. Looking forward to seeing where this goes.
