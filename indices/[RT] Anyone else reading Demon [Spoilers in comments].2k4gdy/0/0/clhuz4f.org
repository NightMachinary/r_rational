I feel like Jimmy will figure it out right away. Hunter will be a little bit slower - it probably won't become obvious until Jimmy's current body dies and Heron shows no change. Jimmy will make his escape, and have to rescue his daughter from the body of Heron and the clutches of Hunter's organization.

I am curious whether he'll see his daughter's head there or whether there won't be any difference - it's not clear to me whether Heron and Jimmy have ever seen each other outside of pictures and video. They showed a courtroom, but it was impossible to tell whether Jimmy was there. Given that he was shown reading the paper ... probably not?
