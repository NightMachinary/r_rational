My thoughts on the most recent page:

I'm guessing Jimmy's daughter was a Demon too, and is now possessing Heron. It doesn't seem like Demons can possess each other or the daughter would have overwritten Jimmy when she died instead of jumping to Heron (I assume she would have been closer to Jimmy, although depending on the geometry it's possible not?).

So what's going to happen when Jimmy dies? Seems like he should jump to the next nearest person, while meanwhile Hunter's agents jump "Heron" (do we know the daughter's name? I feel like we should but I don't remember it and I haven't found it yet). How long before Jimmy and Hunter figure out what's going on?
