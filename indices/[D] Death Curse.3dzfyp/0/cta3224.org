Well, odds are good anyone of prominence who does anyone wrong whatsoever is dead. Add in psycopaths, and they don't even have to do anyone wrong, just be prominent. So that's going to eliminate most of the "World Leaders" of any stripe. Nobody WANTS to be king. If you're king, you're a target, and you won't last long. Same with any kind of celebrety. You don't WANT your name and face known, for fear of a crazy persons death curse.

What you've presented here is an unblockable method for anybody to kill anybody at the moment of their death. And you've given it to HUMANS. I can't even begin to imagine the kind of society that would come of that.
