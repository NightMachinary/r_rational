What happens if the criterion doesn't describe /any/ individual? Nothing, right?

Might be worth setting up elaborate misinformation programs if you're planning to do anything high-profile, like rule the world. (Oh, is /that/ why twins are effected together? To stop them swapping places? Because plastic surgery should work too, or a simple mask worn at all times.)

More generally, it's pretty important that no plan or social structure have any one "key" individual - no presidents, etc. - because they will die. Lots of comittees is the answer here. Sure, there will still be /some/ people who target "a member of the United States Senate", but the risk will be spread out and there's be no figurehead to focus people's dislike on.

Oh, and from a supervillainous perspective, it should be possible to set up a torture system that encourages people you've kidnapped to death-curse wwhoever you want. Fiddly, though, since they're by definition dead by the time the curse goes off, and you need to ensure they can't just target you or the torturer instead.
