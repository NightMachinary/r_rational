Plenty of people wouldn't be OK with killing someone with 100% probability.

I wonder how many people would be OK with killing someone with 0.1% probability? It's the equivalent of trying to assassinate your target blindfolded using a type of weapon you've never before touched.

The difference between "I want to die by sinking a knife into the president" and "I want to die by running in the general direction of the president while screaming and waving a blowgun".

You're gonna have to be /really/ lucky to kill the guy.
