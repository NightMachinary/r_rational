Well, it's probably not /that/ hard to go kill some celebrities if you really wanted to. Just go to papparazzo school and pack a "Wait, this isn't a camera!" on your trips. The fact that most aren't doing this shows that most probably wouldn't choose to press a button that kills a celebrity. (Unless it's just the inconvenience stopping them...)
