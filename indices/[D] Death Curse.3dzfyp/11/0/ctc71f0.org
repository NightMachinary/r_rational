You can't have governments as unpopular as this would make you. Because "The person responsible for this shit" is an unique identifier, and a large fraction of everyone dying natural deaths would use it. So, basically, this means you can't rule at all without being.. well, not universally loved, but at least overwhelmingly not-hated. And even then, you are pretty likely to die in office due to political cranks croaking. Should lead to a very "Summer King". political setup. People are chosen for office (somehow. Certainly not hereditary, because that would wipe out bloodlines darn fast) Do their best to rule well, get laid and feasted a lot, drop dead.
