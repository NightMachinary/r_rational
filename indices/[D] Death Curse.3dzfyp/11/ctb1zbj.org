Ugh.

I'm picturing a mix between Le Guin's short story "the One Who Walks Away from Omelas" and Collin's "Hunger Games." A thousand districts make up a dystopian country where weekly lotteries randomly select a citizen who is routinely sacrificed to eliminate enemies of the State through death curses. Hospices become places of mantras for hatred, in which bitter last words are used to thin out enemy groups using criteria like "kill those who are opposed to our way of life."

Of course, neighboring countries are using similar tactics. May the populace with the most unity persist.
