The threshold for genuinely wanting someone dead seems to be higher than that. I bet the vast majority of people who send "Die! Die! Die!" messages over the internet wouldn't actually shoot their target if given a clear shot and a clean getaway. Getting soldiers in battle to fire is pretty hard. I suspect the same would be true of death curses. Plus inclination to kill seems to drop with age, and most dying people are pretty old.

Still, starting a war would be suicidal.
