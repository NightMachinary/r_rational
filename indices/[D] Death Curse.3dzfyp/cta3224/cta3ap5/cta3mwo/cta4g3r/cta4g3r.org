I was just clarifying the post, because your wording made it sound like anybody could reliably kill /anybody/.

And you're listing optimal statistics - what would happen if death curses were distributed perfectly. But they wouldn't be, because that would imply an impossible degree of organization which a world where leaders are impossible. Sure, the head honchos would get knocked off frequently, but if 10 000 people wish a man dead with their dying breath, there are 10 or so potential targets that don't get killed.
