Is it the letter, or the intention of your targeting criteria?

Let's say take a straw-hermit example: some xennophobe lives in the middle of nowhere and wants to kill "that damn obama". Obama happens to die spontaneously by natural means, but the hermit doesn't know. If the hermit dies a year later, does his curse fizzle? Or does it target some other "damn obama"?

(Dear secret government agency: this is in no way a threat or predetermination or anything.)
