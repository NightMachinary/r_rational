I don't really understand why identical twins would die. Based on what you've described here, they shouldn't, as the curse isn't being triggered via dna sample. It's being triggered by someone's wishes. Meaning by that person's identification of a person, which can vary in specificity.

As for how it's used? I'm going to assume the elderly now are extremely valuable, the sicker the better, as long as they're still conscious. I'm assuming they will organize (or be organized) into large blocks of death curse givers. So you may buy a 100 person block of people (giving yourself a 10% chance of offing someone) Organizing these groups is going to be difficult though, since there's no way to validate this curse, apparently. Proxies that vary wildly in appearance are going to be utilized by anyone with any real power.
