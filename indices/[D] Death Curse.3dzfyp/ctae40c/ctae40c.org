  Any criteria is valid so long as it selects exclusively among humans

We've got an Oracle on our hands! Invent a god of your own design (an FAI, if you will) using clumsy human words ("Satisfy human values" should be a valid sort of phrase to be used in its definition) overlooking all of spacetime and make your Death Curse "May whoever my god would want me to choose drop dead.".

log_2(6000000000)/1000 bits at a time, that god would, like the Simurgh, bring the world that much closer to the sort of world we'd want it to be.

(Think of it like this: Every 1000 deaths, the timeline splits in 6 billion, each having a different person drop dead. After a million deaths, we've got 6000000000^{1000} branches. The god we defined chooses /the best one/. Perhaps the one where that guy who fed a random number generator into a compiler just for the fuck of it happened to produce its sourcecode...?)
