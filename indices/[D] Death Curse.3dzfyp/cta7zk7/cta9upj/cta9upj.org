Wha- goddammit, it's always halting oracles with you people!

Realistically though you're right. Any system where your human language is somehow being interpreted by the universe screams that something is up, Because if the universe can correctly interpret "The leader of North Korea" as Kim Jong-un (for example), we have to wonder exactly how the universe is doing it's interpreting and why on earth it's able to read the maps of humans. And at that point it's worth testing exactly how sophisticated the universe's death curse processing system really is.
