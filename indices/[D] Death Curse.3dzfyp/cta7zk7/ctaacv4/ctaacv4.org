I can do better than that. I have a program that returns a number. I have numbered list of people. I target whoever the program would indicate after running to completion. This is an exact, unambiguous criterion that selects exclusively among humans. I can now run infinite steps in finite time. There's lots of noise, but it only takes about 700 people to have a 50% chance of having a definite return value, as long as no other death curses interfere.

This might be done efficiently with a moderately sized baby farm. Is being able to speak sufficient to lay curses? Just be sure to start early, before pesky things like "human rights" get in the way.
