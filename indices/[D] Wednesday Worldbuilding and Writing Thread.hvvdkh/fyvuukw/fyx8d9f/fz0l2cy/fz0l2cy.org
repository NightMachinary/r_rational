I'm currently pretty sure that the 7-year expiry is a bad enough idea that I should abandon it.

  Second and third order effect I'd imagine to be stricter lending to consumers, lowered quality of life, and a slowdown of the economy.

As an aside, depending on the distribution of which segments of society had their quality-of-life lowered, then a proposal which caused issues on that axis could still be a politically-viable one. Sort of like how adding a 30-second-ish delay to stock trades and a 0.1% tax on stock transactions would cut the high-freqency-trading business off at the knees, while not actually impeding the general price-discovery benefits from the market.

That reminds me; can anyone think of some anti-kakistocracy policies which would generally benefit (or at least not harm) the 99.9%, and whose effects might be noticed by a single-proprieter small-business owner?
