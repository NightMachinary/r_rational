Looking at mortgages in this proposal:

Obviously you can't get a mortgage longer than 7 years anymore, an in practical terms they'll be even shorter, to prevent lendees from stopping paying when there's no longer enough time to work out a default on the loan. This makes mortgages much more expensive, to the point that most people can't afford them. On the one hand that reduces the demand for housing (in dollar terms), so you'd expect prices to go down, but on the other hand the capital that was being used to provide mortgages is still there, and the owning class still wants returns on that capital. With housing prices down and available capital up, investors move to buying properties and renting them out. So back at the consumer end, you mostly see a shift from home ownership to rent.

And I think you'd see the same general trend elsewhere wherever possible. Business loans financed by taking an ownership stake in the company, that sort of thing.
