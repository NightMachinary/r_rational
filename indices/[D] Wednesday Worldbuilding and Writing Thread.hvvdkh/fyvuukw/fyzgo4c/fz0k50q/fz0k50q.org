  An interesting alternative to these is the concept of mutual-credit banks in mutualism. For a hard SF novel, you could possibly have something like an international credit union with its policies established through a liquid democracy.

It seems worth mentioning that I've already included the phrase "Nacia Konfederacio de Reciproka Kredito" in my current draft, and that I have a note that it might be worth including an example of liquid democracy somewhere in the story. I haven't gone into many details about the credit union - and I'm not necessarily tied to it being a national one - so I could certainly draw on some of your thoughts here.
