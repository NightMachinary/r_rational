My understanding is that marriage for love is a relatively recent invention in western society, and that standard monogamous marriage is relatively rare in the world. (That said, my source is Sex At Dawn, which I believe has a variety of problems).

As a poly person I'm interested in if you could get multiples; as a regular human who has been in long term relationships, I wonder if your tattoo would begin to fade as you drifted apart. But I think if it's magic and it's magic romance perfect relationship then... maybe not?

Another interesting thought: a 40 year old man meets his friend's 15 year old niece. Their matching birthmarks appear. That sort of thing would be... interesting, and probably not unheard of. Make the 40 year old man the king (who has a wife and kids already) and the niece a tavern employee and all of a sudden the "young woman is assaulted" story writes itself.
