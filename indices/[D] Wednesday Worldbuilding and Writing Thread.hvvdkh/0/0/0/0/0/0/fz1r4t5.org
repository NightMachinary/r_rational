The thing with most poly configurations it that they're branching webs: I'm not in a relationship with my husband's girlfriend or her partner, and I've only even met one of my boyfriend's like 5 different partners, so yeah. For a good 6 years there I thought I had two lifelong spousal relationships, so I'd have expected two tattoos, one for each, I guess? I'd say only getting one tattoo to appear when I expected two would make me save a lot of time, but it was 6 years well spent, so who knows.

Regarding consent, make the tavern employee 23 years old, if you like; there's still a power imbalance and the politics of the medieval period are unlikely to be sympathetic to the difference. Unless the magic only makes you get the tattoo for someone you WILL fall in love with, and then basically you have Beauty and the Beast
