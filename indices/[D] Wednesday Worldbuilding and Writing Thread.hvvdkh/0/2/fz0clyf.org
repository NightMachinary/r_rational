I think it'd help if you focused more on the immediate effect, before you focus on the consequences. For example, do the people for whom the tattoo appears feel when it does? Does it appear in an obvious place that would need to be hidden on purpose? Is there any effect beyond signaling that they'll be compatible? One of the commenters below interpreted that soulmating as a process selected from the people one meets throughout life and picks one with high compatibility. Did you intend that or are you aiming for something more like the two people having innate compatibility from birth?

I'm not necessarily asking you to clarify, but rather to think about whether you can come up with answers to these questions that would make the concept more interesting, first. A lot of worldbuilding is done in a vacuum, answering questions in a way that ends up deflecting potential development instead of building on the initial idea.
