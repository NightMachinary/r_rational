So I was wondering what would happen if soulmates were a real and observable phenomenon, what's the impact on the world. So if 99.999999% of the population finds and identifies a soulmate(lots of fanfiction likes magical tattoos of some kind and that's what I am picturing since it's observable to both the mates and outside parties) before the age of 35 (I am picturing the world is nonmagical aside from soulmate stuff). I am not sure when soulmating(?) would start but I am assuming a little after the first agricultural revolution. Also, soulmates are just stupidly compatible but not perfect, so not all soulmates work out but a vast majority of them do.

What I was wondering was how would the world change in drastic ways. This does not disallow childbearing or marriage outside of soulmates but I assume that those rates would be a lot lower. Does arrange marriage still exist, is being gay more acceptable if the world itself thinks it's okay, are racial tensions worse or better, would birth rates be higher or lower in modern times, is the human species overall weaker from having the bar for spreading genes lowered?

Edit: Note soulmates are based on the ability to meet and the tattoo appears when the soulmates meet. And 99% of the population meet the other soulmate before the age of 35. (So its really a magic world were the magic only applies to mates finding each other, so I guess fate is probably also a think)
