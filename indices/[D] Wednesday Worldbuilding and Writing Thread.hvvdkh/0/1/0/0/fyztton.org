So your soulmate is randomly selected from among the people that you will meet in life? Okay, that can work out.

Next question: can it be forced, or faked in some way? Everyone would /love/ be be the soulmate of the rich, unmarried Prince, for example. (Though that won't work out for them, because for political reasons the Prince is going to be marrying the next-door kingdom's Princess and both Kings involved are on the lookout for anyone claiming to be one of the two unlucky soulmates).

--------------

I imagine that one effect would be more mixing between classes - a Merchant whose soulmate is a Beggar might happen quite a lot, and people will be more inclined to marry into other walks of life if there's a soulmate involved.

On the other hand, if someone in power wants to /keep/ two classes apart, then something like Apartheid might prevent the formation of soulmates - if they never get the chance to look into each other's eyes then there will never /be/ soulmates between two groups, right?
