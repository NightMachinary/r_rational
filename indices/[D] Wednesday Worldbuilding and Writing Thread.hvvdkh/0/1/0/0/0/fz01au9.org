I bet its a job to tell if a tattoo is authentic (I know nothing about tattoos but they probably would leave more damage then a random perfect soulmate tattoo). And that is why I want to know if people think racial tension would go up or down. On one hand master and slave mates must be pretty common, but on the other hand there is stuff like apartheid.
