the scaries part is that it presumes that either immutable souls exist, or that personalities are 100% deterministic and we have no free will.

If you can have someone be your 100% perfect soulmate forever, then it means neither of you can change beyond certain parameters that would make you unfit to be their soulmate. Which basically means that once you meet them, you can no longer grow as a person, or only grow in symbiotic parallel with them.

For all means and purposes this would make all monogamists into will-less zombies, and all poly people would be insane from trying to synergise 3 or more personalities into one soul-bonded unit.
