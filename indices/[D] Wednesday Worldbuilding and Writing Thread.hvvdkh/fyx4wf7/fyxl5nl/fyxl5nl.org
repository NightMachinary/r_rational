A good starting point for your research would be in modern and ancient societies where astrology and other divination was taken seriously (was it?). See how that's used, because it's a similar (though obviously less evidence-based) concept.

It depends how it works: the soulmate tattoo, like, with 7 billion people today, if my one soulmate could live in Nigeria just as easily as next door, I'd expect to never meet them and so wouldn't really try. You'd live your life, put your tattoo on your dating site profile, maybe go to conventions or speed dating events to find your tattoo mate (the tattoos would have broad categories, like star signs: blobs versus squares vs lines)

So in that situation, you might not get this knowledge in antiquity. People have been spread out around the world for a very, very long time. So it would just be a fun curiosity when people have matching tattoos.

But if part of what makes someone a soulmate is proximity (after all, not much of a soulmate if you'll never get an opportunity to meet!), then that's more interesting. Say in the absence of anything else you have a 60% chance of finding your soulmate. Then folklore can catch up.

Unless it starts as a very basic part of society, it's going to be weaponised and trodden on, though, given what we know about human nature. People will be forced into marriages for family and property reasons, and great writers will write about people who see their matching tattoo in the crowd and run away with them. Sex is one of the most powerful drives most of us have, and it's been controlled forever by religions and the state. I don't think these tattoos would be treated any different: the catholic church would read a gay tattoo as saying that both have been called to serve the lord in chastity, perhaps as priests or nuns.
