Soulmates would both cause and defuse a lot of racial tension. I think that it could believably go either way.

Racial tension, at the heart of it, starts with the observation "those people are (visibly) different" and than tack onto this "and therefore they are inferior". (There's a lot of people who fear that it might be the other way around - that it might be /themselves/ who are inferior - and who react to this fear by insisting, loudly and repeatedly, that they are, in fact, members of the superior race).

Now, someone might meet a soulmate of a different racial background. Let's say that they get together and marry.

But what do their parents think? Is a young man who marries the daughter of a slave considered fully human? Is he considered /sane?/ Or do his parents treat him as an embarrassment - "really no better than one of them"? Do they try to talk (or beat) him around to rejecting her and settling down with a nice, safe girl of the correct race? Do they disinherit him just so that he can't pass their wealth along to the sons and daughters of a slavegirl?

What of his new wife's parents? What do they think? Is their daughter merely lucky, or is she selling out? Does she have any influence over the way the other slaves are treated, and is she urged to do more with this influence than is actually possible? Is their new son-in-law someone they can talk to, or someone who they have to leave the room when he enters in case he carries back reports of what they said to /his/ father?
