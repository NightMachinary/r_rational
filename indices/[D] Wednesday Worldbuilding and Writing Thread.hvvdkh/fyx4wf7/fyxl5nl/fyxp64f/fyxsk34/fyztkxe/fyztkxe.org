Thats the interesting thing about soulmates, is how would it interact with different cases. What would happen to asexuals and aromantics? Would poly's be just be groups of soulmates in relationships or do they all share the same tattoo?\\
I also assumed that the soulmate tattoos would only be visible on people who can consent.
