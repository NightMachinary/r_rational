Yes, it would be, and has happened [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toba_catastrophe_theory][before]]. Even now, there are many [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncontacted_peoples][uncontacted peoples]] who live with stone age technology. It is not hard to imagine they could live with less, and get back to their current state of living within a decade or two. Assuming they don't lose knowledge of the technology when disaster strikes. I'd bet these people expand as resources in other areas turn up, and within a few thousand years they may dominate the rest of the world. If this scenario happens, then we get normal history. If, on the other hand a state forms, made up of people who remember life before the apocalypse, it's likely they will try to replicate the successes of Science and other modern discoveries leading to an accelerated history.

So it's almost guaranteed that at most within at most a few million years, median 2-3 thousand years, and at minimum 100-500 years we will get back to at least Roman levels of technology, and from there it's nothing to get back to modern day technology. Much of the work was done with two major discoveries everyone knows about: the Scientific method, and the usefulness of mathematics. Other keys to the creation of the modern world lie with individual engineering breakthroughs like the steam engine, coal & other power sources, the printing press, and the realization of the benefits of industrialization. It's likely these will be written about (or at minimum talked about) in the immediate aftermath, and if even a single state cements enough power to allow for enough slack to promote science, math, and an industrialized economy it will get enormous amounts of power which it will likely use to further support Science, math, and industrialization as well as conquering or inspiring other states to do the same.
