*Would humanity be able to survive, if all technology completely disappeared?*

Im trying to build a post-apocalypse world in which the planet was brought back to pristine state before Anthropocene, and everyone was stranded naked and tool-less.

But the question is, would it be even possible for enough humans to survive to keep the species going, let alone try to rebuild civilisation?
