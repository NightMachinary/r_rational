*Is there an economist in the house?*

I'm working on a hardish-SF novel, and could use some advice on the consequences of a few policy proposals - and on which policies would tend toward certain consequences. (I don't necessarily want to be tied to any particular model of economics - after all, life keeps throwing up new surprises - but I'd like to at least avoid any outright howlers.)

For instance, I'm positing some fairly widespread consumer credit reform in the mid-21st century, and am thinking about some jurisdictions adapting Graeber's thoughts on a 'debt jubilee'; after an individual's debt gets so old, such as seven years, it's no longer a legally-enforceable debt. But I don't have the economic chops to work out second- and third-order effects of that, let alone how it might compare to competing proposals.

(The setting isn't a utopia; it's just had a few decades of reasonably reasonable people in charge, who are willing to nudge policy in the direction of overwhelming evidence when that exists. Vaguely Nordic-European; sovereign wealth fund, UBI, a year or so of civilian-service conscription, and a few other "somewhat strange to many current-day eyes but still fairly recognizable" details.)

Is there anyone here willing to bounce a few ideas around?
