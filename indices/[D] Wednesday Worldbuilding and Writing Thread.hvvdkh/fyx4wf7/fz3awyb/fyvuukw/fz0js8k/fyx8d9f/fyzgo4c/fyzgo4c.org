I'm not an economist, but this seems fairly problematic. Compare this to filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, for example. Under Chapter 7, you may have to give up certain non-protected assets (like money in a savings account, a non-primary residence, extra vehicles, etc.) You could also potentially be forced into a Chapter 13 bankruptcy (structured repayment) if you have a decent amount of disposable income and you could easily pay off most of the debt over the next five years.

Historically, jubilees were started in a time when there was indentured servitude. Before jubilees, you could effectively be made a slave indefinitely if you failed to repay your debts, which obviously would decrease willingness to take on debt. Jubilees created a bit more balance between creditors and debtors, still allowing the creditor to recoup at least some of their losses, yet also allowing debtors to escape indefinite servitude if bad luck prevents them from repaying their debts. This balance is pretty similar in effect to what we have now with the Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 bankruptcy system. If you just have jubilees without indentured servitude (or other repayment options), you'll obviously make people much less willing to provide loans, skewing the system too far in favor of debtors.

An interesting alternative to these is the concept of mutual-credit banks in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutualism_(economic_theory)][mutualism]]. For a hard SF novel, you could possibly have something like an international credit union with its policies established through a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_democracy][liquid democracy]]. The credit union would deal in one or more cryptocurrencies, serving as both a broker and a creditor. Any person who wants to be eligible to vote or to receive loans from it must have had an investment account with it for at least the last ten years, and must have been contributing at least 1% of their income without taking it out. This credit union would create a somewhat interesting political force, since the democratic control over it means it generally would not issue loans to authoritarian governments or unethical/unpopular businesses, making it one of very few businesses that push would governments towards being good for their people. It would be one of the most cost-effective ethical investments available.
