Not an actual economist but I'm a bit of a dabbler, so take that into consideration. Second and third order effect I'd imagine to be stricter lending to consumers, lowered quality of life, and a slowdown of the economy.

​

Debt is a facilitator of consumption. In economic terms it increases GDP, consumption in general and facilitates economic transactions. If you make it less desirable for businesses, banks and other institutions to issue debt reasonably they'll just avoid it, leading to an economic slowdown.

​

Banks won't give people loans to buy a house as easily without an asset or backer, making it much more difficult for the average individual to acquire one. Cars and houses would become much harder for a consumer to get a hold of, because it wouldn't be the case of saving enough money to pay a down payment but actually the entirety or a much larger percentage of it as a down payment.

​

PS. Most countries would not do this ever. GDP is what very important for countries, if you decrease or virtually freeze consumer spend which is one of the 3 main contributors to GDP you'll be basically taking away over a third of the GDP of most developed economies. As an emergency measure during a crisis, sure, as a predictable consistent debt nullification policy, almost impossible.
