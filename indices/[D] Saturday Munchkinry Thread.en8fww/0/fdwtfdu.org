You can choose an object and affect it with a force directed along the line connecting your and object's centers of gravity, either pushing it away or pulling it to yourself.

The effect of it is equally distributed over the whole object. You are affected with equal but counter-directed force, equally distributed over your body.

There is no upper limit for how much force you can project. You have to continuously think about it to support the effect.
