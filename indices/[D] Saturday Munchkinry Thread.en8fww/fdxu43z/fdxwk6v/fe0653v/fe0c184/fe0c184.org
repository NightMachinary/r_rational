And therein lies the exploits. If the frame of reference is something that makes it difficult for you to abuse your ability on Earth, then it is almost certainly based on something located on Earth. A magical artifact buried somewhere, or the Gaian force of the Earth itself, etc.

If it's a magical artifact, locating it will let you pull of abuses of power just by moving the artifact around.

If it's the Earth itself, get yourself into space. Pretty much every object not attached to Earth in some way will have its momentum (according to the Earth's frame of reference) drastically changed over time as the Earth orbits the Sun. Your ability can abuse this to make spacecraft change velocity in space without needing fuel. (Note: the 100km restriction only means you need to give an object inside the spacecraft momentum, which will make it push against the spacecraft to move the spacecraft.)
