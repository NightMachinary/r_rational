Galactic/Universal Destroyer: Apply nigh infinite force on yourself and any object, giving both you and the object nigh infinite kinetic energy, which will explode in all directions upon impacting anything, creating a sphere of destruction that spreads outwards at near light speeds.

But let's suppose you want to use your ability while staying alive. The fact that the force is equally distributed over your body means you won't be injured no matter how much force you apply, up until you hit something. Like your clothes. Or air. Sadly you need to breathe, so this limits you pretty hard. You could fly around in a vacuum at utterly insane speeds, pushing and pulling around planets and stars, but only for as long as you can hold your breath. And tolerate the exposure to vacuum.

On the other hand, even without applying ludicrous amounts of force, your ability can still be useful. Applying small pushes over and over against a rocket in space can help it move faster and faster without needing as much fuel.
