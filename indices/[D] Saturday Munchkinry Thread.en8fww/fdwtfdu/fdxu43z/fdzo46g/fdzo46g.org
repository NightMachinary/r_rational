You get to break the first law of thermodynamics right off the bat; if you impart a net transfer of momentum from a large object to a smaller one, the kinetic energy of the two-object system will increase (at least in the simple case below).

Let's say we have a large object with mass M and velocity V, and a small object with mass m and velocity 0. The total momentum of the system is MV, and the total kinetic energy of the system is (1/2)MV^{2.} When we swap momenta, the total momentum of mass m remains constant at MV, so the velocity of mass m is (M/m)V. The kinetic energy, then, is (1/2)m((M/m)V)^{2,} or (1/2)m(M^{2} V^{2} / m^{2),} or (1/2)MV^{2} * (M/m).

It would be easy enough to turn this kinetic energy into stored chemical energy, perhaps by dropping large rocks off a cliff and using their momentum to propel small rocks to turn turbines which raise the rocks back up the cliff. How consequential would this be? [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline_gallon_equivalent][Wikipedia]] gives the energy content of a gallon of gasoline as 33.41 kWh, or a little over 120 megajoules. If we drop a 1000 kg rock off a 10 m cliff, we get 10 kilojoules of potential energy converted to kinetic; if we use that to power a 1 g pebble which then turns a generator, we get (1000000 g/1 g) a factor of 1000000 increase, which gets us to 10 gigajoules - nearly 100 gallons of gasoline's worth. These are reasonable numbers; we could easily add another order of magnitude or several to them.
