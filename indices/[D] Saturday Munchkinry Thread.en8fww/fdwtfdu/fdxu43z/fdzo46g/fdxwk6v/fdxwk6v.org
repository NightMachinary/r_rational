No Fall Damage: Jump down from ridiculous heights, and keep swapping your linear momentum with other objects in line of sight so you hit the ground with low momentum. You can even use this as an attack: fall at high speeds, swap momentum with a target.

Actually upon further thought, I wonder how this ability works at all. Momentum = mass * velocity. The earth is orbiting the sun and spinning, so everything on earth already has massive amounts of momentum. If you swap the momentum of something heavy, like a building, with something small, like a pebble, won't the two bodies now move out-of-sync with the Earth and cause utter destruction?

I guess you could get around this by using your own body as the frame of reference, but that only works if you're standing still. If you start running, suddenly everything that was "stationary" before now has momentum equal to your velocity times their mass.
