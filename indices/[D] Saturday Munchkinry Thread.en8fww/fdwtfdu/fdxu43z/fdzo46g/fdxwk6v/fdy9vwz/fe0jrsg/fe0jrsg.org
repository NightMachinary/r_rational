You can easily bring anything to a complete stop by swapping momentum with the ground. Use it to restrain people, bring planes out of the air, stop cars without stopping people in them, etc.

If you target a large volume of windy air, or currenty water, you could also instantly accelerate things to very high speeds. Use it to rip people's limbs off, turn nails into armour-piercing rounds, launch rockets, etc.
