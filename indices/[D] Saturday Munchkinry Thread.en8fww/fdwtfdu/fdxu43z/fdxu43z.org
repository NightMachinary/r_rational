You can switch the linear momentum of bodies. The switch is instantaneous. You cannot alter the bodies' mass, so the only thing that will be affected will be their linear velocity. You must either be touching or have an unobstructed line of sight with the bodies. The bodies must be big enough that you are able to distinguish them. You have a range of 100km (no switching momentum between the Earth and a pebble or between a guy and a star). You can only switch the momentum of two bodies at a time. You can use lenses and mirrors to aid in the line-of-sight requirement, you cannot use monitors or projections.
