Vibration magic from WtC. You can alter the amplitude and frequency of vibrations within your range, which is roughly half a mile in radius, along with an additional sense of vibrations in that range. "Vibration" is defined rather broadly, and encompasses sound of all kinds, biological rhythms, and at the upper end the generation and manipulation of light. Vibration magic uses up your personal mana bar, which can replenish from nothing over the course of maybe an hour. Modifying vibrations down is nearly costless, modifying amplitude at the expense of frequency or vice versa is more costly, and increasing both is the most expensive. In practical terms, you can dampen vibrations basically indefinitely if you aren't doing anything else with your mana, you can create a sound loud enough to kill someone about 4 times before you run out of mana, and you can use your entire mana to generate a sound loud enough explode someone's head. Creating something like an earthquake, even an extremely local one, isn't possible for a single vibration mage without assistance.

Standard means of attack are to generate a sound loud enough to cause pain and then kill with something else, generate a sound loud enough to kill through organ damage, and making someone's head vibrate enough to kill them. The soul gives some resistance to vibration magic, and stopping someone's heart is possible but not clearly superior to attacking their skull. Similarly, you can't realistically make someone run slower by slowing the pace of their legs. Your own soul doesn't provide resistance, so you can alter your own biological rhythms without additional difficulty, but without any inherent protection from altering your own rhythms in a way that might harm your body.

Vibration magic senses are extremely fine, and they can use this sense to feel the vibrations within objects or in a large area around themselves. Combining their senses and sound manipulation allows them to hear nearly anything within their range that they are paying attention to, use echolocation, etc. Other vibration mages can counter these tactics though, if one is available.

Alexander Wales has already explored a number of combat and utility uses for Vibration magic, but I'm wondering if someone here could come up with additional uses. I have a preference for the non-combat uses, the ways that magic affects society, but additional combat uses would be neat to see as well.
