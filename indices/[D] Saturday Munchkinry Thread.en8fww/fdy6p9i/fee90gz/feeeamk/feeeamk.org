You can change some biological cycles, like your circadian rhythm, heartbeat, or breathing. But the soul interferes when you do it on other people, and the ability doesn't give any information on biological processes that aren't cycles to some degree. Affecting things on the level of individual cells, like cell division, is maybe theoretically possible but hasn't even been mentioned as something a real vibration mage can do. So affecting the brain safely would be incredibly difficult.

Slowing down cycles in the brain, if it's something that a vibration mage can even do, would be such a high level ability that you would have a dozen different ways of instantly killing/disabling them, so it doesn't give that big an advantage. The skull vibrating ability doesn't take all that much mana, it's just a difficult process that takes skill to do reliably and quickly.

That said, there's another magic in worth the candle, still magic, where slowing down the brain for an instant and safe disabling attack is possible for the grand masters. It's touch range only, for the most part, however. They have a lot of other non-lethal disabling attacks as well, by the time they get to that level. Incidentally, they can also produce cold, so cryogenics might be a possibility.
