  you could stop basically any projectile weapon by transferring the kinetic energy of the projectile to something else

I don't think this will work. The rules are you need to be touching the object, or have a line of sight to the object and the object can be distinguished. Bullets fired by most guns will move so fast that you cannot distinguish them, and so cannot stop them. And if you're touching a bullet it's probably already too late.
