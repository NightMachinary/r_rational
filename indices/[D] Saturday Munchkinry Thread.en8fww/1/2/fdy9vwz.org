You would be an extremely valuable asset in a military. So long as you have enough time to react, you could stop basically any projectile weapon by transferring the kinetic energy of the projectile to something else. Any hostile planes or helicopters you can see would fall out of the sky by transferring the momentum of their chassis or blades into the ground or something. You could use a telescope to transfer the momentum of a car into a person or vulnerable part of a structure.
