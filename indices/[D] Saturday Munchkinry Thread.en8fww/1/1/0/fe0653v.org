Nah nah nah nah nah. Absolute velocity doesn't exist. Saying that you should move relative the earth is just as arbitrary as saying you shouldn't. The frame of reference is almost certainly just gonna be earth, and if you wanna good justification for this sorta thing, check sandersnoot (he has some nearby body of mass justification that allows you to do shit relative trains, but the idea is pretty much gold for this sorta velocity physicy things)
