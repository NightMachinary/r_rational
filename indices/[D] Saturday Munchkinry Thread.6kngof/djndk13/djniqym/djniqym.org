Can you work as a cashier, and when someone pays with cash, would they think it's totally normal for you to take all their cash without giving them any change?

Can you walk behind the banker's counter, pretend to be a banker, and then start taking people's credit cards? After all, a banker can do those things, so this isn't something "absolutely no person would be able to do without raising some eyebrows".

Also, what is the duration of this power? People might think it's perfectly normal for you to take their credit cards at the moment you are taking them, but later when they check their credit card bills and notice huge expenses, would they realize "wait, this isn't right..." or would they still be "yep, totally normal. nothing to see here."? And if they do eventually notice that something is wrong, would they remember that it was you specifically who took their credit cards?

If people don't remember that it's you specifically, then there's an even better way to make money: industrial espionage. You could walk into the research labs of successful companies, steal their secrets, and sell them to rival companies for lots of money. This only works if your ability makes you anonymous though, otherwise you would end up with a knife in your back.

For more ethical purposes, you could also use this ability to fight crime. You wouldn't be able to actually get in physical fights though, since even though you would appear totally normal, it actually is totally normal to punch bad guys, and it would also be totally normal for the bad guys to fight back. No, instead you should become the greatest journalist ever. Walking into all kinds of war zones and restricted areas, filming all kinds of evils while the evildoers think it's totally normal for someone to be filming their actions. So you would expose all the villains and allow the good guys to capture them.
