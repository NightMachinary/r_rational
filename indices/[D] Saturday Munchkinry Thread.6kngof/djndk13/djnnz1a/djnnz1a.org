Well, one loophole is that as long as any one person could do a thing without raising an eyebrow, you could as well. So, for a random example, Bill Gates could refer to himself as Bill Gates on the internet, and no-one would raise an eye. So you could pretend to be him. This isn't really useful at first glance, more a proof of concept that may be fun in some way I don't know.

Also, it isn't specified it has to be a living person. Does this mean you could, I don't know, kill a subordinate for treason even if everyone knows its just an excuse to get rid of him, as Nero did? Maybe that's pushing the boundaries.
