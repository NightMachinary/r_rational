How does the seeing actually work? If I hijacked the nerve connection between the eye and the brain, would it be sending me information about future photons? That plus a computer that can flash a light would negate the negative effects

What happens if you try to not do what you see? Like in the future vision you see yourself walking forwards normally, but you suddenly stop. You'll have to have seen you stop before you decide to stop, but what if you consciously decide to keep going despite seeing that?
