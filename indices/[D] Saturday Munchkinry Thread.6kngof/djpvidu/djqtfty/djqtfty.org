  What could you do with it if you could see half a second into the future? You'd probably crush someone with equivalent training in martial arts and could punch a bit above your weight but nothing shattering. It doesn't seem like you could even react fast enough to help with automated trading.

Can I see myself half a second into the future seeing myself another half a second into the future seeing myself another... thus seeing arbitrarily far into the future XD?

Even if I can't future see what my future self is future seeing, my future self could still transmit what he's seeing if the data to transmit is sufficiently concise. Half a second is still enough time to transmit more than a few bits of info. You could easily place your hands in front of your face, and change the number of fingers raised in half a second.

So for instance, you could play card gambles like poker, and send information to yourself whether to raise or fold. So, say you find out at time t that you have lost the gamble. At time t-0.5 seconds, you see that happening in the future, and so quickly raise a finger. At time t-1 seconds, you see your future self at t-0.5 seconds starting to raise a finger, so you also raise a finger. At time t-1.5 seconds, you see your future self at t-1 seconds starting to raise a finger, so you also raise a finger... all the way back to the time you were deciding whether to call the bet or fold. Now you call the bet only if you don't see your future self raising his finger.

Would also work for the stock market. When you find out at time t that your investments have failed, your self at time t-0.5 seconds raises a finger, your self at time t-1 seconds raises a finger, ... and so on until the time you were about to make those investments. So you only invest in something if you don't see your future self raising a finger.

You could even use your future sight as a danger detector, designate a specific visible signal (like raising your left pinkie) you will make if you see death in the future, and keep relaying it to the past until you stop seeing futures where you die.

So if anything, fighting martial artists is actually one of the hardest things to do with this ability. A big part of martial arts is reading your opponent. So when you use your future vision to see what the enemy will do, your movements will change in reaction, your opponents will see those movements change, and so they too will change their movements, subverting your future vision. Also, being able to see attacks in advance doesn't mean a lot if their attack power is overwhelming. With enough strength and speed from years of training, martial artists may be such excellent fighters that you can't dodge/block their attacks even though you future-see them coming.
