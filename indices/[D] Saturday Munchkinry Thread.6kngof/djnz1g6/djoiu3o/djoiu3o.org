Hmmm. what you really want to do, here, is find a point of maximal impact with a single bit of data.

Find a smart, intelligent, driven university student who is having some difficulty deciding between a choice of two degrees and is willing to help out. (If you are in such a position, all the better) Ask the 8-ball whether it would be better in the long run for him to do degree A, instead of degree B.

Sign him up for a degree as revealed by the 8-ball. That's a pretty life-changing choice, so loads of consequences from a single bit.

But be sure to define "better" properly in your question...
