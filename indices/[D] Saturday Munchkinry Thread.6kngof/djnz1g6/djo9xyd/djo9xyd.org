  Each of these answers only means its literal meaning, so no "answer 'yes' for 1, 'don't count on it for 2', etc.".

Hmmmmmm... I'm pretty sure you can ask convoluted questions to make the 8-ball have at least 10 different meaningful answers even if they all mean their literal meanings. All you need to do is to include self-reference.

This is because a standard 8-ball has 10 distinct ways of saying yes. So call them "Yes1", "Yes2", "Yes3," ..., "Yes10". Let Q be an important question that has 10 possible answers labeled 1, 2, 3, ..., 10.

Now ask: Magic 8-Ball! Tell me if the following boolean expression is true!

- (Q = 1 AND 8-Ball answers "Yes 1") OR
- (Q = 2 AND 8-Ball answers "Yes 2") OR
- (Q = 3 AND 8-Ball answers "Yes 3") OR
- ...
- (Q = 10 AND 8-Ball answers "Yes 10") OR
- OR 8-Ball answers "No".

Now if Q = X, for some X in [1..10], the 8-Ball has to answer "Yes X". Why? Because if the 8-Ball answers "No", then the boolean expression would be true, meaning the 8-ball isn't honest. If the 8-Ball answers "Yes Y" for some Y not equal to X, then the boolean expression would be false, meaning the 8-ball isn't honest. So the only way for the 8-Ball to be honest is to answer "Yes X".

Hehehe.
