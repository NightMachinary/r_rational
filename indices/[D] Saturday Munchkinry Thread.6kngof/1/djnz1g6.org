You have come into the possession of an Actually Magic 8-Ball, having bought it from a mysterious corner shop that wasn't there the next day. The AM8B is all-knowing and 100% honest, but the shopkeeper warned you that it does come with a few limitations.

- Each ball comes with a limited number of uses; you got this one on sale because it only has one left.

- It only answers questions that can be answered by one of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball#Possible_answers][standard 8-ball answers]] (i.e., only yes-or-no answers).

- Each of these answers only means its literal meaning, so no "answer 'yes' for 1, 'don't count on it for 2', etc.".
