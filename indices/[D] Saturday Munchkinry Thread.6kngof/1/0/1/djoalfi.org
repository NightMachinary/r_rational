We can take this one step further by realizing that when you ask an 8-ball for answers, the 8-ball doesn't answer immediately, or in any fixed amount of time. The amount of time it takes to answer is based on its inner workings.

So if we assume this 8-ball is all-knowing and 100% honest, it has to be able to choose which answer to give when asked a question. But if it has the power to choose which answer to give, surely it also has the power to adjust the timing at which the answer is given!

Therefore, before asking your question, first set up a camera to record the 8-ball's timing with extreme precision. Now every time unit counts as a distinct answer. Add these distinct answers to your boolean expression, and voila! OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS!

Well ok, there's probably still a character limit of sorts based on how precise your camera can be, but it is still a way higher number of distinct, meaningful answers than two. And considering the camera technology available today, you could probably get pretty good answers for questions like:

- What are the winning lottery numbers for the next lottery?
- What is the chemical formula for an optimal cancer-curing/anti-aging/[insert other medical miracle] drug?
- Who is the optimal person for creating a friendly AI if we askers of the 8-ball now gave him our support?
- What is the approximate direction and distance to the nearest habitable planet?
- Which of our current systems of morality would produce the [best] future? (for some definition of "best").
- What is the longest list of presidents this 8-ball can give such that electing these presidents results in an optimal future?

And perhaps the question with the highest risk and highest reward:

- What is the most concise yet viable method of creating a time machine?

If you're unlucky, there's no way to make a time machine in a concise enough manner for the 8-ball to answer.

If you're lucky... time travel back to before you asked the 8-ball. It's time for *infinite questions*.
