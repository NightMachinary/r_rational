Several months ago, I had a very engaging discussion with someone else about a resetting time-travel power. The idea is that you can save and reset as if you are a video-game character, but there is only one save slot and you don't retain your memories after resetting.

About the binary bet thing, I remember reading about a man who made a spectacle by working with a TV station to host a one-off show where he bets his entire fortune on a coin flip and the TV station will either pay him an equivalent amount or get all of his money. He won, but the TV station also profited from airing the one or two episode show.
