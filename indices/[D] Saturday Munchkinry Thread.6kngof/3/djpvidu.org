I've been trying to think about really weak precognition/time travel.

What could you do with it if you could see half a second into the future? You'd probably crush someone with equivalent training in martial arts and could punch a bit above your weight but nothing shattering. It doesn't seem like you could even react fast enough to help with automated trading.

What about very low bandwidth? Every birthday, you get a vision of your future self holding a red or blue ball. You can't see anything in the background. Effectively, you can transmit one bit of information to yourself of one year ago. I could definitely see getting rich using this, but what else? And what's the most efficient way to use this? I can't think of a sufficiently binary bet that you could use this to guarantee huge wealth within one birthday.
