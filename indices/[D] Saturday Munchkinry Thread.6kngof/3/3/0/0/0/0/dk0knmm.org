I'm not relying on security through obscurity. I have full faith in the AGI to know exactly what I'm thinking. I'm relying on security through being a massive burden. Everyone else can just be easily caught and stuck in a box/cyrogenic sleep/etc. My life alone would require the costly development of mind control technology, since I'm the only "time traveler" in this scenario. So why bother saving my life when the AGI could use the resources to save countless others?
