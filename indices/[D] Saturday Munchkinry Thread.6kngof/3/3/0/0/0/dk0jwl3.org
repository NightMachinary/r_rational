Any plan that relies on security through obscurity against an AGI is a bad one. For example, it will only need to notice that you don't seem to feel as helpless as everyone else while otherwise being in good mental health to see something's up. I suppose it depends on how time travel works - if only your life is lost, there might be a slight chance it leaves you be. If it can predict both timelines that can result from your messages well enough, it would choose the better, and the outcome for you would be mostly random.
