The AI? Yes, it would want to make me send back a 1. But how could it? I control what I send back. Unless the AI develops mind control technology, it can't influence what I send, other than preventing me from sending anything (which is equivalent to sending a 0).

And the AI is highly unlikely to develop mind control technology, since all the resources that would go into that development could easily be used to save more lives, than just my own.
