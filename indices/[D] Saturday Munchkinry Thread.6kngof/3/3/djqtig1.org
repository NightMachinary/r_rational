  What about very low bandwidth? Every birthday, you get a vision of your future self holding a red or blue ball. You can't see anything in the background. Effectively, you can transmit one bit of information to yourself of one year ago. I could definitely see getting rich using this, but what else? And what's the most efficient way to use this? I can't think of a sufficiently binary bet that you could use this to guarantee huge wealth within one birthday.

Let's clarify the rules of this scenario. I'm going to assume you can't do funny things to the ball, like writing instructions on it or holding it at different angles to denote different meanings. So all you see is either holding a red ball (0), or a blue ball (1). I'm also going to assume that dying or not sending a bit results in the exact same signal as sending a "0", so you truly only get 1 bit of information. So every year, at the exact month/day/hour/minute/second/millisecond/etc. that you were born, you get exactly 1 bit of information from yourself exactly 1 year in the future. Let's hope you weren't born on Feb 29.

This will be harder than the first scenario, since you literally only get 1 bit per year, so every time you future-see "oh this gamble will fail", the gamble either has to be binary, or you have to wait another year to try a different gamble. And binary gambles tend to have much worse payoffs than multiple choice gambles.

You can't even use this as a proper danger detector, since sending back a bit to yourself indicating your death doesn't really tell you how to avoid that death. You could drastically change your behavior upon receiving that signal, but you wouldn't really know if any of the changes you made helped you avoid death until it's too late.

Worse, since the moment you receive a future bit is the exact moment you send a bit to the past, you can't even relay future bits, so your future sight is limited to one year.

I guess in this case, I would just use this ability as a Utilitarian Torture AI alert. By Utilitarian Torture AI, I mean a not-so-friendly AI that has been coded to follow the utilitarian principles of saving the most lives, even if those lives have to become utterly wretched existences in the process. Which means the most likely result is the AI will shove all humans into little boxes, keep them barely alive, and strip them of all their freedoms and unnecessary organs/limbs, so that the amount of nutrients needed to keep them alive is absolutely minimal and thus the AI can "support" more human lives on the same limited amount of resources.

So every year on my birthday, I would hold a blue ball by default, and a red ball if I become aware of the existence of a Utilitarian Torture AI. Remember that not sending any signal also sends the same signal as if I was holding the red ball. So while I see my future selves holding blue balls, I continue to live life as normal. The moment I see my future self holding a red ball? I kill myself immediately to avoid the eternal suffering of being kept barely alive by a Utilitarian Torture AI.
