I don't know if this one has been done yet, but one I've been thinking about a bit is the ability to fit in. As in, people around you don't think twice about what you're doing or why you're doing it, and that it's totally normal that you'd be doing it. What would you do with such a power? The only rules I can think of for it would be that you cannot do stuff that absolutely no person would be able to do without raising some eyebrows, such as breaking the glass around the Mona Lisa, and you cannot turn it off.
