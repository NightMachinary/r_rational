It's the only satisfying solution to the Problem of Evil I've ever encountered which allows both evil and an omnibenevolent deity to exist simultaneously. Of course, we have no reason to think it applies to our world. In the UNSONGverse, the dead were /merely/ being tortured horrifically for a time which wound up being finite. In our world, however, we have no reason to think the dead even exist anymore, so they can never have justice.

My father is a tricky situation. Given that he's a theologian, he doesn't see the problem with the Problem of Evil, I don't think. Now that you mention it, I don't think I've ever asked him which apologetic he finds satisfying there. My mother (an Episcopal priest, if you'll believe it) is a universalist, and so from her perspective it isn't an issue because everyone is getting saved anyway, much like in UNSONG. But dad is...not quite an annihilationist, given that he doesn't believe in souls, but definitely thinks the unsaved just aren't coming back. I've tried to explain to him how this makes God the most horrific mass murderer imaginable, but arguing with religious people like that doesn't generally accomplish anything.

His job is literally convincing himself and others that his reading of some old books is the right one. It doesn't help that he can actually read the original old books, as he's fluent in Hebrew, Ancient (but not modern) Greek, German, and Latin. He's probably right on what the words mean and just wrong to /trust/ them the way he does.
