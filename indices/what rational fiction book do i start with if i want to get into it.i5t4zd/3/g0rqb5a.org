[[http://hpmor.com][HPMOR]] is the quintessential rationalist work. I read it because someone attempted to /criticize/ it by calling it Harry Potter with the plot of Ender's Game, which obviously meant I was required to read it immediately.

[[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Worm]] is the genre breaker of superhero fiction. If you've always been bothered by superhero worldbuilding that just doesn't make sense, this one is for you.

[[http://unsongbook.com][UNSONG]] is Bible fanfiction which takes a look at what the world would look like if every single thing in the Bible were true, including and especially the contradictory bits. It manages to be hilarious to both me, an antitheist, and my father, a theologian.
