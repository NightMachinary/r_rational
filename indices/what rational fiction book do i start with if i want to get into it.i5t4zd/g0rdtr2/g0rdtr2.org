I would start with the stories in the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index][wiki]]. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man][The Metropolitan Man]] is a decent, relatively short one. And by short I mean normal book length rather than epic 10 volume series length like some of the stories on here. It's about treating superman like a villain.

But I don't know if it's a good idea to pick up a hobby just to get someone to notice you. You're better off talking to him and asking him what he would recommend, then going off and reading it so you can discuss it with him.
