I'd echo the suggestion below that "Metropolitan Man" is a good entry point, just to even see if you like this stuff. It has the benefit that you'll probably already be at least a bit familiar with the cast of characters involved, and not being of epic length,

If you are into horror and just want to watch anime, "Promised Neverland" hits the rational vibe. Smart kids, orphanage, horror.

"Mother of Learning" dips into other tropes that seem popular in these circles, (time loops, and complicated magic systems) but it's a rather large commitment.
