Looking over the wiki or [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic][tvtropes]] page will give you a good idea of what it is, and list a bunch of examples so you can see what strikes your interest, particularly if there are any fandoms that you like that there's rational fanfiction of (Harry Potter, Pokemon, Twilight, Naruto, Animorphs, Superman, Terminator, etc).

Also you should know that the community is small enough that, if your crush likes rational fiction and reads it often, they probably frequent this subreddit and will see this post :P
