If that is your motivation I will reiterate what other's have said: Ask him what he would recommend reading and likes, that way you can discuss stuff in common.

The next answer is that there is a lot of fan-fiction based rationality writing. Go to the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index#wiki_defining_works][wiki]] or [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic][tvtropes]] (scroll down to examples and pick fan fiction) and find one from a universe you like. [[http://www.hpmor.com/][Hpmor]] is considered an important work, and is a good choice if you like Harry Potter.

The final answer is my personal favorite: [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25137/worth-the-candle][Worth the Candle]] (you can read the first 14 chapters, book 1, and see what you think).
