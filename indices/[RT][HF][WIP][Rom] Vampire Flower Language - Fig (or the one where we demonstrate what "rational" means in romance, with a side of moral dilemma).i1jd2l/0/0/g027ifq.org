Thank you so much, it means a lot! I'm glad you enjoy it :)

Feel free to join the discord - there's like three people on it apart from me and they're both [[/r/rational]] people.

Sorry about the last chapter. When I went to write it, thinking about everything that happened during that time, I was like, thinking that it was way too different and tangential to the main story. So we decided to go self-indulgent artistic with it, and self-indulgent artistic is very on-brand.

(but don't worry, all other chapters are normal chapter length!)
