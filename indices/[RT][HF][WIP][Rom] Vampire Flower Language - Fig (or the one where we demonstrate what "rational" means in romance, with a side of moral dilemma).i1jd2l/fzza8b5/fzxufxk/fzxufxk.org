Non-spoiler summary: this chapter moves the plot forward quite a bit, though mostly through talking.

Oh, but we gratuitously use 4D physics to make magic happen, so hopefully that's cool?

I've been asked "is this any good?" a few times in the last couple of months, so feel free to go through my post history to see why you may want to give this story a chance. We're coming onto the home stretch, hopefully will be finished by the end of the year, but note this is just volume 1 so not all the plot threads are going to be tidied up.

(spoilers for this chapter below)

So, I remember people have often said "what does it mean to write a rational romance" - and well, this is what we're trying for here. There's a legitimate point of disagreement, and the characters are both /trying/ to communicate that that means to them. They're not fully succeeding, but they're both trying, and you can see where they're both coming from. In short: It's not the hilarious misunderstanding that starts most every 90s romcom

Suddenly the very real problem of having a boyfriend who is 1500 years older than you and had been living most of that time as thinking of your whole species as a commodity rears its ugly head. The ethics of what is effectively a giant, stone house elf comes into play.

Of course, this chapter provides no answers as to the nature of the events of the previous chapter (Sardinia, which was like two sentences long because we take ourselves too seriously as "artists"), because you weren't really expecting that, were you?
