I mean if most of the wasteland nobles are dead and Ubua is there basically as Cat's oathbound enforcer i guess that's workable if Amadeus is really that opposed to actually ruling Praes rather than having held what two out of three for the position? Is it that bad that she's not the worst candidate for Dread Empress in terms of her long term goals? I mean yeah there's a bit of a huge conflict with previous oaths to put her down when... what was it she stopped be useful? Wait it was just a she doesn't go unpunished i think. I mean being leashed at the post that was her Goal of all goals is pretty ironic i'm not sure if that would qualify under most justice systems but Cat is still de facto Queen of Callow.

But also like directly calling out some of the readers it feels like with the mentions of Kilian.
