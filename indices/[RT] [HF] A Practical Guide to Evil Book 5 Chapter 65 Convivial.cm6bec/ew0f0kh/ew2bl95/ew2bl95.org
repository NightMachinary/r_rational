Every time Kilian's been mentioned for the past three books it's been to repeat that /it's over./ In the same way that Nauk was only brought back to be a different person, and then killed off entirely.

I see chapters like this as an answer to fan enthusiasm. An indulgence, rather than a re-introduction of the plot thread. If it /still/ gets brought up in the comments of future books, there will come a chapter where we get an off-hand mention of a Legion mage with red hair annihilating a group of undead only to catch a javelin in the throat.
