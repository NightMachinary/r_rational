By the same author as [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/hope-and-silence-in-the-hive-warhammer-40k-complete.583942/][Hope and Silence in the Hive]] and [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/terror-peace-among-the-stars-sequel-warhammer-40k-complete.672535/page-30#post-67895968][Terror & Peace Among the Stars]], Onward To Providence utilizes truly alien perspectives to tell a story broader in scope than I've yet seen in another sci-fi story. The little glimpses of the bigger picture shown through each character show how truly /different/ everyone is from each other. Even the human perspectives are altered, living instead on a giant world beast and having a society that can meaningfully interact with and exist as souls while exploring the implications of what exactly this means. There are some hiccups while the story is getting started in the early chapters, such as typos and a rather memeified human character, but these issues crop up less frequently as the narrative continues. Despite the rough start, this story is definitely worth reading. The semi-frequent art on top of everything else adds another dimension to the story, and bumps this up from /recommended/ to /highly recommended/.
