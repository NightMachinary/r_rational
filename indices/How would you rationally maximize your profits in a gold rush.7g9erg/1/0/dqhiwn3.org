It's intended to be somewhat crowded and biased towards violent solutions, but, yeah, 10km squared is probably still a bit small.

~1000 miners should be leaving a month, and perhaps 250-500 per month should be dying due to various causes.

Let's further assume that it's not so easy to set up a large company, for various reasons. Culturally, miners reject obeying 'middle management' bosses, and only listen to the CEO directly. There are no good long-range communications. Spreading thin opens up your turf to being taken. Etc. Let's basically assume you can't control more than ~20% of the gold fields, and that attempts at further concentration fail due to raids, theft, betrayal, etc.
