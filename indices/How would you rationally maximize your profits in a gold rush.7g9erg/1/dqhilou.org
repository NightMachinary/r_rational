I'd acquire start up capital by conquering small bands and conscripting them or murdering them outright. I'd do this in secret as best I could. Once I've gathered up a large enough band, preferably the largest, I would continue my chain of conquering until I've established myself as a pseudo King of sorts. I would maintain control by incentivizing my closest advisors with money, power and the implicit threat of violence.

Treachery is an obvious risk but I would both provide for my people and brutally stomp any treason I encounter. This becomes much more difficult in the sort of lawless scenario you've depicted. Once I'm the biggest bad ass around, I simply run things. I'd have workers that worked the river, soldiers that policed and protected them and I would ensure my people are well fed while also stomping out any signs of rebellion ad best I can. I would do my best to make my people see that, though I'm brutal, life under me is good and safe as long as you follow the rules.

The new miners would be absorbed into my group or completely prevented from mining. Depending on the situation, this would be through simply blockading the river and forcing them to go back home. Or killing them if they tried to shoe in to my business. Of course it's not as if it would be "take a pebble of gold and get killed". There'd be some sort of decently civil way I'd tell them they need to fuck off before killing them.

Basically. I would be Negan.

P.S won't the model you imply hit critical mass very quickly considering it's only 15 km square? That's a bit small for a population of 10,000 that grows by a 1500 a month and only dies to violence. Or are we assuming the gold has effectively infinite depth?
