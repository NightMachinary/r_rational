I still control a 5th. That's more than enough to have dominance, especially if the rest of the miners are as small minded as the rules dictate (e.g have issues working with others)

I'd do my best to sabotage any companies approaching our size but, other than that, I would continue on. I would supplant the various supply shops with my own puppets, whether through force or straight up purchase, since I have the most gold on the block.

I would have control of the import of supplies at that point and would then proceed with the sort of bottlenecking that companies with monopolies have used for forever. I'd still be fair, as I don't want to be overthrown, but I would ensure that I was winning more.
