Oh. Black is going to go back. The betrayal happened, and Malicia is at ease. Black is going to kill her. Probably +after+ before saying the words "I do not kneel."

Edit: This is an incredibly stupid move on Malicia's part, but it also fits in perfectly with her blind spots. It's hard to say whether or not she'll expect it, but it seems that Black believes she won't.
