Man, I feel like you've really done a great job at capturing a civilization in your words. Brutal, unforgiving, rational and irrational in twisted ways.

Reminds me that we live at human civilization's most graceful, most enlightened peak, that it was 100x worse for most of history. I had hoped there was a light at the end of the tunnel, but now I sort of expect Ram to die a tragic, meaningless death raging against the world he was born into.
