Thanks for the introduction to this one. About halfway through so far, great for killing time.

My main issue, though, is that the main character is quite well optimized, but the people back in his world aren't at all. Somewhat spoilery, but EVERY adventurer and NPC over a certain level will be rocking an item of /Protection from Alignment/ out of necessity to avoid extremely common mind control and rather common possession effects. Nevermind that action economy is a thing, which is why groups of adventures can gang up on an otherwise more powerful singular for and bring it down. It's like his world suddenly stops following it's own rules.
