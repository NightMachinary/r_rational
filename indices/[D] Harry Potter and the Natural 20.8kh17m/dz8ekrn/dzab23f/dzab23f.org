Hello! This is me. I'm sorry to say the project is on hiatus for the time being; I've only got so much time to write things and I don't want to spend it all on fan fiction. Part of the problem is time--as the story gets bigger and more complicated, it takes substantially longer to write. I wrote the first three chapters in an evening procrastinating for an early Roman empire final; more recent chapters take days or weeks just because of all the threads and characters I need to consider.

I can understand your disappointment with the lack of updates, and if I'm honest, I'm pretty disappointed too. I started the story for a park and never intended for it to be hanging over me like this.\\
Ii /will/ finish it, and people can stop worrying if I'm dead. I'm young and healthy and not going anywhere any time soon. It's just slipped to a lower priority because as much as I love it, its not something I can really put on a resume, you know?

You can check my Tumblr or Twitter for updates. I'll be sure to let people know there when the next chapter is out
