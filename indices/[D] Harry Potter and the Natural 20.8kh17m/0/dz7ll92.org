  what would be the natural next thing to read, in terms of rational magic fiction?
#+end_quote

Two of the most popular fics on this sub right now, [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][Worth the Candle]], contain a great deal of rational magic (and, in the later case, RPG logic).

But, I mean, it's hard to find a rationalfic that /doesn't/.
