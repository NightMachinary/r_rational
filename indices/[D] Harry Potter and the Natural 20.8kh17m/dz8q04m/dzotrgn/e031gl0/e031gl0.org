Took a while for me to figure this out -- all of the relevant posts in the thread, ie. the actual story, will have a "threadmarks" link at the start and end of the post. That's their equivalent of "bookmarks to all posts in the thread by the original poster". You can read in a quasi-normal style by navigating to the next threadmark every time you finish reading from one post.
