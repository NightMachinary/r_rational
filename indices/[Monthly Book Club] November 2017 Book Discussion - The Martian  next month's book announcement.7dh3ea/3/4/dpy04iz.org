I really didn't care much for the movie. I feel like even though the tone is similar and the plot is pretty much a point for point rehash, that it actually differed substantially from the book in terms of where the interest lies. A lot of what I liked about the book was all the clever stuff he did with the oxygenator and such and the constant back of the envelope computations about food/oxygen/power left. I feel like the movie didn't have time to get into enough detail to really appreciate any of the clever ideas, which substantially changed what I considered to be the main source of enjoyment of the book.
