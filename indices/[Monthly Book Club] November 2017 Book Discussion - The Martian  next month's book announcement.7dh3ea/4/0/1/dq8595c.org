  why multivitamins over specific vitamins
#+end_quote

Mass, probably. You are going to need a little bit of everything, especially if the MREs aren't perfectly nutritious. And I think that NASA would be able to make vitamins tailored to the mission. As for the reason they're overstocked, keep in mind that a little extra for six people is a lot extra for one person. Although for the six crewmembers to have 3 years of vitamins on a one-month mission they would need to have 5 months extra each, which is weird.
