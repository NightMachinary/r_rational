The thing is, being on the surface for a month would not require any vitamin supplementation at all, realistically. That is, assuming they were planning on eating something vaguely resembling food.

They could even go without vitamin D supplements (which they'd definitely be supplementing on the Hermes) as their stores would be sufficient to last a month on Mars.

At the end of the day, he was on Mars for something like 2 years, which is so far beyond the ~30 day anticipated stay that the nutritional requirements are completely different. Like, as long as you have water, you can pretty much go 30 days without eating (OK, maybe not twice - but it's on the order of that). It's not about vitamins for 30 days, it's calories. So having vitamins on Mars is just.... makes no sense. Multivitamins as a whole aren't recommended by dieticians. Minerals can interfere with each other for absorption so if you do need a supplement they recommend you take each vitamin you need individually.

Like, I said to one of my professors, who is a dietician, "I need to take b12, and I also have started taking iron lately because my periods have been heavier. I always read multivitamins were just giving you expensive pee, but I can get three months' worth of multivitamins for $10, so it'll actually be cheaper for me too take a multi than to take an individual iron and b12 supplement. Should I take a multi in this instance?". She recommended that I take a high dose iron supplement every 2-3 days because iron and calcium (and I think magnesium) compete for the same absorption pathways, so any vitamin with both would mean I wasn't absorbing it fully. She also said that if I wasn't feeling any symptoms of iron deficiency then I probably didn't actually need to supplement it, many people are fine with low iron levels (my serum iron was too low to give blood). But anyway that was a bit of an aside but meant to say that multivitamins really aren't what professionals recommend.

I mean he has to have the vitamins because otherwise he dies and there's no story.
