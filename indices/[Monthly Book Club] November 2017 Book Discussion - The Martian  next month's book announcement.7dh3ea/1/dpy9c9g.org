On a reread I noticed a seemingly gaping plot hole, and I think it's too big, I must be missing something. I tried googling for it, but in a few places where it's mentioned responses are missing the point or offer handwaves that don't explain anything. I'm hoping [[/r/rational]] can point out what I'm missing.

So you remember when Mark was making water from hydrazine there was the hidden build up of hydrogen. And the story made a big dial how it could have exploded from the smallest spark or even too much static. But during the sols the buildup was happening Mark had an /open flame/ going inside the Hub doing the controlled burn. How come it didn't explode as soon as it reached the critical concentration? What do you think?
