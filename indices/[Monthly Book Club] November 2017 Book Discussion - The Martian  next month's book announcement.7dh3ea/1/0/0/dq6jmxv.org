  Even though my plan was to torture Mark, I knew from the very beginning that I didn't want my hero to suffer one unlikely, disastrous coincidence after the next. I decided that each problem Mark faced had to be a plausible consequence of his situation---or, better yet, an unintended consequence of his solution to a previous problem. He could suffer an equipment failure in machinery stretched beyond its intended use, but he couldn't be struck by lightning and then have a meteor crash on him.
