The thing is, making vitamins tailored to the mission would be vitamin D only, since all the rest are obtained from food. I don't think there are any uses for vitamins in terms of treating specific illnesses, but I don't think e.g. Folate is used to treat anything in particular.

Even if they did tailor the vitamins to what wasn't in the MREs, the MREs would have a more balanced nutritional profile than "organic martian-grown potatoes", and even if they didn't, they'd have a /different/ imbalance.

If they were concerned about mass they wouldn't do pills, I'd imagine they'd store the pure vitamins in powder form or something, since so much of a pill's mass is filler. It's confusing either way.

When I have time I should work out the symptoms and severity of chronic deficiency in all the above vitamins and see what happens. I think after 3 years of very little b12 he'd be having permenant nerve damage though. It does take a year or two for deficiency to be felt though as it's one of the few water soluble vitamins we store (in the liver), but by year 3 he'd be in big trouble. (Except B12 is in every multivitamin ever, so). But there'd be no reason for the crew to need b12 as the length of the journey wouldn't be enough for b12 deficiency, and the food would contact it. Then again, b12 malabsorption is very common, so the Hermes would probably be outfitted with a bunch of B12 syringes but they wouldn't need it on Mars itself.

In conclusion, I guess it's one big shrug?
