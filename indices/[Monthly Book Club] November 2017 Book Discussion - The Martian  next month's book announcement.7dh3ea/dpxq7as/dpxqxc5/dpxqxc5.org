I thought a lot of stuff was really convenient. I didn't feel like it was "cheating" or anything, but having Pathfinder be within roving distance, having usable potatoes (though they hang a lampshade on that), having Mark have a low resolution map of the entire planet, having a huge supply of multivitamins, etc.

Then again there was a lot of stuff that wasn't too convenient: he wasn't given a greenhouse as part of his "science project", Pathfinder dies, the maps aren't perfect, there's the dust storm, the extra oxygen when he's making water, etc.

A few things are gimmes like the evacuation-causing storm that couldn't actually exist on Mars (otherwise there's no story).

What did bug me is that ever since I read about "the science good and bad in the martian", they said that the radioactive heater thing is completely safe as long as he doesn't eat the pellets, so there's no reason for NASA to be so paranoid.

I'm a nutrition student so now I think about it the multivitamins bug me the most. Why would the crew have 3 years' worth of multivitamins? I could see the crew having a large supply of each individual vitamin, but not of multivitamin pills. You could see from a medical point of view the doctor needing to treat someone with big doses of iodine because they get thyroid issues, but you wouldn't want to give them big doses of OTHER vitamins at the same time. They'd definitely be taking Vitamin D tablets the entire time (in space, on mars, etc) due to the lack of UV light to make it in the body, but commercial multivitamins generally don't contain ~2000-4000 IU of D that you'd want if you were not getting supplements.

The potato diet would be deficient in omega 3 and omega 6 fats (which are essential), several amino acids (cystine especially - but he'd survive, so just more "starvation" I guess). He'd need to supplement B2, B12, Biotin, Folate, A(or carotene), D, E, and K; as well as Calcium (he could get away without it on Mars but it would probably do serious bone damage), Chromium, Fluoride, Iodine, Molybdenum, Selenium, Sodium (you need a minimum amount of sodium to live), Zinc.

I could see the HAB having a big thing of oil (though 3 years worth? not sure) and salt. I'm kind of interested to look up the severity of, say, Molybdenum deficiency to see if it's the sort of thing that would kill him or just contribute to his overall feeling of being starved. By the end he is not supplementing with many MREs at all, so I guess all I can really say is he was probably really starving by the end of it, which is not exactly a hot take.
