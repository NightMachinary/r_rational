While the movie does alot of things well, there are some inconsistencies (the spaceship (Artemis?) had to be spaceshippy, of course) I can overlook as falling to the wayside in adapting the story to a different medium.

What I truly, sorely missed was the desolation and solitude. Maybe I'm over-interpreting things here, but Whatney's abject aloneness on that rusty planet was something that shone through the cracks in the book, but not so much in the movie. Admittedly, I only saw the movie once and read the book twice, so I may have been imagining things, but the way I see it Whatney kept madness only barely at bay. He keeps watching and rewatching old tv shows, listens to that damn disco, and so on, but the isolation gnaws at him.

That didn't come through in the movie. I wished they'd have added one, two scenes where he's just outside, staring into the empty red plains before him, and struggles to not give in to this.
