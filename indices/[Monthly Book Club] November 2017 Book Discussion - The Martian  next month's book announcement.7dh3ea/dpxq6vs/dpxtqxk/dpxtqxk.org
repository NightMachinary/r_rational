I thought the movie was a great adaptation; it had the same general "feel" to me as the book did, which is my biggest criteria for adaptations. People often look at adaptations and ask "what is different", meaning at the actual objective level, while ignoring the spirit of the work (because that's much harder to judge). The movie keeps the spirit, in my view, and that's what I consider important. Yes, they changed some things, especially right at the end to punch it up, but I consider that fairly minor in the context of the rest of the film.
