I think /The Hatchet/ does that well in a way, because in a sequel, he ends up having to face winter with its own new set of challenges. It raises the tension without feeling like an asspull because we all know that winter is a thing that happens.

The rover capsizing is another example of that, I guess: it all seems hunky dory and we need more tension.

Not that any of the issues that arise in the story feel like asspulls, of course. Just that there's an asspull scale, and "winter happens" is lower than "it turns out HAB canvas isn't perfect".
