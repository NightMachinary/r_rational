I think first and foremost, people are willing to deal with a lot more exposition than they're usually given credit for, even when that exposition is delivered /as/ exposition and without much in the way of framing.

The other big thing I took from it is that if you're writing a "survival" story, the tension has a tendency to get lower over time. In the beginning, you're dealing with the things that can kill you in a few hours, then the things that will kill you in a few days, and eventually the things that will kill you in weeks or even months, or which won't kill you /at all/.

Up until the hab explodes, that's the general trajectory of /The Martian/; things get less and less urgent with every problem that gets solved. I would actually argue that from a Doyalist perspective, that's /why/ the hab explodes, because without that, there's just not enough drama in the story. Something needed to happen to shake things up, and the explosion was that thing.

Generally speaking, I would consider that one of the challenges of this variety of Man vs Nature story, and by extension, a few other types of stories as well, where there's a natural decrease in the tension that needs to be addressed with some counteracting force within the story.
