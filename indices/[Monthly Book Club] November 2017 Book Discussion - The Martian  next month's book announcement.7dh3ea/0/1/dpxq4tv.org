I asked this question because it's the first time I read The Martian (I think I've read it 5 times now) since I started writing my probably-never-to-see-the-light-of-day same-sex supernatural romance novel. And I can see the nuts and bolts of the story more: like, I always worried about transitioning between different scenes, that it would be jarring or something, but this book and no doubt countless others do the exact same thing and as long as the reader doesn't feel there was anything else to say in the scene then they're good.

Also, the book has some "weird" departures: before the HAB explodes there's a weirdly detached piece of writing from the point of view of part of the HAB canvas as it goes through manufacture and testing. Rather than being "weird" in a bad way, it's weird in a good way. My own story has a weird departure in it that I hope will also be weird in a good way if anyone ever reads it. (My husband actually said he really enjoyed it and said it was similar to something that happened in Homestuck, and gave me pointers on ways to make it feel /more/ different to the rest of the story for emphasis).

Anyway it made me feel better about my writing, is about all I'm trying to say here :)
