I posted [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/eoakbn/worm_by_wildbow_spoilers_understanding_dragon_and/feca3co/][this in the Dragon thread]], but it's too eloquent of a piece for an offhanded mention.

In honor of fixing broken systems, anyone have some recommendations for the best examples in fiction?
