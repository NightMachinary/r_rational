Since you need me to spell it out, let's look to the subreddit sidebar and go over why -on the meta level- an article on ice cream is not the same as an article on fixing systems when it comes to this sub:

#+begin_quote
  Focus on intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of their knowledge and resources.
#+end_quote

Characters in rational fiction are often trying to work past a hostile or what they perceive as an inadequate system. If they want to fix it (which they often do), they creatively apply their knowledge and resources and try out (different) solutions. In fiction (and much more in real life), it's hard to say whether any one solution is correct or effective. Also, like this blog, fiction has a very heavy bias for the human element (though fiction in general also has a propensity for radical revolution). And guess what, the blog discusses a lot of potential options in an iterative fashion. Speaking for myself, I'd find it more rational if a ratfic showed itself aware of these systems dynamics and social structures, regardless of whether they deem it viable in the story.

And what was that about ice cream? Your turn.

#+begin_quote
  It is, separately, a load of horseshit, on the level of bad self-help books in its total ignorance of its uselessness.
#+end_quote

When you unironically say lines like this, are you an armchair specialist or an actual expert? Sometimes I find it hard to tell on Reddit where people spout with the conviction of holding multiple doctorates on the subject.

To everyone else, I know I'm feeding the troll but sometimes I'm optimistic.
