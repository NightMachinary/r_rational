  Then a word of warning to that change starts with you - i.e. act instead of whining.

This specific argument and variants of it are particularly annoying to me.. Who do you think is braver ? The one that takes a beating quietly and never complains or the one who fights back ?

Who do you think is braver, the ones that get beaten by the system and take it quietly? Or the ones that fight it with whatever means they have, be it complaining, protesting, rebelling ?

Is it the person willing to lose his life for sticking his head out to try to make things better for everyone else or the one quietly taking it with no complaint ?

I know which are brave and which are cowards, and they aren't the ones people that don't like change love saying are stronger. Maybe because those are the ones that pose no threat to them..
