#+begin_quote
  I know which are brave and which are cowards, and they aren't the ones people that don't like change love saying are stronger.
#+end_quote

I can't make heads or tails of this sentence, but I got the gist and I don't think the blog frames it as bravery vs. cowardice. It sounds like it's a spin of Gandhi's famous quote "Be the change you want to see in the world." It's not a dichotomy where you're either sacrificing yourself or being passive: my interpretation is that he's a behaviorist. If one type of response doesn't change the environment (system), then try another.
