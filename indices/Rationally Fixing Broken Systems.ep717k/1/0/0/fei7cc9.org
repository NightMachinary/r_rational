My reaction was more negative than it just wasn't insightful. It is self-contradictory, actively harmful in the information it presents due to how shallow and generally poorly framed it is, (nearly all of its links are to other blogs that are mostly click bait "7 ways you can increase your will power" "10 ways white people are more racist than they realize" "Why we resist change, and what leaders can do about it", "How To Use 10 Psychological Theories To Persuade People" etc) and gives terrible advice for a rationalist (i.e. "ask forgiveness, not permission.").

I found it to largely be the opposite of what you found it to be. What within it did you find insightful or eloquent?
