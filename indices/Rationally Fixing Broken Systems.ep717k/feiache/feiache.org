I found some points in this interesting but I don't think that it provides anything extraordinarily insightful that hasn't been better put elsewhere. Additionally there are several points that I don't necessarily agree with. For example, that people don't support movements that benefit them directly. The article didn't seem to address the fact that many people do support movement that are primarily about fighting for groups of people other than their own and that people can benefit socially from being seen to support a movement even if they don't care about it personally. The article seems to greatly oversimplify the problem of social change as well as the number of agents involved in it. Here's a vastly better article on a similar topic for anyone who is interested though [[https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/]]
