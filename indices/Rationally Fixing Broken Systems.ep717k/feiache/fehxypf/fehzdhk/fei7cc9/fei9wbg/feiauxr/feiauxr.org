- It explains his reasoning on why systems are resistant to change.

- He breaks down a system into parts supported by systems theory: input (humans), processes, output (results).

- The human element is further split into a quandary often brought up here: logical vs. emotional motivations (sadly he doesn't really explore the conflict).

- He points to the biases for the status quo and asserts that it's at least partially due to perception of systems as a zero sum game.

- He gives two reasons why radical revolution (or moralizing) would be ineffective.

- He gives tactics for more effectively changing the minds of calcified thinkers (supporters of the status quo).

- Presents alternative options for changing a stubborn system: join it to change from within, beat it, or subvert/exploit it.

- Then a word of warning to that change starts with you - i.e. act instead of whining.

- And a last ditch option: show results because that's what meritocratic systems thrive on.

There's nothing anti-rationalist about "ask forgiveness, not permission" - read in another way as "sometimes it's better to take the first step, then see where you're at".

Alright, now seriously, why is the burden of validation on me, and both you and [[/u/VorpalAuroch]] can use judgemental language without the least support? ("not particularly insightful, self-contradictory, actively harmful, shallow, poorly framed, terrible advice")

Besides your accusation of its sources, which I admit some links were questionable, what about it was exactly:

1. self-contradictory

2. actively harmful in the info it presents

3. shallow

4. poorly framed

5. terrible advice

Sorry for any pressure, but low effort put-downs have really been getting on my nerve lately.
