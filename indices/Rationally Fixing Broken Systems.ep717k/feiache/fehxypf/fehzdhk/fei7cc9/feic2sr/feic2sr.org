Characters in fiction often eat ice cream. "Rationally eating ice cream" is still off-topic.

Everything in this is an extremely surface-level, cursory analysis of social systems and change, and ignores basically everything about how systems are /actually/ changed in practice. There's approximately one piece of advice in it which is any good, which is "make a better system in parallel", which everyone already knows because that is the Silicon Valley approach. It doesn't even talk about the drawbacks of that advice, which is, as you can see from Silicon Valley, that even if your alternative is better you will probably fail. (E.g.
