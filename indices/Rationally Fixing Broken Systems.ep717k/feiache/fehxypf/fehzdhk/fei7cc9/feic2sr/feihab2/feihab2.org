That's an inappropriate analogy and you should know it.

There's no doubt it's a surface-level, oversimplified analysis of systems. You can't in good conscience finish the sentence "ignores basically everything about how systems are /actually/ changed in practice" without citing decades of academia and historical meta-analysis. Forget surface-level, this blog and your linked article combined don't even scratch the surface of modeling systems and failure states.

As for why I shared this and not another article from the depths of slatestarcodex or lesswrong with a high vernacular threshold is simple: between EY's meditations and the OP blog, which would you select to inform the average person of the complexities plaguing systems change?
