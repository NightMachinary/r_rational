You keep trying to "prove" me wrong by asserting you're right, using one technique: repeating "you're wrong" and "this is garbage / you're a moron" in different permutations ad nauseam. I've engaged in reasoned discussion about what these alleged flaws are in the blog but you seem pathologically incapable of reasoning through a /single/ criticism. FYI linking an article and mentioning something that the blog fails to mention don't constitute a refutation. At all stages, I've been explicitly open to arguments that the blog is wrong (see questions above), but you've been exceptionally resistant to rational discussion.

Funny you should dig through my history to shore up your arguments and try, again, to put me down. Ironic question: do you know who that thread about low effort negativity applies to?
