FWIW, I think the strength of the negative feedback on this post is due to the effect Eliezer mentioned recently, where people who have the strongest responses are most likely to act upon them (vote and comment).

My own opinions on the post:\\
Content-wise, I thought it had useful things to say, but also got annoyed at how little some of the statements were explained or expanded upon.\\
Style-wise, it started strong, but didn't seem to provide a good structure further in. If I was going to make a similar article for a general audience, I would write something shorter or choose to make a strong throughline (eg. taking a broken system and exploring different ways of trying to fix it, showing if and how they fail).

Overall: Not terrible, but if I was looking for something to share to a general audience, I'd hope there's a well-edited youtube video that explains the same.
