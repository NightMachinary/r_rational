I'm not saying it's holy writ to follow if one wants to change a system, nor am I claiming it's a pioneer of any of its ideas. No solutions are foolproof and disagreement-proof. It definitely doesn't account for your cases of people supporting social change - though I've also read some cynical pieces on how much people at large are really invested in a fight for outgroups (beyond a token nod). I also agree that it's substantially oversimplified (but that's true of any issue as large as this). I haven't read your linked article yet, but a glance at it shows it's not nearly as approachable to a general audience.
