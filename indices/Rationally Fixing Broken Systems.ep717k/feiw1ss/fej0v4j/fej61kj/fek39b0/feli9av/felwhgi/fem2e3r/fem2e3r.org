Well, I've made 100% more statements of value than you have, because I've made some. You've just waffled about how it has points despite not actually attempting to justify the correctness of any of those points. Even just reading your statements /in defense of it/, the case that the article is useless garbage is quite clear. That you haven't realized this yourself means you're either a moron or totally unwilling to change your mind.

EDIT: Looking at your recent post history, it looks like recommending low-quality material to audiences with more discernment than you, and then getting condescendingly defensive about your shitty recommendation, is a habit for you. So if I wasn't sure you were wrong before, I sure am now.
