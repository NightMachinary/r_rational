Aren't you embarrassed by your hypocrisy or by proving me right when I alleged your pettiness? You've sunk to name calling and take your own correctness as axiomatic, when in fact you've offered barely more than patronizing, low effort comments (besides your one mention of drawbacks and link to another essay). Seriously, go through the thread and do an objective count of how many belitting adjectives you use versus statements of value (reasoning, non-judgemental analysis of faults). Then compare it to my contributions - that's a rather insightful disparity, yeah?

I enjoy learning experiences that change my mind, so why don't you change it? Oh wait, that would require effort on your part, which seems unlikely based on your current track record.

To be fair, I'm petty as well. Otherwise I wouldn't have continued engaging when I already knew the type of responses I'd get.
