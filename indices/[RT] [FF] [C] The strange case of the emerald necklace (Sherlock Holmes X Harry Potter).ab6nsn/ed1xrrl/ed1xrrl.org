This was wonderful. I've always loved it when stories explored just how terrifying HP universe must be for muggles, and this fic fit the bill perfectly. I've also always loved it when fics truly explored how truly scary mind magic, as portrayed in canon, actually is. Rowling created a world where anybody and everybody with a wand could drug you (Confundus), roofie you (Obliviate) or completely enslave you (Imperius), and there's basically nothing you can do about it, even if your wizard, except exercise constant, never ending vigilance. Canon doesn't provide any wearable shields that block such spells, or anyway such spells can even be detected (since if there was a way to detect mind magic like that, I'm pretty sure Gringotts would have it). And given how Malfoy and rest of the Death Eaters, after the first war, claimed that they were innocent because Voldemort had Imperiused them, apparently its possible to be under the Imperius curse, and for no one around you to even notice (because I guess your captor ordered you to 'act normal')! And of course, all of this is even worse for muggles, because they both have no idea any of this is possible, and even less ability to defend themselves.

Rowling created a setting that should, by all rights, be a hell state of paranoia and terror, and yet isn't, and I haven't even gotten into the sheer, bottomless moral abyss that commercially sold love potions are. You can't drink anything without risking getting mind whammied. You can't be alone with anyone without risking being turned into their eternal slave. You can't come back from being alone with anyone without being certain they didn't do unspeakable things to you and then mind wipe you. Any brief moment of confusion of stupor could be natural, or it could be someone confunding you in oder to make you vulnerable to more mind magic (since if resisting the Imperius is a matter of will, being confunded beforehand probably makes that a lot harder); and the list goes on and on. Rowling created a wonderful, whimsical world, but honestly I don't think she really considered if it was one normal people and society could actually function in.

In America we can't even handle guns being readily accessible without having to deal with school shootings. Could you imagine what would really happen, if instead we gave every kid all powerful mega-tools, taught them all the incantations for morally terrifying mind magic just as puberty was hitting full steam (I think Harry and the others learn the incantation for Imperio at around 13), and then locked them all in a boarding school together?

Anyways, this was a wonderful, wonderful piece of fiction, and your writing skills are excellent :)
