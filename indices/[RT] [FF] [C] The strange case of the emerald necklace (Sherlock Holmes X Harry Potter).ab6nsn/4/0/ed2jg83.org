Thanks :). I love the appreciation!

With regards to mind magic, yeah, I get the impression that while trying to keep herself out of narrative trouble by not inventing too many counters for it (which would have made her job harder) JKR actually dug herself way too deep and made a setting that's unworkable. Mad Eye Moody is way too right to be so paranoid. Would have made more sense if Imperiused people could be detected, or Imperius could be shielded. Though there's always the counter Harry uses in Significant Digits, namely [[#s][SD spoilers]].

As for the curse itself, HP & co. see it from fake!Moody in year 4, so I think they were 14. But they only learn the incantation: doesn't mean they necessarily learn the /spell/. Avada Kedavra for example needs hate to be cast, and controlling one's emotion at a command seems a complex skill. It's possible that Imperius requires a will to command or something like that? Still, probably ridiculously easy for such a broken ability (in fact, far more broken and dangerous than either the Cruciatus or the Killing Curse, both of which whose effects could at least be approximated with mundane, non-magical methods).
