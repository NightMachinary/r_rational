I wasn't sure about posting this here, since I did not write it strictly with the idea of making it rational, and Sherlock Holmes on his own isn't considered very rational as a character (what with his wildly inaccurate use of the term 'deduction' to actually mean INDUCTION, and often extremely speculative induction at that!). But in the end I decided to put it up since it still features some munchkinry and the notion of precommitment, so I thought it could be a fun read for this sub.

By the way, for anyone who's following The Optimised Wish Project... I'm working on that, but the Christmas holidays slowed down progress a bit both for me and my beta reader. New year will come with new chapters!
