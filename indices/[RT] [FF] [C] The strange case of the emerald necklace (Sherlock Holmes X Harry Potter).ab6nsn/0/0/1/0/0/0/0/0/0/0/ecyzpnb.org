Hm, fair, but he said that as a condition to let him go, and they didn't. He then got free because he ordered Holmes to back down, and Holmes immediately tried to grab him again. While certainly excessive, it was defense of sorts, and the offer of no harm was null and void. But agree that it /could/ kill Holmes by accident (though I assume a certain experience about how Cruciatus works means an expert user, like an expert torturer, would know how to limit oneself).

Anyway him not being exactly a nice fellow is part of the point, but it must also be said they don't really have a choice about trusting him or not. They're completely at his mercy.
