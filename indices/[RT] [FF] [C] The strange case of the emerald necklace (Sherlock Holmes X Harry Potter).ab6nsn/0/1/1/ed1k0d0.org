My choice went to the Unforgivables more for added horror effect - and because I imagined Cornelius here wanted to put some serious fear in his opponents, so that they would understand they were outmatched. But if we're talking detective work, I'd say everything that can extract information (Legilimency, Veritaserum) or alter it (Obliviation, Memory Charms, Polyjuice, animagi, Detection Charms, transfiguration in general), alter behaviour (Imperius, love potions), grant access inside otherwise locked/restricted areas (apparition, portkeys), hide (disillusionment, invisibility cloaks), and obviously kill in otherwise undetectable or unrecognizable way (Killing Curse and who knows how many magical poisons and potions). Heck, give your whole team of thieves a vial of Felix Felicis each and watch them rob the heck out of Fort Knox without firing a single shot, just because all guards will /happen/ to be looking another way when they pass. Slughorn's Eleven could be a thing, but not a very long or exciting one.

Really, magic just utterly and completely /breaks/ all assumptions a detective relies on if investigating a crime. And without other magic to protect you against it, it's basically impossible to prevent a crime or identifying the culprit if they're using it. Gringotts is safe because they have anti-apparition wards, the Thief's Downfall and all their other wards, but a normal muggle bank is completely defenseless. Even here, I made it clear the problem was that the Malfoys were worried about /other/ wizards sniffing something. If it was just muggles, they had a gajillion ways to kill Artemisia that would have been utterly undetectable.
