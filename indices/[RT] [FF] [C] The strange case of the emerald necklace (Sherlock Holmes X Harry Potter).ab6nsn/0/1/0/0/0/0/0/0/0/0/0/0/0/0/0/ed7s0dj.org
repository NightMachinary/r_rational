The Feynman lectures are a great read! But they're an outright textbook, so they're going to go through a lot of maths and stuff. Still, I like a lot the writing style, it's clear and the arguments are presented in an interesting order, flowing logically from one to the other.

If physics aren't your job of course it's kinda hard to justify that much time investment, unless you're really into it. I can tell you being a physicist myself I've /tried/ learning some quantum field theory (outside my usual field of work) but I hardly can find time to commit to memory more than the basics. I don't feel much like doing exercises like an undergrad, which I'd have to to really learn it, but that's also a side effect of me already doing physics work during my daily routine. Perhaps it'd be different if I had an unrelated job, and it'd feel like a change of pace.
