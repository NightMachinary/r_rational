My comment was originally about how "you can take Action A which would not lead to a stable time loop, as long as the full sequence of your actions do lead to a stable time loop." That said...

There are a number of ways things could work.

0) Time travel is impossible, or costs lots of energy, or no one gets around to it. Boring, but consistent.

1) People go back in time, and their actions have effects. But where those effects touch on their younger selves, this leads to more effects....

1a) And then you end up with self-consistent histories after enough iteration. Time travel allows you to solve most problems via brute force - but the consequences and moral implications aren't immediately clear unless you know what time travel actually does. Does it really "change" the past? Or does it create more universes? Biohazards may be a problem.

1b) No Self-consistency. (Maybe all "loops" are guaranteed to terminate, but no one has actually tried to make this /not/ happen.)

2) Everything works out being consistent in *one* go through. This might make life...unpredictable. The nature of cause and effect may be unclear at times.

3) The universe fixes things. If you break too many things you might be erased - possibly including everything you've ever done. Or maybe you'll just die of a heart attack before traveling back in time.

4) Inconsistencies can be created, leading to timeline erasure. This doesn't destroy the universe, but you might not remember the way things used to be. It's can be a tricky process though.

*How people figure out which one is correct for their universe is unclear.*
