It's funny you mention the mythos, because I feel like there's just a touch of Lovecraft in the ending to this story. Forbidden knowledge reluctantly revealed as a warning by men trying to forget and Watson left with a lifelong paranoia, coupled with the verbose prose of the period, make me think of one of his protagonists.
