Oh, because Lestrade/Lestrange. I wonder how is it that there are so many pureblood wizards with French names... guess they're all descendants from that William the Conqueror group (the Malfoys are canon as such). This actually reminds me, what would be /really/ awesome is some alternate history of the wizarding world. Just like we know Grindenwald was the wizard side of WW2... what was it like during the Hundred Years War? Or the War of the Two Roses? Who were the first wizards that went to America? And so on. There's a lot of potential material, especially if you're a big enough history geek that you can tie together all these events in a clever way.
