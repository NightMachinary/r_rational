Crucio would be pretty good evidence, but if one was going to torture them anyway, what is the point of being civil and trying to convince them in other ways? If you go evil, go all the way. But he says he is trying to become a good man and now that I think of it, he is not doing a very good job there.

Gun moving around could be just tricks with strings.

The guy could even have wiped their memories and walked and planted the string, then moved back and pretended to cast a spell.

Watson could as well have been hypnotized to just throw the weapon when he gives a certain command. Both plausible explanations with what has been demonstrated before.

  the muggle world IS our world in HP, with the wizards hidden

All of the "magical beasts" and monsters and plants exist there too. There is no way magical plants exist only in places muggles don't go to. There can't be enough wizards to mess with everyone's head either. The wizards are not the only difference, basically all the folklore is true, yet hidden, and thus why wouldn't hypnosis be too?

EDIT: He actually swore he wouldn't harm them and then he crucioed Holmes. He clearly can't be trusted in any way.
