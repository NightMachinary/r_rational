there's quite a far cry between "not completely rational and stressed" and "intentionally inflicts the worst torture imaginable on a relative stranger."

I think the 3 unforgivable curses were all placed in by the author for thematic reasons, not because the character would actually do those things to prove their wizardhood. The dog feels much like a strange deus-ex or non sequitur as well. I think the story would be improved by dropping those bits and having some less antagonistic proofs.
