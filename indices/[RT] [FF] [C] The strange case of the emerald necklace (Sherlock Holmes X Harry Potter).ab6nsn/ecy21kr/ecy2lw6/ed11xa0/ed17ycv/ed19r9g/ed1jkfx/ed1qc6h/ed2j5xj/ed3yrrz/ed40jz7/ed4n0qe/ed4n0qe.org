I think "how time travel naturally works" is dependent on "how time travel works".

I believe things are portrayed that way because it is 1) simple*, and 2) surprising - a horrible series of events occurred, and then was averted - all without changing what happened from the perspective of their younger selves.

*(I hear physics finds this important.) Many a story grows a thousand gaping plot holes with the advent of time travel.

The only problem I can find with that idea of time travel in HP canon comes from "book 8"** -if the past cannot be changed, then they have nothing to fear from a villain with a time turner..., or anyone for that matter. Which just goes to show,... that how time travel works in the show is however the scriptwriters/etc. wants it to work, for the current plot, which isn't too surprising when you think about what kind of fiction she writes.

**Which is a bit dark when you think about it.
