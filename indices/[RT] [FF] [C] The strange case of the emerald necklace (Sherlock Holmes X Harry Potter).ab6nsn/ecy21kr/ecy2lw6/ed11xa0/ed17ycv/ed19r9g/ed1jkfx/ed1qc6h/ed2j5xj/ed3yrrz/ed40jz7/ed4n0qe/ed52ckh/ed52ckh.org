Ah, I haven't read "Cursed Child", but always got the impression most people found it rather disappointing and possibly canon-breaking. In "Prisoner of Azkaban" however it really seems a stable time loop: there's occurrences of inverted causality or causality loops as for example Harry realises he can summon a Patronus /because he realises he saw himself summoning a Patronus/.

  I think "how time travel naturally works" is dependent on "how time travel works".

Not really: time travel would not be an independent mechanic, free from shackles from everything else. It would be a part of general relativity, and would work in the context of general relativity, and would also have to be consistent with all other laws of nature. So unless multiverse theory IS real (interesting question) and time travel moves you to a different branch of the universal wavefunction, then I'd expect stable time loops to form, the way in which in a spatial loop you'd have all field solutions be standing waves. Time and space are after all two sides of the same coin.
