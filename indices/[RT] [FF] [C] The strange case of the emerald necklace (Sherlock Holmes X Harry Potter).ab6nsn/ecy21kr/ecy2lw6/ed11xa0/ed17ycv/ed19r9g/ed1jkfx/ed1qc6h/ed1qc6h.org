I'm saying "what seems like it wouldn't be a stable time loop" can easily be made so, if you are able to a) conjure suitable illusions, b) change the memories of all involved, c) bribe the witnesses to lie, or d) have enough people to impersonate them via Polyjuice Potion after knocking them out and stashing them somewhere.

Additionally, in Prisoner of Askaban, a stable time loop was /demonstrated/. How that world handles unstable time loops still isn't clear - everyone avoided doing that, and nothing accidentally happened in that vein.
