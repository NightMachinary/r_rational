You're right about the Killing Curse, but he also used the Imperius on Watson before that. And meanwhile they're seeing all these bolts of light flying around. Really, the Expelliarmus /alone/ should be grounds enough to realise either something really is going on, or you've been hypnotised so thoroughly you have no contact with reality any more and thus no empirical evidence will ever be enough (and this, in itself, would be magic, since hypnotism doesn't work that way).
