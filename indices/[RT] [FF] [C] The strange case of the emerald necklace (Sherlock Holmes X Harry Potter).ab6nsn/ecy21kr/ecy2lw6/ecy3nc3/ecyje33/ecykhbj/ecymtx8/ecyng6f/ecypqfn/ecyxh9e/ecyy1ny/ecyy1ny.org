  Take that issue with JKR, it's a clear plot hole in her setting.

Yes, but you said it's just the wizards that's the difference, when it's actually a lot more. Like even astrology would be real, even though muggles would probably still do it all wrong. edit: not that I really need to argue about this, just responded to a thing you said

  He took an Unbreakable Vow that he would not kill them. Said nothing about harming, and a short Cruciatus, however painful, only causes temporary suffering, not long lasting harm.

  "I swear I will not harm you or your friend..."

He swore to /them/ he would not harm them. Holmes could as well just drop down and hit his head and die, so technically the wizard is risking a lot here. I'd disagree with the pain and harm here, but it's a /lot/ of pain, no matter how short. Harm is really too wide thing to promise, but as magic is probably intent based, it could be ok. edit: Uhh yea that one was not unbreakable one, but yea still a liar. You would really expect to not get tortured when someone promises to not harm you. Mixed it up as you started talking about the unbreakable one.
