Well, my assumption was that talking about 'hypnotism' they're talking about the same thing, since muggles can't do magic and basically the muggle world IS our world in HP, with the wizards hidden. Agree on the preparation, but my point about hallucinations is that if he doesn't believe the Imperius can cause them, then he needs to justify the Crucio and seeing the gun fly from Watson's hand - twice.

Admittedly, it's not the strongest possible evidence. But the room for deception had considerably shrunk at that point.
