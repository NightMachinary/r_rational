If Holmes doesn't believe on himself being imperiused, there is no way he'd believe when Watson gets imperiused. After all, he too could have been hypnotized earlier as well. The fact that hypnotism does not work that way doesn't necessarily mean that it's more probable that he should think there is actual magic rather than himself being wrong about how hypnotism works. It's not our world, it's a world where magic is a thing, so hypnotism could very well potentially work in any way instead of the way it works in our world, so facts about hypnotism are a bit weak argument.

Magicians can throw around sparks and fireballs and move objects around. That they don't, in the moment of action, notice how the trick is done, does not mean it's not just a trick. Magicians get fooled by other magicians all the time. They also arrived into a place where the wizard could have done any kind of preparations.

He has no reason to believe hypnotism/imperius would cause hallucinations, especially completely controlled ones. He has only experienced loss of memory and having to follow orders.

I'm just saying that not all magics are equal to convincing people about it existing. Doing stuff to a person, like levitating him, transforming him into a frog, making him puke slugs, transforming his clothing, etc would be way more convincing than killing a dog in a way that would need autopsy to figure out if there was a trick.
