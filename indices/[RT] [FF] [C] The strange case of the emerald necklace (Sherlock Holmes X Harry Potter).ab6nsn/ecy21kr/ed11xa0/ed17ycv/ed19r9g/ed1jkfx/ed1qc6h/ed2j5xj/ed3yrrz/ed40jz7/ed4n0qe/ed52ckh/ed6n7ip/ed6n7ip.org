  possibly canon-breaking. In "Prisoner of Azkaban" however it really seems a stable time loop
#+end_quote

Yes. If one takes 8 as canon, then time loops are still possible, but it's less immediately obvious that the past cannot be changed.

#+begin_quote
  Not really: time travel would not be an independent mechanic, free from shackles from everything else. It would be a part of general relativity,
#+end_quote

That was what I meant. (In HP, Time Turners are "magic", but what "traveling back in time" means, depends on "how the universe/multiverse works".)

#+begin_quote
  Time and space are after all two sides of the same coin.
#+end_quote

And yet, while I can walk backwards and forwards as easily as right and left, and with more difficulty, go up and down, and with enough resources, reach the moon, I have yet to travel a second back in time.
