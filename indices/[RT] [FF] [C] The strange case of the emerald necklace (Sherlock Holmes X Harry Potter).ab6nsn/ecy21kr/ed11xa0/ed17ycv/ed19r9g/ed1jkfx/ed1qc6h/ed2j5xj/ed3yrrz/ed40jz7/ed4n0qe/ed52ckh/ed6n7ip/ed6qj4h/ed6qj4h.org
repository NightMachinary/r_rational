  And yet, while I can walk backwards and forwards as easily as right and left, and with more difficulty, go up and down, and with enough resources, reach the moon, I have yet to travel a second back in time.

Well, they are /two/ faces... not literally /the same/ face. You're locked in a specific direction because in relativity the signature of spacetime is +++-, meaning you can't go faster than light, and thus can't "turn around" and go backwards in time. In a world with signature ++++ (such as the one Greg Egan describes in his "Orthogonal" books) you could go back in time simply by going fast enough. However, General Relativity /does/ have some solutions that travel back in time. We don't know if they're possible (we tend to think they're not and there's some law that forbids them, it just sounds more sensible that way), but if they were, then they'd be basically stable time loops. The one thing that could change this is integration with quantum mechanics, something we still don't have or understand fully.
