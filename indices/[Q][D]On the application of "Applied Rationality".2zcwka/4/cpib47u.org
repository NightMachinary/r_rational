This sounds cool and interesting, and I wish you the best of luck. It might be worth checking out [[/r/lesswrong]], which is a subreddit related to the Less Wrong rationalist community. Other places to check out include the comments section of the blog [[http://slatestarcodex.com/][Slate Star Codex]].

[[/r/rational]], despite the name, is actually a subreddit devoted to rational and rationalist fiction (and fanfiction). You'll certainly find people in [[/r/rational]] interested in what you're doing here-- many will share your interests. Hopefully in this thread and at the communities I linked you find what you're looking for.

All that being said, I will be downvoting this post to reduce its visibility on this subreddit. I wish to discourage divergence from the core goal of [[/r/rational][r/rational]] , even when I think the thread is good, like this one is.
