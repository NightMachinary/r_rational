The idea reminds me of how the US Founders kept a record of the proceedings of their meetings - the minutes is what I think they were called, and they intended to be available for review in later meetings, if not beyond. Also, a person to neutrally govern the proceedings was elected at the start of everything, and was called the Chairman. So there's some historical precedence for certain of your ideas in a real-time, debate-centric environment, in which some impressive decisions were made.

Now am I thinking of the Constitutional Convention, or of the meetings that gave rise to the Declaration? It's been a while since those delightful history classes.
