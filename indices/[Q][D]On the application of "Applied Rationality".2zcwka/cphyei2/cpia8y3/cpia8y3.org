Awesome idea. I imagine that such a rendering of the arguments would make it easier to follow the debate, compared to my list form.

You gave me a vision of people referring to past debate logs in the way court systems refer to previous case rulings.

"As has been concluded by /Josh v. Gerald, 2016, reddit/, calling someone Genghis Khan is analogous to Godwin's Law. I bring this as support to my claim that the referring to me as Kim Il Sung, another historical dictator, is also in violation of Godwin's Law."

Indeed, it's quite dry, and having a neutral third party seems required no matter what. But I'm hoping it's a cool little way to practice logic and rationality.

PS. I'm pretty sure a lot of what you said went over my head. Thanks for the comment, and sorry for anything I've missed!
