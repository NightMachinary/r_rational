I'm pretty confused by this link. I thought it was going to be a proof of concept via translation of a presidential debate, but it's all x's, y's, z's, etc. I'll bet it helped you solidify your thoughts/processes, but without more explanation (in several places) I'm not hopeful to get much out of it. Was it intended as a proof of concept?
