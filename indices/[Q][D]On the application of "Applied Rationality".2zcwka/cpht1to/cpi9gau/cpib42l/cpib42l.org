So I talk to a friend about how unfair it is that the Chancellor of my university is making $400k a year, plus benefits.

He says that's the wage determined by how much people are willing to work for. I shrug, feel vaguely uneasy about that, and don't change my mind.

A week later, I realize that I felt uneasy because no, the wage isn't just what people are willing to work for, it's lessened when lots of people want the job, and the chancellor position is one of the most prestigious in the country. Are intelligent people willing to work for less than $400k?

If, during that week, the debate closes, my point never gets brought up, and neither myself nor my friend changes their mind.
