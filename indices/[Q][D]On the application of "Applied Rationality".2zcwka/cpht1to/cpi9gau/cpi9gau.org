Great idea with translating a debate. You comment actually just reminded me that the inception of this idea came during the presidential debates. Real-time update of such a debate log by fact checkers could work to reign the debates back from being sophist popularity contests. I'll start working on it.

I'm having trouble understanding the second part. Could you perhaps clarify with an example?

Cheers, thanks for the comment.
