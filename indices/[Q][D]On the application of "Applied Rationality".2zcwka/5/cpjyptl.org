A quick look at a few of the references others have mentioned gave me a sense of the importance of including the basics in your schema, such as: descriptions, related assumptions, and discussions of relevance/significance for points and supporting/counter points.

If you don't mind flash games, I recommend taking [[http://socratesjones.com/game.html][Socrates Jones: Pro Philosopher]] (a creative little introduction to philosophy) as an example of a basic system for offering meaningful choices in a debate. The character has these choices:

- Ask for Clarification

- Question Relevance

- Press for Backing

- Challenge with a Counterstatement

The game focuses on proving the opponent wrong, which makes for an interesting game but isn't usual ideal otherwise. The choice framework I listed above should be adapted to a descriptive/explorative purpose and a multiple-PC setting:

- Add/request further clarification/references/links

- Confirm/question relevance

- Offer/request supporting evidence

- Offer/request evidence to the contrary
