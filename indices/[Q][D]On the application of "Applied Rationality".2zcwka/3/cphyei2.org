I had a similar idea, for a graph-theoretic representation of argumentation to canonize arguments for and against certain positions. The idea would be to take all of the replicated work done across internet arguments (objections and refutations, noting fallacies, etc). Whatever website hosted it would need to be easy to reference, and it could be used as a source of arguments, evidence, and beliefs.

Of course, the point behind internet arguments is to get offended and solidify your position further along, so it wouldn't really do much for those who don't care about being right, but otherwise I think it's a good idea. There could also be representations of debates and arguments in the form of the graph, where each statement would be transcribed into its graph-theoretic representation, and all of the arguments/evidence for and against each statement would be plainly visible.

The idea would require (re: be helped along significantly by) a social media button, kind of like the social button rolls at the end of blog posts, or something similarly ubiquitous to long-form argument. I can think of many ways to improve on the current state of debate graphs, and I suspect this sort of thing might be what EY designed and gave to a friend to execute.

In the end, the biggest obstacles would be popularity and resistance to the format. It would probably function as a thread-killer, and the way to prevent it from becoming a gish gallop would have to be the social element on the graph itself. Ultimately, though, I don't think trusting users is a very good way to ensure neutrality/objectivity, so some form of curation would be required.

Enter the AGI.
