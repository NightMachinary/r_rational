Sweet. My solution to that would be that there is no real time limit on an answer, as all work can be done on paper. Such a thing would be an issue if the debate is is real time, but in this age, the nature of the debate could be changed to be more deliberating, taking more time to explore all aspects of the issue.

Although if it still happens, and one is left with a counter-argument after the debate closes, I can't see a solution aside from requesting a reopening of the discussion.
