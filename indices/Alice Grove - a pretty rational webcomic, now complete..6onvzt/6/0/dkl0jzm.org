Alice has been "serving" humanity to atone for her actions in the war. She deliberately does not share technology with them because she fears it will be bad for them.

Recently she found out that 1) some humans really don't appreciate her anti-technology policy 2) the AI that she thought were completely apathetic to humanity has been doing more for humanity than her and 3) they did that by undoing all her efforts to keep humanity in the dark age.

Basically she worked so hard to prevent Ardent from fucking up a delicate status quo, but it turns out there are already hundreds like him all over the world.
