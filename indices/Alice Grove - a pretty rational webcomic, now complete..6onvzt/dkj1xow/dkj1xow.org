Oh sweet, didn't hear about it until now. It's just the right length for casual bingeing too.

If Jeph Jacques happens to read this, I'd like to congratulate on a story told well. The story itself is interesting and only enhanced by the chosen medium of a comic.

I managed to pick up on the influence of Banks' work on the comic right from the start, so kudos for pulling that off so well too.
