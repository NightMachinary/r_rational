Oh shit, he wrote something besides QC? I loved that comic for years, still do, but ultimately just stopped following it since its storyline, while amusing, was not compelling enough to survive the Natural Purge of webcomics that I couldn't remember to check up on at least once a week after I started writing again.

If he's written something else though, and with a completed story at that, I'll definitely check it out, thanks for posting it!
