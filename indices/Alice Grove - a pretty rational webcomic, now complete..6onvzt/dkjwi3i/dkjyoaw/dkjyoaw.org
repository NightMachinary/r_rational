I think that's intentional. This is a story that wants to drop you into the world and slowly reveal its facets to you as the plot unfolds. I can confirm, all your questions get answered and everything makes sense. There's some comedy, some drama, some surrealness, some character study, and some transhumanist sci-fi that all becomes clear after a while.
