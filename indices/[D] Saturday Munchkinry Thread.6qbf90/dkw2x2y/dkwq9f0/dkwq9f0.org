Step 1) Steal the cloning device.

Step 2) Mass produce clones of myself.

Step 3) Use clones to colonize some distant planets no one knows about.

Step 4) Begin horrible mad scientist experiments, using clones as fodder.

Side Note: I am not willing to undergo or perform horrible experiments, but then again, I'm also not willing to take over the galaxy. So I assume that when you say my goal "is to take over the galaxy", that goal overwrites my utility function, and so me and my clones would gladly kill/torture themselves and destroy everything they love for the fulfillment of that goal.

Side Note 2: These experiments will almost certainly discover that I'm force sensitive, even if I'm not looking for that specifically. Not that I would really use the force, but I suppose it might help to do more experiments. Being able to move things without touching them certainly seems useful for making various control groups and experimenting in environments too hostile for my life.

Side Note 3: The fact that all my clones are single-mindedly pursuing scientific advancement at all costs, and that I'm a pretty good scientist, odds are high that I would gain technological supremacy over all other life in the galaxy.

Step 5) Use my newfound technological supremacy to take over the galaxy by force. My preferred tactic would be playing billiards with stars.

Fun fact: when some stars supernova and turn themselves into neutron stars, they can also fire themselves off at super high speeds in some direction.

Fun fact 2: If a neutron star is coming your way, you either get out of the way or die. You cannot divert it, it has too much momentum for any kind of nukes to mean anything. You could fling entire planets into it and it would probably just continue moving along the same path. You cannot block it, because it just absorbs whatever is in the way and continues. You cannot survive it, because it's gravitational strength is powerful enough to spaghettify you (stretch your body until it breaks apart) and everything around you.

I would experiment to figure out how to aim these neutron stars (which is probably doable at the moment just before they become neutron stars), and then aim them at enemy planetary systems. They will either die or become homeless vagrants, desperately fleeing their home planets with barely anything, doomed to wander about in deep space as I continue to destroy every planetary system around them that they might colonize.
