Plan A - assuming droids can be made force-sensitive (apparently the Star Forge was a force-sensitive AI?), then there is no need to wait for Order 66

- collect disembodied droid intelligences and have them design next generation droid intelligences, accelerating their subjective time as much as possible, to create a rapidly self-improving superintelligence with the utility function of granting me omnipotence and omniscience in the galaxy

- of the force powers, precognition is the most important. At a minimum the superintelligence requires the ability to cancel out the precognitive abilities of other force users or the equivalent of "battle meditation" if anti-precog is not possible.

- siphon Coruscant economic flows to construct self-replicating force-sensitive droid warrior factories managed by a network of self-replicating precognitive matrioshka brains.

- kill all force sensitive beings with significant precognitive abilities to establish and maintain precognitive monopoly.

- be generous to those who surrender, ruthless to those who do not

Plan B - droid intelligences cannot direct force powers under any circumstances

- initiate the superintelligence

- siphon economic flows to acquire such anti-precog/precog stealth resources (tech or people) as are available and boot the self-replicating droid factories (the droids will /not/ have single point of failure control ships)

- wait for Order 66 to complete

- stream hyperspace capable droid assassins and/or missiles at the Sith

- conduct war of attrition against clone troops unless they are capable of redirecting their loyalties.
