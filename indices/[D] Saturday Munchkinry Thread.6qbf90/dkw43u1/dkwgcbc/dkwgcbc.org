There will be a significant interest in the number of keys in the market, as a measure for the kingdom's power in relation to other kingdoms' powers. If the total number on the local market are known, that allows one make guesses and judgement about the kingdom's power.

This has knock-on effects on the intelligence levels. You will have arguments for not utilising all keys all the time. If you underreport, the kingdom appears weaker than it is. This might help to avoid the baleful gaze of other, bigger kingdoms, or induce a smaller kingdom to attack a kingdom they deem less powerful than it actually is.

If you go with eternal-potato's [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6qbf90/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/dkwfiz4/][comment]], then the TC would be a prime target for all kinds of espionage and counter-espionage actions.

Lastly, I fully expect there to be a national strategic reserve, and a an unreported reserve for clandestine purposes. The sizes may vary depending on importance.

PS: I very much enjoy your story. /thumbs up/
