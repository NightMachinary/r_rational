Can you send teleportation keys using the bulk teleportation method?

What stops terrorists from, I don't know, teleporting a sponge where that supporting pillar used to be, or teleporting a bomb into Congress, or any number of other things that make it so anyone with some ressources can build a Death Note that needs a location instead of a name?
