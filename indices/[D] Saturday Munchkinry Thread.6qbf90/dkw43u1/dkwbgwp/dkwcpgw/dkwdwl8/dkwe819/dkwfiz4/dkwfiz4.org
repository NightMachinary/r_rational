Okay then,

There is Teleportation Coordinator (TC) that has telephone lines to every Teleportation Station (TS). Keys from incoming teleports are stored locally at each TS. When a client want to go from TS#1 to TS#2, TS#1 calls TC and places a bid for a TK in client' name. When TS#1 has no available TK locally, the client must also pay for bulk-teleporting a key from another station, or refuse, in which case the key goes to the next highest bid. TC coordinates everything via telephone, payment and authentication happen at TSs, otherwise everything as described earlier applies.
