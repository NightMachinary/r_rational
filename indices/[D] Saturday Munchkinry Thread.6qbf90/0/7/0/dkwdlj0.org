Whoa there, are you trying to butt in on the Minster of Defense? You were assigned the task of reforming the teleportation key allocation system and now I see you surrounded by anti-terrorism white papers and theoretical physics texts?

There are non-intersection rules governing teleportation; it doesn't work if you're trying to teleport into a density greater than 2kg/m^{3} which is about twice the density of air. In other words, a light rain at the destination will stop teleportation from working, let alone a stone pillar.

There are also wards to stop people from teleporting things into a given location, and these are their own problem, since a covert agent could sneak into your airport-equivalent and place them in order to halt all teleportation, but they're fairly easy to find and defuse, and they usually expose the perpetrators meaning that they're not a reliable method of teleportation denial unless you control the physical location. But counter-terrorism falls under the control of the Minister of Defense, and isn't part of your job, except insofar as you have to liaise with the Defense Ministry to coordinate personnel, screening systems, key requisitions for special troop transport, et cetera.
