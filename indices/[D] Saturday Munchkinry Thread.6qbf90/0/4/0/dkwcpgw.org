Yes, but ...

Free is stretching it. The real-world equivalent would be containerized cargo shipping, which makes cargo transport cheap enough that you can move tonnes of materials without really having to think that much about the costs involved. Moving an /individual/ item like a teleportation key through that method would be incredibly costly, but you could maybe send teleportation keys through the cargo service as riders on other shipments, at the not-insignificant cost of making the personnel transport interconnected with cargo transport (i.e. having them be co-located, delaying cargo transport to have teleportation move in synchronization with key countdowns).
