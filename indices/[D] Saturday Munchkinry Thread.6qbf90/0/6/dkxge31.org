For commercial purposes, keys will only go either point to point in the kingdom or to allied nations. The landing port for each key will be a heavily fortified area set up like an embassy: considered sovereign territory of the nation porting in. This reduces the likelihood of a host nation attempting to steal a key from a landing point, as that constitutes a declaration of war.

Some percentage of keys must be kept by the military for their operations. Some military keys will be used the same as commercial keys to ferry troops and materi√©l around, while one will be kept unused in a bunker. In the immediate vicinity of the bunker key is tons and tons of explosives, enough to obliterate the largest city in the world. If a war gets dire enough, the invading nation's largest city or cities die.

I think you don't give a key to the sovereign. Other legal measures will be in place which will force the sovereign to set up strong institutions capable of weathering the death of the executive, so their ability to escape from any situation into the most fortified bunker in the land instantly is simply less important than keeping that key in active use.
