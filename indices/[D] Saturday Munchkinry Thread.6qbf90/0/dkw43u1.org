This is less munchkinry and more a question of optimization; hopefully that's okay.

- Bulk goods can be teleported pretty freely and can be considered irrelevant for the purposes of this prompt.
- /People/ can only be teleported through the use of teleportation keys, of which about 1000 exist; roughly 100 are controlled by your kingdom. It is impossible to make more.
- The teleportation key allows up to five people to teleport to a given location, taking the teleportation key with them, along with whatever they're carrying (but again, bulk goods can be teleported more or less freely, so that's not really a boon).
- The refresh timer on the teleportation key is two hours.

You are the Minister of Teleportation and part of your remit is reforming the teleportation key allocation system (TKAS) in order to A) maximize throughput, B) ensure allocation is "fair", and C) ensure that the TKAS is responsive to e.g. national emergencies, urgent diplomatic missions, etc.

Here's what I have so far:

1. The primary goal of the new TKAS is that all teleportation keys are used whenever their two-hour limit is up.
2. The secondary goal of the new TKAS is that every single use of a key will teleport the maximum of five people.
3. Teleportations primarily happen to and from "hot-spots" where there are lots of people wanting to teleport both in /and/ out, because otherwise there's underutilization on one side.
4. Teleportations primarily happen to and from guarded locations where personnel will immediately take control of the teleportation key and ensure that it's safely back in the TKAS.
5. Actual allocation is probably best done through a market system which takes into account the necessity for a return trip (i.e. a key needs to make money going both directions).

It's /almost/ but not quite the same problem as organizing airline flights, where you want to keep airplanes in the air as much as possible in order to maximize profit from each individual airplane, but I think for airplanes it might be more a matter of profit per flight mile (because airplanes suffer from wear-and-tear, so continually keeping the airplane in the air isn't efficient if they're not making a certain amount of money per trip).
