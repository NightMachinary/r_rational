This depends somewhat on what assumptions you're making about what constitutes nation-state scale.

- Kansas has a population of *2.9 million*, which would place it just below Armenia and Albania.
- The busiest airport in Wichita is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wichita_Dwight_D._Eisenhower_National_Airport][ICT]] with *1.6 million passengers* per year. The busiest airport in Armenia is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zvartnots_International_Airport][EVN]] with *2.1 million passengers* per year. The busiest airport in Albania is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirana_International_Airport_N%C3%ABn%C3%AB_Tereza][TIA]] with *2.2 million passengers*.
- The teleportation keys, working at full capacity, can move 5 passengers, 12 times a day, with 100 keys = 6,000 passengers per day, or *2.2 million passengers* per year.

So the teleport keys have a throughput roughly on par with the biggest international airport of a small nation-state. And keep in mind that there's no such thing as a connecting flight, which /probably/ inflates the numbers for the above airports some.
