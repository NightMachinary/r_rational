This probably isn't what you're looking for, but since there are 900 more keys for you to conquer....

Step 1) Arm a group of 5 people with all kinds of bombs.

Step 2) Teleport group to some foreign key.

Step 3) Bombs detonate, everyone around your key and the foreign key is dead.

Step 4) Using another key, teleport another 5 people to the same spot, and now collect the two keys and return home with all 3 keys, gaining a net bonus of +1 key.

Step 5) Repeat until you have all 1000 keys.
