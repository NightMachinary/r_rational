Can keys be carried as cargo without being activated? If so you could use a third friendly key to avoid suiciding your own people:

Step 1) Arm a group of 5 people with all kinds of bombs and two teleport keys.

Step 2) Teleport group with bombs to some foreign key using Key 1.

Step 3) Teleport group home with key 2, taking key 1 as cargo and leaving bombs behind.

Step 4) Bombs detonate, everyone around foreign key is dead.

Step 5) Using key 3, teleport another 5 people to the same spot, and now collect the foreign keys and return home using it (or a fourth friendly key if you don't know if theirs is on cooldown), gaining a net bonus of +1 key.

Step 6) Repeat until you have all 1000 keys.

Of course, the plan is countered by keeping key locations top secret at all times, or at least vague enough that enemies can't teleport directly on top of them.
