You wake up in the Coruscant Underworld (from Star Wars) in the year 26 BBY (four years before the Clone Wars) with nothing but the clothes on your back. You are Force-sensitive, but don't know it (yet).

Your goal is to take over the galaxy - not the entire galaxy, mind you, I'm not including Wild Space or the Unknown Regions. You also don't need to be an absolute dictator, either.

How do you do this?
