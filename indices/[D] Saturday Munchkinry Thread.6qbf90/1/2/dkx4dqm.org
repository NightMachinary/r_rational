Well goal one needs to be to get the fuck out of the Coruscant Underworld, that place is scary as hell. Now, unless we've got plot armor (which I guess might more or less be the case, depending on just how much latent force potential we've been given), success at this stage is actually far from certain.

Corcuscant's underbelly is basically a death world, and it's not exactly easy to escape from the ghettos down there even if you're a native (otherwise no one would be living down there in the first place). And we're definitely no native. Like, I think you may be underestimating the difficulty of just surviving from your specified start point. This is thousands upon thousands of years of just building on top of the remains of old buildings, full of all sort of nasty wildlife, often dangerous discarded technology, criminals looking to hide and the truly desperate and destitute pushed out of the over-city. On top of that, even the most obsessive Star Wars fan is going to have less practical, day to day knowledge of basic science, technology and everyday life stuff than the local equivalent of a fresh Highschool graduate. Also, there's no guarantee that we'd even be able to /talk/ to anyone out the gate. Basic may not be the same as English, and even if it is there's all sorts of other languages spoken by specific groups and species that no one from Earth would know so much as a single word of.

But, let's just assume we get past all that without getting eaten by ROUS or shivved by gangers or getting crushed by some crumbling bit of architecture that's been abandoned for longer than the history of agriculture back here on Earth. What then?

Well, with only 4 years of lead time, there's no way we're stopping the Clone Wars from starting, and sticking our nose in it is a good way to come to ol' Sheev's attention, which has 'bad end' written all over it it big flashing letters.

Probably the best bet mid term is to find some way off Coruscant, and once it becomes clear that we have the force, to seek out tutelage in itone way or another. We're obviously too old for the Jedi of this era (and honestly aren't the best place to start for this whole 'galactic conquest' thing even if they would train us), and like I said before, coming to Sheev's attention would be no bueno. So, Holocrons? One of the various groups of force users out there? Probably won't be able to afford to be picky, at least not at first, but given our near-total lack of starting assets and the scope of our goals, we'll need grab anything we can with both hands.

Obviously the exact details would depend heavily on how things play out, but there's lots of little enclaves of force users with their own tricks and specialties scattered around, so my first thought is to go around picking up as much as we can from all of them, aiming to pick up as many 'one-trick-pony' sorts of abilities as possible and seeing what synergizes into something really broken. The end game would be founding our own order of some sort, building it up in the shadows until we can step into the limelight at some pivotal point and set ourselves up as something along the lines of the Jedi Lords of old, with me as the head honcho, of course.

I'd talk about picking up stuff like the Katana Fleet or seeking out specific groups for training, but realistically, given zero time for research before being dropped over there, finding anything specific would mostly come down to trusting the Force (and sheer dumb-luck) anyway, so super specific goals and objectives don't really make sense here, to my mind.

EDIT: There are a number of things that are done strangely and seemingly illogically in Star Wars that people like to talk about leveraging and exploiting in these sorts of scenarios. The big ones that come to mind for me are computers (basically anything to do with them) and the way battles are fought is space. Now, it's easy to sit here in the real world and just go with the Doylist explanation (a combination of ignorance and stylistic/plot reasons on the writer's part) but that obviously doesn't work once you're actually in the setting. So you need to shift to thinking of Watsonian reasons why so many things are done in ways that seem sub-optimal, especially when we're talking about a technological society that's got records going back tens of thousands of years.

The obvious ones to me are:

A) Cultural. That's just how things are done, and it's how things have been for so long that no one would even think to suggest doing it any differently. There are enough examples like this in real life history that I wouldn't find it implausible at all for any number of issues to fall under this one.

B) There are additional factors at play that make the strange things more sensible (one theory I've heard brought up before is that computers and IT are so dismal (and for why you see stuff like soldiers sitting and manually operating gun-emplacements on frickin space ships) is because a number of droid rebellions happened over the years and the galaxy at large decided to make like the Colonials from nBSG and make their computers 'too dumb' to hack).

C) Things don't actually work exactly the way they're shown in the movies. They're obviously not meant to be serious, factual, historical documentaries, so maybe sticking too slavishly to every detail as presented would be like watching a bunch of WWII movies and then getting dropped into the battle of Stalingrad.

So yeah, it's entirely possible that someone with a basic understanding of modern technology(or military tactics or whatever) could revolutionize the galaxy by 'inventing' smart phones or telling fighter pilots 'hey, have you tried /not/ having WWII style dog-fights and actually taking advantage of being in zero-g/the vacuum of space?', but I feel like counting on being able to do shit like that is a good way to get burned when you find out that there's damn good reasons why people weren't already doing it. You can't just assume the entire galaxy has been holding idiot balls for the past twenty-five thousand years.
