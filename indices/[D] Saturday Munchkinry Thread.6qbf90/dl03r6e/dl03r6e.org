I'm the DM for a Harry Potter themed DND campaign. The players joined the Order of the Phoenix and they decided that the best strategy for locating Voldemort is to spam Voldemort with thousands of messenger Patronuses every hour, surrounding him in a perpetual Patronus sandwich. Patronuses don't use regular magic but happiness, so you should theoretically be able to crank out a lot of them. And if you can't be happy for so long, MDMA.
