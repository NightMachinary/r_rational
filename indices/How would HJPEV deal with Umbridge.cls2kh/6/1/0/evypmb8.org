There are other people in the world who need help for other reasons than Umbridge. Azkaban, for example, is much worse than anything she's likely to do. As is the possible end of the world which may or may not still be fated, as are other problems such as human mortality. If leaving Britain gets him even /slightly/ more freedom to work on the most serious problems, it's the obviously correct choice. It would be out of character for him to give up on helping people, but very much in character for him to /prioritize/.
