The fact that nobody does the grenade thing in canon probably means there's a safeguard against it. Letterbombs started appearing in the Muggle world as early as 1712, and at the very least muggleborns would have talked about it and the idea would have made its way around. There's enough cultural contamination for trains to have made it, so something far simpler probably did as well.
