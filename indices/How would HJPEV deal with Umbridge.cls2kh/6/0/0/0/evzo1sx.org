Letterbombs are older than that. It only takes exactly one muggleborn in the ministry to read a muggle paper and make the connection telling their competent Slytherin or Hufflepuff superior that they should probably, like, disable all magical and nonmagical explosives in flight, or something, to make it a non-issue. Or maybe they enchant owls to not take lethal items at all and to get lost in uninhabited woodlands if confunded in any way. Or maybe there's a Return to Sender feature, or the magical post office delivers an irresistable homing tracker to whoever sent the bomb. You could stay in an unplottable and Fidelius'd area to avoid that, but you'd never be able to leave.

Or maybe they did all of that. I took less than 5 minutes coming up with those, and despite the canon HPverse being a worldbuilding disaster, there are still usually reasons for things to happen besides author fiat, even if those reasons are bad if actually examined. The reason letterbombs don't really happen anymore is because the Unabomber made IRL authorities think about how to prevent such a person from being successful again, and we now have some simple safeguards against it. One ambitious, but stupid, would-be dark lord doing the same would be enough to make even a society of mostly daft wizards do the same.
