Any clue how canon 5th year Harry would handle suddenly being in the HPMoR world shortly after the defeat of Voldemort? Among other things:

- Dumbledore is dead.

- Petunia is a supermodel that loves him.

- Draco's dad is dead and expects to find a friend in Harry.

- Hermione has superpowers and expects him to be some sort of genius.

- Many of the Wizarding world's movers and shakers seem to expect all kinds of things from him.

- Ron doesn't like him.

- He's in Ravenclaw.

- Magic is slightly less magical and much more sensible.

- The whole world is subtly different.
