I wonder how he'd react to finding out that Michael Verres either doesn't exist (given that he's a MoR-only character), or has experienced a Petunia-and-Harry-free life, possibly being part of a different family. And that Petunia does exist but is a really horrible person.

Of course, yes, he's a rationalist, but even so, would he be able to easily tank that kind of emotional double-blow?

I'm also thinking that he'll find out about canon!Harry's history and personality, and while initially being a little horrified and embarrassed, might eventually come to sympathize with a Harry who spent eleven years without parental or family support and was actively subjected to years of abuse.

Realizing that Dumbledore and McGonagall /knew/ the conditions the local version of Harry had been raised in, and did nothing about it, might make him blow his top.
