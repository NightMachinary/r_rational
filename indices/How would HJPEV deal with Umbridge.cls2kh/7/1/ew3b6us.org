This assumes he knows she isn't Voldemort aligned. Consider what canon Harry has had to deal with up to this point: (DADA = Defense Against the Dark Arts)

1. Literally Voldemort. (Technically possessed by.) The DADA Teacher. (He might count this one twice.)
2. One of Voldemort's Horcruxes possessing Ron's little sister. Ron is his friend.
3. Someone who's escaped from Azkaban...
4. A death eater who sent him straight to Voldemort/bringing him back/removing magical protection. The DADA Teacher, who everyone thought was a super trustworthy auror.

If there's a 50% chance someone is Voldemort, 25% chance they're a Death Eater, killing them or getting them fired ASAP seems like a solid move. (The remaining 25% - that they're a member of the order of the phoenix/good defense teacher, can be easily eliminated.)
