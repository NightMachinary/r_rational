Within the first few days, 5th year Harry will throw an angst fit witch will immediately reveal him as an imposter, if he hasn't been caught before. Mad-eye and possibly Amelia Bones will interrogate him to see if his sudden behavior change is due to a piece of Voldemort coming to the surface or something. They will probably get the truth of his origin out of him.

I can see Hermione and Neville trying to work with Harry to un-isekai him. Draco may or may not help, depending on how obnoxious the swapped Harry is about it.

At the end of this scenario, I would love it if the Harry's are swapped back and 5th year Harry comes back to a home universe utterly changed by HJPEV's influence!
