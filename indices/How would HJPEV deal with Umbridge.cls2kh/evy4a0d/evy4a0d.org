He sends her a package by owl with a grenade in it.

In all seriousness I think he'd gather information, finding out how much authority she actually has in the school. Figuring out what her objectives are by speaking with the student body, teachers, possibly the woman herself and maybe a bit of snooping in her office with the Invisibility cloak. Also finding out what in the world the Ministry is doing by sending someone so antagonistic to the school.

Then with what he's able to piece together either as Nimelennar says he "retracts the story of Voldemort's return" to get her to lower her guard and to stop grinding everyone gears. Possibly undermine her credibility and sanity with Fred and George plus more invisibility cloak.

Or

If the situation truly seems untenable he could always just leave lol. Go to another school outside of Britain. He has no real stake in this battle to be honest other than familiar faces who aren't the people he knows and a personal slight.

If leaving the school is too dangerous or is somehow unachievable he can I guess utterly destroy Umbridge with his dark side. As for what that intails errrrrr grenade.
