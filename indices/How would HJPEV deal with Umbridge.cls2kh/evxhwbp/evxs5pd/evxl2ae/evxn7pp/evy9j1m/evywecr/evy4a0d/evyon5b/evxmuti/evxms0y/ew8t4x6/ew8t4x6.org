Some questions that came to mind on reread:

- Does HJPEV get CANON!Harry's connection to Voldemort? I'd doubt it, but then I have to wonder if Voldemort would notice, or if he didn't realize it was a thing until after a few of the visions in canon.
- Doesn't HJPEV have a different accent from CANON!Harry? Oxford vs Surry? I think people would immediately notice that he walks, talks, and reacts completely differently from CANON!Harry, and respond accordingly.
- A few people have questioned whether or not HJPEV would approach CANON!Dumbledore, but in keeping with the above, wouldn't Dumbledore immediately take action to figure out what's happening? In canon, Dumbledore avoided Harry during this book, due to the Voldemort connection. Would HJPEV's obvious weirdness change this, or make it seem like an even better idea? Given the latter, he'd probably put Snape on it, and that would probably result in Snape discovering HJPEV's oclumensy, and this just gets harder and harder until HJPEV suggests something like veritaserum or testifying under magical compulsion of some kind. (Pensive could help, but getting to that point seems like it'd take longer.)
