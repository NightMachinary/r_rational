Retracting the Voldemort's Return story would be a political disaster that would oust Dumbledore and vindicate Fudge. The fact that he doesn't have memory of it (when he's aware he's literally missing /all the memories/ of canon HP) doesn't prove LV isn't resurrected, and if he's remotely intelligent he'd defer action until he knows WTF is going on.
