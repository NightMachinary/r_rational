We never see, in canon or in HPMOR, a wizard checking an unfamiliar owl to be registered mail owl and not an Animagus or Imperiused regular owl. And even if they would start, would the Ministry really put as much effort into making every mail owl distinct and unfakeable and unhackable as Gringotts put in it's Grand Manager's seal?
