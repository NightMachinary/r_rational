I remember that.

My point is:

50% chance that someone's Voldemort

(Conditional on that - 50% chance that the DADA teacher is Voldemort.)

While that only leaves us with a 25% chance the DADA teacher is Voldemort (25% chance some other Death Eater), that's still way too high to be taking any chances.

You can say "She's obviously not a Death Eater." Had someone raised the possibility when it was the case, people would have said the "he's not a Death Eater, he's Mad Eye Moody!" (Similar with Quirrell.)
