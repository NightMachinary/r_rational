All those reasons you just quoted about how easy it would be to address the letter bomb issue apply to a hundred other features of the canon HP verse. I absolutely agree that it would be Incredibly Easy for these things to be addressed, but like HJPEV notes, it's a world of the idiotic and insane. And it's ABSOLUTELY internally consistent that the wizarding world would somehow fail to address this. After all, even with all the muggleborns available, they're still using quills and parchment rather than notebooks and ballpoints
