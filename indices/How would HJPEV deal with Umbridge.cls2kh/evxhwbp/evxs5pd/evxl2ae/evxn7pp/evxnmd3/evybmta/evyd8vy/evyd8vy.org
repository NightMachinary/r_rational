I think one of the first hypotheses to cross his mind is that this is somehow Hermione's dreamworld where she is expressing a repressed desire to be the main character - a literal dreamworld that only he and she are experiencing, operated inside her mind.

(He will then test this hypothesis by looking up additional math in textbooks, and consider it tentatively disconfirmed when he finds valid theorems that neither of them knew. What, you thought he was going to stay dramatically mistaken for multiple episodes?)
