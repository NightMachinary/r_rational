I've only read HPmoR once, but I don't remember petunia being part of the plot at all, weren't the majority of his resources from his scientist parents?

Edit: wait, petunia is his mom, and there's a subplot about his dad being an ass about intellectual stuff with her because she's not a scientist. I think. Carry on.
