End of HPMOR Harry was well aware that Dumbledore had actual good reasons for his odd behaviors, and I seem to recall him flat out said something to the effect of "Dumbledore may have been the only one that was doing the right things for the right reasons."

So "talk to the local version of Dumbledore" would be a plan of action that'd at least occur to him as worthy of consideration.
