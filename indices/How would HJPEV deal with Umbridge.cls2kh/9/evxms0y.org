Why would Umbridge and HPJEV even come into conflict?

HPJEV retracts the story of Voldemort's return (as he didn't actually witness it).

The rest of the conflict... doesn't happen.

Maybe the DA still gets formed, but with Harry no longer so closely associated with Dumbledore and the Voldemort-returned story, I think Umbridge would be less paranoid about the whole "Dumbledore wants to seize power" idea, and might actually let them learn.
