In Harry's shoes, I /wouldn't/ defeat Umbridge. She's way too useful.

Umbridge's thing is getting political power by abusing bureaucracy and blackmailing people. She's openly hates Harry and isn't Voldemort aligned. Plus, she has strong and easy to understand motivations.

All that makes her a perfect cats paw.

Step 1 is to toss a confundus at her: "Harry served his detention" / "you transferred Harry's detention to Filch after Filch promised to do something torturous."

That gets Harry ~4 hours of free movement / night and establishes the enmity between him and Umbridge. Plus it starts to win him public sympathy; people don't like it when authorities go too far.

Then I'd start running through her blackmail files. General goals are (1) learn the network of power / alliances in the ministry as seen by people outside of team Dumbledore, (2) copy damaging stuff on team dark, and (3) fill the files on team Dumbledore with useless misinfo.

Once the files are edited, the next step is to burn through Umbridge's accumulated power. Have her pick fights with people on Team Dark and then use the blackmail against them.

When Umbridge's influence is mostly gone, and her allies are angry, then maneuver her into a scandal where she's colluding with Malfoy to do something appropriately taboo.

The maneuvering wouldn't be that hard to set up. Just a liberal mix of confundous + the inventing of a society of purebloods who recognized Umbridge's brilliance
