That's pretty good actually. She's definitely vile, but you're right that she was never explicitly with Voldemort.

I'm not sure you could build much public support with the detentions, though, at least not until you've toppled Fudge. Over half of Harry's class either didn't care about his detentions or thought the nutter was getting what he deserved. I did overlook that it may have been possible to get Umbridge nominally on-side long enough to both use and destroy her though.
