Several things that HJPEV might do:

- Show up at the new professor's office, before their first class, and have a quick chat to get to know her better. This HJPEV is much more in control of his emotions than canon Harry, and might be expected to try to charm the new professor.
- Having learned the lesson from Snape, /lose/ during a conflict in class.
- Take time to plot.
- Check to see if Rita Skeeter is alive in this continuity, and if so, feed her all the juicy tidbits. We're only a few months into Fudge's campaign; it may not be too late to begin a pseudonymous character assassination campaign against Umbridge and Fudge, and when it succeeds, reveal that he was the author.
- Plot with Gred and Forge.

But regarding Quest Items, you the author need to decide:

1. The rules of the method by which Harry got isekai'd. Does he have access to Harry's memories? Since souls exist, does HJPEV's soul replace HP's soul, or does HP's soul cease to exist and HJPEV take its place? Do the prophecies which bound HP bind HJPEV? How does this affect the local prophesiers? Does Harry have the right to the Line of Merlin Unbroken?
2. There are three options for what items got transferred with Harry's soul: none, or some. None is easy. Some means that Harry will spend time trying to figure out why certain objects came with him but not others. You should figure out what the rule is beforehand, even if the rule doesn't make it into the story.
