HJPEV's mind state completely overwrites that of HP's. He has none of canon HP's memories, but is good enough at extracting information from context clues to at least stall long enough to explain things to Dumbledore and get correct stories. He's still going to be ignorant of things Dumbledore wouldn't know or tell him until he can bluff his way through conversations with the relevant people. All the prophecies still bind him, as it was his mind, not his soul, which was overwritten. Local prophets notice nothing...for now. This will change as HJPEV starts HJPEV'ing.

His closest friends are going to notice the changes almost immediately and will demand answers. He'll need to figure something out to tell them, possibly the truth.

Harry brought over zero magical artifacts. He only has access to whatever HP had at the time, though he could obviously get his hands on some others. He does not have the Stone of Permanency, as that is a universal win condition. I'm allowing him transfiguration and Patronuses because those really aren't ever explained in any depth in canon and may really work that way.
