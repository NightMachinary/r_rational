I've had a similar scenario I've been idly puzzling with for a while. End-of-book!HJPEV overwrites canon Voldemort in the exact moment Voldemort first sees baby Harry. Lilly is alive and in combat stance, James is freshly dead.

Harry has less than three minutes to orient to his surroundings, diffuse Lilly, and attempt to resurrect (or freeze) James before James's brain starts to take serious damage.

Harry has to weigh probability that he is actually in 1981 and James is an actual person who will be perma-dead soon verses the probability that this situation is somehow fake/enemy action that is possibly an attempt to steal the secret of patronus revival. (Harry considers and rejects the idea that this is a years-long time-loop, because he simply refuses to murder his own parents to complete the loop.)

Harry will attempt to revive James even though he thinks he is in some sort of simulation because:

#+begin_example
  p(this is real) * cost of James dies for good > p(this is enemy action to expose my secrets) * cost of patronus revival secret being known
#+end_example

Holds true even if p(this is real) is very low.

The next big challenge is developing a “Voldemort Cleanup Plan.” If Harry in Voldemort's body just nopes off to hide or find personal answers, magical Britton basically turns out the same as it did in canon. Harry is likely to see his remembered history as a control and try to work for a better future.

Harry's resources * historical knowledge * true patronus and partial transfiguration * an adult magic capacity * any artifacts Voldemort had on his person * a whole, unshattered, Tom Riddle soul (presuming some of canon!Voldemort's behavior was caused by instability from making horcruxes)

Harry's weaknesses * limited spell knowledge * no canon!Voldemort memories (maybe some re-awakened MoR!Voldemort memories like the one from his first dementor exposure) * Vow-bound

Wild card * 5 canon horcurxes with unknown behavior
