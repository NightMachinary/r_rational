Was there really a reason for that? I mean, unless they were running on dregs in term of people to move through the process, I feel like draining another person from 100% to 1% is better than draining 99 people from 1% to 0%.

Especially considering that chakra naturally recovers over time. If the process went on for several hours, you could even get MORE chakra out of people if you draned to 1%, then a few hours later when they are back up to ~25% or so, drain them again to 1%.

It's just really inefficient, even from a sociopathic perspective.

It's like destroying your power generators and getting new ones rather than running them out of gas and then going to refill them, even if you get a small amount more power by running it on fumes until it breaks.

The only justification I can think of is that they were worried about not have enough people even overall to provide enough to reach the absolute borderline for Naruto's natural regen. But that decision would have had to be made early, when they couldn't possibly have known, and obviously wasn't true, and again it /still/ is a dumb plan if the whole process lasts long enough for any of the first donators to recover appreciably.

Unless they were prisoners being executed or something.
