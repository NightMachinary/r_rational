So essentially 3: Make Naruto feel indebted to Orochimaru and his people because "look at how many people willingly sacrificed themselves to help you when you were directly responsible for killing two of my peacekeepers. +Now come, let me show my snake.+ Don't you think you should honor them by doing <x>?"

EDIT: While this argument is easy to refute ("Why didn't they stop before they died?") rationally, it should still have some emotional pull. Even if you know that their deaths were senseless, they still died for you. Stupid? Maybe. Easy to ignore? Probably not.

Maybe next chapter is going to be titled 'Naruto and the 30 orphaned children' that come visit him and tell them about how heroic their parents were. You know, just for more guilt tripping. :V
