Range limits are interesting too - I mean, this could simply work out to an unbeatable edge for defense. Attack a city of any size, get obliterated by city guards with infinite mana pools. - everyplace becomes an independent city state, and offensive war impossible. At moderately greater distances, I think it works out so that political entities end up the same size as the range limit. No range limit, and it snowballs into the world state. Or possibly not - there likely is diminishing returns on this stunt. Most importantly, it provides better social levers to apply to chackra-users.
