Hmm. Fair point. Perhaps everyone assumes that Naruto himself will not care either. And they may actually be right, since the culture of that society is so alien to us. Perhaps for the children, who are raised to be solders, ready to be sacrificed for the convenience of their village at any point, this would not be such a big deal.

From the clone's and Naruto's point of view, a short life that contributes to his goals may well be preferable to no life at all. If the clones are not scared of their imminent demise, then they may actually be grateful for the chance to contribute.
