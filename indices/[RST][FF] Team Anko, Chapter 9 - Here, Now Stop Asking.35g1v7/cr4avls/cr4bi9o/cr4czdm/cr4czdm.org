The pedophilia thing wasn't meant seriously anyway. It's just that I like to read Naruto parodies every now and then and this is a common topic for Orochimaru. :P

But yeah, just imagine living in a village like this until someone who you trusted or depended on knocks on your door and tells you to report to the hospital. You are not being told why but Orochimaru took in your family when it needed help the most so you go (Orochimaru strikes me as the guy who tries to have good PR; it costs him little and the gains are pretty big). Then without warning you get paralyzed by one of the nurses (because in my head canon you have to be concious for the procedure because <reasons>) and get moved into the same room with that blond guy you don't know. All you know is that you are replacing the corpse that was in your place before you. And you can do nothing about but wait until your life is slowly being extinguished.

And FWIW, what Hinata did is a pretty calculated move but not unexpected. She values Naruto more than a bunch of strangers, especially strangers she can just rationalize to belonging to an enemy faction. I imagine you will explore her feelings about this and Naruto's guilt later on (why not just add that he is creating life when he casts Kage Bunshin so he is already a murderer anyway so we can be sure his spirit is fully broken? :P).
