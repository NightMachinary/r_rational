  I was expecting comments like "zomg, Hinata's a monster!"

I think everyone mostly expects to see callous disregard for human life in rational naruto settings by now.

That said, it'd sure be nice if there were some repercussions Hinata actually cared about. As it looks right now, nothing of value to Hinata was lost in the incident and even her relationship with Naruto improved. I'm not sure if it's the urge to see Hinata pay for the deaths of all those people, or just the desire to see some consequence-induced character growth, but, for me, a childish tantrum leading to such a favourable outcome for the child at the expense of everyone else feels really unsatisfying.
