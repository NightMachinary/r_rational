Without a doubt there were many points at which this incident could have been averted.

But as far as responsibility goes, I'd say Anko is the one who's most to blame for the fiasco. Even disregarding the fact that she took a recruit with that kind of volatile emotional baggage on a mission in a foreign territory, she could have easily stopped Hinata herself instead of sending Naruto running into a hostile village. Scolding Shino was not something that absolutely had to be done immediately. So, definitely poor judgement on her part there. Not to mention the fact that she is a commanding officer and that pretty much makes everything her subordinates do her responsibility by default.

As for Hinata, I would not say it's her fault exactly. Inability to control her actions in such a situation is understandable. The lack of maturity has to be acknowledged nonetheless. Usually I would start wondering what kind of military organisation would allow recruits to start active service without any kind of psych aptitude evaluation (especially since there is no immediate need for fresh cannon fodder on the front lines of some war), but given the political power of her father, it's no surprise she slipped through.
