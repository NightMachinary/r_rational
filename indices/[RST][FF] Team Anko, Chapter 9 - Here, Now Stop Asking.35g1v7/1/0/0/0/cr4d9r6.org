Causation is an interesting thing. One could make the following arguments:

1. This is all Anko's fault, because she didn't address the issue of Hinata's abuse earlier, in a safe environment.
2. This is all Orochimaru's fault, because he kidnapped the team and forced them to come to Sound.
3. This is all Shino's fault because he tactlessly brought out the fact of Hinata's abuse.
4. This is all Hinata's fault because she went out to vent her rage running instead of staying in and fighting with her teammate. (Or, alternatively: This is all Hinata's fault because she had a childish temper tantrum and went stomping out.)
5. This is all Naruto's fault because he didn't stop when the Sound ninja told him to.
6. This is all the Sound ninjas' fault, because they had Naruto trapped and they went for the kill instead of the capture.
7. This is all Hinata's fault, because she refused to allow her teammate / friend / role model / crush to be killed.
