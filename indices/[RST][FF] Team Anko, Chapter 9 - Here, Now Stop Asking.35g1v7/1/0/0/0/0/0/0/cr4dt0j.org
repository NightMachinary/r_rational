Infiltrating a DMZ is not something I'd think of as low-risk for someone's first mission right out of academy. I consider the decision to take this particular mission to be made under the influence of significant emotional bias. It's pretty clear by now that Anko may be a great warrior, but a great officer she is definitely not.
