I actually just noticed nearly all of those are time travel fics, heh. I love that genre but I suppose it is well suited for parodies as well because your main cast already knows what is going to happen but just doesn't care anymore. The last link especially has a Naruto whose (sort of) insanity I really liked. :P

EDIT: Chapter 21 of said fic is actually where I was hinting with Orochimaru and his canon pedophilia. :V
