I wish you would have mentioned if the people that were being sucked dry for Naruto (oh, is he going to deal /well with/ that) did so voluntarily or were forced to. Just knowing their expressions, even if they looked fanatically happy to be of use, would have made that scene even more haunting.

EDIT: Possible reasons Orochimaru is so invested into Naruto: 1) he wants the power of the Kyuubi and he cannot extract it to a better container/himself so he is trying to turn him

2) he cannot afford the Kyuubi to reform for whatever reason; maybe he still has ties to Akatsuki and having to wait for it to reform would ruin their plans; in fact, if he had NO ties to them, wouldn't it make sense to kill the hosts preemptively to screw with them?

3) he has a thing for little boys (i.e. see the Sasuke Thing from canon) and he hasn't developed Edo Tensei far enough
