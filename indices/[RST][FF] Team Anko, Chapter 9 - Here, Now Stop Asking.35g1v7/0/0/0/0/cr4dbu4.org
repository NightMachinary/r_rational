I'm already playing awfully fast and loose with canon, so pairing him off certainly isn't outside the realm of possibility.

Actually, the one that really gets me is that I had one person tell me "aw man i wantd [sic] anko/naruto but it looks like more naruhina shite"

I responded with something that was as polite as I could be when saying "no well in holy hell is that ever happening."

On its own I would have ignored it, but THE NEXT DAY I got a message from someone (who actually had good grammar) saying "I hope this isn't going to be Anko / Naruto" I wrote back with a "Hell no, what even made you say that??!"

The juxtaposition of the two was weird.
