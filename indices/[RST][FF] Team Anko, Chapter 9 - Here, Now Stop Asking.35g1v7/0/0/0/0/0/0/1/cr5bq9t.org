This kind of forbidden romance is the best kind of romance, as far as I'm concerned. There are challenges to be overcome, there is plenty of readily made drama and the titillation potential mustn't be forgot either. The problem is that it requires genuine skill to write well. And so there is almost no fiction (fan- or otherwise) that manages to successfully tackle it.
