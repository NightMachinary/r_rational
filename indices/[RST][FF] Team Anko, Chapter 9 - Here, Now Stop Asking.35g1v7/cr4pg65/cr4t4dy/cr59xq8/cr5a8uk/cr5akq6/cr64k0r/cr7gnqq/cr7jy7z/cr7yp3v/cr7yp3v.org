Not.. really. Sending in a ninja-team to go on a kill-spree just means you promptly loose that ninja team. They are out of range of their home links, and thus will loose to any local. Including the medic-nin. You can probably assassinate individuals - infinite Chackra and free access to all known techniques because the polity has leverage on you other than "keep you ignorant" might not help against being murdered in your sleep, but trying it would be a guaranteed suicide gambit with uncertain chances of success. As for poison.. To actually overcome the defenses, you would have to kill a very large proportion of the population. This doesn't count as conquest - it is warfare at WMD levels, and actually pulling it of is neither a simple proposition, nor a safe one.

The poisons that might do that are.. not ones I would want to manufacture, and given the general level of paranoia in the naruto verse I doubt /any/ city will in fact be drawing all their water from one source.

Far more likely that ambitious rulers will start research into ways to make the links reach further. So the various equilibriums could follow one another.
