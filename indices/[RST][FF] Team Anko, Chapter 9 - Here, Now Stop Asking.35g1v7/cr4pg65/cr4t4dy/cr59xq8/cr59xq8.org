Seriously, what? Unless this is just the preferred method of execution or they otherwise have a reason to kill these "donors", that makes zero percent sense. Chakra regens fast. Faster than blood, even, and it isn't like there is any shortage of potential donors in the middle of a city. Just stopping at 30% remaining and yelling "next!" would be faster because they wouldn't have to spend time carting away bodies, and works out to an infinite supply because by the time they ran out of potential donors, the first donor would be have been ready to go again for ages. There is being evil, and there is being stupid. This is just both.
