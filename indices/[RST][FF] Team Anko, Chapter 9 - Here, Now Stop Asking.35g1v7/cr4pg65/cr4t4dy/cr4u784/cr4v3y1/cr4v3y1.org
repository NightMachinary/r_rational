I had wondered about that myself and the theory I came up with is that replacing these people is cheaper than nurturing them back to health. Using your numbers, even at 1% chakra left, there should be side effects to the procedure, such as being unconcious or organs not working properly until you have above y% chakra. Then the question becomes: Why not stop at safer levels like mild exhaustion? I have no working theory about that since essential information is missing (like duration of a single chakra drain). Maybe Naruto just drains the chakra so fast that you couldn't fine tune it and the procedure takes 10 secs per person at most?
