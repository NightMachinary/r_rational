I typically update at the same time, yeah, but I'm already regarding the forum site as a failed experiment. As soon as I can shake loose some tuits I'm going to see if I can find a better platform -- probably some sort of Wordpress. The whole "failed experiment" thing means that I haven't been remembering to update the forum at the same time.
