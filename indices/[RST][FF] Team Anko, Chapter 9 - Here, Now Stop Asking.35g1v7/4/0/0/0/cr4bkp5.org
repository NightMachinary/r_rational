BBCode blows. Things I consider basic, such as the ability to center, are not there. Styling is very limited. I need to maintain HTML versions for FFN and BBCode versions for the forum, etc.

Also, there's little to no discussion on them, which was the entire point -- I wanted a way to respond publicly to reviews / comments. That might develop over time, but it's not worth putting up with BBCode in the interim when I could just find a blogging platform that supports inline replies, looks nicer than PhPBB, and takes HTML.

EDIT: Note that I don't regret doing it. I learned a bunch about a very common piece of software and will now be making a choice based on experience.
