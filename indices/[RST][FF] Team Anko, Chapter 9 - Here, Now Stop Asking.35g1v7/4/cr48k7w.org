Nice scene between Naruto and Hinata, showing their improving relationship. Was interesting seeing how our favourite orange-wearing ninja was getting patched up again, as was Orochimaru's totally unbothered tactic of draining lots of people of Chakra till death just to stabilize the guy.

I wonder what Shino just found out about the hospital basement?

Also, do you post to your website at the same time as you update your FF.net version of this? I've noticed you update the FF version then the website a few hours later a few times recently.
