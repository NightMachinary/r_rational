  Here, the universe starts to rearrange things so that the blue point is unchanged. Causality isn't exactly going backwards, but it is being funnelled in a particular direction. People who descended from others who “should have died” in WW2 start suddenly dying off. Memories shift; records change. By the time you're very close to the blue point, the world is essentially identical to what it would have been had there been no time travelling.

Why can't the universe just create a delusional time traveler who thinks WW2 happened?
