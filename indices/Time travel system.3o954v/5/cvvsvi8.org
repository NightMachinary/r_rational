  Well, a second jump is a time jump that would not happen if the first jump hadn't. So for each arrival in a time jump, you can trace it back to the original jump-point. Then your priority score is the (negative) of the volume of the time-space cone determined by the arrival and original jump-point.

What if the original jump-point is not in the future of your arrival? E.g. make a first jump back, wait in normal time until you've left the past light-cone of your departure point (travelling through space if necessary to avoid being erased by your departure point), and then make a small jump back? You might end up with negative or even imaginary priority, if I'm reading the description right.

I'm fairly sure there's some way in this system to create arbitrarily many duplicates of an object or person, which seems OP, but I can't quite work out the details so maybe it's not possible.
