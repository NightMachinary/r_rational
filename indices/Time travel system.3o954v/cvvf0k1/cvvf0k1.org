This time travel machine is also a teleporter. If you add in self-replication, then a low-priority time traveler can just print out a copy of the time machine, take the copy with them, and then as soon as they start getting to close to their exit-point, enter their copy-machine, and teleport out of the danger zone.

Another problem is that, as I understand it, the timespace volumes of every jump is relative. That means that, potentially, time travelers will appear to have different priority to different observers, which in turn implies that those observer's will have different histories.
