On Earth-sized scales, light cones are basically flat. If we go back in time to kill Hitler when he was sixteen, the universe has 100 years to interpolate between the two fixed points. Statistically, most of the "weird things" should not happen in the last second of those 100 years: a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_bridge][Brownian bridge]] has value close to 0 when /t/ is close to 1. So a second before you time-travel, everything within a light-second of you is basically unchanged.

But most of the interesting bits about history are happening within a light-second of you. So the fixed point of your departure screens off any real effect you might experience. There's only a couple of kinds of things that wouldn't get affected:

- Imagine if aliens 50 light-years away from us listen to our radio broadcasts, and start just in time to catch the end of World War II and send a reply. Then after the time travel, confused humans that remember World War II as we know it get a message from aliens referring to a history without Hitler.
- Maybe with no World War II, there's been a much more successful space program. Things it launched into space sufficiently far might survive, though they'd have to be going at a good fraction of the speed of light to stand a reasonable chance. Say a single, atomic twiddle at any point in time is enough to adjust for the space program. If the alternate-history spaceship made it 1 light-day out, roughly comparable to Voyager 1's distance, then it has a (1 day)/(100 years) chance of "surviving" the time travel: the probability that the twiddle occurs in the last day of those 100 years.

Most things we care about don't look like this. So most things we care about wouldn't be any different. Any future cosmic noise we observe might be different to the extent that our actions influence it to begin with, but to a first approximation, future cosmic noise is just random, anyway.
