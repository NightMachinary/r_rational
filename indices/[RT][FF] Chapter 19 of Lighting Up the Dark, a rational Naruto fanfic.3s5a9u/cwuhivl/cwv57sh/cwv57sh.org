  Canon ninja being one trick ponies as a whole makes sense narratively, but not rationally, imo. You'd just be setting yourself up for hard counters, every 1v1 would be a game of rock paper scissors, like Tenten vs Temari.

I suspect that's more a reflection of Genin limitations. IIRC, it was meant to be a big surprise that Sasuke could do non-Academy ninjutsu /at all/ during the bell test. Expecting the Genin to not only know multiple techniques within their specialisation, but multiple /kinds/ of technique, may be unreasonable given the limited time they've had to train. Of course, some Genin, like the older and supposedly elite Temari, have no excuse that I can see. Meanwhile, J≈çnin appear to have much more diverse abilities - even Maito Gai has some upper-tier techniques that blur the line between taijutsu and ninjutsu.

  With regards to rational!naruto, he's had years to theorize and test tacticts, stealth, deception, etc. vs. ANBU through his pranking. So when he doesn't try to diversify his arsenal and continues to rely solely on shadow clones(even if he uses them really, really creatively), well, that just seems weird and out of character.

I think there are two answers to that. First, /everything/ he does with shadow clones is a product of his experience and training. Shadow clones in human form are just him in greater numbers. Shadow clones in non-human form are just summonable tools. The capabilities of the Shadow Clone Technique in his hands are thus nothing more or less than a direct manifestation of everything he's learned. To him, it's less of a ninjutsu and more of a force multiplier on /himself/.

Second, I think you are overstating the case when it comes to him vs ANBU. He didn't make them, or other high-skill ninja, his primary targets by any means (there's only so much trouble the Hokage's intervention could get him out of), nor was he specifically trying to develop ability as a ninja through his pranking, or to accomplish his pranks in particularly ninja-like ways.
