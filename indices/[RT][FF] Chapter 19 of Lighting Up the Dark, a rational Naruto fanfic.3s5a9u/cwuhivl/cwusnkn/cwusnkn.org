Well what exactly are his options against a team with a wide area defence and a long range offence? The only option I can think of is some sort of bizzare bum rush where Sasuke and Naruto hold a piece of ninja wire between them. Anything else is either blasted away or ineffective.

Maybe if they had time to throw logs at them, but logs can just be blasted to bits and then you're open for a counter. Or if they had traps set up beforehand, which would have been a good idea for a person for whom "many hands make light work" is not just a catechism, but a way of life.
