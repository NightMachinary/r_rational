How can naruto's every strategy revolve around a technique he learned within the past 6 months?

Canon ninja being one trick ponies as a whole makes sense narratively, but not rationally, imo. You'd just be setting yourself up for hard counters, every 1v1 would be a game of rock paper scissors, like Tenten vs Temari.

With regards to rational!naruto, he's had years to theorize and test tacticts, stealth, deception, etc. vs. ANBU through his pranking. So when he doesn't try to diversify his arsenal and continues to rely solely on shadow clones(even if he uses them really, really creatively), well, that just seems weird and out of character.

Though to be fair, I suppose he can feel like nothing so far warrants revealing whatever he has hidden up his sleeve.
