My teenage boy is showing, but I'd probably end up figuring out how to have a one-night-stand with all my crushes. (Or discovering I don't actually /want/ to, depending on how the conversations go.) At the very least, the lack of consequences mean I'd talk to attractive people - people in general, TBH - far more often.

I'd probably make a great deal of art, since I'm usually OK with scrapping stuff after I've finished. I suspect I'd be far more willing to do physically dangerous but enjoyable things, like climbing the outside of a building. I'd spend a lot of time in thinly-veiled philosophical discussion about my situation - I might even post it to Reddit.

I really hope the loop hit at a point where I was at the "fit" point of my exercise-laze around cycle, where I have internet, and where I'm well-rested (or I can at least /get/ well-rested rather than "resetting".)

I suspect my paranoia would drive me to find some easily-verified prediction that I could check at the beginning of each day, to reassure myself that I'm ... well, honestly, if I /was/ delusional I'm not sure I'd notice, but it would at least give me some peace of mind.

EDIT: Oh, I would also unquestionably snap and kill a few people at some point for getting in my way.
