One possibility you forgot is that whatever mechanism is moving you back in time is /editing/ the past you's brain to have your memories, reflexes, etc. without actually copying the entire brain, so chemicals in your brain wouldn't be taken back in time. Remember that you're in a freaking time loop, the thing causing it could be omnipotent. That's how Innortal's loops work.
