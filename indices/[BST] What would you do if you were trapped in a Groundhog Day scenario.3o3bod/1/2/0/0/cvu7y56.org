Or some alternative hypotheses:

A) you could be a transdimensional being that seems to time-skip but you're really just in an alternate dimension where time is slightly displaced (by exactly 24 hours for some reason?)

B) you could be a Boltzmann brain that "just so happens" to rewrite itself to simulate an outside world that keeps repeating (perhaps the 24 hour periodicity come from some sort of orbital or pulsar activity)
