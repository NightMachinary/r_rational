Sorry for such a long post. I had a really detailed answer which I already posted to another thread, but for a month-long loop.

First of all I'd assume that someone near me put me in this loop and is paying attention to what I do. So I would maintain regular routine for at least the first fifty to hundred loops. It would be easy to keep from getting bored since I'm a college student and what I study (or use for entertainment) can vary by a significant amount from day to day. I'd also memorize significant events that happen(ed) to the people around me +as well as lottery tickets/stock prices+ so I can commit simple crimes for some fast, hard cash in preparation for future loops. Note that I'm assuming there's at least the possibility whoever placed me into a time loop doesn't have ultimate power to spy on me whenever they want, since my loop might be an accident and I really don't want any other loopers to force me into a permanent cycle of dying every day or worse (making it so I never existed in the first place).

Depending on whether or not I notice anyone else acting differently, I'd then start spying on them as a seeming non-looper, or concluding that I'm (possibly) alone. If I'm alone, I'd first investigate the mechanism behind the loop before having fun with it.

My first theory is that my body is just moved backwards in time (or to a near-identical parallel universe) and eliminating my younger self. I would check for any changes to my body because aging in the loop is really, really, really, really bad. After that would be checks for any weird physical changes that aren't related to aging like pains, losing energy, infection, color changes, or anything else out of the normal. Extremely through and expensive hospital check overs are done after the waiting phase.

After going over my body, I then check the second theory where my brain-state is being copied at the end of each loop and overwriting the version from yesterday. This theory means that all physical changes to the neurons in my brain such as new memories, instincts/reflexes, and brain DAMAGE will be carried over. I'd test my reflexes (since reflex is partially a function of brain behavior) and different types of memories (topographic/spatial, episodic, declarative, procedural, semantic, and anything else I can get from a biology textbook on the brain). I would figure out some way to get an MRI scan of my brain over multiple loops to look for physical changes to the brain. I would be very careful about activities that can damage the head, addiction to drugs, or psychological torture. One way to test for this is to inject a harmless chemical to dye parts of the brain and look for the chemical via brain scans in the next loop. It's done all the time in animal experiments with no harm done. This theory implies that my brain will probably degrade into senility, develop cancer, or some other disorder in a few centuries from the aging. Not as bad as the first theory, but not as good as I would hope.

The third theory is that at the start of each loop, I'm living a hyper-realistic dream where a year in dream time is like a second when awake. Then my memories are sent back in time as part of an even longer dream. You can pick up reflexes in dream, since sleep is when the brain consolidates one's memories for permanent long-term storage and muscle memories are also stored in the brain (definitely not the muscle and I really dislike that bad terminology). However, ingrained reflexes will be lost or severely degraded at the start of each loop since it takes time for the brain to re-adapt to the new neural structures being rebuilt over and over. This is the best theory for myself since no physical problems will carry over, but it makes it harder to preserve information (read identity or memories) perfectly. According to information theory, error-free copying is very hard (I suspect impossible once one goes above a certain level of complexity).

If all of these theories are false and I'm starting each loop with no detectable physical change, then I'd be forced to spend a lot more time on general human biology for anything that might be changing about me without my notice due to my lack of biological knowledge. If there's still nothing else I can discover changing about me, then this means that the "information" of my memories are being somehow stored outside of my body and I'd be investigating the possibility of being in a hyper-realistic stimulation, having a soul, or something even weirder.

These are the first few things I'd test once I'm convinced that I am in a time loop since knowing how it affects me is crucial to knowing what's worth learning or not (as well as knowing in advance any potential problems the loops may cause). If I'm relearning something every loop, then I'd mostly ignore combat training to focus on memorizing information or mental tricks such as cooking, medical knowledge, and so on. But if I'm building on reflexes I trained into instinct, then I'd devote loops to combat, sewing, crafting, archery, riflery, and all of the tedious reflexive work I want to know.

NOW for the meat of the time loops!

I'd spend time learning, just learning about a lot of things. One of the biggest distractions for me is daily life. But now I don't have to worry about regular responsibilities such as getting good grades, money to survive, socializing with friends/family, and other necessities to function daily in society without ruining my future. One potential issue is consuming goods such as movies, comics, games, and other pleasure activities that just waste time. But once I spend a lot of loops entertaining myself with stuff like that, I'd run out of new material and be forced to actually pursue constructive goals where I create instead of consuming (hopefully this happens instead of me being a phenomenally lazy meat-sack of a couch potato). Spending time just learning or practicing is an inevitable state unless I have enemies/problems to deal with. After all if I have nothing else to do, then practice will be my defense against boredom and being creative and learning acts as it's own source of entertainment and healthy mental well-being.

I would train myself up to talented amateur or journeyman level in as many fields as possible. Mastery level is for areas that I have an extreme interest in or is required for whatever task I wish to accomplish in a particular loop (hacking FBI, dominating the world's economy, public speaking/blackmailing/politicking my way into USA presidency). No one can get 100% completion in life and I really don't want to break my mind trying.

In addition to learning new areas, I would spend time on physical conditioning no matter which theory is true. Even if my body doesn't gain any muscle and I can't improve it in any possible way from loop-to-loop, I'd still work on some strength training. It's possible to train the body to exert more strength if you can ignore the pain. While it's damaging if you start out lifting 200 pounds when you never done any weight-lifting in your life, you can learn to force more strength out of the same pre-loop body with a stronger willpower. Which is too useful to not learn how to do even if it's going to ruin the body for the rest of the loop. Also agility and reflex training should be more mental than physical. I'd have to talk to a body builder, doctor, and professional trainers to actually know what to test for and work on, but it should be possible to improve myself even with a static body.

Aside from learning and investigating quirks of the time loop and its influence on my body, I'd spend time experimenting and inventing. Since mistakes cost me nothing more than time, I can do things that would bankrupt governments and destroy continents to enable me to discover and advance technology and scientific theories.

Finally I'll try to make myself grow as a person through repetitive practice and hypercompetence, because as the first potential transhuman (with immortality via time loop, you are transhuman) I want the version of me at the end of the loops to be someone I approve of, a good person.....or one who prefers to cooperate, but can crush you like a bug if you are rude.

In summary, my list of things to do is:

- Wait and Watch

- Investigate

- Learn and Experiment/Invent

- Have periodic time loops where I set myself nigh-impossible goals to make myself grow as a person, shock and awe the masses, and to signal other potential time loopers.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/681915/Innortal][Innortal]] has good ideas and a lot of the magic stuff I probably can replicate with advanced technology after a few million loops. Now that I think of it, there's a lot of stuff on anime that I would love to reenact in real-life. Heh, heh, heh, heh....

I honestly can't predict the odds between me going insane, becoming a hyper-competent real-life Mary Sue, breaking down into Cthulu level of w*E*/i/R*d*, something utterly impossible for present-me to comprehend (yes I can imagine cthulu-like weirdness), or some mixture of the above by the end of the loops if it goes on for a few millennia. But it'll be a blast!

PS There's not too much difference to me between New York and some tiny, isolated village in the middle of nowhere as long as I have access to the Internet. The Internet is the time-looper's best friend with access to unlimited information and once I develop my hacking skills enough, I probably can trick governments into sending me anything I need through chartered jet flights and illegal transactions of obscene amounts of money.

But if I didn't have any access to the Internet during the loop? For the rest of my very, /very/, *very*, */very/*, */VERY/* long lifespan?......well there's going to be a lot of property damage...................I think I read something somewhere about how to synthesize thermite......
