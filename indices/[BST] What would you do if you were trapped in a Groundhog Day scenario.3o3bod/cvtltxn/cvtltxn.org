If I know the day is going to stop eventually, I should spend some time researching any lotteries that run on that particular day, and buy the winning tickets for them each day.

Though the real answer is...I have no idea. If the loop lasts more than a couple of years, I suspect the Salivanth who finishes the loop will consider the Salivanth of today to be an idiot, if past trends continue to be accurate. If 2500 years is the average? There's really no way to tell what I might think of given that amount of time.
