I think you misunderstood me. The second theory is checking if my brain is being overwritten which is covering the possibility of a physical change. You're right that I was thinking about a total change in my brain, but if it's a partial edit, then there should still be some physical signs of changing neural structures such as changes in memory and different organization of data as I move from novice to expert in multiple skills. Of course, we might not have the technology yet or the ability to interpret this sort of change with existing tech.
