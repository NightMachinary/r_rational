Unlikely, the average age of a nobel prize winner is like 40, far too much to learn. I was never suggesting that- I'd seek to get political power from politicians- I could find blackmail material, whatever, and get actual scientists to run experiments that could be done in a day and produce easily digestible results.

I wouldn't memorize models. I'd memorize the result, like the shape of the molecules that cured breast cancer, or the gps coordinates of oil.
