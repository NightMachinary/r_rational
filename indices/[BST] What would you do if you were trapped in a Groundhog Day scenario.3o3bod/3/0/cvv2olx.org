Do you really believe your memory is up to the task? Genuinely curious- in theory, I really love the idea but personally I think it would be a lost cause.

Training yourself to be an expert in many fields? Possible, there's an experience factor there that would help you retain it (although there's a limiting factor: a day really isn't enough to do many of the projects/experiences that I think would help you achieve mastery). And I like your experiment ideas, brute forcing these would be tedious but I agree would be of great value. But just flat our memorizing the location of all the data needed for models, "new rare earth mineral deposits, oil deposits, rare species"...?
