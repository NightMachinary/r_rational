You start out by doing all the good you can, finding out about preventable accidents in your area. You can't counsel your friends in any way that'll stick, but you can find out what makes them happy and give it to them. Spend your money on gifts and donations - it's not like there's any point in keeping it.

And while there's limits to how much you can get done in 24 hours, you can do a lot. You can get to the other side of the world with hours to spare. You can meet people. Collect phone numbers and e-mail addresses, those'll still work the next day.

Yet it's funny. The more you do to help people, the more they seem like robots or second-rate AIs. Stimulus, response. Give the same stimulus and you get the same response. The dialogue trees branch out in your mind's eye. It's just like a computer game, with its good endings and its bad ones. And once you've found the best ending, with no higher branches to strive for... well, it would get repetitive just doing the best path over and over. Why not try one of the bad endings?

The first time you kill someone on purpose, you're horrified at yourself. But it gets easier. Running and fighting is thrilling - scary, but you're in no real danger so it's like the best amusement park ride there ever was. And competence is thrilling too - fighting to the death is something no other human could practice! It's actually surprising how easy it is to outfight trained soldiers, break into secure areas.

And you're learning so much! In their last moments, your friends show remarkable bursts of courage, or weakness, or bloodlust, or honour. They reveal sides of their character that nobody imagined was there. You come to know them far better than they know themselves. You know their weaknesses, neuroses, and obsessions. Now you can break them in far more creative ways.

Some days you feel disgusted at yourself, and resolve to be a better person. This has no long-term consequences for anyone but you.

After a few subjective decades of this, immortality wears you down. You've seen all there is to see, done all there is to do. Or at least, a representative sample of it. New experiences were the only thing that kept you going for so long, and now they've run out. There's no point in getting up in the morning. Whatever you were planning to do today can wait. There's always tomorrow.

There's always tomorrow.
