Well.

I'd certainly find out if there's a point in which I've consumed enough fiction and / or video games that I can start back over at the beginning of the list and work my way through it in time to not be bored by making it to the end of the list and working back through it.

Then there's the fun of eventually seeing what happens why the brain runs out of space to store new memories.

If I reach a point where there's more shit in my head than should reasonably fit there, then it's moderate confirmation that they're being stored outside time / space somehow, which is sure would be something interesting for someone to study to whatever degree they can while relying on whatever I can relay to them between resets.

It gets real fun if they eventually figure out how to manipulate and / or replicate the effect.
