  The more you do to help people, the more they seem like robots or second-rate AIs. Stimulus, response. Give the same stimulus and you get the same response. The dialogue trees branch out in your mind's eye. It's just like a computer game, with its good endings and its bad ones. And once you've found the best ending, with no higher branches to strive for... well, it would get repetitive just doing the best path over and over. Why not try one of the bad endings?

This would make for a great MMORPG premise. Basically the world loops at variable intervals with PCs learning where to maximize/mine resources, how to best influence NPCs through optimal conversation trees, etc.

Each new patch for the game would be something like day #2, or week #3, etc.

The biggest flaw I foresee is the reset button timing -- everyone will want to squat at the same respawn/restart sites, so there's probably have to be a local sever for each time zone.
