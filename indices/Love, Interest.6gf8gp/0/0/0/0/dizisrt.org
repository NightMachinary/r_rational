Are there any ways to money pump a human that don't expose the imbalance clearly enough that the slow consistency-finding process wouldn't immediately patch it? I can't think of any. This does not mean that intransitive preferences in humans don't exist, it just means humans intuitively try to fix them where they can.

Maybe if you take a static snapshot of a human's preference ordering, it would be VNM rational. I can't find a way to demonstrate otherwise. However, it's quite obvious that preferences are not stable over time. The evening human buys an irritating alarm clock to undermine the temporary preferences of the morning human. We drink and sleep and expose ourselves to deeply transformative influences without trepidation, we don't genuinely aspire to stability. We subject ourselves to mode shifts we might never come back from, and I'd argue that we do that so frequently that if you found a utility function that implements it, it would boil down to "It's good to implement this state machine". We lack the character of a utility function(if I as someone who is not a practicing mathematician have the right to characterize the utility function construct.. perhaps not). We are state machines that sometimes use utility functions.

I suppose I can't argue on mathematical grounds that such a thing wouldn't be a utility function.

I guess the disagreement is about pragmatics, when I say "utility function", I don't mean the mathematical construct, I'm talking about a machine part. If you see a utility function out in the world it's because someone built it. If a human built it, they probably would have made it behave far more.. temporally consistently.. than any human is. Many of the consequences of that elegant temporal consistency will appear monstrously strange. I wonder if it will seem monstrous enough that future, moderate FAI advocates would argue that too much consistency is bad.
