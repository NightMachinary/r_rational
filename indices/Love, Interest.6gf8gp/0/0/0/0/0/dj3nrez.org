Actually, I don't think we disagree too much. True, I was implicitly referring to a "static snapshot", as you put it. The point I was making in the first part of my comment is relevant to both humans and non-humans equally, or perhaps even more so to humans, as we have basically no control over the miasma of chemicals and so forth that our brains are steeped in.

If you're grumpy because you're hungry or tired, that's a good example of "your" utility function changing because of "outside" forces. I say "your", in quotes, because treating the new version of you as a wholly different agent is probably more correct. As for "outside", well, it's physically inside your body, but it's outside your zone of control.

Anyway, the main point of my comment was that things like this apply to all agents. A smart agent tries to minimize this kind of influence, and a superintelligence is probably going to be really good at it (in the same way it's good at everything). We, as humans, are bad at it, as you point out. So in practice, yes. Superintelligences you encounter are going to change over time a lot less than us, simply because they are better optimizers. Still, it's a quantitative difference, not a qualitative one the way implied by your original comment.

I think that's important to remember. But all in all, I do agree with you about the pragmatics of monstrous temporal consistency in superintelligent AIs. But! That's a good thing, a necessary thing, especially for Friendly AI. If we manage to build an FAI, the absolutely last thing we'd want is for it to change its mind! Mindspace is wide enough that a UFAI which changes its mind isn't going to stumble into being Friendly, whereas an FAI which changes its mind most likely won't retain its Friendliness.

Too much consistency is /not/ bad. Our lack of it is probably our greatest failure as human beings. And I absolutely hope that we'll be able to build a consistent FAI in the future, because the only alternative is UFAI.
