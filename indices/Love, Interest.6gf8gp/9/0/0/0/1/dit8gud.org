Ah, sorry for the confusion. Nothing for short stories comes to mind straight away.

In terms of long form, though, "The Practical Guide to Evil" web serial is pretty good.

Not sci-fi or genre, but "A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius" by David Eggers is pretty amazing. It manages to live up it it's title. It's worth reading in print because he subverts so many conventions that it would be almost impossible to do it well in an e-book. Maybe get a copy at your local library or something. On top of that, it's actually a memoir. In the original print he actually included the phone numbers of all of the principle people so you could call them and confirm the veracity of his story . . . yet it still manages to both deconstruct and reconstruct the memoir.
