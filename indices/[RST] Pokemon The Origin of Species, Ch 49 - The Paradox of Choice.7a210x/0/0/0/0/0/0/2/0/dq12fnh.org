I may be wrong, but I immediately caught that she was talking about Mewtwo, setting up a potential empathic relationship between it and Red. In addition, I believe that when Red passes out it's because he inadvertently accessed Sabrina's memories of Mewtwo, and so she knocked him out and potentially edited his mind. Did that occur to you, or did you/do you think that was a genuine training accident?
