I'm going to be fairly disappointed if Red does not take Sabrina up on the offer. Developing his abilities seems really time sensitive in a way a lot of his other goals do not, and every single one of his goals is improved by improving his abilities in this regard. Training Pokemon becomes significantly easier, battling becomes significantly easier, he gains new forms of perception which could alert him to ambush by wild pokemon, and otherwise improve his ability to keep himself and his friends safe.

Putting aside the fact that he would be learning more or less the current state of craft from one of the few practitioners not actively hostile to scientific inquiry, and putting aside the fact that she could teach him skills and abilities no one else could, and putting aside that she would provide valuable knowledge of the broader social context of the craft and of various tidbits of knowledge that have not yet managed to make their way into any book, putting aside all of those things, studying with Sabrina would give him access to a network of other psychics in various states of training, in which he could easily solicit volunteers for surveys, studies and experiments. There is no way the character portrayed in this story so far could study with her for so much as a month without coming up approximately 1 'a lot' of potential publishable papers and directions for future research.

Every bit of extra skill and capacity with his psychic abilities would prove extremely useful to future research, where it could be used to quickly identify a variety of traits of individual pokemon that would be otherwise be extremely hard/expensive to test for. Like, if there are a variety of medical conditions which could otherwise explain away the anomalous data for certain outliers, a full suite of diagnostics might prove too expensive to integrate into a study, but using his psychic abilities, he could narrow down the symptoms to a much more manageable set. Or in a study where uncooperative pokemon were introducing too much random noise into the experiment, improving compliance with the kind of hypnotic skill Sabrina was demonstrating could easily fix things (assuming behavior wasn't the thing being studied, but some physical attribute like strength or agility). I just imagine how many real-world biologists would kill for those kinds of abilities with respect to their research.

Red's reluctance to spend even a year or two on something like this just seems really puzzling.
