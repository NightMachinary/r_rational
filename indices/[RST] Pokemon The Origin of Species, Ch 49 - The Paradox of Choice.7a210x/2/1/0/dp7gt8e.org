This honestly seems to me like turning down a chance to go to Hogwarts because one feels there are already so many witches and wizards, so what could one possibly contribute? There seem to be no major researchers who are psychic in this universe, and the number of researchers studying psychic phenomenon is small, if still non-zero as we found out this chapter. The goal of studying wouldn't be to become a world-class psychic, but to at the very least become a reasonably competent practitioner of the craft, so that one could bring the mindset of a researcher to a fairly under-developed and under-investigated subject.
