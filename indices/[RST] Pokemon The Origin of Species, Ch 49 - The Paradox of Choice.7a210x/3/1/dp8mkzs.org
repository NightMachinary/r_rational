Agreed. Though I'd not thought of it that way before. Also makes the varius techniques seem more practical when applied to everyday situations not end of the world.

Also the fact that the focus is spread across the 3 main protagonists and some pretty competent side characters helps a lot. If the main character was both a super competent scientist and a champion trainer it would strain disbelief a lot more. Also means that they can take turns being right and wrong in a more realistic way.
