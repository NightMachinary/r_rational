Bulbapedia has it as episode 92, /The Joy of Pokemon/, though in the list I sourced the episode itself it was 94.

There's also Gary's Krabby, which we first see in EP013 compared to Ash's much smaller Krabby. We see it again in EP65 and it's almost as big as a Kingler. Not that that stop's Ash's Krabby from evolving into a full-grown Kingler when he madly uses it, unbattled, to fight in the Pokemon League.
