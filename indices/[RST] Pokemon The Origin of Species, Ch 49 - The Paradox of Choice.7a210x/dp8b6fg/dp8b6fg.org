Y'know, I was just thinking the other day that one of my frustrations with a lot of rational fiction is that despite the emphasis placed on problem solving and plot progression that's realistic and replicable, too many plots are centered around the premise of the main character being THE hero of their setting, or otherwise somehow uniquely positioned to make a difference in their world.

One of the things I've realized I absolutely love about this story is just how normal and unremarkable the main characters are. Sure, they're smart, Red's a psychic, and they've got their connections to noteworthy people, but those aren't the driving forces in the story. The trio and Aiko are mostly concerned with trying to drive their day-to-day activities into larger, long term goals, and having to contend mostly with the fact that everyone around them is doing the same thing.

Also nice that despite the unrealness of the Pokemon setting, Red is still grappling with pretty mundane, real world dilemmas - different career options, demands on his time, reputation and relationship maintenance.

It's really a breath of fresh air.
