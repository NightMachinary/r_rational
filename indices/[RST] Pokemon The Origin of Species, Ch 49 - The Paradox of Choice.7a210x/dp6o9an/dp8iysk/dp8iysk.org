  Red's reluctance to spend even a year or two on something like this just seems really puzzling.
#+end_quote

Red isn't a perfect rational actor remember, he's a human being. Here's a few emotional reasons he might be reluctant:

- He has an emotional connection to travelling with his friends, he has repeatedly talked about how this is one of the most enjoyable times of his life and he probably doesn't want that journey to end soon.

- He's still very uncomfortable about his psychic powers and strongly associates them with deep grief and pain.

- Also he's been told that Sabrina is manipulative and potentially dangerous, by someone he trusts. Being her pupil would put him diectly in her power in a very real way. So some caution is understandable.

Also, learning about psychic powers doesn't seem particularly time sensitive right now, but other things he could do would be. E.g. the immediate benefits of attention and momentum to his research career. Opportunities that come dirctly from travelling with Blue and Leaf, etc.
