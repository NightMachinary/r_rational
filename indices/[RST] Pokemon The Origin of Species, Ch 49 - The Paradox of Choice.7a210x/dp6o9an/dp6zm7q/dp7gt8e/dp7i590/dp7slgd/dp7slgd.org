Ah but the thing is, studying with the Sabrina would the fastest way he could get to any level of psychic proficiency he wants. If he wants to just become a well informed practitioner and then leave, he has that option. And when he leaves, Sabrina could probably offer him the best possible advice for future self-guided development of his powers.

I know that Red wants to be a fantastic professor, and is always trying to align his choices with that goal. But psychic powers are an incredible advantage, and Sabrina didn't even ask Red to commit himself to her tutelage for years; in fact she didn't bring up a time frame at all if I'm remembering correctly. And if Red can get free teleportation down before he has to make a decisions, then it's possible he could work out a way to not even has to leave his friends.

Turning down Sabrina as a teacher feels like shunning an incredible opportunity, simply because it does not align perfectly with your own goals. Becoming a better psychic might not directly help Red become a better professor, but it would certainly help him in that endeavor. And Sabrina is, so far, the fastest way he knows to become a better psychic.
