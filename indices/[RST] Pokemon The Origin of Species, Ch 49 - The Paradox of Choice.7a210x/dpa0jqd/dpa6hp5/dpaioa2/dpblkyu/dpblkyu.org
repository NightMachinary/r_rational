Sure! So the idea of culturally aligned city-states is pretty much correct: each city and town has a democratically elected mayor, legislators, chief of police, district court judges, etc.

Above that, the cities and towns send representatives to the Regional Council, which serves as the legislative body, the Regional Court, which is its judicial body, etc. The executive branch is headed by the president, who is chosen by the only region-wide election, since all he's tasked to do is oversee the other Regional bodies and make sure they follow its constitution, which can differ from place to place.

Each region's League, its Elite 4 and current Champion, functions as its domestic defense and potential war council. No democracy here, it's all merit of pokemon battling.

Rangers are the closest thing to a military that most regions have, but their focus is of course on pokemon, not neighboring states, which are more the focus of the League/Gyms if war is on the horizon. The Rangers are a separate political body that are also not elected: instead the organization is run by the successors of the previous generation, with a hierarchy that's topped by a Ranger General, who's elected by the Captains that are in charge of smaller locations, and answers to the League, though they're funded by the region as whole as part of the legislators' budget.

Kanto and Johto is a somewhat unique in that each has a separate Regional body for their various branches, but their League, the Elite 4 and Champion, is shared. Together they make up the Indigo League.
