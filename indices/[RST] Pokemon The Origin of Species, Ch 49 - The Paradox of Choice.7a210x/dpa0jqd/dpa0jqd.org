I'm not sure where best to put some of my comments from my reread, so they may as well go here.

In [[http://daystareld.com/pokemon-18/][Chapter 18]] there is a random NPC named Aiko in Viridian woods during the forest fire. Now, is it impossible for two different people in the same country to have the same name, no. Does it make the reader go "Wait, is that..?" unnecessarily, yes. The author should do with this information what they will.

Also, I got to the part again with one of my favorite moments of the early story: Leaf's interview with the mayor of Pewter. I really love the seeds its planting about the political reality of the world. Its subtle and brilliant, a wonderful portrayal of small town political intrigue, with grander external implications.

Which now, in light of the discussion about the Fighting gym leader and Sabrina, I am even more curious about how exactly the Indigo government is structured. Is there a civilian branch of the Indigo league government? Like, Mayor is to Leader as X is to Champion? I'm also curious about some more noodley political organizational things like there is actually a political organization that is "Kanto" and "Johto," or are they mostly just culturally aligned city-states with a historical feudal bond.
