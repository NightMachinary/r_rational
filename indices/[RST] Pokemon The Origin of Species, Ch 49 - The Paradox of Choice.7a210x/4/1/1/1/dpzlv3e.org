Hm. You can teleport between fixed points in Silph and the Saffron Gym. In emergencies, you teleport yourself to the last safe place you visited; any teleporting Pokemon you have follow the same rule. Talking to other Trainers who are apparently you on a different timeline isn't just possible, it's essential to completing the Pokedex. You have what appears to be the ability to either see the future or loop time, and messing up can create all sorts of interesting problems.

Oh, and your subjective time can go hours:seconds, and you always know your Pokemon's exact status.
