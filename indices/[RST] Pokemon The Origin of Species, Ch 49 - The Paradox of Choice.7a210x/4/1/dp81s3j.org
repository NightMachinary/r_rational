  I can't find more than one or two good psychic MC pokemon fics (that don't either make all Pokemon so sentient that the entire setting becomes barbaric; or just kind of ignore the powers) had been a constant source of frustration for me.

It is by far the most underutilized aspect of the world in the anime (what I've seen of it) and games, and possibly the manga, which I haven't read yet.

How awesome would it be if they released a pokemon game where the main character was psychic, and could detect pokemon hiding nearby or get a hint in combat as to what the opponent is about to do or bond better with their pokemon the way Pokemon Amie currently works? As far as I know no fan game has tried to utilize it either, which means we'll all have to wait for [[/u/ketura]] 's before we get the chance.
