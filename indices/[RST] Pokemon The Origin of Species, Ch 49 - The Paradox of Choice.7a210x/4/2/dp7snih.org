Eh, I'm not convinced Sabrina is the most /powerful/ psychic trainer. Perhaps the most /popular,/ or maybe even just the most /famous/ or even /infamous./ Nothing she's done so far paints her as particularly powerful, just uniquely driven and has a bit of edge for her age, and is kind of "normal" for a psychic so people like her. She is probably one of the most politically powerful psychics in Kanto, and for that reason I would think Red avoiding her tutelage would be sort of a mistake.

But, I totally understand Red's perspective and decision. He is a shy teenage boy who has already suddenly been thrust into like three separate public spheres (celebrity, researching, psychicd), something he is clearly not comfortable with from their dinner conversation, and then to suddenly be invited to one of the highest levels of those spheres on a random afternoon, I wouldn't just say yes right away.

Plus, Red is a teenage boy that has shown some romantic interest in girls. I don't think it would be in appropriate to suggest that their may be some other anxieties in play during his interaction with a young, attractive, and powerful woman wearing a short pink tank top in a cafe.
