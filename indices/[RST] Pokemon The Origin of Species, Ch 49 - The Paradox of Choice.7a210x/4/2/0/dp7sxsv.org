To be honest my view of Sabrina as the most powerful comes from the cartoons and some half-remembered quotes from the games, and the fact that Mew-two (if I remember correctly) described as being more powerful than all the other psychics at Giovanni's disposal. And considering Giovanni seems pretty well-connected and powerful, and Mew-two is his most important project that we know of, I feel like he would have gone out of his ways to recruit the best psychics possible.

So even though Sabrina hasn't been explicitly stated as the most powerful psychic training in the actual fic, I feel like there is definitely enough evidence to infer that she is at least one of the most powerful in the region, and not just for her age.

And I also understand Red's perspective, and his decision not decide right away. I just feel like after some thought, his answer should be yes unless some new information comes up.
