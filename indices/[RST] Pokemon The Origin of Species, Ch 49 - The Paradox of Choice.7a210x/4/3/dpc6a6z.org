Although they aren't in the games, I feel equally fascinated about the concept of Dark humans.

Though it probably would work well in the games especially since in Japan it is known as the Evil-type. Though Pokemon OoS makes it clear that the Dark trait is primarily that of being psychically blank or null, the games portray it as a combination of psychic immunity and dirty fighting. Or as you and I might call it, smart fighting.
