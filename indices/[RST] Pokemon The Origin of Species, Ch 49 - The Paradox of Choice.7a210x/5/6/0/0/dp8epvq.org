You're very welcome!

Going off on a tangent here but I *love* your writing. I was giggling and smiling like mad while reading the latest chapter with tons of possibilities and metaphors running through my head. Seriously, Yudowsky's and your writing make me rethink my whole life.

I especially loved the part where Sabrina comes up with a novel solution to penetrate Red's shields ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) on the fly. It was really creative albeit quasi-brute force (esp. when compared to Mewtwo's really nuanced undetectable bypassing, which I know is a very unfair comparison). I was half expecting Red to ward off sabrina for typical protagonist reasons but I was pleasantly surprised. You did an excellent job at illustrating:\\
- that sabrina is supposed to be powerful AND smart in the use of her powers. Basically a psychic savant.\\
- That there are other highly intelligent characters which Red has to look out for.\\
- That strengths can be converted into weaknesses given the right context. The whole tapping to beat and going with the flow thing made me think among other things if my love for music can somehow be taken advantage of.

I also love your usage of phrases like 'alien/inhuman pattern' for the droplets and 'colours that can't be described' for psychic EM-waves.

Also this is probably the first unfinished fanfic whose updation process I'm personally witnessing. Feels great! Thank you for doing such a fantastic job.

P.S. : Sorry for making this so long. Had to stop myself or it would've devolved into an essay.
