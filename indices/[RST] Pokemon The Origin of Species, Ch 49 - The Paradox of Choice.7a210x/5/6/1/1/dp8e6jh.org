Well, given that the majority of the intended audience isn't aware of the correct usage of the word, I don't think it's justified to use the word incorrectly and call it sensible because of it.\\
Don't get me wrong. I'm not trying to be pedantic, it's just that I'm /from/ the land of chai (I make a good cuppa too :P ) and it's extremely jarring to hear 'chai-tea' being used anywhere (I'll admit some personal bias too. XD) Also chai doesn't necessarily refer to just a single type of tea. I'm from a household that's used to nearly 4 types of chai on a fairly regular basis.\\
Cheers :)
