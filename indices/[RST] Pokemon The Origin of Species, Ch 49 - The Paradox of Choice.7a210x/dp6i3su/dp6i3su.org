Hey everyone, welcome back! Not much to announce this month, but lots of thanks to my patrons for their continued support, and to my new patrons for motivating me all over again to make this story the best it can be. I'm still working on the second chapter of Guardian too, and hope to finish it by next month. Thanks for reading, and all feedback appreciated as usual!
