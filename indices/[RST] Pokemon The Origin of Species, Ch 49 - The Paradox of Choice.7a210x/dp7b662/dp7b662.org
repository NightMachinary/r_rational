You see, I've always loved the concept of psychic humans in Pokemon. Their existence has driven almost all of my best tinfoil theories, the episodes in the cartoon that feature them are my favorite, and the fact that, despite endless searching, I can't find more than one or two good psychic MC pokemon fics (that don't either make all Pokemon so sentient that the entire setting becomes barbaric; or just kind of ignore the powers) had been a constant source of frustration for me.

So when I saw that Red, a main character in an exceptionally well written fanfic about rationality, was a Psychic... words cannot even describe how excited I was. I simply could not wait to see how a rational character would react to having that sort of powers. The Misty chapters only heightened that excitement. I wanted to see if Red's point of view would be changed from the expansion of his own perceptive powers. And while I was kind of OK with the fledgling nature of Red's powers, and realistic exploration of grief and mourning that came with it , and I realized that power spikes weren't really a part of rational fiction... part of me wanted the story to skip to the part where Red was at least as powerful a Misty, just for my own personal gratification, plotting and characterization be damned.

And now that Red has gotten an offer to train under the most power psychic in the country... I don't think I could forgive the character if he passed that up. Training under Sabrina would give him access to a whole variety of psychic Pokemon to study, as well as expanding his own ability to better study all Pokemon and making him stand out more in the research field (because while I know that in this universe Professors must make use of psychics, I have yet to hear about an actually psychic Professor).

And not only would expanded perceptive powers make Red's narrative more easy to read, it would also allow the fic to explore new areas. Is the mistrust psychics face justified? Are there any areas in the world where they face discrimination, or are intentionally marginalized? Are there no psychic Professors because psychics in the field face discrimination? If Alakazam really is as intelligent as a three year old child, is it also as sentient? If so, are there struggles unique to training Alakazam and other intelligent psychic Pokemon? There are so many questions surrounding psychic Pokemon, that I don't really see how Red immersing himself in the psychic world wouldn't help also become a better researcher, simply by the virtue of exposing him to so many useful things.

And also I'd like to point out how good the writing is: I only noticed later that Blue gave Red a speech about how much easier life becomes when people know about you, and like you, directly after Red was offered an opportunity he only received because he (unintentionally) made himself known within the psychic community.
