Something to note: in many rational stories featuring young protagonists, for them to accomplish anything in a world of adults means that, unless they are actively resisting or subverting society, the adults are letting them do that. One way to make that work, as in this story, is for that to be normal: it's a dangerous world and the kids are expected to grow up fast, and do.

But another common thread in rational fiction is that the protagonist kids are often the only ones who actually do any of that, or at least that the reader gets to see. Sure, 10 year olds are routinely handed powerful elemental powers and sent unsupervised into dangerous forests to battle deadly monstrosities and that's normal. But how many other ten-year-olds are getting published in scientific journals, newspapers, and acquiring large followings from the public and public figures alike?

I know that they are exceptional in many ways and have a certain amount of privilege that lubricates some of those successes. But maybe a peek into the accomplishments and extra-curricular activities of their peers would serve for some world-building.

Such characters, properly developed, might also make good outgroup rivals, friendly or otherwise.
