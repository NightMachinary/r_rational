Reviews on fanfic work for reread comments, but this is fine too :)

I try not to worry about name duplication among minor characters that people aren't expected to remember in their first read through :) I'm bad at naming characters and in a story like this I think it would get weirder if there aren't at least some same names, even if that's a standard allowance for most fiction.

I'm glad you liked the mayor scene! I plan on expanding on the way the government works eventually, but if you want I can tell you now?
