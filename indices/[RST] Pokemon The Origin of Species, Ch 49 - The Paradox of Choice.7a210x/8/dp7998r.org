Midway through and loving it. Will edit with more comments later, but I just wanted to say DAMN I wish I was Lucian's grandkid.

EDIT: Great chapter :) The description of Sabrina's mind was really beautiful. The IT reference was fun, and I look forward to seeing how Red develops his mental patterns--and also to him getting a Psychic type for use in combat, or evolving his Abra.

Loved the discussion about the values of building a public persona. Rings very true to a lot of things I've thought about myself. Also made me think of the famous people I look up to, and I realized that the ones I admire the most are the ones whose work speaks the most for itself. For instance, Elon Musk of course gives interviews and writes articles, but I don't really care about those compared to his actual work, which I think is world-changing. My favorite writers are the ones whose books are really good, not the ones who write incisive social commentary and also write good books (Rebecca Solnit is cool, Brandon Sanderson is cooler).

So I guess I agree with Red: he should focus on the work itself, not on communicating it to others. Blue is right that he will have to be interviewed from time to time, but I'm with Red that it feels slimy somehow to start influencing public perception of him before there is all that much of it to influence. If he does good work, it will gain traction and people will talk about it, and he can engage with them then. Writing a blog now, in order to spin up positive perception of a currently very minor celebrity, feels like time and effort that could be better spent on research or training.
