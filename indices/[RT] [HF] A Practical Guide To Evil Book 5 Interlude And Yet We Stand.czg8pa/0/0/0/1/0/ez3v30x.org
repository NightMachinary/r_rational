The crux is that due to the Augur's scheme, the White Knight arrived earlier, about 30 seconds or so, just before he entered, Cordelia almost named herself Warden of the West, which would have ended the conspiracy by force, but also end the principate of Procer

So Cordelia would have been fine either way, but in one scenario she is forced to take a name, in the other, she is offered two, the Warden, and a name of below, but is able to turn down both because her life is no longer in danger.
