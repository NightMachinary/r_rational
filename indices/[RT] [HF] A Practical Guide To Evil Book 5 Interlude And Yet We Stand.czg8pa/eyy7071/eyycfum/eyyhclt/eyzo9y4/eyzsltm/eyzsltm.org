  she has a lot of room to scheme yet.

I don't disagree, but at this point, she can't afford for ANY of the schemes to come out in the open. GP may take anything she does or says as being done for the Greater Good, but if any one of her schemes come to light, that is as good as isolating the heroes from the few remaining sources of support they have and risks turning Pilgrim from a supporter to a staunch opponent.

GP is first among equals, but at this point the only broad source of support (with trust) is in the Dominion. Praes hates him along with other heroes, th League is licking their chops at the chance of whacking the heroes through Heirarch. He pissed of Cat, so Callow is out. Cordelia isn't too keen on Heroes, when they slipped the leash and interfered in foreign policy, and when news of the plague came to light. And if it becomes known that Bard set up the whole shitty situation in Salia, the consequences would be... interesting.

So, unless Bard can get GP to have all the Heroes go rogue, with their own agenda, her scheming will have limited effect. If she can manage that, the political support for the heroes will dry up from both the Good kingdoms and the Evil ones like whisky on the sun. That kind of results in the same thing.

I might turn out to be hopelessly wrong, but that's my current read on the situation, and I stand by it.
