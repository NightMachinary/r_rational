My current working hypothesis is that Bard's main prerogative is to prevent the apotheosis of any greater gods. Sve Noc and the heads of Fae Courts are approximately lesser gods but the Dead King seems to be pushing into the medium territory, and Cat seems to be making a habit of killing/manipulating entities in those categories so the Bard's got an eye on her.

She doesn't seem to particularly care about anything short of deity-making, no I'm not sure how much of the after she really cares about shaping if it introduces any risk at all to the current game. Granted, this is largely informed by her conversation with Cat that was at least partly motivated by trying to get Cat to act a bit more typical villain-y so that Pilgrim/other heroes would end up killing her, but it's also taking into account the Dead King's own fixation on apotheosis/immortality as being the only events worth considering and his view of the Bard as a player on that scale.
