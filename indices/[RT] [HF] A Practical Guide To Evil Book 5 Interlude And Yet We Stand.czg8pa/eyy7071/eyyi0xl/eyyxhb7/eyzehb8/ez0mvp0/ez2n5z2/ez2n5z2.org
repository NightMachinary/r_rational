In the paragraph where she's offered the second name, she's referred to as the First Prince, until she rejects it. After rejecting it, she is Cordelia.

  She could be the law, the *First Prince* knew. After this, looking in the eyes of those around her, seeing the loyalty that was blooming there. The faith. She could take it, and *First Prince* or not she would be the only law Procer would need. With scheme and knife, with ruthless will, she could purge the rot and turn Procer into what it should be instead of... this. No, *Cordelia* thought once more, and this time it was barely a struggle at all.
