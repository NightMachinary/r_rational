She set up the burnings in the previous chapters, probably by arranging the goblinfire to get into the city:

  “Sometimes there is a need for bleeding,” the Augur said, looking up at the horizon.

  Plumes of smoke had begun to rise, for Salia was burning. She would ask the Gods to forgive her, but she sought no absolution.

  Let her silence drag her all the way to the Hells, if it was what she deserved.

Those burnings made the White Knight and the Witch of the West accelerate their 'Judgments'. In particular, the Witch raised and crashed a manse in the previous chapter because of the already-present chaos:

  Before Simon could ask where the First Prince had then gone, genuinely bemused, both of them turned when soldiers in the courtyard began to yell in surprise. The lay brother swallowed drily, when he saw what appeared to be an entire manse rise high in the night sky before being suddenly smashed downwards to a chorus of screams.

  That, Simon of Gorgeault thought, rather changed things.

That demonstration of power led Brother Simon and Prince Renato to set out earlier than expected. They'd planned to go with a full guard, but instead left with just a few horsemen.

#+begin_quote
  Prince Renato brought only a small escort when they sallied out, all mounted, and provided a mount for Simon as well. There was no point in bringing great strength, for they'd seen rise in the sky how such would be answered. No, best to flee if things went badly and for that horses and few soldiers were best.

This lets them meet the White Knight and the Witch of the West on the road, which brings Hanno to the Court just before Cordelia is forced to assume a Name to defend herself. Hanno even says himself that they were meant to meet:

#+begin_quote
  “We are here for a reason, Antigone,” the Ashuran said, almost chidingly. “To meet them, perhaps. Do you know where the First Prince is being held?”

  ...

  “Then you must help us,” Brother Simon says. “For my colleagues will have gathered every sword they can from the city guard and the garrison, every loyal man and woman in the city, but even with the help of loyal princes and the retinues we will find it hard to take the palace.”

  “See?” the White Knight smiled, glancing at his comrade. “Always a reason.”

Everything that happened was expected to happen. Thanks to the Augur, it just happened a little earlier.
