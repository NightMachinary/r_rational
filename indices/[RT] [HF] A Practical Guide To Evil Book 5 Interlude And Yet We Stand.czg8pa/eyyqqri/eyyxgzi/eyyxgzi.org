No. The Mavii summoning very much applies as a pretty direct metaphor for how Agnes drew Bard in and then keep her distracted while the slight alterations Agnes made to her plan took place.

 

But Bard isn't fae so much as basically having to come when being explicitly summoned no matter the method. Remember that she came when the Sisters were making their call/plea to the Gods Below and that certainly had nothing to do with fae.
