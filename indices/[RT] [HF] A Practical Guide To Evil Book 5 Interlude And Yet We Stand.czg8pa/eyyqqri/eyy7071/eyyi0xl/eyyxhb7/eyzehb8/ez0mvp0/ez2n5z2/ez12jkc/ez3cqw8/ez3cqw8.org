That's what I mean.

If you look at the royalty of Callow, "King/Queen of Callow" isn't a Name, despite having several Named people on the throne. Each of those Named rulers have some other distinction: Queen of Blades (Elizabeth Alban), or the Good King (Jehan Fairfax).

First Prince is just the title of the ruler of Procer. It seems too /common/, too /usual/ to be a Name.

Besides, she would have been taking upon herself power that the First Prince doesn't have: if the other princes think that appointing a few partisans is enough to accuse her of crowning herself a Queen, how wouldn't reforming the whole country in her image be?
