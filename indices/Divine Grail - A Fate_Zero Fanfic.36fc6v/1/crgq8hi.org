the time reversal part was definitely interesting. the first section though was less interesting and to be honest i had to force myself to continue through it, less because it was bad and more because i had no particular interest at that point. if the timer reversal was presented first i think it would have been easier to get in to it and then the weber section would have been more fun probably.
