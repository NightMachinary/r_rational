Sure, but the spear won't do any more damage than it would normally.

The original concept of the railgun was "transport thing super far in 6 seconds by RAW but then throw it at the end and it keeps moving at the same speed as it must have had during transport and so it does lots of damage because physics." You can't switch in the middle like that -- if you're playing by RAW then you can transport the thing 1000 miles in 6 seconds but a thrown spear still only does 1d8 damage. If you're playing by physics then you can't transport the thing 1000 miles in 6 seconds.
