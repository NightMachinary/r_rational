Would you be more comfortable if I had said "always act according to what I would want according to your best understanding of me based on the fact that we have the exact same memories and skills and are generally identical except for the facts that you want to kill me, you must obey all my commands, and you are actually made of ice even though you look like me to everyone who isn't me"? I felt that "my CEV" was a less verbose way to say very-close-to that, but I can use the longer and more precise way if that's better.

Also, note that telepathic commands are sufficient to convey any desired information. If nothing else, you can embed the information into the command, e.g. "Write down the following words, which are true: 'Mom gave me a red and green sweater for the holiday.'"

EDIT: I should have said that you can also convey arbitrary visual information by, if no better method can be found, relaying the RGB values of each pixel on a screen of known size.
