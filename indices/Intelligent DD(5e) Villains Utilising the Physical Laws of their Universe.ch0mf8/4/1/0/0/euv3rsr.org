Well, yes. The trick would be how well you yourself understood what your CEV would be. Sometimes it's difficult to predict what you might think under future circumstances, because the circumstances themselves might play a part in revealing options you didn't previously know you had. Or there might have been other external influences between now and then.

For instance, it might not be too difficult to figure out what you want for lunch if lunch is ten minutes away, but trickier to figure out what you might want for lunch a week from now. Or what your clone-self might want for lunch today if you split a week ago and you were an ice golem who hadn't eaten or rested in that week.

Something of an extreme example, I'll admit, and CEV guesses would presumably generally be at least roughly in the right ballpark (assuming that neither 'self' had encountered data which would change their CEV and the other one didn't know about it; there doesn't seem to be anything in the writeup indicating that the Assassin is automatically mentally updated on everything the spellcaster knows, or vice versa, even if the spellcaster can choose to look out of the Assassin's eyes at times. There's a telepathic link, and mention of command, so it might be assumed that the spellcaster could issue commands over the link, and possibly informational updates, but whether those would be total mental downloads or just the ability to effectively 'speak' down the link isn't made clear.

e.g. The spellcaster doesn't want the Assassin needlessly destroyed, so the Assassin doesn't take actions which, it seems, would lead to that end. But the spellcaster wants the Assassin to scout out a building. The Assassin goes to do so and in doing so walks out of telepathy range. The spellcaster then learns that the building is rigged to explode. The Assassin does not know this. Thus the Assassin's best guess at the spellcaster's CEV is outdated and inaccurate.

Even if the Assassin was within range, and could be commanded not to walk into the building, a telepathic link which was limited to the mental equivalent of voice commands might not be able to convey something more subtle. What if the spellcaster, after making the Assassin, undergoes a profound spiritual awakening, or sees a psychologist, or really gets into yoga and crossfit? The Assassin could be instructed about this, but their mental baseline would still be the old version of the spellcaster's, and they might not be able to accurately predict what the spellcaster wants out of life any more.
