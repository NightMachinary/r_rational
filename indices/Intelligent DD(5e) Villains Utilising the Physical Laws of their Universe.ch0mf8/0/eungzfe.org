Munchkinry by villains in d&d is only fun if it results in something stabbable by the party. Otherwise it is a thing that happens to other people in the world.

For example, it's best to assume that the spell Fireball is the best possible fireball at a given power threshold. It has probably out-competed every other aoe fire spell or whatever. However, [[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/herbs-oils-other-substances][3.5 and pathfinder]] had a bunch of consumables that just made your fireball noticeably better than the next guy's.

Anyone with enough power to cast a fireball should have a bunch of black powder on hand in their component pouch too. It out competes clearly, and so should be the staple rather than the exception.

In your example, if mindflayers know they can flay a KT society and make gods, why would any mindflayers of sufficient skill even bother with goblins and hook horrors?

The stable state (like, whatever is read in the books) of Forgotten Realms says they don't, so they either can't or don't know how or whatever. Applications that adapt the stable state are just contrivances for the purpose of story, and stories need stuff to be stabbed eventually.

Passwall will sink any boat. Teleport will let you target a boat. Sink any ship with 3 spells.

Be a halfling wizard, weigh 80lbs. Cast reduce person, weigh 10lbs. Mage hand yourself around at 60ft per round.
