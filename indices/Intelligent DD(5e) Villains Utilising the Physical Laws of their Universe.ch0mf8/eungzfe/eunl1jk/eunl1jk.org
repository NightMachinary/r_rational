Any intelligent actor could quickly go infinite if they knew both the spells /Simulacrum/ and /True Polymorph/

Step 0: Make sure you won't fight with your infinite clones.

Step 1: True polymorph a pebble into whatever material components you need.

Step 2: Make a simulacrum of yourself.

Step 3: True polymorph the simulacrum into a true copy of yourself. Maintain until permanent.

Step 4: Have your new twin repeat the process. Go to bed and start fresh in the morning with your triplet buddies.

+Step 5: Be executed by the gods for daring to overstep your bounds+ Step 5: Enjoy Infinity

You should triple your numbers 12 hours if my logic is right. You might be able to cut out the simulacrum entirely depending on how you interpret the Polymorph any Object text (by polymorphing a pebble into yourself), making you multiply much much faster.

Though ultimately any exploit that undoes the setting will have to be explained away. Maybe exploits are how gods get made, and they then get patched, a la WTC Exclusions, whenever a new one is found?
