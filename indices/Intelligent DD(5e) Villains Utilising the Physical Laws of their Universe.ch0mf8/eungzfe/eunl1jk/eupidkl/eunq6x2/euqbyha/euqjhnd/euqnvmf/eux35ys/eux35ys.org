Regarding the ladder. A cruel DM would just use the item creation rules for creating firewood and poles while graciously letting you use the ladder to substitute the item creation costs. Now you can fail at it and will spend considerable time. Of course the DC will be raised if you want to create firewood and poles from the same ladder. You'll need to make sure nothing gets damaged right?
