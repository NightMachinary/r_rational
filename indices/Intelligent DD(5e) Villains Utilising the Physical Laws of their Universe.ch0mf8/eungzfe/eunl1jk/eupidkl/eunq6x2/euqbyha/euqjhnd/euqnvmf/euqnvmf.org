I'd wonder if the Assassin would be able to determine your CEV accurately, though. Presumably it'd be better at it the more intelligent it was. The "you can cast any self-targeted spell on yourself and the Assassin" mechanic has got to be munchkinable, though.

Come to think of it, does the Assassin have its own XP and mana pool equivalents? It does have "all the skills and abilities" of the original. Can it burn its own XP and/or mana to increase yours beyond the 5000 XP it costs to make one? If you have access to an enormous amount of diamond dust, can your Assassin create an Assassin of its own, and that one create its own, and so forth?

Come to think of it twice, is there anything preventing you creating an Ice Assassin of something epic-level? The diamond dust and XP cost is the same regardless. Create an Assassin of something capable of casting Wish, or massively boosting your own stats, or producing items of significant monetary value.

Perhaps most important: there's no information about what an Ice Assassin does when its original/nemesis dies. Does it stop working? Does it just melt away? Does it instead become a completely pliant golem, doing whatever you tell it, until it disintegrates of accumulated damage at some future point? Is it, in fact, possible to create an Assassin using a body part from a dead creature at all?
