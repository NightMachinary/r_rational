I would have you pay for the commoners time/food/accommodations and 4 shift replacements. At useful distances this turns out to be more expensive then just using commonly acceptable ways of transportation.

Also even if you pay the commoners, their lord might take exception to why Joe Farmer is not dirt farming but standing around waiting for someone passing him an item.

Commoners aren't free and everything in the books while buyable isn't an infinite resource.

My general rule of thumb for fiction is can be summed up with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Chesterton's_fence]]

Rules and fiction may sound illogical or without reason because the story doesn't focus on that particular mechanic. If the player decides to abuse it the story changes it focus and reality will ensure.

Rocks will fall and may cause harm as appropriate.
