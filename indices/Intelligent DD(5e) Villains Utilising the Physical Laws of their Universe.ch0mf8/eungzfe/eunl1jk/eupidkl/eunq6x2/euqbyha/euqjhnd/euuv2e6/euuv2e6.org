Yes, but that's single-use. The commoner railgun is repeatable. Have a lot of commoners stand in a line 5' apart. The first one picks up a person or object (one action) and drops it into the hands of the best person in line (free action) that person drops it into the hands of the next person, etc. In one round, the person/object can crowdsurf an arbitrary distance.

Note that the CR does not actually serve as a damage-causing railgun, as that application requires shifting from RAW to physics halfway through.
