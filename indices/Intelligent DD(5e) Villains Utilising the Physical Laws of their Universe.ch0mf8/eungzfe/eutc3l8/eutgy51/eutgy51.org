I don't think that teleport thing would fly. Spell failure is based on how well you know the location, and "any ship" doesn't imply that you're familiar with it (so at least a 33% chance of a miscellaneous mishap, 10% to end up on the wrong ship, and 10% to probably drop into the ocean).

You'd need access to the ship to take a chunk off it for the teleport to work reliably so at that point you can sabotage the ship for fewer spell slots and attacks of opportunity.
