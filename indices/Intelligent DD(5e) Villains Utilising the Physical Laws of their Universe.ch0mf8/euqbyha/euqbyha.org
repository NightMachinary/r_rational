I literally wrote a book on this.

- A 10' ladder costs 1sp. A 10' pole cost 5cp. Firewood costs 1cp. Buy a ladder for 1sp, break it into 2 10' poles and a pile of firewood (the rungs).
- Create an [[http://dnd.arkalseif.info/spells/frostburn--68/ice-assassin--1279/index.html][Ice Assassin]] of yourself. As its creator, order it to "always maximize my CEV".
- Grapple N willing creatures, where N is your number of hands. Each of them grapples N' other creatures, where N' is their number of hands. On your action, move, dragging everyone with you. Release one target (no action required). They grapple you and drag you, and everyone else in your grapple ball. Repeat. Note that you can fit 100 Fine creatures in a square and they can all reach each other.
