The lore says that through their madness from being broken by Illithids they end up creating entities resembling gods that can manifest, and that they can draw power from those to cast spells if enough of them believe in it.

That doesn't necessarily mean that it's a path to apotheosis, and even if that can happen, those entities are shaped by the Kuo Tao's beliefs, so anyone seeking godhood through that path will most likely suffer significant personality changes to the point that they might as well be considered dead, and the entity left, an entirely different person.After all it's created from madness, so any kind of stable transference seems pretty unlikely.\\
I'm not even sure that those entities created have anything resembling full-fledged personhood.

That said, a botched attempt at apotheosis could be a pretty interesting plot element to explore.
