Reposting a review I wrote a few months ago:

--------------

I think /A Practical Guide to Evil/ is a mix of three genres: young adult anti-hero epic, political intrigue, and meta-story telling. I tolerate the first, love the second and hate the third.

Catherine is basically the archetypal female young adult character. She's grown up in a difficult environment, seen suffering and misery, learned to fend for herself, she's the Chosen One but she's building her own destiny. She's baaaasically Katniss Everdeen with more agency, and a rationalist spin ("most heroes try to do X, X doesn't work, I'm going to try Y instead"). So if you don't find this type of character compelling... yeah, ain't gonna work out.

Personally, I love the worldbuilding and the political elements. Stuff like the idea that Amadeus made the Imperial Legion more popular by having it patrol areas controlled by corrupt nobles and corrupt police forces, or the idea that Callow and Praes are doomed to fight because Praes has a constant overpopulation problem and needs to invade Callow to either cull its population or import food (which was also a theme in OotS).

On the other hand, if you forget the big picture plan of "unifying Callow and Praes through common enemies" for a moment, the day to day reality is pretty grim. Catherine is working for an Empire that has consistently been an oppressive Tyranny for centuries, and just happens to currently be getting more progressive. Her plan to unify the region entails a lot dying, suffering, and civil-war-ing. The story doesn't pull punches on the fact that every battle has casualties, and every manoeuver requires sending soldiers to their deaths. Maybe you don't like the frequent reminders that a lot of people are dying in the depicted conflicts.

The meta story-telling is when a character goes "I'm a villain and he's a hero, that means he's going to win because stories!". I don't have much to say on that except I don't like it. It's another thing that drawn from /Order of the Stick/ (Black is basically a cross between OotS' Tarquin and Darth Vader), and... I dunno, it's not very interesting to me. I'm not really a fan of 4th-wall breaking, unless it's used sparingly in comedies, so the whole idea of "We know we're in a story, so let's use strategies that will work because we're in a story" doesn't really appeal to me. I prefer the parts about logistics and politics.

Also, I know that "Evil" is in the title, but I don't really like the parts where they start to discuss Good and Evil. Despite what Star Wars would like you to believe, there's no ideology of Evil. There are weird Satanist cults, and philosophies of rationalizing why it's okay to be selfish, and you can always use some variation of individualism and "The only virtue is being strong because Darwin / because good and bad are subjective / whatever", but essentially, everyone either believe themselves to be "Good", feel like they're not "Good" but would like to be, or don't care and think the idea of "Good" is pointless.

So while I understand that the setting has a whole divine eternal war between order and individualism and how they basically map to Good and Evil in human societies, I still find it weird when the protagonist goes "We are the villains!" even though she has a pretty strong sense of ethics. Same thing for Worm, I have trouble taking someone seriously when he's saying "This person is a villain!" Who does that? If you want to use labels, use "criminal" or "murderer" or "scumbag", but having cops talk about "villains" is just silly.

Overall, yeah, the writing goes from kind of mediocre to amazing. I definitely recommend you give it a try for a few chapters.
