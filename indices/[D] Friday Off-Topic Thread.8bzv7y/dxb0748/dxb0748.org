So... At least a few of you are aware (probably, I think) that I've been working on a sequel to HPMOR for quite a long while (like, over 3 years). Maybe you saw the rough draft I posted /15 months ago/ and saw that I said I'd probably start posting chapters within 3 months. Gotta love Hofstadter's law, right?

Anyway, I thought I'd ask if anyone would be willing to do me a favor and look at the most recent update and tell me if you think the writing itself is at a point where I can safely say I'm done editing it, so I can move on and finish editing the rest of the chapter and the nine chapters that follow it (there's no new information, it's still just the first half of the first chapter (and nothing beyond that is coming out until editing on all of the first ten chapters is done and they're all ready to be released simultaneously)).

Beyond the writing itself, I've incorporated a /lot/ of expository stuff in an attempt to make this thing more accessible for people who have either never read HPMOR or who haven't read it in a long time. If you have a strong opinion about that and feel like it's too much and needs to be cut back, I'd be interested in which expository bits you feel are unnecessary, or which bits you feel are overdone and need to be more subtle.

Anyway, if you're interested, here it is:
