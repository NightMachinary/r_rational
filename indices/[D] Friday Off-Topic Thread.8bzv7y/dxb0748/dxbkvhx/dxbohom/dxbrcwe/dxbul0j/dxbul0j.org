Thanks, would be a /great/ suggestion in most use cases, but I feel like I need to keep iterating on this thing until it "resonates" with my own brain. I have many versions, none of them have resonated, and when I get a version that resonates that'll be the version I clean up and edit. This is literally the first work of fiction I've ever written (I played around with an idea for a few months about 6 or 7 years ago and at the time I thought I was "writing," but I really wasn't), and I want it to be something that comes from my own mind (insofar as that's even an accurate thing to say in the first place; nothing is /truly/ original, every idea anyone has ever had has originated outside of their own mind).

I get what you mean, like, take two or five of the versions I've already decided not to use and let other people react to them for a fresh perspective and kind of triangulate a causal chain based on their feedback, but I really want to do this myself. "Elizabeth" doesn't exist, she's a pseudonym, so I'm never going to get any credit for writing this and I'd at least like to feel the accomplishment of having managed to do the whole thing myself, y'know?
