Yeah, I know, I touched on that with "I suppose a huge majority of fanfiction is written by functionally anonymous authors."

EY is probably the problem. HPMOR was the first fanfic I ever read, and for like 7ish years it was the /only/ fanfic I had ever read, and I guess my mental model of how all that worked never updated after I started reading general fanfic (which is a thing that happened just over one year ago, and I started working on HPIO /three/ years ago).
