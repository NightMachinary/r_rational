Ok this is awesome! [[#s][tag]] If you have me thinking along those lines, you are doing something very very right.

Or via a tegmarkian shift into another universe ultrastructure with more optimal parameters (it feels as if canon!HPJEV would add something like that)

  A global society of immortal wizards, spreading throughout the galaxy...

[global] is of a degree of falsehood untypical of HPJEV, [stellar]/[interplanetar] works

4 instances of "grin/grinning" - too much in such a short text. Replace some with [smile] etc

In HPMOR canon a fundamental limit of the FMC is its 1:1 time ratio. Its actually a rather important plot point [why has Hermione spent month obsessing over her perceived nemesis Draco? Can't have been FMC, that takes too much time. We dont know the method; that has always been a sign of Voldemorts involvement.]

Please more.

Exposition seems fine to me.
