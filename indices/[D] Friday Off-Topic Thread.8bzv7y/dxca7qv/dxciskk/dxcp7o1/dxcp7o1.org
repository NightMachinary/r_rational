Thank god I'm not alone. APGtE doesn't feel particularly rational to me, just a solid deconstruction that still doesn't really go far beyond the usual young adult novel quality-wise.

I know I would have loved it before reading all the other stuff linked on this subreddit, so it might be a case of chronologically inverted [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny][SeinfeldIsUnfunny]]. Whatever the case, I gave it a fair chance and I don't really see what most everyone else sees in it.
