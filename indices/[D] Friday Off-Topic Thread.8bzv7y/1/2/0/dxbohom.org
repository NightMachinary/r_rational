Partly because I'm trying to pull off some risky stuff in the first few chapters and I need people to be able to binge their way past that or it might turn people off. It's going to turn some people off regardless. There's also an organizational problem I'm running into.

I'll give you the first 6 chapter titles (as of right now).

#+begin_quote
  Something to Protect: Tom Riddle

  The Truth, Pt 6, A Riddle Unraveled

  The Truth, Pt 7, A Riddle Reiterated

  Refraction

  Interlude: All the Myriad Ways, Pt 0

  Into the Forest
#+end_quote

As you can see, we're /mirroring/ HPMOR's naming conventions a bit, up until "Refraction," so you should be able to easily figure out from where Harry is in the chapter I've posted that it's going to involve the Mirror of Noitilov. "Into the Forest" doesn't follow that pattern, and that's extremely relevant and a very big spoiler if you figure out what it means.

My working drafts originally only had "The Truth, Pt 6, A Riddle Reiterated" for a substantial part of the story's development, but there's too much stuff that needs to happen for that to only be one chapter. My "organizational problem" that I've been dealing with for - god, has it been a year? Longer? - is that I have all of the stuff that happens in the first three chapters written out, but multiple huge chunks keep getting shuffled around between those chapters, which in turn necessitates shuffling all the other stuff and coming up with new transitions, and the "Truth" chapters themselves keep swapping names with each other. I /desperately/ need for "Pt 6" to have the "Reiterated" title, and it doesn't right now, which means I'm not done. It's a thing that /must/ happen, because "reiteration" is "a step where one re-uses a previous step. In practice, this is only necessary when one wants to take a hypothesis which is not the most recent hypothesis and use it as the final step before a deduction step." Harry is the "Riddle" who has been "reiterated," and Quirrellmort is the "Riddle" who we "unravel." It would be swell if in the "reiterated" chapter we could use "reiterate" in the other sense and re-answer the questions from HPMOR's "Truth" arc, and if we could use "unravel" in the other sense in its chapter as well, though being specific on either sense for that one would be pretty spoilerish.

At some point in the (relatively) near future, I'm going to get a bunch of note-cards and write out /all of the things/ on them and physically lay them out and move them around by hand and see if that helps. I might become extraordinarily ballsy and change the order to "Truth Pt 6" "STP: TR" "Truth Pt 7," but I would be extraordinarily dissatisfied with that ordering.

That's a big part of the reason you're only seeing the first half (or third, or possibly quarter) of the first chapter, I'm not going to publish a draft of chapter one that includes material that's almost certainly going to be in another chapter. There are a lot of earth-shattering revelations in a very short period of time, and I need to be very careful about when everything gets said in relation to everything else. The reveal about the true nature of the mirror has been in all three of those chapters at some point. The reveal about David Monroe has been in all three of those chapters at some point. If you take the set of "all the things" that are in all three of those chapters, almost all of those things have been in all three of those chapters in multiple configurations. This isn't a delay due to writing or editing, it's a delay due to figuring out the most logical causal chain of events. I know I'll hit the right configuration eventually, but I have no way of predicting when that'll be.

Now, beyond all that, chapters 4 through 10 are pretty well close to done, it's the first 3 chapters that are being disagreeable and refusing to cooperate.
