I mean by "Elizabeth doesn't exist" that there is no human being that corresponds to the identity "Elizabeth Robin Thales." That's not even remotely similar to my real name, so no one (other than a select few people I know in the real world) is ever going to know I wrote this thing. But, I mean, I suppose a huge majority of fanfiction is written by functionally anonymous authors, isn't it?

  If this is your first work of fiction, you're supposed to do it "start-up style": start simple, iterate a lot, and move forward with new content instead of redoing the same thing until it's perfect.

I disagree. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
