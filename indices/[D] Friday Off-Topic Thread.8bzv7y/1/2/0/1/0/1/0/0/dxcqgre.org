  I mean by "Elizabeth doesn't exist" that there is no human being that corresponds to the identity "Elizabeth Robin Thales." That's not even remotely similar to my real name, so no one (other than a select few people I know in the real world) is ever going to know I wrote this thing.

... yeah, but that's, like, everyone. Alexander Wales isn't /really/ named "Alexander Wales" (or Cthulhuraejepsen), and /obviously/ nobody in real life is named "Eliezer Yudkowsky", and if they were they would be too ashamed to ever talk with anyone on the internet.
