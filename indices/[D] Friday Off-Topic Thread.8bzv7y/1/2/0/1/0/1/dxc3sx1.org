I think you're overthinking the pseudonym thing.

Actually, since we're on the subject, what do you mean by "Elizabeth doesn't exist"? Like, I get that you're not named Elizabeth, but the person you're answering to probably isn't named "Xamuel", and I'm not /really/ a French sentient blue knife (well, I'm really French and sentient, but that's about it). Do you mean that you act out a different personality while online?

--------------

Regardless, I think you're overthinking this. If this is your first work of fiction, you're supposed to do it "start-up style": start simple, iterate a lot, and move forward with new content instead of redoing the same thing until it's perfect.

If you have content, even discarded content, and people who might be willing to give you feedback, then you should release it all.

As it is, I can't give you any useful feedback because I have a ton of questions where the answers would be "It's explained in the next chapter".
