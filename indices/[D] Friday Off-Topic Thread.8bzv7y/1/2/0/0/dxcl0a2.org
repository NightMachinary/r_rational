At the risk of further messing up your schedule, I appreciate your intent to have optimal story structure. It is something I feel a lot of online fiction misses out on by writing single chapters at a time.\\
Having said that, over-editing is a thing. You seem self aware enough about it though. Good luck; I look forward to reading it soonish :p
