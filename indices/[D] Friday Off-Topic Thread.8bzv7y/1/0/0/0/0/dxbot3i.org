  Are bacon presses even a british thing?
#+end_quote

I have absolutely no idea, I tried googling around to find something but I'm getting nothing but recipes and links to purchase a bacon press. I wasn't interested before, and I am now, and now I can't find anything relating to the history/origin of the thing and it's infuriating lol
