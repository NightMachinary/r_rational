Yeah, but there are workarounds for these problems.

For instance, a bot can associate tags to an image using machine-learning-based algorithms, and for every new image, apply the duplicate detection to every image with similar tags posted in the last 6 months. (obviously this simplistic approach would have tons of flaws, but a more elaborate one would work reasonably well)
