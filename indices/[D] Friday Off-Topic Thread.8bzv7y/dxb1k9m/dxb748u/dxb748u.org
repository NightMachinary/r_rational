Option 1 is also better than 2 (although both are extremes) because it caters to long time members as opposed to an influx of new ones. Option 1 means that there is less content per refresh of the page, but it means that the people who are dedicated to that sub in particular will be able to open a new link without having to check if they've already read the content. Every new link guarantees new content, even if it isn't always high quality. And catering towards long time members is beneficial because those members make up a disproportionate number of the people who make comments and make new posts (when posts consist of user created content, in contrast to some news subreddit that posts links to articles that the submitter didn't make).

Having no reposts also means that new content is much more likely to be seen by the userbase, because it doesn't have to compete with the best content from the past. This encourages people to try new ideas, instead of sticking with variations of the already popular content.

Option 2 is probably much better for the membership numbers of a sub, because it constantly shows off the best the sub has to offer, and also because a single repost of a popular submission is much more likely to cause someone to subscribe than for an existing member to unsubscribe, but it's bad for the more abstract health of the sub.
