I agree that reposting is good. I repost things here from time to time, and encourage others to do the same. Unearthing an oldie-but-a-goodie type thing is great to reminisce, re-read, and show to newer community members. On top of that, it's not like we have so much traffic that it would drown out the new stuff.
