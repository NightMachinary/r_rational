I've been considering trying some soylent-adjacent meal replacement shakes. Specifically, [[https://www.completefoods.co/diy/recipes/simshame-superfood-soylent-high-protein-low-calorie-low-carb][this]] is the top contender, and possibly also [[https://www.completefoods.co/diy/recipes/keto-chow-150-master-rich-chocolate][this]].

I'm not planning on replacing all my meals, but maybe one or two a day. Or maybe once I try it, it's disgusting and I give it up immediately, who knows?

Anybody here ever try anything like these?
