I've had keto chow, but have not tried Simshame.

Keto chow I remember tasting good, but I had extraordinary gas and stomach instability from it. One of my prime reasons for liking Soylent is due to how even it makes my digestive system feel, so Keto Chow causing instability make it not worth using. I prefer to Keto Fuel, but not to any normal soylent/joylent.
