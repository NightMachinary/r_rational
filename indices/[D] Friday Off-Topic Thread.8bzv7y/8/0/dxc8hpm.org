Not exactly, but recently I've replaced my breakfast (previously milk+cereal) with milk+protein powder, which I'd think is a little comparable. Because it's just breakfast I don't get bored of the food, but I don't really /enjoy/ breakfast like I used to when I guzzled sugary cereal. YMMV, but I wouldn't suggest replacing more than a single meal, as you might run into a problem where you get frustrated and start "treating yourself" i.e., snacking on unhealthy stuff, undoing the work you'd put in.

Alternatively, if your rationale is ease-of-making, then look into getting a crockpot.
