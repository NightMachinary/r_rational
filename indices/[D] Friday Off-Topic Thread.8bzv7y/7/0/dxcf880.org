I've moved cross continent a couple times. My main advice is to accept that there's a financial cost to moving, and not try to transport anything that you don't absolutely need. Namely, try to move in one carload if you can. Anything more than that, and your moving costs are going to be more than just getting rid of things and re-buying when you get there.
