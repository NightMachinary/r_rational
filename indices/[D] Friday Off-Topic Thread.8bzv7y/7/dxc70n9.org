So I've just about gotten it confirmed that I'm going to get at least an offer from one of the companies I interviewed with out in San Francisco. I'm kind of insanely nervous. Does anyone on here have experience moving across the country? Obviously it's at least somewhat dependent on money, but I'm trying to decide if I'd take it.

I'm trying to decide if I'm ready to move that far outside my comfort zone ect.
