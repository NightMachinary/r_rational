My last update for Heroes Save the World stated that it would be returning in mid-April. The time that it's taking me to recover from eye surgery is forcing me to put that on the back burner if I want to stay on top of school and so on, so expect it to resume updating in August instead. I have an outline for the next thirteen chapters and several of them are written up already, but I want to wait until the sequence is complete before I release anything (so that I can revise earlier chapters if necessary).
