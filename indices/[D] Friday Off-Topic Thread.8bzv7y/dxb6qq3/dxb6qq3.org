[[http://www.crunchyroll.com/thunderbolt-fantasy/episode-1-code-of-umbrellas-716075][Thunderbolt Fantasy]] is probably my favorite new "anime" series of the year so far (as in, that I've watched since 2018 started, not that has come out). It has one of, if not the, best Trickster Thief/Rogue character archetype I've ever seen. There's also a fantastic Wandering Swordsman archetype in the main character. Both are unique in ways I can't discuss without spoilers. The movie is fantastic too.

If anyone's bothered by the medium, I was a bit too at first, but stopped even noticing they were puppets within 2 or 3 episodes. Give it a bit to see if it draws you in with the great writing and music and characters. It's by Gen Urobuchi, who wrote a lot of fantastic manga/anime, such as Fate/Zero, Madoka Magica, and Psycho-Pass.

To those who have seen the series and movie...

How would you classify [[#s%20%20the%20Enigmatic%20Gale][Spoilers]], morally?

Curious to know others' thoughts on him.
