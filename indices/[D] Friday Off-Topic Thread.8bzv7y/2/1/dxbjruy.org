Whether option 1 is bad depends on the relative quality of the posts. If you are in a subreddit where content is easily replaceable and there are no high-quality outliers (I can think of a few), then a repost might be a net-negative: Some people have seen it already, so for them it's a value of, say, 0.5 of a baseline post. The majority has not, they get a 1.01 post. Obviously those numbers are pulled out of thin air and up for debate, but I think they fit many subreddits. (Ones with lots of qualitatively similar content, where reposts diminish a post's value significantly.)

In those cases, a steady stream of new content is the desirable state, and you want to encourage that. Sadly, voting does not address this problem, as most users just see a 1.01 baseline post, and act correspondingly. (Rightfully so, I might add.) Thus, the local incentives do not line up with the global optimum. I believe this is---in an abstract sense---why you see people complaining.

Note that the above does explicitly not apply to the case you are describing, where you are trying to see /all/ high-quality submissions.

One final remark: Reposts seem like something that is incredibly easy to mitigate technologically. Facebook can recognise my /face/ being used in a photo, how hard can detecting /identical/ images be?
