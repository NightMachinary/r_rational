Specifically on reddit I always thought the voting system was fine for reposts. If I haven't seen it I upvote, if I have seen it I downvote. Recent reposts should get voted out by the community. The longer you wait to reposts the more likely it is new users have arrived to upvote. Obviously there are more things at play but because the basic system is there I feel empowered and don't complain.\\
Admittedly this might be less relevant because your specific case is different from mine.
