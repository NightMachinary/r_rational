  One final remark: Reposts seem like something that is incredibly easy to mitigate technologically. Facebook can recognise my /face/ being used in a photo, how hard can detecting /identical/ images be?

It probably isn't that difficult to do, but I imagine it isn't worth it in terms of hardware. Checking every post if it's a copy of any other post in the history of that sub would get somewhat costly for the bigger and more active subs, and costly in terms of CPU time translates into additional cost for running servers. For a small wuality of life benefit, it's not a good investment. Plus, if people actually didn't like reposts, they wouldn't get upvoted so much.

Also, if the algorithm has to check not just for whether a photo is identical to a previously posted one but also whether or not it's very similar (i.e. you can't just crop one row of pixels and have it get through) it would get even more costly.
