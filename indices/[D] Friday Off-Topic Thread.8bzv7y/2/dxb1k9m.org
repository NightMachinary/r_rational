Reminder: Reposting is a /good/ thing.\\
- Option 1: Nothing can be posted more than once in a subreddit. A person who hasn't seen the good submissions of yesteryear /never/ will see them, unless he takes the time to look through the archives himself or the submissions happen to be crossposted elsewhere.\\
- Option 2: Reposts make up a high proportion of all submissions. A person who already has seen the good submissions of yesteryear will have his front page and his [[/r/all][r/all]] clogged with them, unless he takes the time to downvote the ones that he considers to have been reposted too heavily and refresh the page. (Being a savvy Redditor, he obviously has activated the setting that automatically hides all submissions that he has upvoted and downvoted.)\\
- Option +1+ 2 is better than Option +2+ 1 because being forced to downvote annoying submissions in your front page and your [[/r/all][r/all]] is /significantly/ less tiresome than being forced to sift through the archives of /dozens/ of different subreddits. (Presumably, either option would impose its special hardship on the same number of people.)
