  *Destructive problem-solving*

  Something as apparently benign as a list-sorting algorithm could also solve problems in rather innocently sinister ways.

  *Well, it's not unsorted:* For example, there was an algorithm that was supposed to sort a list of numbers. Instead, it learned to delete the list, so that it was no longer technically unsorted.

  *Solving the Kobayashi Maru test:* Another algorithm was supposed to minimize the difference between its own answers and the correct answers. It found where the answers were stored and deleted them, so it would get a perfect score.
