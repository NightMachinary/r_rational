  For example, consider the phrase "go to hell." Is hell a concept that is understood by the people in this setting? Furthermore, is hell universally regarded by the characters within the setting to be a bad place that people wouldn't want to go? There are a lot of cliches that actually have an afterlife belief embedded in them, e.g. "see you in hell."

Han saying "Then I'll see you in hell," in Empire always bothered me as a kid.
