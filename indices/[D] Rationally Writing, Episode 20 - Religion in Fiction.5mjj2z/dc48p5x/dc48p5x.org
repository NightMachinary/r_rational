This isn't really related to most of what was discussed in the podcast, but I think that worldbuilding religions in secondary-world fantasy is an interesting topic. For example, one thing to consider is the way that religion colors language, and more specifically, the way that characters curse. People often use the word "profanity" to generically refer to any kind of swearing, but profanity refers to something very specific, namely language that specifically invokes the "sacred" without regarding it with the respect that something sacred ought to command. (For example, "damn" and "hell" are profane, whereas "fuck" and "shit" are obscene, but not profane.)

If you're writing a secondary-world fantasy, I think it's worthwhile to spend some time thinking about how characters can swear. Obviously, it would look horribly out-of-place for someone to exclaim "Jesus Christ" in a fantasy setting where Jesus of Nazareth was never historically present, but even some simpler and seemingly innocuous phrases might be out of place depending on the setting. For example, consider the phrase "go to hell." Is hell a concept that is understood by the people in this setting? Furthermore, is hell universally regarded by the characters within the setting to be a bad place that people wouldn't want to go? There are a lot of cliches that actually have an afterlife belief embedded in them, e.g. "see you in hell."

Also, when worldbuilding language, it may be worthwhile to go back to first principles, rather than just playing mad-libs with phrases taken from a contemporary context. For example, understand that if you have a polytheistic say "oh my gods," or a character who invokes a feminine deity by exclaiming "oh my goddess," you're not exactly being original. That said, when done correctly, I've always had a certain appreciation for people who take concepts that are often presented as cliches and re-contextualizes them in a way that presents the same message in a way that's at least somewhat original, especially when you specifically /want/ to draw attention to a line instead of having the reader gloss over it.
