Yeah, a lot of stories get around this by just replacing the name of any particular god (instead of shouting "Jesus Christ!" they'll shout "By Odin!"), and a lot of pokemon fanfictions will invoke Arceus or Mew as deities that people would invoke in language.

I think it's fine to overlay the generic concepts themselves, overall. Even nonbelievers will use profanity of beings they don't believe in due to cultural influences, and it always interested me as a kid in Star Wars when Han said the "See you in hell!" line in Empire Strikes Back. As you say, it was a fairly simple signal (if intentionally done, which it might not have been) that there are religions in the world and many common ones have the belief in a bad afterlife for those who have spent their days being immoral in some way that Han clearly considers himself.
