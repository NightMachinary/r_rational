It's grating when authors have real, interventionist powers AND modern theological cliches.

Real world priests don't perform visible miracles. And our discussions about religion are shaped by that.

As a result, there are tons of works that look into why people believe despite a lack of evidence. "Proof erodes faith" or "God works in mysterious ways," or "You can't test God" or whatever. Real-world religions don't hold direct contests because it would look bad for everyone involved.

This should change in worlds where priests do overt magic. If people thought that faith moved mountains, you'd see mountain-moving contests to prove which faith is right.

Even the bible has a story where Elijah challenges some Priests of Baal to a spellcasting competition.

People in Fantasy worlds would undoubtedly have their own cliches. But they'd be cliches for solving different sorts of problems. Like, "why are there evil priests?" or "why do both of our pantheons have spells of similar strength?" or "why can't priests heal all the sick kids?"
