This is a really good point that we didn't get a chance to go over in the episode. What you'll often see in such worlds is that everyone acknowledges that each-other's gods exist (so there's no need to prove one or the other is "real") and some of them are kind of dicks, so invoking them just to prove who's stronger is a good way to get your life screwed up, even if you win. Also, some of the gods are just evil, so the evil priests using faith magic for bad things tend to be theirs.
