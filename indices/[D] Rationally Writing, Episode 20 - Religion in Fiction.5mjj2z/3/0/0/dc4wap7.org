I'm glad you liked the omakes. I wasn't sure if anyone would appreciate them, but several people including you now have positively compared to the ones in HPMOR so I'm glad I included them. :)

As for your criticism, yeah, I accept it. You brought it up in a more generic context in the podcast so I did expect that reaction from you.

Hope you're having a great day!
