Haha, sorry to disappoint :) I said most of what I wanted to say in that one post, but thanks for reminding me to read your epilogue!

/later/

Okay, so first off: the Omakes were brilliant. I enjoyed them all quite a lot, and actually think they're as good as the ones in HPMOR. But then, writing skill and creativity were never the problems with GWSI :)

As for the epilogue itself, eh. It was basically more of the same of what bothered me, except even worse in that it just confirmed the perspective that God is real and nothing matters because everything eventually ends in everyone being happy forever.

Don't get me wrong, it's a nice belief to have. Always has been, always will be. But a reality that really works like The Egg kind of removes any semblance of a point or meaning from the whole charade of existence, let alone the tension or drama of any given story, as was mentioned in the podcast.

Not to say that that's evidence that it's not true. It's always possible, however unlikely I might think it. But I do believe it makes for a worse story, for those not already accepting the premise.
