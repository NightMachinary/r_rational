You may end up being correct, and there is the danger that it becomes a story of trope after trope, but I think if plotted correctly it could still work.

I've spent more time attempting to figure out the characters than anything, and it's been more than just coming up with clever portmanteaus of their names. I remember [[/u/wildbow]] mentioning somewhere that he attempted to write like a DM: he would come up with a situation, and then throw his fleshed-out characters into that situation and see how they reacted.

If I can get a good starting point that's a recognizable mesh of both stories, then I'm okay with it going unexpected directions, and in the end it may indeed be its own thing. At this juncture, though, I don't have any other story waiting in the wings; I just want to crash the two worlds together and see what happens.
