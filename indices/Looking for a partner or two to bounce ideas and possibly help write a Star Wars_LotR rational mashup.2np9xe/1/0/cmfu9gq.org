Setting is essentially the idea that middle earth was at some point inhabited by members of the old republic, but somehow the planet lost contact/was made unreachable through some cataclysm (relatively shortly after colonization; long enough to be introduced but not long enough to proliferate). Middle earth history proceeds as normal (haven't decided the exact point of departure), except that force-sensitive genes are mingled with the population and various relics have also been passed down.

For instance, the rings of power and lightsabers have been combined, producing blades of power. Saruman's military superiority comes from reverse engineering and mass producing ancient blasters.

Places are also combined as convenient, such as Rivendell being an oasis within the Tatooine Wastes, or the Paths of the Dead being within the Swamps of Dagobah.

Following an attack of the Darth-King resulting in the death of Luke's adoptive parent Elrond and the capture of Leia Evenstar, the party pursues (each for their own reasons), leading to the rescue of the princess, but not before the summoning of the Starbane, an unstoppable being of flame and darkness, at which point Obi-wandalf is slain. The group escapes to Lothlorvin, where Luke, Han, and the forces of Gan Galadriel manage to slay the beast.

EDIT: accidentally hit submit, stupid phone.

Anyway, the plot points and character arcs play fast and loose with the source material, but it's the taking of two very different things and producing something new that's the goal. A lot of the game is in leaving it up in the air when a particular aspect of one or the other story is going to be confirmed or completely inverted. Will it be Boromir Darklighter or Boromir Antilles?
