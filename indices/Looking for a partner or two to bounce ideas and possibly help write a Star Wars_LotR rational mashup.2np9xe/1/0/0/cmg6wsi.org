You might be better off just making it completely original. The number of liberties you're taking will destroy the personalities of every one of the characters. If you completely alter someone's history, that person will act completely differently. The only way to preserve even a semblance of the initial character's manneurisms and other characteristics would be to exploit tropes associated with the characters, like having king Arakbar yell "It's a trap!" while swordfighting with the reforged lightsaber that initially killed Darth Sauron. Keeping true to the source character would be so painstakingly dull and cliched that it would probably be better to just write your own original story if you're going to deviate that much.
