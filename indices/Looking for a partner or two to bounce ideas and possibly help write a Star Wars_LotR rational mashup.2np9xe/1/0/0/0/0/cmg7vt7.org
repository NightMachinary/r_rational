I got notified because you mentioned my name. So here I am.

It goes beyond just throwing characters into a situation. What conflict should do is peel away the veneer to reveal the characters as they truly are. For this, it should be relatively harsh and it should reveal different facets of the character. Put a character into a situation they're unsuited for, and see how they develop.

In Worm, I put Taylor into situations where a keen awareness of the situation and consequence mattered, where social grace was key. On the surface, she faces down enemies she can fight with her power, but beyond that point, there's other stuff going on. Can she build up a reputation in the process, can she get others to act as she wants? She struggles with this, and the path she takes in response highlights who she is. It works on other levels - the best fights in the series, imo, are those where her power wasn't suited to fighting the opponent (her first fight against Mannequin stands out in my mind).
