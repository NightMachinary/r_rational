A problem with that reasoning is it assumes that you individually read every single letter, rather than reading words as a whole like most people do.

Edit: Re-read your comment, I understand better what you're saying now. I still don't fully agree with the methodology involved, because it implies that your focus width is the same (7-8 letters) regardless of other factors such as font size.

Additionally, I literally cannot imagine reading anything other than a textbook as slow as 250 wpm. My base speed is ~1500 wpm, with 98% retention.
