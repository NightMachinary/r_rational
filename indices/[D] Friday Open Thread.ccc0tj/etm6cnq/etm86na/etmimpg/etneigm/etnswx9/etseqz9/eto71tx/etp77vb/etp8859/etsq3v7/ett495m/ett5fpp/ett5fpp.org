It was a fun talent to have in highschool, I competed in my states battle of the books competition and made it to state level by myself :P

That skepticism is fair. My guess for the reason I read so quickly is as a kid I read for 16 hours a day, every day. Social ostracization plus being friends with the librarians was a fun combo. I'd check out 10+ books every time I went to the library, and reread my favorites when I was done.

My first read of worm took the course of about a week, my second took two days. I'd also love to see how I fare with the book of the fallen but I just can't seem to get into it.

Imagine having bouncy walls on the margins of a piece of text. Visualize (heh) your eyes bouncing off them, going faster and faster each time. It turns into this weird feeling of reading sentences the same way you normally read words; cognizant of the parts that make them up but also not thinking too hard about them.
