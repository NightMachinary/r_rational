I was actually being as polite as possible, since the only two possibilities are that you're delusional or that you're a liar.

You didn't present information counter to my worldview, you presented a claim counter to the findings of cognitive scientists much smarter than you and me who have studied this issue extensively for decades.

I'm going to give you a little snippet from that 31 page study, something short enough that you'll /actually read it/ instead of just running your eyes over it:

  As you might expect, when McLaughlin (1969) tested comprehension with free recall, he found that the speed reader recalled confused - and sometimes */completely fabricated/* [emphasis mine] - information from the text.

You have /no idea/ how high or low your comprehension is when you're "reading" at that speed.

Here's another chunk:

  Another study looked at two graduates of a speedreading program who were considered by program officials to have achieved such remarkable performance that the officials contacted a cognitive scientist to test them under controlled conditions in a laboratory (Homa, 1983).

  When so tested, each student read an entire college-level textbook in less than 6 minutes, achieving rates of 15,000wpm or higher.

  Although the students speed read the book three times, their performance on a multiple-choice test of comprehension was quite poor. Neither speed reader showed any extraordinary ability, as compared to average readers, in perceiving peripherally presented letters or identifying which words had appeared in a briefly presented paragraph.

  The extraordinary ability that they had achieved, the investigator concluded, was “a remarkable dexterity in page-turning” (Homa, 1983, p. 126).

  Calef, Pieper, and Coffey (1999) recorded the eye movements of a group of adults both before and after they enrolled in a speed-reading class, comparing them to a group of people who did not take the class. In the pretest, both groups of readers read at about 280 wpm.

  After the speed-reading course, the speed readers read at about 400 wpm, making fewer fixations (and regressions) with shorter fixation durations (228 ms after compared with 241 ms before).

  Their comprehension score decreased from pretest (81% correct) to posttest (74%), indicating that the increased rate of speed was achieved at the expense of comprehension.

  Further evidence for comprehension difficulties among speed readers came from a study by Liddle (1965; reanalyzed by Carver, 1971, 1972), who tested graduates of Wood's speed-reading program and compared them to readers who had signed up for the program but had not yet taken the course.

  Both groups of people were tested for both speed and comprehension on fiction and nonfiction material. The reading rates were about 300 to 1,300 wpm faster for the graduates than the control group.

  While test scores revealed a significant decline in comprehension among the graduates on the fiction material, the two groups showed approximately the same level of comprehension for the nonfiction material (68% for the graduates and 72% for those who had not yet taken the course). But in nonfiction material, the content is based on the real world. Thus, it is possible that the speed readers could have answered the questions correctly by knowing the answers rather than actually having read them from the text.

  In fact, when Carver administered the same comprehension test to a group of people who had never seen the passage, they obtained an only slightly lower score (57%) through their use of common knowledge and guessing.

And another one:

  The most complete study of the eye movements and comprehension of speed readers was carried out by Just, Masson, and Carpenter (1980; see also Just & Carpenter, 1987). They presented passages to speed readers (reading rates around 600--700 wpm), normal readers (reading rates around 250 wpm), and people who were asked to skim (producing rates around 600--700 wpm).

  The speed readers did better than skimmers on general comprehension questions about the gist of the passages but not quite as well as people reading at normal speed. Normal readers, who made many more fixations than the speed readers, were able to answer questions about details of the text relatively well, while skimmers and speed readers, who made many fewer fixations than normal readers, did not differ from each other on these items. They could not answer these questions if they had not fixated on the regions where the answers were located.

  *The data thus suggest that the students of speed-reading courses are essentially being taught to skim and not really read in the sense that we use the term “reading” here.* [emphasis mine]

  The advantage of trained speed readers over skimmers with respect to general comprehension of the text was ascribed by Just and colleagues to an improvement in what they called extended inferencing. Essentially, the speed readers had increased their ability to construct reasonably accurate inferences about text content on the basis of partial information and their preexisting knowledge.

  In fact, when the three groups of participants were given more technical texts (taken from Scientific American), for which background knowledge would be very sparse, the speed readers no longer showed an advantage over the skimmers, even on general questions.

Ain't none of that my "worldview," home dog.
