  I'd also love to see how I fare with the book of the fallen but I just can't seem to get into it.

Yeah, each book starts painfully slow before getting interesting eventually. Once it gets going though, it's some of the best in my opinion. One part in Deadhouse Gates, which I won't go into detail for fear of spoiling it, was genuinely the most emotionally impactful moment I've experienced in fiction. Maybe it just hit me at the right time, but it was masterfully done.

  Imagine having bouncy walls on the margins of a piece of text. Visualize (heh) your eyes bouncing off them, going faster and faster each time. It turns into this weird feeling of reading sentences the same way you normally read words; cognizant of the parts that make them up but also not thinking too hard about them.

Huh, that is interesting. However, I'm not sure if that's necessarily what your brain is actually doing as it's my understanding that human vision works by focusing on discrete points with the brain providing the illusion of movement between them, rather than actually seeing the movement like you would with a camera. If I'm correct with that understanding, you'd only be able to see the "bounce points" with this analogy, which obviously wouldn't allow you to read everything in between. This is outside of my area of expertise though, so I fully accept that I may be misinformed about the subject. It seems to work for you though, so I suppose the exact mechanics of it don't matter all that much.
