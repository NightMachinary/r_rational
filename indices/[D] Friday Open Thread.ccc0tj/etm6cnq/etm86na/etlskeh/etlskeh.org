[[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/bxvocf/d_friday_open_thread/eqac711/?context=3][glowfic]] on meeting parallel-universe elf versions of yourselves, when you're a family of adorable genius language nerds.]

 

The strange nonhumans lower their longbows. One of them walks forward to greet the broomstick riders where it appears they mean to land.

They land.

 

"Um!!!" says Minor.

"Yes, I noticed," says Finis. "If they're nonhuman then it wouldn't make sense for them to be nearly human either, maybe their real shapes are very strange and they're inhabiting ones close to ours for some reason - or maybe there's some kind of time travel involved, or maybe the mysterious spell works by reaching into parallel worlds, or -"

"It's uncanny. He doesn't look quite real."

 

"Uh, hi," Minor says to the uncanny him.

/{You'll have to give me a few minutes for the language,}/ Curufin sends, and says aloud in Quenya as well. Finis lights up with delight. /{I am Curufinwë Atarinkë of the Noldor.}/

"/I am Finis Eleazar Way,/" Finis says immediately in Quenya.

"/I am Minor Finis Way,/" Minor says. "/Of the -/ British." And switching to English - "where are we -"

"/Where are we?/" Curufin repeats in Quenya. "/This is Lake Mistaringë - Mithrim in the local language - in Beleriand, which our tongue has no word for, not knowing the place until we met its people. I have never heard of the/ British."

 

"/Mistaringë,/" says Finis thoughtfully, "/Mithrim./" And then he guesses four more Thindarin words off the Quenya ones. He gets three right; Curufin corrects one.

(Curufin is staring at him a bit fixedly.)

 

And then, switching to English, "I think we are very far from Britain - and we shouldn't have miscalculated the size of the world so grossly that there were large landmasses we missed - we've circumnavigated it - not us personally, but I follow the march of progress -"

"Circumnavigated."

Finis conjures a globe, demonstrates. "Circumnavigate. Circumference. Circumstance, circumvent - from the Latin -"

"Latin?"

Finis repeats what has been said so far in Latin.

 

/{Please do not be too distracted to ask why he's got a sphere for the world,}/ Maitimo sends.

/{I'm getting to it,}/ Curufin sends back.

He's not; he's carefully repeating back the Latin.

 

"British, Latin - we have Thindarin, Quenya -"

"Oh, I also speak Swedish and Danish and Italian and French and Greek and Igbo and Mandarin -"

"We have - not as many -"

"In the whole world? How far have you explored -"

"Haven't - circumnavigated - can't circumnavigated, no circum -"

"Primitive people think that before they learn math."

"We learn math. Can't circumnavigated, no circum."

"Can't circumnavigate, it's not round," Minor offers him.

"It's not round."

"Can show you with the angles off the sun."

"By all means."

 

And a flurry of conversation later - "okay, yours isn't round. And your sun is close and dim -"

"Not that dim -"

"Ours is very very far, and very very bright, if it were closer everything would boil and die -"

"Ours is drawn on a chariot by a Maia."

"Primitive people think that before they learn math, too."

"Does your kind of math make you wrong."

 

"Our world works on math! Yours might not."

"Our world works on fate."

Finis and Minor look at each other and make a face.

"- my father felt that way about it too. He's dead."

" - is he me," Finis says.

"Yes. I think so. Yes. Only - moreso -"

"Well. I don't have resurrection yet."
