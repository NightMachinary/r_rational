I'm almost halfway through Neal Stephenson's newest book Fall; Or, Dodge in Hell. (Marked spoilers are minor to medium.)

This book is reminding me of how much I enjoy Stephenson's tangents. The main storyline is about the main character being virtually simulated after his death, but I've been much more interested in the parts of the story about current and future social tech.

Early on in the book, a small town in Ohio gets nuked. Everyone freaks out until it comes out that it didn't actually happen. The town was DDOS'd and the supporting evidence was all faked. It uses that initial event to get into the idea of how it's hard to discern truth and lies on the Internet, and how in the near future it's going to get much harder than it already is.

He offers technical solutions to the above, as well as other related problems like privacy and Internet dogpiling. I don't necessarily think that some of them would actually work (if I can prove that this women wrote this code, the people calling her a fake will surely leave her alone). I think he does understand that though, there are sections on extreme conspiracy theorists and how no amount of evidence will change their minds.

But regardless of how effective his proposed tech would actually be, I still like reading about it, and I'm hoping it continues to show up in the story. I'm not sure if any of this will end up being relevant to the main plot or not, but I'm liking the book as a whole either way.
