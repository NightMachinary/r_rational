  I'm easing myself back into it with one a day, but after I finish this, like, I guess this course then I'm going to start watching 3 videos a day, one each from three different courses, sort of like school.

This is a good idea and I'm going to do it soon-ish, as soon as this next semester (final semester, at least before phd work, if those applications get accepted) is finished.
