I've noticed that lots of people like to talk about how many words they can read per minute. Saw it happen on a thread on [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] just yesterday, the OP and two commenters all claimed to read over 1,000 words per minute, with one of the commenters claiming to know someone who reads at 1,600wpm.

Here's the thing, though. Anything less than full comprehension isn't actually reading, it's skimming. The fovea is only as wide as it is, fixation lasts as long as it lasts, and saccades take as long as they take, so it isn't /physically/ possible to read with full comprehension much faster than 250wpm. 300wpm is /pushing it/. People who claim otherwise are deluding themselves - if you're "reading" at "600wpm" then you're only actually /seeing/ (and there's a difference between seeing and /seeing/) about half of the words, if that.

Each word influences the meaning of all the rest of the words. Reading should be done mindfully, every word heard in the mind's ear, and skimming only employed with text that describes a subject you're already familiar with.

What good does it do to /devour/ a book if you don't actually retain anything?
