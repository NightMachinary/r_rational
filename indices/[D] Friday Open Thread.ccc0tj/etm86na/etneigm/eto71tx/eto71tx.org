Do you have a cite or the math behind how you arrived at that 250-300wpm? Looking at the average wpm given by the app I use for offline reading has me at almost 500wpm (across 1300 reading hours).

Now, I do skim sometimes, so I've assumed my reading speed was more like 350-400 on average. When I look at the stats after reading a book I know I've read more carefully [usually because it's denser] it's as low as 275wpm. On other books I know I've read without skimming but that are lighter fare it's usually more like 400.
