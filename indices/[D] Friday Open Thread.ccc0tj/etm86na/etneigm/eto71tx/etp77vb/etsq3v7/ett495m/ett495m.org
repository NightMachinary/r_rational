I wish there was some form of standardized tests about the contents of novels popular on this sub. With your numbers, you'd be able to read Worm in ~18 hours. That could be one day of heavy reading, if you don't have to work that day. Or moving away from novels talked about on this sub, the idea of only taking ~37 hours to completely finish Malazan Book of the Fallen seems unlikely to me. I'd be fascinated to see you read all of such an incredibly long piece of fiction test how well you absorbed the text.

I'm not calling you a liar, it's just that you claim to read ~7.5 times faster than the average adult while simultaneously having much better reading comprehension than people reading much slower than you. This isn't necessarily impossible obviously, as the average adult almost certainly hasn't put any significant effort into optimizing their reading speed, but I'm sure you can understand some of my skepticism.
