  Do you have a cite or the math behind how you arrived at that 250-300wpm?

The source for that particular claim is an excerpt from a book called Language at the Speed of Sight: How We Read, Why So Many Can't, and What Can Be Done About It by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Seidenberg][Mark Seidenberg]]:

The relevant chunk:

  Reading speed is obviously going to depend on factors such as readers' skills and goals and whether they are reading Richard Feynman's lectures on physics or TMZ.com. But let's just do some cold, hard calculations based on facts about the properties of eyes and texts.

  - About 7 to 8 letters are read clearly on each fixation.

  - Fixation durations average around 200 to 250 milliseconds (4 to 5 per second).

  - Words in most texts are about five letters long on average. 4 fixations per second = 240 fixations per minute

  - 240 fixations Ã— 7 letters per fixation = 1,680 letters per minute

  - 1,680 letters/6 (five letters per word plus a space) = 280 words per minute

  The exact number of words per minute is far less important than the fact that this value cannot be greatly increased without seriously compromising comprehension.

The other source is a nice beefy 31 page article, which I would be willing to discuss if you took the time to read it:

  Now, I do skim sometimes, so I've assumed my reading speed was more like 350-400 on average. When I look at the stats after reading a book I know I've read more carefully [usually because it's denser] it's as low as 275wpm. On other books I know I've read without skimming but that are lighter fare it's usually more like 400.

You're probably skimming a lot more than you think you are, even when you think you're taking care to slow down or when you think you aren't skimming at all. If your "mind's ear" isn't "hearing" each individual syllable of every word, you're doing /some/ amount of skimming.
