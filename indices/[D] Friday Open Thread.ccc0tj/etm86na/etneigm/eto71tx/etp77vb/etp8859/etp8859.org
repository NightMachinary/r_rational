I'll take a look at that longer paper later, but with regards to the first article you quoted... Yeah, I do not read each individual letter. But it's not necessary to do so in order to read and comprehend! Most adults read by recognizing whole words at a time rather than letters. (Which is why poor grammar and spelling is annoying for me -- I have to concentrate more on what the writer meant to say than on what's actually being said.)
