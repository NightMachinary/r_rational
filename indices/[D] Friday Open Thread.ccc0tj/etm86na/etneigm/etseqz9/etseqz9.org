  Reading should be done mindfully, every word heard in the mind's ear, and skimming only employed with text that describes a subject you're already familiar with.

That's not really true though - human language was developed for use while speaking, which is a lossy medium. Most colloquial speech is quite redundant. For instance, only the first sentence of this paragraph was necessary; the rest of it only exists to provide for a smoother segue into the next point.

If you're not reading something particularly dense with meaning (like, say, the majority of fanfic, which is what the people in [[/r/fanfiction]] are probably reading), you're fine only reading every other word.
