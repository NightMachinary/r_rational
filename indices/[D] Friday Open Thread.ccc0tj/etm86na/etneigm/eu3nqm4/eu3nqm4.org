This sounds like pointless gate keeping.

Let people read how they want. If they want to speed read who cares?

You say they don't retain anything? Is that held up? Does it matter if they forget it? It's their choice

Are you the kind of person who says someone hasn't really read the hobbit until they've read all of the collective work of Tolkien and don't skip any of the three page long poems and songs
