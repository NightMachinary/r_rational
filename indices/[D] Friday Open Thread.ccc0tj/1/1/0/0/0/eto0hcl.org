I started on x1.5, have progressed to x2.5, and am experimenting with x3.0. I would not have been able to comprehend anything at 3.0 when I started, but I also know that I'll never comprehend anything at "infinitely fast," so I wonder when I'll hit that wall and what my maximum speed will turn out to be.
