I used to do 1.25x for like "informational" stuff but now I do 1.5x for that stuff because I've found it doesn't affect comprehension for the most part (sometimes I'll rewind 30 seconds and drop it down to 1.25x if I feel like I'm not paying close enough attention). I've tried 1.75x but it's just too much, your brain really /needs/ at least a little bit of time to linger on the words to absorb them and connect them to the surrounding words. For the most part, I play everything else at the speed it was recorded. I like language. I like listening to people speak. I'm tired, it's 3:12am, I'm having a hard time doing words good.

By the by, Stanford's got a bunch of courses uploaded to youtube. I'm easing myself back into it with one a day, but after I finish this, like, I guess this /course/ then I'm going to start watching 3 videos a day, one each from three different courses, sort of like school. Just because I feel like my brain is rotting from having consumed too much crap content. I abruptly stopped watching television in 2010, and I might be about to do the same with youtube (not like all videos stored on youtube because youtube is wider than TV was, like youtube-specific content like lets plays and podcasts and whatever). 3:22 now, definitely no do words good. I took my valerian root pills like 4 hours ago, I should've done been in bed by now.

This is the one I'm watching now, I'm on episode 14.

EDIT: Oh, left out something to the effect of "listening twice as fast probably isn't the same blow to comprehension as reading twice as fast because when you're listening the words are still entering your earholes but when your reading the words aren't entering your eyeholes at that speed."
