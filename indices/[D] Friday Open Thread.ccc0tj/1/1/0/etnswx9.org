ehhh... i play podcasts on 2.5x speed and i admit i probably only get 80% of the value out of them, but I get to consume more than twice the content, so really I'm getting ~200% the value per minute. I don't think there's anything wrong with making a quality/quantity trade off in whichever direction you want, and I assume that's what the boasters are doing whether it's conscious or not.

I do agree that boasting about reading speeds is weird, though, in light of this. In fact it makes about as much sense as boasting how much you dial up your podcast listening dial, so I should probably scuttle off in shame right now :)
