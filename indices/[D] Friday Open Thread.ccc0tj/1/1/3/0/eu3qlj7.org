  Let people read how they want.
#+end_quote

It literally isn't reading. It's like someone saying they've discovered a way to swim indefinitely and then when probed they say their more efficient method of swimming is to /walk/ around the perimeter of the pool. "But that isn't swimming, you're literally not even interacting with the water at all?" "Yes I am, it's right there, I'm looking right at it, don't be a gatekeeper, my method of swimming is just as valid as yours."

  You say they don't retain anything? Is that held up?
#+end_quote

Yep.

#+begin_quote
  Does it matter if they forget it?
#+end_quote

Can you really "forget" something that you never actually absorbed in the first place?

  Are you the kind of person who says someone hasn't really read the hobbit until they've read all of the collective work of Tolkien and don't skip any of the three page long poems and songs?

Have you read the rest of the comments I've made in this thread? Or the links to the work of cognitive scientists who specialize in psycholinguistics? There literally is /no such thing/ as speed reading. Brains and eyes just don't work like that. People who believe themselves to be "speed readers" are just skimming and depriving themselves of any real understanding of the text.

But hey, don't take /my/ word for it. You can start here:

[[https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1529100615623267]]

And then I swear to all the gods that if you continue researching this stuff in good faith that you'll see that literally zero legitimate sources support the assertions of people who claim to be able to "speed read."
