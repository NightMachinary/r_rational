They aren't just passively "having fun at the pool" and "enjoying themselves," minding their own business while swimmers heckle them. They're purposefully showing up at swim meets and actively bragging about how great they are at swimming to actual swimmers. Possibly worse, they sometimes try to poach from the swimming classes and convince people who still haven't worked their way up to making one full lap around the pool that they can quickly progress to being advanced swimmers by just getting out of the pool and walking around it instead of bothering with all that "actually interacting with the actual water" nonsense.
