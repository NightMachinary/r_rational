  Imagine having bouncy walls on the margins of a piece of text. Visualize (heh) your eyes bouncing off them, going faster and faster each time. It turns into this weird feeling of reading sentences the same way you normally read words; cognizant of the parts that make them up but also not thinking too hard about them.

That's a hell of a claim. It's not an original claim, either. Lots of "speedreading" proponents have claimed to read entire lines or entire pages at once. The claims have been tested and shown to be false. I'm sure if you were tested, you would fail as well. Literally each and every single individual human in the history of history who made that claim before you? They failed when their "ability" was tested. You see a thousand apples in a row fall to the ground, you do the math and show that it's physically impossible for them to do anything besides fall to the ground, and you're perfectly in the right to ridicule any apple who claims to have floated up to the moon and back.

The fovea is only 2 degrees wide. That's 1 degree from the center of vision. Words presented at a distance of just 3 degrees from the center of vision are correctly identified at the same rate as guessing, pure chance. It isn't physically possible to perceive an entire line of text at once.

Even if it were, brains simply don't work that way. We could theoretically alter our visual acuity to be able to clearly perceive every single word on a page, but that wouldn't change the fact that the brain can't process all those words simultaneously, that isn't how language works.

None of this is a claim. You can read it for yourself, in pages 6 through 13 of this paper:

[[https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1529100615623267]]

Given that you claim to be able to perceive an entire sentence at once, in spite of the fact that it's been conclusively shown that it isn't physically possible to perceive an entire sentence at once, can you explain how it's /me/ who's rude for pointing out the fact that you're making false claims and it isn't /you/ who's rude for making the false claims?

Unless of course you're simply deluding yourself and you really, /truly/ believe your own bullshit.

If you only see a tenth of the text and you retain/comprehend everything you've seen, I'm sure that feels the same as 100% retention/comprehension, because you have literally zero idea what's going on in the 90% that you skipped over while "reading sentences the same way you normally read words." It's entirely possible that you have piss-poor reading comprehension when you "speed read" but have convinced yourself otherwise because you know that your reading comprehension is fine when you /actually/ read and you don't feel the difference because you haven't read what you haven't read while +skimming/skipping+ "speedreading."

Subject your belief to falsification. Go back and re-read a book that you've recently read with "speedreading," and purposefully slow yourself down. Subvocalize. Hear the words in your mind as though someone else were reading them to you. I bet you'll feel like you're reading a completely different book that you've never encountered before.
