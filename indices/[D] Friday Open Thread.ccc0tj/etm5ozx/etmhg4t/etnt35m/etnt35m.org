Thanks so much for looking that up for me... so, basically, it's luck dependent enough that it's better planning to do it as part of a longer trip to the arctic circle. My BFF is Icelandic and we're going to go together one year, so I think I'll plan to see the aurora borealis (at this time of year... at this time of day... in this part of the country... located entirely within your kitchen) on that trip and strike it off the itinerary for this year.
