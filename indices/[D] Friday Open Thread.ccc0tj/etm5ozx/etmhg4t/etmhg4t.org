The probability of northern rights grows the further north you go. (Until it doesn't.) Just hopping over in Helsinki is probably not gonna give you anything. You'd have to go all the way to Lapland. There, in November, I think your chances are above flipping a coin + not having cloud cover. And you need to get away from light pollution.
