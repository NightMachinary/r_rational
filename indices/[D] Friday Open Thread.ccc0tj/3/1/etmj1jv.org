The museums in Berlin are spectacular. Get a day pass to the Museum Island--five world-class history & art museums all within a one-mile radius. I recommend two or three days to see them all, but if you're less of a museum fanatic than I, a day touring a couple of them will also be great.

As for vegan food: you must go to Mustafa's, a world-famous kebab street cart. They have an excellent falafel sandwich.
