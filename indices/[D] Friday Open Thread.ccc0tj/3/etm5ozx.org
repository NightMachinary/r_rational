OK, I'm going to start booking flights for the Weasel European Tour, so who wants to recommend cities in Europe that are good to spend a weekend?

I'm not a drinking/night-life person; I'm all about getting good (vegan) food, wandering around on foot, museums, animal sancturaries (not zoos unless they have a heavy conservation focus), that sort of thing.

I speak English and my French isn't too bad, and I have "decent for a tourist" Italian. I'm a woman traveling alone so no recommendations that are too dodgy please!

My wishlist so far:

- Amsterdam (i saw pictures of a ridiculous milkshake on [[/r/vegan]] the other day so even though i am not a "coffee shop" person, i'm definitely going to go there)
- Berlin (as promised: the people who live there please reply so we can start talking dates)
- My hairdresser recommended Prague, how's Prague?
- I want to go somewhere in Eastern Europe: Slovakia or Moldova or IDK, somewhere like that, searching suggestions
- Italy: I've heard Pompeii is stunning; I've heard Turin has a lot of vegetarian food.
- I want to see the northern lights: I'm here 'til the middle of November. Are they are a reliable "every night" thing or would it be silly to plan a weekend trip to Finland or something because it's not a guarantee?
