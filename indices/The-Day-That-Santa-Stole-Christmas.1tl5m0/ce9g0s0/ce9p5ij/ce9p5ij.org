I wrote this. I agree with most of that. Some are mistakes that can be easily fixed (the time zone thing), and some are just things that weren't explained enough. But there are also some structural problems, and I wouldn't really call it a "rational" story, just one that has the sort of science fictional and logical themes that you'd expect the find in this sub.

Things that I thought worked:

- Showing the problem with optimizers that can't read your mind
- Demonstrating the ridiculous capabilities we can infer Santa has
- Trying to figure out a foreign value system that's contradictory and not well-defined, and having to work within that
- Existential threats implied by the existence of the entire Santa system

Things I thought didn't work:

- Needs less idiot plot
- Needs a better central conflict
- Needs more coherence/foreshadowing
- Needs more background on Old Santa and his motivations

But I finished before my self-imposed deadline of Christmas, so whatever. I'm not entirely unhappy with it, for a little side project. It could be done better, and rewritten, and perhaps that's what I'll do for next Christmas. Thanks for the feedback!
