My main complaint is it was to short. Specifically, you wrote the first 2-3 chapters PERFECTLY in every way (I were expecting this to be the Next Big Thing along the lime of HPMoR, Friendship is Optimal, or Luminosity), then went "oh **** running out of time" and ruined it by rushing.

I advice retoning to wherever you started rushing, then continuing at the pace you're comfortable with, with no deadlines, and without worrying about getting anywhere.

Even the ending wasn't /bad/ it just needed 20 chapters of meandering exploration of the themes before it happened.
