Fucking annoying that you can't highlight on FF.net

#+begin_quote
  "Everything from 12:01AM on December 25 of last year to 11:59PM on December 24th of this year.
#+end_quote

What timezone (and would they really use 12 hour time)? That the guy didn't ask what time zone was really bothersome

#+begin_quote
  elves which is both age, gender, and culture appropriate
#+end_quote

Why not just say appropriate? By specifying those three things you imply that you're not doing anything else, such as whether they want it or not, length-of-their-hair appropriate (for example you could end up giving a hairbrush to a bald girl with the above criteria), etc

#+begin_quote
  we'll strip the present of its label since she doesn't read English anyway
#+end_quote

The elves use English in their day to day?

#+begin_quote
  He turned the dial back as far as it would go, to December 25th of the previous year, then zoomed all the way out until he was looking at the entire Earth
#+end_quote

So this could mean that there are no sentient life anywhere else in the universe, that the elves/Santa will never service off the Earth (kids in space/on mars), or that they only service humans and deliberately limited the scope of the zoom out function to where humans are

#+begin_quote
  "If I asked you to do anything, no matter what it was, you would do it?"</p><p>"Yes, Santa," she replied, eyes glued to the floor. She must have caught something in his tone. "Even that. I have training in ways to please you." Charles felt his stomach lurch.
#+end_quote

Sweet, she'll save every child on the planet from death and remove all poverty, etc.

She'd do literally anything. So maximize the happiness of every human on earth.

#+begin_quote
  "A merry Santa means a merry Christmas, as we say." She smiled at him, but he could see something false in her small eyes
#+end_quote

You know there is never a story that actually says "yup slave race that is happy to be a slave race, no questions about it", it's always "oh these people have different morals from me, hah, yeah right they have to be pretending!"

Far more likely that you would talk to a cannibal and say "so you like being a cannibal" "sure love it" but there was something false in his eyes. Really you're just making that falseness up. Of course, in this story unlikely.

But I like the implication the dwarves (human ones) aren't allowed to date if they're 3 feet tall.

#+begin_quote
  "Not me, Santa," said Matilda. "Others though, yes." Another false smile graced her face,
#+end_quote

Look this doesn't make sense, if she is false smiling and I'm pretty positive teh author is not going to just be doing that the guy assumes the smile is false because he wants it to be false they wouldn't have done any of this. They can replace Santa if they were able to get their own Santa after having none for 500 years.

AND THERE'S NO REASON TO MAGICALLY MAKE UP THESE RULES TO APPLY TO THEMSELVES IF THEY AREN'T TRUE!!!

Like why fucking bring that up? If they're under the impression you won't do things like that then they'll never do things like that. So dumb

#+begin_quote
  "We didn't know what you might want," said Matilda apologetically, "So I decided to offer a little bit of everything. Let me know what you prefer are and I can get you the breakfast of your choice tomorrow, or I can fetch more immediately if this isn't okay."<
#+end_quote

How can they not know what they want when they could have watched his entire life and worked it out?

I mean the fact that every food they offered was western and there wasn't anything at all out of the ordinary is pretty suggestive that they know plenty. They know he's not a vegetarian presumably or that he's not allergic to things. IF they're all about his merriness they definitely should've checked.

#+begin_quote
  "Jesus," he said quickly. "Forget I said anything, I want to be fat."
#+end_quote

Assuming that elves have human psychology is dumb, limiting oneself because of a reaction that apparently has not even affected someone is dumb, though I'll say fair enough if he's just delaying it since time is not an issue

#+begin_quote
  Elves can suffer/die from contradictions in the Christmas spirit? Find out what Christmas spirit is.
#+end_quote

HOW DO YOU KNOW THEY SUFFER. HOW DO YOU KNOW BLOOD FROM NOSE IS NOT AN ELVES FORM OF LAUGHING?!:?! Presumptions galore! This is not a very good rationalist he's way too immersed in his bias.

#+begin_quote
  "After he saw the first atomic weapons, Santa feared that the North Pole would be discovered if we were too obvious, and that if they discovered us they would bomb us," said Matilda.
#+end_quote

SO SANTA WAS WELL KNOWN AND COMMON KNOWLEDGE UP UNTIL 1945>!?!?!?!??!?! (or probably during the first nuclear tests)

Excluding of course all the other bombs and shit that could destroy the North Pole (hello global warming)

#+begin_quote
  If he made them redo the list, it would mean hundreds of generations of elves living and dying in order to get Christmas ready. "Hold off on that for now," said Charles.
#+end_quote

WHAT THE FLYING FUCK ARE YOU SERIOUS.

NO ONE SHOULD BE NAUGHTY! NO ONE! AND DON'T MAKE IT APPLY ONLY TO CHILDREN

#+begin_quote
  "The Christmas spirit is when a child opens presents in the morning," said Matilda. "It's a sip of eggnog, it's snowball fights, it's Jack Frost nipping at your nose, it's -"
#+end_quote

I think I am going to have a stroke from this.

[[http://www.calendar-365.com/seasons.html]]

A not significant portion of the world don't have Christmas during Winter (all places that don't have seasons/equatorial/tropical countries, plus places that have it opposite seasons to Northern hemisphere) aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah

#+begin_quote
  he could just repeatedly ask Matilda over and over whether this or that thing was part of the Christmas spirit, but that seemed overly laborious and prone to error.
#+end_quote

Look is this guy a retard or something?

"Okay, entire elves spend 1000 years writing everything that you think is in the Christmas spirit"

Then they come back maybe they finished the list in 100 years, maybe they never finished it, don't matter. Easy!

Also get them to put it in some sort of computer program and then go put it into watson or something.

#+begin_quote
  Effective immediately, there is to be one child on the Naughty list," he said to the elves
#+end_quote

Well it took him long enough (to think of it), THOUGH FOR SOME REASON IT'S STILL CHILDREN ONLY!.

How do elves define children? 18, 21, 13? Countries all have different definitions

Him mandating it that it was the naughtiest child in the world was kind of dumb when he doesn't know the definition of naughty, instead he should have chosen a random child in the world, or a specific one he knew. Like, I don't know a comatose baby or something. That saves all work.

But since he has heard the story of the elves giving the plague rat to a naughty child I think him changing the list first WAS REALLY DUMB. Change present production then change the list. He's been given ONE LESSON and he ignored it straight away. "Elves give epidemics to naughty children"

#+begin_quote
  "Okay, even if that were true, her parents and friends would still be sad that they couldn't interact with her, wouldn't they?"</p><p>The elf frowned.
#+end_quote

I do not like Charles. The solution is to give it to all her parents and friends. This device is literally the best possible thing that could happen to humans.

#+begin_quote
  "Never, ever make self-replicators."
#+end_quote

Fuck this guy, the elf literally solved all of humanities problems and just maximized happiness of humanity (except they need to figure out how to make humanity spread) but he's basically offered transcendence on a platter

#+begin_quote
  . In the wake of that we adopted a human Santa.
#+end_quote

WHAT IF THEY HAD ADOPTED HITLER. THE IMPLICATION IS THAT ALL HUMANS SHARE THE SAME VALUES THIS IS FUCKING DUMB

#+begin_quote
  "Nothing short of a complete destruction of your body would kill you, and assuming that the North Pole wasn't also destroyed we would restore you from backup if you were killed."
#+end_quote

Does she mean matter annihilation? What if one atom survived, one proton? One electron? at what point is a body completely destroyed

#+begin_quote
  It keeps making me feel sick."
#+end_quote

Why the fuck did the Old Santa choose this guy then? I mean they can't have anything in common being separated by 100 years and this guy gets sick from people willingly fighting to the death by their own choice instead of being merged into a single body which is exactly the same end

#+begin_quote
  "He is a worse man than you," said Matilda. "I think we've talked enough that I can see that now. Though he did stay within the Christmas spirit."
#+end_quote

WHAT HOW CAN HE BE WORSE

The elves have a moral compass apparently to fucking know that he was worse this makes no sense at all god fucking damnit why don't people think

#+begin_quote
  At 3:42pm UTC."
#+end_quote

Now she clarifies time zones, interesting that she knows what unit to give them time in too. I suppose the old santa told her to not give seconds or plank seconds, etc.

#+begin_quote
  "We wouldn't let him kill anyone. Elves can't act contrary to the Christmas spirit."

  *Though he did stay within the Christmas spirit."*
#+end_quote

CONTRADICTIONS

Why did this homocidal murder fantasy Santa decide to choose another Santa replacement? Why the fuck did he not get a child and raise the child to want to take over the North Pole then get the child to get the present so that he could control the North Pole with absolute power with no Christmas Spirit. Why not get him a holographic room so that he could just simulate killing all these people instead? Add a room to his apartment in the north pole with a holodeck and hop on in.

#+begin_quote
  It affects us. We don't like it. It's not in the spirit of Christmas, to have such things happen to children."<
#+end_quote

HEARD IT HEAR FIRST FOLKS

ADULT SEX SLAVES ARE FINE FOR CHRISTMAS.

Also you know there are children rapists and those who use sex slaves. And he still hasn't defined children

#+begin_quote
  whole of humanity as good as killed
#+end_quote

Look, this is clearly plainly wrong. The BEST universe is a universe filled with as much life as possible that is experiencing constant happiness. Out of every universe in the world that one has the highest value. There is no universe that is better.

#+begin_quote
  However, if we were to make a duplicate of you and strip him of his mantle, it would be acceptable to send that duplicate out into the world to do as he wished."
#+end_quote

It's official there can be multiple Santas.

Also, how exactly are they stopping him killing him? Why can't he just order an elf to create a nuclear missle targeting system for him. Then without telling them use it. Or even better "Can I get an instant killing device that I just type in a person name and it kills them, I don't want to use it thanks"

#+begin_quote
  Did I screw up, when I told you all to be immortal?" he asked.</p><p>"No," she replied. "We think better, when we have hundreds of years of experience to draw on. Charles, we're leaving.
#+end_quote

That's what he fucking gets for not simulating that the idiot that he is.

Also for being wiser why the hell would she acquiesce to one last Christmas?

--------------

All done now, obviously whole bunch of negativity from me, not really seeing the "rational" in this story, but eh it was an all right story if it's not meant to be rational. I like that the elves were like "Fuck you, cheerio", makes for a good surprising twist. I kind of thought that there would be more to James like he was being very built up to the be epitome of evil that I thought he would be the central antagonist of the story but that didn't happen
