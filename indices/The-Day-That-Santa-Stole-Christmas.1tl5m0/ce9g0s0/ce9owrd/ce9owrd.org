Many of these complaints are just silly. Some require unfairly uncharitable readings, and some of them are contradictory. Why did you read the story that way? Could you not equally read it like this?

  "We didn't know what you might want [for breakfast]," said Matilda apologetically, "So I decided to offer [something age, gender, and culture appropriate. Those are the only criteria that are at all important in deciding these sorts of things! Just like you are age, gender, and culture appropriate to be our moral compass. Within those constraints, plus or minus a few others you do not know, you were the most expedient choice, if someone wanted to stop being Santa. (According to normal procedures, we spent a few generations switching to your language and time conventions, before you arrived.) What's that? You share an age, gender, and culture with Hitler? Why, yes, you do. Hitler was also qualified to be our moral compass. Why shouldn't Hitler be Santa? 'Evil monster'? 'Unique individuals'? I'm afraid I don't understand. What's wrong with ordering that people be killed? People dying wasn't the problem with the rat, the problem was that the child was naughty and shouldn't have gotten anything, and, even if he had been nice, he wasn't happy with his present! And what's wrong with adult sex slaves?]"

  "When the button is pressed, it will activate the neurons in her brain and make her maximally happy. It has its own internal power source, and will continue going until she dies. [...] The device will multiply itself, drawing matter from its surroundings, in order to make the parents and friends of the parents of and friends of Li Xiu Yang happy, and so on. [Essentially, it forces a massive dose of heroin into every person on the planet forever. I'm sure there are no ethical problems with that at all! Isn't that what you wanted? Is heroin induced euphoria not the best thing in the world? What's 'eudaimonia'?]"

  "He is a worse man than you," said Matilda. "I think we've talked enough that I can [predict what you would think about him]. Though he did stay within the Christmas spirit [so us elves didn't have a problem with him. And now that he's not Santa, we won't prevent him from breaking the Christmas spirit anymore. For example, if you recall our lengthy dialog about what is and is not in the Christmas spirit (which constrains your actions, and the actions of your predecessor, and which our readers didn't hear all of; they might not even know how the Christmas spirit deals with hemispheres! I think you would be pleased, by the way, that you didn't unintentionally have 50 generations of elves kill themselves to make that list, before you thought to make us immortal just now), setting up a holodeck to kill people contradicts to the Christmas spirit, but the old Santa could do that now that he stepped down]."
