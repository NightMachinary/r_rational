  Well, yeah, clearly those aren't the only criteria. I just meant to point out that you complained that they should have claimed to use everything about a person to decide on a gift for them, not just a few general criteria... then you complained when they did exactly what they said they would, instead of what you said they should have said they would do. That's simply not the story's fault.
#+end_quote

I complained that they specified at all, and my complaint was not that they did things in the way later on which implied they had other criteria, it was because they later on said that they did have other criteria (poor kids getting poor presents). Sure some of the examples I suggested might actually not have been part of their criteria, but that's not irrelevant I was just positing potential other criteria on the grounds that they definitely have other criteria so why the hell did they specify those 3? And if that was there only criteria plus christmas spirit then that's just asking for more analysis, how did they end up caring about gender or age and not about religion or individual likes/dislikes. After all an individual male might dislike a barbie doll while another individual male might like a barbie doll but if you go by gender then it'd probably be based on averages but even that doesn't make sense so how do they use broad categories to decide gifts. It works on generalization scale but not when you're individually tracking all children there's no need to group at all.

  Elves don't value the lives of elves, but elves can recognize that Charles values the lives of elves, and they can talk about things from his perspective instead of their own. This helps communicate with Charles, signals submission to Charles' ideals, and reassures him of his own position. It's exactly what a good servant should do.

Sure, but he should have noticed that. Him blindly accepting that the elves were a moral bunch when apparently that simply take on the morals of whoever their Santa is (so that before the new Santa took over they were all cheering in the gladiatorial combat) is silly. And assuming what you're saying is right then why did she offer extra services in the first place? Why bring it up? She didn't offer other things, and she started off with sadness when offering it the first time which does imply that she values the happiness/lives of elves. Because she didn't know anything about him yet

  For example, they know that at least one person has to be naughty, in spite of your exclamation to the contrary. (As we are told later.)

So I'm not seeing what your complaint is. My instant thoughts on seeing this was I don't know this, I don't know if Charles know this, it was mentioned in needs one child but it wasn't mentioned that it needs children. I can assume that Charles knows the answer to literally every question I could possibly think of but it just makes way more sense for me to ask questions that I would want to know the answer to that I don't know.

I don't know what Charles asked, he clearly never asked if elves could change their opinion on anything (seeing as how they eventually abandoned him) or asked about repercussions of immortality. Yet you would have had me assume that he knew exactly all future events that were going to happen.

And in all the time he spent asking questions he only found out James was alive LATER?

I cannot assume the content of a conversation I'm not privy too. When he says that only one child is allowed to be on I did not disagree or be like where did he get that information, I accepted that it was now revealed that he had that in the previous conversation but until it's revealed I'm going to assume nothing specific.

  If someone credibly offered to flood your senses with a permanent orgasm, if only you let them destroy your prefrontal cortex, remove all your limbs, and stuff you in a bag alone forever, would you take them up on it? If so, can you not imagine any reasonable person choosing to stay sapient but sub-orgasmic?
#+end_quote

Whether I would take it up is irrelevant because humans don't act rationally. The rational choice is yes, I know the rational choice is yes. I know that my biological imperative is to be happy and the best life would be one in which I was happy, I know if I was granted total omnipresent omnipotent powers the eventual play even after 1 billion years of experimenting would be a universe with total happiness.

The only reason you would say no would be if you valued your ability to move, but why do you value your ability to move? Because it makes you happy to be free/you would be unhappy if it didn't happen. It's the fundamental of all human action. No one does anything they don't want to do, because if they didn't they just wouldn't do it (excluding involuntary actions like seizures)

Of course "reasonable" people would say no, but that doesn't mean that it's the right choice. After you made the choice you would be happy with it, if you took the other choice it's not certain.

The rationales out of it are afterlife, you believe that in your lifespan they will invent it anyway but also invent immortality or you could not believe them in the they're lying to kill me/etc or you could be of the opinion that permanent orgasm is impossible

If the best universe is not one filled with the simplest (or the one that can experience the most happiness per material used) possible conciousness experiencing bliss then what is the best universe? All utility functions have at least one max result with finite inputs.
