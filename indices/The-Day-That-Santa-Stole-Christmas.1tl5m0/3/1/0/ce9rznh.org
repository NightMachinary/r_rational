  Many of these complaints are just silly. Some require unfairly uncharitable readings, and some of them are contradictory. Why did you read the story that way? Could you not equally read it like this?

I'm a pretty negative person, I certainly agree that on some things you can just accept it willingly. However when dealing with other sentient species and especially in a story about optimizers I'm far less willing to just accept it.

  Those are the only criteria that are at all important in deciding these sorts of things

Well sure, but I'm pretty positive that that's not the only criteria they use. Since they mention they don't give rich toys to poor kids we know that have other values such as relative social status and attempting to keep hidden. I also doubt they'd give presents of say chocolate to people allergic to chocolate. I don't know that with the story as it's presented but it would fit with what I already believe that Santa does and this is a story that works backwards from "Santa does this" therefore he has X abilities, rather than changing what Santa does.

  Essentially, it forces a massive dose of heroin into every person on the planet forever. I'm sure there are no ethical problems with that at all! Isn't that what you wanted? Is heroin induced euphoria not the best thing in the world? What's 'eudaimonia'?

I will argue to no end that this is the best thing possible, however I was definitely wrong in assuming that Charles would think that way.

I cannot think of any other goal that people would choose. When described the best possible universe I don't see how the one with infinite life and infinite happiness is not the best one. Everything only is valuable because of happiness, we don't like murder because it makes us unhappy, etc.

  I think you would be pleased, by the way, that you didn't unintentionally have 50 generations of elves kill themselves to make that list, before you thought to make us immortal just now), setting up a holodeck to kill people contradicts to the Christmas spirit, but the old Santa could do that now that he stepped down

But they do not value the lives of elves, elves dying isn't a bad thing under the Christmas Spirit, since they value that that was a huge hint that they have their own set of morals that aren't defined by the Christmas Spirit which was my point.

For a story about rationality it is often very important that the reader actually gets to know ALL of the information that the character does. I'll give you that since the author said he didn't intend for it to be rational then it certainly makes sense for story purposes not to give the reader all that information. But then I don't see how I can be made to fault for assuming that dialogue which I didn't read happened. I want to know how the elves dealt with it, and if it happened off camera and I'm not aware of that fair enough but I couldn't be expected to assume that at the time of writing, or if I could I don't want to start assuming off camera stuff because that changes how I criticize.

And if she is just saying he is worse to fit with the own guys morals, which sure were blatantly obvious then I feel he should have noticed, but I'm willing to accept he has a privilege there of expecting reality to conform to his ideology.

I was talking about simulating elves being immortal, but I'm pretty sure that wouldn't be against hte Christmas spirit since they already simulate reality and reality involves people dying. and since we know elves don't mind dying for Santa's random will then I can't see why they'd mind being simulated.
