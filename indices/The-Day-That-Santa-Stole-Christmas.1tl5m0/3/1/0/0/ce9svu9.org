  Well sure, but I'm pretty positive that that's not the only criteria they use. Since they mention they don't give rich toys to poor kids we know that have other values such as relative social status and attempting to keep hidden. I also doubt they'd give presents of say chocolate to people allergic to chocolate.

Well, yeah, clearly those aren't the /only/ criteria. I just meant to point out that you complained that they should have claimed to use everything about a person to decide on a gift for them, not just a few general criteria... then you complained when they did exactly what they said they would, instead of what you said they should have said they would do. That's simply not the story's fault.

  But they do not value the lives of elves, elves dying isn't a bad thing under the Christmas Spirit, since they value that that was a huge hint that they have their own set of morals that aren't defined by the Christmas Spirit which was my point.

Elves don't value the lives of elves, but elves can recognize that Charles values the lives of elves, and they can talk about things from his perspective instead of their own. This helps communicate with Charles, signals submission to Charles' ideals, and reassures him of his own position. It's exactly what a good servant should do.

You don't have to assume that dialog that you didn't read happened. We are /told/ that dialog that we didn't read happened. The last paragraphs of Chapter 3 are basically "And then Charles asked Matilda a bunch of questions about the Christmas spirit, and refactored his plans around that information." True, the reader isn't given enough information to solve the problem ourselves, but we absolutely know that the characters know more than we do. For example, they know that at least one person /has/ to be naughty, in spite of your exclamation to the contrary. (As we are told later.)

  When described the best possible universe I don't see how the one with infinite life and infinite happiness is not the best one.

If someone credibly offered to flood your senses with a permanent orgasm, if only you let them destroy your prefrontal cortex, remove all your limbs, and stuff you in a bag alone forever, would you take them up on it? If so, can you not imagine any reasonable person choosing to stay sapient but sub-orgasmic?
