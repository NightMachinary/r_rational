Aren't you making a number of assumptions on Charles' values ? Such as

#+begin_quote
  The BEST universe is a universe filled with as much life as possible that is experiencing constant happiness. Out of every universe in the world that one has the highest value. There is no universe that is better.
#+end_quote

There's nothing obvious there. The best universe could be the one that's filled with paper clips.

Also, I thought that elves being pretty contradictory and weird about the Christmas spirit was the whole point of the story ? That it doesn't really make sense ? So I think you're being a bit unfair there.

Although I definitely agree that the whole "we won't let him kill" "hey, he just killed someone, no worries" thing shouldn't be there.
