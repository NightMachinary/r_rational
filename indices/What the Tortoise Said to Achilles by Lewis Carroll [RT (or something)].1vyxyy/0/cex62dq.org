Just for those who are not aware: If you enjoyed this story, go read all of Godel Escher Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid by Hofstadter. His book, in addition to focusing on ideas like the infinite regress illustrated by Carroll, also uses a similar style and characters in dialogues to illustrate things (though he also explains things with rather more mathematical precision as well).
