I think the talk of Atlanta in hpmor is inspired by (or even a reference to) another fanfic. I think "Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time". I had read it a little before I read hpmor because it's in Yudkowskys favorites list. I don't thinking that fic is especially rational, though. And I think it's not finished.
