I'm not sure if I still get your Waffley disarm-spamming thingy reference.

But to this:

"Hi, I'm Harry Potter. At this moment, I'm being chased by genocidal terrorists who are actively trying to kill me and all my friends. I know! I'll use a spell that temporarily disarms them, assuming no one has a backup wand, or could ever recover their own! Brilliant tactics!"

I couldn't really contend your response.
