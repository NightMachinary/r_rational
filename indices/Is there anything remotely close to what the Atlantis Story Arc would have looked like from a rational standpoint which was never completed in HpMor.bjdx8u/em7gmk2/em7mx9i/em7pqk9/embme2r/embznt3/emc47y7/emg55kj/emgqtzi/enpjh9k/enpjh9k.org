Well, also, what bugs me is expelliarmus is a spell taught to 11 year olds.

We teach 11 year olds basic ways to fight - from karate, while some kids hunt with rifles.

​

Yet it's still nothing like the kind of heavy firepower you'd use in a real battle. Even the kids using rifles aren't using them like you'd use a military assault rifle, or using the supporting fire and explosives you'd actually use.

​

So it just felt weak when Harry faces armed assailants with basically just a kid's spell. Even though it worked, the victory didn't feel earned.
