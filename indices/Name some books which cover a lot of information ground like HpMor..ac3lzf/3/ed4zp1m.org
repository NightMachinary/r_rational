I'm not sure how you'd like it but I would recommend a series of books written by Terry Pratchett, Jack Cohen, and Ian Stewart called "The Science of the Discworld". There are 4 books and each is about 1/4 humorous Terry Pratchett story and 3/4 scientific essay (I find it hard to describe but these sections are meant to teach and explain - mostly to scientifically competent and intelligent audience). They cover everything from the beginning of the universe, the appearance of life, the nature of humanity, the scientific method, evolution, infinity, quantum physics, ecology, and astronomy, a little bit of everything scientific really. Although it is only partly fictional story and mostly non-fiction that weaves in and out of the narrative. I don't know if that is what you are after but its the closest thing I can think of.
