  particular Incandescence verges on being a physics lecture in fiction form
#+end_quote

That's true. It's also, in my experience and opinion, a very confusing physics lecture that uses different terms for everything, and from which I didn't understand much because of that. Greg Egan also published a tutorial explaining the physics in the book [[http://www.gregegan.net/INCANDESCENCE/Incandescence.html][in his website (see bottom of page)]], which you might find easier to learn from.

Basically: if you are new to them and want to learn, I do not recomend Incandescence. I think it's OK entertainment though.
