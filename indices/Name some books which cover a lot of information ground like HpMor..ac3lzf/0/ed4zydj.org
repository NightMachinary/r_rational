It's hard to recommend fiction books that will teach you science, because often the science in even "hard SF" books was speculative or wrong on publication or out of date now.

I would suggest Blindsight by Peter Watts (a lot of cognitive science/neuroscience content) or Anathem by Neal Stephenson (although that has more maths and philosophy content to do with Platonism than science).

A lot of Greg Egan's work is very heavy on science content, and in particular Incandescence verges on being a physics lecture in fiction form. He even has material explaining the science and maths behind a lot of his stories on his website. Some of his later work was kind of heavy going for me, but you will definitely learn a lot if you follow it all up!

A lot of older hard SF is really space opera with a veneer of science. I guess A Mission Of Gravity by Hal Clement holds up if you ignore the biology.
