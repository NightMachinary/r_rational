- Every book by [[http://daniel-suarez.com/][Daniel Suarez]] does an excellent job of taking at least one potential upcoming technology (AR, CRISPR, drones, etc.) and explaining how it could / will be integrated into our future lives in a realistic techno-thriller manner. Daemon + Freedom(TM) changed my life.
- [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004M8SR2O/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1][Rainbow's End]] is a great look at how Augmented Reality will be integrated into every part of our lives.
- Potentially Bug Park and The Fear Index?
