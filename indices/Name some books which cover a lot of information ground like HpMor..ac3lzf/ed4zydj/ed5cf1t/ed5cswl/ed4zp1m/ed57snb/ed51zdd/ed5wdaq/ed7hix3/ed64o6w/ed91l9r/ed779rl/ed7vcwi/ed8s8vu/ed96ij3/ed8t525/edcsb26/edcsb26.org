The big deal with the Bayesian theorem is that it gives a mathematical explanation of how scientific reasoning arrives at the (p<0.05) truth. You can't plug numbers into it because most of the time there is no calculable prior, but you don't need to; it just shows that what we already do with the scientific method increases or decreases the probability of a hypothesis being correct. So the Bayesian theorem itself isn't the rule of thumb, the scientific method is, the theorem is what happens "under the hood". This is kind of controversial in philosophy of science (obligatory Feynman quote in the replies) last time I checked. It's not some huge revelation that shakes up how we do science, it says "Oh, that's why it works".

LW doesn't really go over that, or how science works in practice. Which makes sense since afaik most of the writers aren't practicing scientists. That one short story EY did about students in the future figuring out a grand unified theory in a few days because you only need 5 minutes for a good idea and they thought outside the box was particularly insulting.

HPMOR focuses on the wrong stuff if it aims to teach the scientific method, as well as referencing stuff that is outright wrong or unproven. It's okay as a work of fiction, as long as the protagonist and author tract don't turn you off, but it's not a good teaching tool except as a way to get people interested in learning more.
