I've just finished catching up to the end of the story. It suffers from a major flaw (in my opinion), which consists of existing in what I'd refer to as an American-movie world.

It doesn't feel like a world that is lived in. It feels like a world that exists entirely to be looked at from the outside. A world in which a student association has access to mind-control drugs and several decisions are taken on the basis of Rule Of Cool instead of Rule Of Practicality.

Aside from that, and a couple of logic errors*, it's a pretty neat story, though.

(/The most egregious is that GORGON's anti-qubit plan is going to lead inevitably to massive trouble if *any/ way of defeating her foresight ability is at all successful - but with a modicum of thought, OAT can very easily use a qubit-based strategy to completely dismantle GORGON's anti-qubit plan.)
