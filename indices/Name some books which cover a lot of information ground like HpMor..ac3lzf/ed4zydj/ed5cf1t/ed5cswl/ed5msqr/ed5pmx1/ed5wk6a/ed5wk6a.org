Think of it as taking place in an alternative universe with different underlying physics, including magic. The magic is self-consistent and rules-based much more heavily than in most fantasy novels, but it doesn't have anything to do with the real world and doesn't really teach the reader anything. Sanderson believes, rightly I think, that authors should only use magic to solve problems insofar as the careful reader could have figured out the magic was capable of solving it and why. So he doesn't have a deus ex machina problem that I've seen in other fantasy novels where the hero gets stuck in an impossible situation and all of a sudden their magic takes over and just wipes out an enemy legion or solves some other insurmountable problem that you didn't know it could.
