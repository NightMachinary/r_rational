(An absent-minded Blindsight question: Who poisoned the pseudo-captain vampire? I recall that he began dying epileptically, and the protagonist thought that a character expected to mutiny had sabotaged his anti-epilepsy medication, but then a later twist reveals that the expectations of mutiny were only the protagonist projecting his own dissatisfaction--so, who sabotaged the medication..?)

...now remembering various moments from that...

Protagonist: "I've thought of an unintuitive implication of the prisoner's dilemma in respect to benefits and disadvantages of telling others one's birthday, namely that only by not telling others one's birthday can one identify genuine interest in celebrating one's birthday."

Reader: "Hmm, a fun-to-think-about line of thought, but I note that even if someone goes out of their way to learn your birthday they could still just be being conscientious or want to make themselves look more likeable by going that far, and even if you tell others then both you and (more) others could enjoy the celebrations taken part in."

Character A, in romantic relationship with protagonist at the time: "I'm going to laugh at you without suggesting any alternative line of thought at all."

Character B, later: "I'm not going to suggest any alternative line of thought at all, and if I were character A I would have immediately terminated our romantic relationship without suggesting any alternative line of thought at all."

Reader: "..."

...Maybe that actually stung because it puts me in mind a conversation I had once, where I mentioned a trolley problem to someone I was having a pleasant conversation with and the person suddenly started cursing at me (repeatedly saying that I was saying bovine excrement, less politely) without giving any explanation...
