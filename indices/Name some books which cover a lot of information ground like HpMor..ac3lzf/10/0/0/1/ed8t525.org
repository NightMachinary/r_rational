Nah, I get it. Honestly while I got the general idea I didn't keep to mind most of the social psych stuff anyway, so no harm done here I guess. As for Bayesian reasoning... it's all about your priors, really, so ultimately it's just a way to express systematically a way of reasoning, but in all situations in which you can't actually put numbers to things it's not exactly a rigorous tool. Just a rule of thumb, basically.

About the bystander effect, I guess the terminology was wrong, but I get the idea that was meant in the story - the whole "/someone else/ will do something about it" line of thought that ends up in no one doing anything. I suppose it's not the most accurate use of the notion, but I can see how one sort of makes you think of the other.

The timeless physics stuff, as I said, isn't something that for what I know is /wrong/. But it's a theory. Not unlike if Harry had said he needed to think of strings. Strings are something physicists talk about, not complete nonsense, but neither they are remotely proven and they have competing theories.
