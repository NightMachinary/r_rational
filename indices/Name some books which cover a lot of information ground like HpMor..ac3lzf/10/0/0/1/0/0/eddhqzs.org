I guess I just don't feel like Bayes' theorem is especially surprising; it seems an intuitive notion to me, the theorem is just a way of putting it into numbers. As such, it doesn't tell me anything that I didn't already understand if I don't have numbers to put to it. Ultimately, the great Bayesian prior of science is "there exists some set of consistent, universal rules upon which the natural world operates", because conditional to that, the probability of observing consistent, predictable experimental results is much higher than the Universe simply randomly conspiring to screw with us.
