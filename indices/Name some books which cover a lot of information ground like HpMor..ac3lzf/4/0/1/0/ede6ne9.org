Valid criticism. Truth is it is basically a story wrapped around concepts I find cool. This leads to a 'movie world' that is not immersive. This is apart from own shortcomings as an author.

I might have painted myself in a corner on the qubit plot line. Need to think about it more. Also, I constantly violate the cardinal rule of rational writing: bending character actions to fit the plot :-)
