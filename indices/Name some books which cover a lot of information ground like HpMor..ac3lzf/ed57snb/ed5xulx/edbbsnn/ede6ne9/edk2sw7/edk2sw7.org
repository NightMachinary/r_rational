Think about this - the qubit-based strategy will fail to predict a strategy that will result in the world being destroyed. Thus, if the qubit-based random generator is used to randomly predict an /entire strategy/, it will never pick a strategy that will lead to the world being destroyed. Thus, a strategy designed by qubit will either:

- Be thrown out, unused
- Result in a complete GORGON victory
- Successfully prevent GORGON from destroying the world, probably through damaging their giant accelerator beyond repair

Using the qubit to generate strategies, and throwing out any that look like they would lead to a GORGON victory, should result in a strategy that can cripple GORGON's particle accelerator; this then allows more traditional use of the qubit for attack timing after that point.
