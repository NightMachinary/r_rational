The honor Harrington series. It's pretty hard sci fi.

There's a fic called "with this ring" on sufficient velocity. [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.25076/]] It's similar to Hpmor in that it fills in plot holes neatly. It's a SI, so you might not like that. If you liked the original teen Titans, or the new Young Justice, it's for you.
