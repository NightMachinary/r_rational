I really loved Capacity in that series. One of the most beautiful & chilling speculations of mind uploaded futures, Von Neumann machines, mind-as-computer-tape determinism, etc. as you said. The only glaring fudge IMO is one of the novels interpreting quantum observers needing to be conscious to qualify as observers instead of simple photon detectors.
