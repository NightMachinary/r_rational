Also, fun fact: the famous Robber's Cave experiment was the second attempt.

The first experiment by the scientist behind it had the two groups getting along as good friends, and was never published because it didn't show what he wanted. The second experiment didn't manage to create tension without assistants (not the boys themselves) stealing/vandalizing from both groups and blaming the other group in front of the kids involved.
