A lot of the social psych, for starters. One that sticks out to me is the Robbers Cave experiment around chapter ~30. This setup of the experiment was presented completely incorrectly in-text, with incorrect conclusions drawn from it. Another example is the bystander effect- it applies specifically to /individuals/ in emergency situations, whereas the text attempts to use it to describe behavior on a country-wide scale for long-term issues. And it doesn't apply in situations where the individuals attempting to help are putting themselves at risk, like children facing a troll or untrained combatants facing a terrorist attack. These are basic concepts in psychology, and are far less useful models when you take them outside of the bounds where they were tested/observed.

There's also a lot of bad Bayesian probability/reasoning.

More generally, I don't like it being referred to as a "non-fiction work of science education," since it doesn't really educate you on how to "do" science. The parts where things are actively being tested are good, and there are some fun concepts (i.e. sunlight in acorns -> potions on the fly), but a lot of them are Harry thinking really hard about something, making a hypothesis, then just assuming that it's correct. Word of God says that Harry was actually wrong about some of those hypotheses, but that's only brought up in external discussions and Harry's false theories are never addressed in the story, so functionally there was no difference. The aforementioned potion thing is a fun idea, but IIRC the "carryover" of magical meaning concept isn't even hinted at earlier in the fic, unlike Taure's Victoria Potter series where a similar underlying concept is gradually introduced to the reader.

I'm not especially familiar with physics beyond mechanics, E&M, and basic quantum physics related to optics/physical chemisty/biology, so I can't really speak to any of the timeless physics stuff.

Not saying HPMOR is a bad fic, or that I didn't enjoy it. But it's definitely not a great place if you're looking to actually learn the concepts (especially if your first exposure to them is incomplete and uses bad examples)
