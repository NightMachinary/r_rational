Any examples? I can't think of anything outright /wrong/ off the top of my head right now. The worst bit is perhaps the one about the 'timeless' representation of physics being presented as the 'true reality', not because it's necessarily wrong but because it's just one of EY's plausible pet theories pushed as if it was proven fact.
