  happy to accept even mean-spirited criticism

I can offer half-baked criticism! Is that acceptable?

1451 words are not a lot, even when you try to illustrate only one concept (a [[#s][spoiler]] using a rather well-known setting (classic DND fantasy). You use the minimum amount of words to introduce the entire party, which is rather economical compared to something like this paragraph, which re-states the same thing quite a few different times, and is really unnecessarily rambling at this point, by which I mean to say, I liked how /compact/ your story was.

The one thing I would like to nitpick is that it lacks a bit of polish, which is not uncommon for these challenges. For example, the beginning sentence of the fourth paragraph ("And yet..."), is not unambiguous in its meaning, as well as somewhat complex, which made me stumble over it. Since multiple editing passes are the only cure for something like that, it's an understandable imperfection :)

All in all, excellent work, keep writing if you have any more clever ideas, and have my upvote.
