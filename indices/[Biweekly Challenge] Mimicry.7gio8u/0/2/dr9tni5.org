(I wonder if the 'orders' are Mimics themselves (and for what use if so?), or objects with their own functions imitated by unchanging Mimics. --Ah, and one could compromise by having Mimics which constantly imitate, say, helmets, but (wouldn't be much use in a fight and) don't reveal themselves until their pre-set assassination target puts them on (since the floor shows that 'stickiness' is voluntary).

Given the 'poking', I found myself wondering why the last part was done piecemeal, rather than suddenly slamming shut the walls once they were in deep enough. (Mobility, in that the walls themselves were so coherent they could barely move? Still, the door seemed able to change rather fluidly, even if not move around by itself; lots and lots of spikes (or blunt-ended ramming pillars) all at once, say..? Or perhaps it could be a maturity matter, that the breeder-level cannot itself move, only remain stationary after formation like an ant or termite Queen served by many mobile workers/guards/drones/servants/children.)
