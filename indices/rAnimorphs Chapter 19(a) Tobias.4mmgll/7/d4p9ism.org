FYI Glocks don't have safeties that you can switch on or off, the safety is disengaged when you pull the trigger.

If you wanted to get the same effect you could say "a loaded Glock 19 with a round in the chamber"

I'm loving this by the way, just wish I'd found it after you finished so I didn't have to wait!
