Apparently this created huge issues for him though, and he sees it as a mistake.\\
IIRC, he talked about how as he approached "7pm" he'd end up rushing through the end of the chapter, with the aim of getting it up that day. Alternately, he'd end up finishing, then have to sit there and wait to post, sometimes for an hour, sometimes for a lot longer. I can't remember the exact issues he said this led to, but he attributes this method as one of the reasons that the writing of HPMOR slowed down.\\
The bottom line was that he ended up thinking that that inflexibility was a Bad Idea.
