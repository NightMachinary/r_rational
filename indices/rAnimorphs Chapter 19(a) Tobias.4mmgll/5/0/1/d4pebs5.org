Seems to me that Paul should have learned about the Chee from Tobias's mind, (although I guess that doesn't change too much at this stage).

I completely missed the part where Tobias got Rictic to accompany and help him, not sure if this is my fault or just the nature of reading incredibly information-dense writing spread over a long period of time.
