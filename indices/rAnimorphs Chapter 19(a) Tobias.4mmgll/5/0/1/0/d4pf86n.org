Paul definitely has access to knowledge about the Chee. But he had only a couple of minutes in Tobias-morph, so far---enough to verify that Tobias believed everything he'd been saying, but not enough to dig through his brain for /everything./ So he doesn't know about them as of the events of this chapter (much like how Rachel and V3 have access to some knowledge about one another that remains to be processed).
