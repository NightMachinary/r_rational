Yeah, canon Animorphs handled the power disparities between modern and space-faring militaries pretty realistically. On the other hand, the Animorphs's effectiveness was super buffed, with a Batman-like tendency to go through perimeters, security measures, guards and fortifications like they're not even there. It helps that the yeerks never seemed to use passwords, security booths, surveillance cameras, satellite tracking, or any form of security more complex than locked doors and "shoot at the good guys when you see them".
