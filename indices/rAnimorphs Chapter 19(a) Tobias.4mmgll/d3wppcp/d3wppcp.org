I don't think that Tobias's strategy up to this point was a good one. Jumping at every shadow and refusing to move until you have 100% confidence it's not going to backfire is a textbook case of over-optimization. This is the same trade-off the yeerks face: being cautious means you reduce the risk of making mistakes or leaving weaknesses for your enemy to exploit, but it also means giving your enemy more time to prepare and plan and exploit the few weaknesses you leave.

Spending weeks doing background checks and looking for spies is a waste of time; Tobias could have started with recruiting intelligence agents right away, with the fastest process that was still reasonably safe; something like: find identity of agent, morph them, read their mind, unlock the morph and simulate the conversation a first time, if it goes well, do the actual conversation, ask them for the identity of superiors and better placed agents, maybe give them the morphing power, rinse and repeat.

Anyway, really liked this update. I'm not sure how to describe it (other than "it's well written"), but you have this thing were things I would expect to work easily are hard and painful, and things I would expect to be hard and challenging work very smoothly, and it makes a lot of sense in retrospect.

That's kind of the opposite of the canon "Animorphs talk to army people" scenes. The canon authority figures are ridiculously overskeptical, and dismissive of the main characters, like that scene where Jake tries to talk to General Doubleday and gets thrown in a cell three or four times, and nobody bothers to monitor it to learn how he escapes, or wonder the point of putting away someone who proved he couldn't be contained, or think that a fly transforming into a teenager is super weird and important and maybe we should listen to what he wants to say. On the other hand, as soon as the adults learn Earth is being invaded, they immediately become complacent and ready to accept the authority and tactical acumen of a group of ragtag teenagers. "Oh, so you want me to send a platoon to their deaths to distract the mothership for, like, five minutes while you execute your commando mission that I haven't approved or even been briefed on? Sure, go ahead."

Anyway, I'm not used to authority figures as compelling characters, but you're doing a good job on that point. Jeremiah is both suitably open minded and willing to listen, and reasonably cautious. He makes good points too, about the "we don't know who's the bad guy" thing.
