What I did find compelling while reading though is that Tobias is not Marco. Marco would be able to know or work out the best strategy by trial and error, quick thinking and if necessary, improvisation. Tobias is more likely to know his own limitations and thus be overly cautious. It's good to see the canon characters powered-up (logicked-up?) but not /too/ OP.
