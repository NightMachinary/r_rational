"Oh, so you want me to send a platoon to their deaths to distract the mothership for, like, five minutes while you execute your commando mission that I haven't approved or even been briefed on? Sure, go ahead."

Actually, general doubleday was able to put together a full battalion for his diversionary attack. As far as fictional battles go, that one was pretty interesting. After the animorphs blew up the yeerk pool, they torched the entire city and landed the pool ship on its ashs. This fact made doubledays mission alot harder because even if he launched the attack from los padres forrest, his troops would have needed to cross at least 2 miles of open ground. Terrain that was completely devoid of cover, and crawling with thousands of yeerk soldiers. Never mind the not inconsequential fact that the pool ship itself was shooting at them!

Another interesting fact: The pool ship was so enormous that no human weapon could conceivably destroy it. If it had the same dimensions and density as the [[http://www.st-v-sw.net/STSWvolumetrics.html#mozTocId697772][borg sphere]] (that is to say, 600 meters in diameter, and built like tin foil), it would have a mass of 126 to 489 MILLION tons. Considering the inability of [[http://warships1discussionboards.yuku.com/topic/8838/Battleship-durability-vs-antiship-missiles#.V1X1ueTSR1E][anti-ship missiles]] like the harpoon or exocet to threaten even a 50,000 ton battleship, there is no possibility that they could damage something that is larger by 3 orders of magnitude, and probably built of far stronger materials than ordinary steel. (A valid assumption, considering the pool ship doesn't collapse in an earth gravity well)
