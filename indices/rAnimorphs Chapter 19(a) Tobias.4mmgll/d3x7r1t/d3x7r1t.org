I love your story, and I'm starting to think I'm getting a bit too invested. This is because I really wish I'd had either a bit more or a bit less information about when the update was coming (I'm bitter because I was so looking forward to the update that I spent half of yesterday refreshing ff.net, but eventually had to give up and go to sleep before the update). Not complaining- I realize that's my own problem and will be taking steps not to feel that way again, but I also wouldn't be surprised if others felt the same. Take it as a weird kind of achievement maybe? Your fans have graduated to "clamouring" status!
