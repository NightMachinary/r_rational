@[[/u/TheJamesRocket][u/TheJamesRocket]] has a pretty amazing analysis of the link between canon locations and real life, available [[http://kesler12-jamesrocket.blogspot.ca/2016/03/animorphs-scenery.html][here]]; I'm adopting this for r!Animorphs going forward, as demonstrated in this chapter.

It's only half! I fell prey to planning fallacy again. I'll post the second half (hopefully) within the week, and then combine them back into a single entry later (at which point I'll also post on ao3).

Because it's being posted in the middle of being written, it's particularly ripe for your critical feedback; if you've had negative things to say about the story thus far and have been holding back, well---I'm literally asking for it.
