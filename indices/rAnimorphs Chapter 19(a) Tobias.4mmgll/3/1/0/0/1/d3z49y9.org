I'm going to guess not by changing anything physical /inside/ the true bodies, but rather just overwhelming the signal between the true body and the yeerk tissue. Since it's not too energy-intensive to create radio waves, it's probably also not too Expensive to create the special Z-waves or whatever. The seeming teleportation would be practically free then.

I'm still having a hard time figuring out the rules, though, because the haggling etc that the animorphs did, along with Ellimist/Crayak needing Cassie to willingly sacrifice herself as her own idea, doesn't fit into what I'd expect if the rules were as simple as he says they are. I'm looking forward to clarification on that front.
