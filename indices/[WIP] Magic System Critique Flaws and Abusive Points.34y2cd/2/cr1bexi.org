#+begin_quote
  through the countryside of what was known as Mother Huraedon
#+end_quote

of /who/ was known as? (reads) No, it looks like the name of a country. That's confusing. I suggest you either say "the country of Mother Huraedon" or rename it something else.

#+begin_quote
  temperatures of exactly 1.538 million Celsius
#+end_quote

How many significant figures counts as exact?

According to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature][wikipedia]] this is about 1/10 the temperature of the core of the sun. It is more than enough to melt all rocks and minerals [[http://www.gly.uga.edu/railsback/Fundamentals/HardnessMeltingPlot06.pdf][plotted here]] by a few orders of magnitude. Unless the runes are made out of a material with an appallingly high melting temperature or the explosions happen under appallingly high pressure, this will melt the runes in question.

#+begin_quote
  runes can only be utilized if refined, and then broken after refinement
#+end_quote

Can a rune be broken more than once? Presumably no.

#+begin_quote
  this quick explosion is only logistically possible once a year
#+end_quote

World building inference: only governments can arrange it. This has many implications about availability to civilians and organized crime.

#+begin_quote
  nasty sunburns
#+end_quote

Suggests ultraviolet light in the explosion. Explained by black-body radiation of the runes. Later he says that there are no survivors because they are burned to a crisp. Unclear why the mages sent to do it cooperate and why sunburns are an issue to the ashes of a human body.

#+begin_quote
  left in the cavern to cool down
#+end_quote

This could be accelerated with water but since the latency is already a year on producing more, a few days are unlikely to make a difference.

#+begin_quote
  stones are carved into small pebbles
#+end_quote

Are these held in pockets?

#+begin_quote
  any Actions done from a rune is

is -> are

If the spell to refine runes is easy to learn and cast, suicidal mages could use it to blow things up. Is this spell something other than a Rune?

When the rune vaporizes, does it literally turn into gas or does it simply vanish? I wouldn't want to breathe one.

#+begin_quote
  all runes with the same inscription are vaporized
#+end_quote

Even ones you don't own?

#+begin_quote
  The laser used to write the seal is constructed in such a way that they are tailor made to a magi's voice.
#+end_quote

The seals are tailored to a particular magi's voice or the lasers are tailored to a particular magi's voice?

#+begin_quote
  catch an utilize
#+end_quote

an -> and

Be careful about "utilize". It means "to make useful" and can pretty much always be replaced with "use".

#+begin_quote
  rps (rotations per second)
#+end_quote

If you have to say what the acronym stands for, don't bother with the acronym.

How exactly did they measure the rotation speed of the elemental traces?

Munchkin: if you chain the syllables, you can make it so that as you are speaking you can decide how many of your runes you want to activate: "AB" activates two, "ABC" activates three, "ABCD" activates four, etc.

Can you inscribe more than one trigger phrase on the same rune? It might be convenient to have an "all fire spells" command or whatever.

Must all Actions be immediate?

#+begin_quote
  us Magi are able to do
#+end_quote

us -> we

--------------

Overall it's unclear what can and cannot be done with an Action, which is seemingly the most important part for finding flaws. Can mages spin a turbine, harvesting soul/extrauniversal energy into electricity, or directly create current? Depending on the tech level that could have significant impact.

How simple must the actions be? Is matter creation possible?

Must runes be associated with particular spells or are runes just a source of mana?

If runes can do particular spells then you might do something fancy with making a rune automatically reproduce a recording of your voice giving the command for another rune, and if you can make it do so under useful conditions you've got the beginnings of a computer or a Contingency spell.

Is remote action impossible? Must the gel directly touch anything it affects and pass through all space in between the mage and the target?

Can spells be blocked in any way?

Do detection spells exist? What can they detect?
