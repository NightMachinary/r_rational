So once again, thanks. The largest weakness of this system is that the runes (which are the only things that allow you to access this practically infinite power) are rare and will run out.

So you have the government controlled wizards never actually manufacturing or replacing the common craftsman. They are used to research and advance the mundane sciences so that when magic is impossible to do, humanity will then be sufficiently advanced enough that they won't need it.

Thanks for the well thought out responses. Weaknesses and possible conflicts (all that new energy in the world) will be kept in mind.
