Is there a range on rune voice activation? If global, is it instantaneous? Could be used as a fast and expensive method of communication.

By detection spells I meant: can a spell retrieve information for the caster in some way? Can you shoot a fireball around a corner, or some sort of heat-seeking missile?

Same question as before about defenses. If it's all the same (creating a wall to block a fireball) that's fine but magical defenses can get interesting.

Exponential cost curve will incentivize teams of wizards splitting the work into as many pieces as possible, as you said. That's interesting. Can a wizard only cast one spell at a time? Someone might try to split the work into two pieces ("lift left half of rock, lift right half of rock") in order to square root the resources required.

It seems like delayed-action spells aren't possible with the current configuration. Can a wizard make a spell that produces the sound of that wizard saying a particular word or phrase? That's an important component of metaspells.

Is there a time limit to saying the magic phrase? If my phrase is "ABCD" and I say "ABC" then wait for a long time and then say "D" will the rune break?

The syllable chaining can always work as long as there are two distinct one-syllable words in the language and the caster has a very good memory. It's possible with one but then you'd have to have much longer trigger phrases (O(n) instead of O(log n)).

Can you explode matter? Convert it to energy? Use the heat of a local object to further fuel a spell that's already being cast? Heal wounds? Violate entropy? Create safe food/water/tools? How about unskilled artists creating artwork the way they imagine it? Or making photographs of your memories. Mass production of tools, outpacing both craftsmen and even factories. It could lead to a post-scarcity society if there are enough resources.

Again, I think the most interesting part of the magic system isn't how it works, it's what you can (and, more importantly, can't) do with it. See [[http://brandonsanderson.com/sandersons-second-law/][Sanderson's Second Law]], and the others while you're at it.
