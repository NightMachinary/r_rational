Runic stones = unstable. Become inert unstable or explosive unstable? You said store them in vacuum chambers to keep them from touching any matter, I believe. So they're basically antimatter grenades? I see military applications. So would many people in your world, unless the energy released is low.

Define "will" and "intention". Specific mental states (i.e. patterns of activation of neurons across specific areas of the brain)? Language based, but telepathic? Loose and handwave-y?

If computers existed, could they give instructions to stones? Could sufficiently intelligent animals?
