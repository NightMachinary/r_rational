Oh, uh, wow, thanks for the response lol.

I actually fixed this (very) rough draft a bit. If you want to read another long (but shorter) paper I can link it.

All the world's historical context and bad sarcasm was removed. Some grammar mistakes were fixed (wrote the previous paper a bit quickly). As some parts are still a bit vague I'll pitch some ideas and see if you think they are worthy or not.

The high temperature is required to create the raw rune from the stone ore mined. The magi used are hardly willing and are convicts that have been forced into this situation (usually through some form of brainwashing).

The heat itself doesn't give sunburns, that was a bad joke. The stones are a bit on the ridiculous side of the required melting temperature. They are basically tiled across this cave, and with a very intense but small centre of heat in the middle of it all. The result is your refined rune. The side facing the heat is going to be very hot to the touch, but the other side is cool, and unmelted at all. What the magi want is the core, which is where you can get these semi-immaterial particles. The heat is needed to create this core due to properties of the original stone.

Runes, once broken, are impossible to use again. They disintegrate and cannot be recreated through magic. You must mine them again, but this means your key to infinite energy is finite.

The cavern with water is smart, don't know why I didn't think of that, thank you. Yes, this is all government run. And yes, the pre-blasted stones that are carved into small thumbnail pebbles are meant to be held in pouches. Also, suicidal mages are pretty rare, considering everything magic related is strictly controlled by the government, and only exists in the capital. Besides, it's easy enough to make a pipe bomb (I think) but most people won't do that anyways.

Only your voice specific rune vaporizes. And it is the seal that is tailored, gotta make that clear! The syllable thing would be fantastic, but I tried to curb that with only the full words of the Alkire language being able to be breakable seals.

Yes you can put the same word on as many runes as you want, and they are all used.

I think that answers most questions above the line. I'll post the link below, but what it doesn't answer: runes are just a source of mana, the 'gel' is synced with its magus creator, and so must be in a certain range (determined to be 70 centimetres) in order for the magus to use the energy to empower his will.

Spells are like miracles. Their creation is amazing and out of this world, but when put into this world they follow the norms. When fire is about to jump onto you from a building you take cover under heat resistant objects. For lightning you try not to get struck :P etc. etc.

Not sure what you mean by detection spells.

One of the largest problems in the original was that it was energy that spun the turbines, not particles, there was no need for spinning as it was just a process of energy has made the exact same type of energy! Kind of useless, so I changed the soul/planur stuff into actual particles with names (but not named yet since I haven't thought of them).

By the way, thank you very much for taking your time to do this!
