Luna=Deadpool confirmed.

That said, if we think this situation was caused by time travel somehow, Luna being totally normal might indicate that she's one of the time travellers. We already know large-distance time travel is possible because Horry has met a far older version of himself, so I'm thinking Luna somehow got pulled along for the ride.

That said, I've just had an insane tinfoil moment. What if this universe is the result of HJPEV successfully casting /Becomus Goddus/ and then immediately screwing everything up? Say he accidentally bumped the machine operating magic, rewriting something small but significant, and in his haste to stabilize the universe before it was too late, snapped his fingers and created The Library.

This would stabilize time for him, but leave a messy universe where everything ran on Fate. Obviously, Harry /hates/ fate, so he wants to fix it, but he didn't get to see enough of the magic machine before he changed it to know what he changed and how to change it back. His safest route is to sort of...nudge everything back into alignment over the course of numerous overlapping time loops, each person steadily becoming more like they should be over time. We're just in one of the universes after Magick has a stable set of rules, but before those rules have returned to normal.

Or maybe this is the end state. These rules do seem like they would appeal to HJPEV.
