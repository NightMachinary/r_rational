I think there are two parallel goals:

1. Write a story in a world that vaguely resembles J.K. Rowling's wizarding world, but with an internally consistent magickal system /and/ in which realistic (and by this I mean realistically rational and irrational) people have lived in.

2. Write an existential mystery where /something/ is wrong with the world as presented and we, along with the protagonist, will have to figure out what that /something/ is.

I'm not convinced yet that Horry will actually ever learn what's up with his reality; there's still a good chance only us (and Luna) will ever recognize this world as not!Rowlingverse.
