Me too, but I'm loving it. It's like... It manages to be fun and entertaining as popcorn reading, while still having a ton of meat on the bone. I've chosen to read it pretty passively, but I feel like I could dive in and pick at it and it would hold up well. Maybe it wouldn't, but from my perspective it's all the same anyway, and it's a rollicking great laugh besides.
