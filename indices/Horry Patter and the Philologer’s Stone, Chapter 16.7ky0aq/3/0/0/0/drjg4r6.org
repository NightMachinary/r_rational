is the cover image of the story meant to represent a point of divergence? because i cant see at what point they could have possibly diverged. magic seems to /work differently/ in the Horry Patter universe than in canon. And yet even though they would have diverged so long ago, both branches seem to have remarkable similarities.

Maybe the reason has something to do with information travelling backwards in time as well as forwards. Actually Im not sure where that thought came from. Not sure what I was thinking.

Or wait, maybe someone figured out the secrets of time and divination, and used that to transmit any info they wanted from future to past. But the information that gets sent back is a bit garbled, so the prophecies fulfill themselves in different ways? So Horry's parents name Horry instead of Harry because they misunderstand the message sent back from the future about his name. And messages about magical discoveries get sent back in time as well, so Hogwarts ends up being much more magically advanced than it was at the time in canon.

And maybe overtime their understanding and control over time and divination advanced to the point where they could get their messages sent back through time much clearer and much less garbled.

And then when people were abusing these prophecies too much they started locking them away, making them unreadable until they actually happened.

It seems like a really big coincidence that Luna would be transported from canon to this particular everett branch.

Also, the first name Horry is an italian first name which means "timekeeper". This is certainly not a coincidence.
