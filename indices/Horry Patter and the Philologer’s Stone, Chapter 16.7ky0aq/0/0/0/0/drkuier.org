I didn't actually notice that. Good spot.

I wonder if Luna is in the same sort of position here that Hermione was in HPMOR. If I recall correctly Elizer said for that story everyone got an intelligence boost except Hermione, who didn't need one.

Here everything got a weirdness boost, except Luna so she's now on the same level as the rest of the universe. Though I'd need to see a bit more of Luna's character to be sure.
