  They'd had their own watch as well, once upon a time, though Catherine had disbanded it after her coronation with a look in her eyes that was all savage glee. Sometimes Vivienne forgot the Queen of Callow had been a nobody orphan but a few years ago, and one used to being stepped on by foreign and homebred lords alike. She had not forgotten a single slight from those days, the Black Queen. As was their people's way.

I wonder if this will enter into the public consciousness, once all of this is done. The thought that the urchin you spurn today might be your liegelord tomorrow could become a morality tale for Callow. A myth told to to young lords and peasants alike, to keep the peace and foster some sense of national unity.

Hell, if I were Catherine, I would be trying to implant that myth right now. Legends are some of the strongest institutions, after all, and everything she does is to create an institution which will outlast her.
