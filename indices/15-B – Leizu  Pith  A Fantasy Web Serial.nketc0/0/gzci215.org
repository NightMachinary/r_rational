This looks like it could be the start of Leizu being a major viewpoint character. The story's had chapters from different perspectives before, but those are usually at the end of an arc and tend to be a bit more removed from the main action than this. I could be wrong, but I hope not. I like Leizu and what her perspective adds to the narrative.

Shame about the hiatus though. Hopefully the author recovers soon and we can get more of this great story!
