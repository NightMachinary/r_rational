A bit of a shame that we didn't get any clue as to what kind of eldritch horrors Cao Hui managed to grave-rob/extract from containment before the hiatus.

But health does takes precedence.

The Yokusei Pact sounds like something that should have been broken long ago. It's a classic tragedy of the commons setup plus allegedly some future stability issues for the transgressor. I don't really buy those; and anyway, non-immediate consequences seldom stop human governments, when there is power and money to be gained.

It definitely should have been broken by someone while Shenten was a failed state, if not long before.
