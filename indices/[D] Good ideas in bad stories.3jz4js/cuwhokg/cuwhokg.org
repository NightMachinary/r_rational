As someone who started reading C.E.D when it was just starting out (~10 chapters) I would like to say that it is perhaps the greatest example of a story that starts off with tons of hidden potential, only to be completely and utterly *fucked up* by the author. C.E.D was comprehensive, funny, enjoyable and rewarding. Then we shifted into an amount of bashing that honestly made us more annoyed at the author than the characters, unrealistic harem nonsense and the pleasant image of Sasuke Uchiha being forced to shit himself because our main cast found it hilarious to do to him, despite the fact that he'd done nothing to really deserve it, other than being a cold asshole. I was so disappointed by the turn the story took and it will forever be my Hero. As in Hero from Worm. Such great potential brutally torn away before we could see it come to fruition.

Sorry. But C.E.D weighs on my mind to this day, and it's been a grievance I've had for years. Shameless ranting aside, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4611673/1/Naruto-s-Compensation][Naruto's Compensation]] does a decent job at being rational. Not an AMAZING job, mind you, but it's worth a perusal at least. Naruto's approach to being a shinobi is unique and it's an approach I could see many [[/r/rational][r/rational]] subbers taking, assuming we could get it to function the way he did.

The Doc Future series has a lot of great ideas, particular around the implications of a speedster with no magical force to keep them from breaking the world around them, but the polyamory it sort of shoves down both you and the Doc's throat is a bit of a turnoff. At least to me.

That's kinda all I can think of right now. Sorry I didn't have any real schizophrenic ideas. Hope these help :)
