Lawrence Watt-Evans' world-building is strong-to-incredible, but his narratives are often a little too mundanely realistic. They tend to read like awesome DnD/Pathfinder campaigns with ~rational characters.

Of particular note, /The Annals of the Chosen/ is set in a world where inanimate objects and locations have non-sapient spirits that must be appeased, negotiated with, and trained, with dangerous untamed spirits rampant outside the bounds of settlements. The plot revolves around the Wizard Lord, near-omnipotent ruler, and the Chosen, 7 individuals given supernatural mastery over traits like swordsmanship, thievery, beauty, etc, and tasked with taking down the Wizard Lord should he turn evil. The first book in the series is good; the other two are fine.
