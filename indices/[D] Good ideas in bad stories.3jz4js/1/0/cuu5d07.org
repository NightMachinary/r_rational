John C. Wright is a very interesting person. At the time he wrote The Golden Oecumene trilogy, he was an atheistic, libertarian transhumanist with a fanatical Randian streak.

Several years later, however, he survived a car crash which left him with a radically altered philosophical outlook. He transformed overnight from a fanatical libertarian into an equally fanatical fundamentalist Christian.

The author who once wrote about radically transhumanist utopias now frequently writes shockingly intolerant and homophobic polemics. For example, take a look at [[https://www.goodreads.com/author_blog_posts/8225391-perverting-the-story-to-kiddie-propaganda][his response]] to a Legend of Korra writer revealing that a character was gay. It reads exactly like something out of Westboro Baptist, and honestly makes me wonder if that car crash involved head trauma.

In any case, I liked The Golden Oecumene when I first read it. I felt that the Randian themes made sense in a post-scarcity economy where they wouldn't in modern society. However, when I look back at the series with what I now know about the author, a lot of its ideas and themes seem less innocent than they did on first reading.
