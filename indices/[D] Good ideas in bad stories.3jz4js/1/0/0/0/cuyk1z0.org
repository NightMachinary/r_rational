That's actually related to my conspiracy theory as to why U.S. politics is so divisive these days. If you look at when many of the most extreme politicians were born it's right around when leaded gasoline was at its peak. Maybe they, for whatever reason, had enough self control not to become criminals but they lost the amount necessary to compromise or consider other viewpoints.

It's probably nonsense but I found it interesting to think about.
