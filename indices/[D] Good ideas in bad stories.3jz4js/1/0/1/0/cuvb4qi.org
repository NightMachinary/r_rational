From the same author and with similar problems you have Orphans of Chaos, a trilogy of sci-fantasy novels that makes for a really good read when you know nothing about the author, but then you start questioning if some of the traits and preferences of the protagonist, contrived as part of the plot, arent informed by some sort of mysoginistic ideology.

I still recommend the books even if their author can make reading them uncomfortable. They're essentially about 5 kids with contradictory but ambiguously correct worldviews exploiting them and the abilities conferred to them by their strange birthright to change their situation.

I personally believe wildbow might've read it and used it as inspiration for the lambs of Twig. They have a very similar dynamic.
