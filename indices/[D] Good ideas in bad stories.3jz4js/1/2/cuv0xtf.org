Haven't read that, but /Awake in the Night Land/, short stories set in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_Land][The Night Land]] is one of the most amazing things I've read in years. Lovecraftian Horror with Victorian Writing.

And, to be clear, Awake in the Night Lands was written by Wright in his fundamentalist streak, but if the author interjected his beliefs into it, it works with the settings. It is, after all, an homage to a series of stories written a century ago. Wright manages to make a bleak, nihilistic worlds where humanity is losing (and destined to lose, and die horrible deaths) and turns it into a romance.

It is chaste, horrifying, and beautiful.
