That's scary as fuck. Imagine if you hit your head and became some kind of extremist bigot, all your carefully reasoned thoughts and beliefs corrupted into something unrecognizable, abhorrent, and completely out of your control. That's horror story material right there.

It reminds me of when I read about the [[http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2013/01/lead-crime-link-gasoline][correlation between the outlawing of lead in gas and the sustained reduction in crime over the last 30 years.]] How much of what we choose is actually the result of completely unknown factors nudging or even pushing us in any given direction?
