I'd agree with the review. The books progressively go down hill as the clever world takes back seat to preaching. I'd say it's similar to the Unincorporated Man that OP mentioned in that after a while it stops being about the future and starts being about the author's particular hobbyhorse.

And to clarify about the Atlas Shrugged comment, I actually enjoy Rand even if I disagree with her. It was just disappointing to see this story stop focusing on the areas in which it excelled.
