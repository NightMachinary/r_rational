I was curious about this as well, and read some reviews on Goodreads:

#+begin_quote
  At the beginning of the trilogy, the story's pretensions toward philosophical complexity could be ignored in light of its luxurious imagery and bewitching, kaleidoscopic narrative structure. These redeeming aspects fade to the background, however, and are soon replaced by a simple philosophical debate. And I do not mean that figuratively: by the third novel, the whole substance of the story has taken the form of an endless discussion between the characters on questions of abstract philosophy.
