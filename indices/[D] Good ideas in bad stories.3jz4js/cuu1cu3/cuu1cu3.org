[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Golden_Oecumene][The Golden Oecumene]] trilogy by John C. Wright has a really impressive scifi setting. Humanity has branched a lot and actually seems alien without being unrecognizable. It also has some rather interesting memory issues and logic puzzles, as well as some interesting discussion of AI. Unfortunately, part of the way through it turns into Atlas Shrugged in space. Still, if you can stomach that its a pretty well constructed world.
