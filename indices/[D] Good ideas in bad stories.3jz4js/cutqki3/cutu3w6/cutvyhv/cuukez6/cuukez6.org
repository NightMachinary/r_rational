I didn't notice it during the series, but it's definitely true. There seems to be two components to the magic - the language, which establishes limits around what the magic will do, and the intent, which pushes the magic to do as desired within the limits of the language. You can do spells in two broad categories, as well - either you use very little language and shape the spell with intent, or you use next to no intent and shape the spell with language. The result of this is that it's technically possible to do spells without using a word of the Ancient Language, or recite spells without understanding half the words. We see both in the series - Eragon learns several complicated healing spells far above his Ancient Language reading level by rote, and occasionally rewrites reality by will and power alone. The most common spells use a short phrase to define broad limits to the magic, then rely on intent to take it the rest of the way.
