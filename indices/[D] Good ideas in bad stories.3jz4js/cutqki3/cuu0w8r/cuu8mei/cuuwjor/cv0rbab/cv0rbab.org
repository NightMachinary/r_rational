Bit of a necro, but this subreddit moves slow:

In the /Belgariad/ (and sequel series the /Mallorean/), the magic system is called "The will and the word"- magic requires you to draw up your will to power the change, imagine exactly what you want to happen, and then say a release word. The word itself doesn't really matter. There's a tenuous connection between the amount of effort the task would normally take and how much willpower it takes to pull off the spell, as well as what is actually happening and yourself- if you try to lift a rock, you get pushed down in a sort of "equal and opposite reaction" thing; it's elided over quite often, since to avoid it you just make sure to push down as well with the magic to cancel it out. You do have to actually know what exactly you want to happen, because the magic isn't going to interpret it for you; if you want a nuke to go off you better understand the physics behind it (the setting is quasi-medieval, so no nukes). The only solid restriction is that you can't "unmake" something- trying to destroy something offends the universe (literally, it's the mother of the gods and has opinions about anti-creation) so you get destroyed instead.

All magic users are semi-immortal direct disciples of the gods (now mostly gone) with some exceptions for priests of one of the gods - though at one point the main characters find a magic user who isn't a disciple and theorize that sometimes people get magic on their own, don't know that destruction is forbidden, and off themselves in short order.

/Eragon/ was possibly inspired by the series, but really Eddings' stuff isn't very original so it wouldn't be a direct source anyway. (Eddings was specifically trying to create a formulaic fantasy adventure series with more humor and light entertainment; he wasn't trying to be original and deep.)
