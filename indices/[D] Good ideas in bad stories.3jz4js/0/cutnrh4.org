Leo Frankowski immediately comes to mind when you talk about interesting ideas in really, really, really poorly executed stories. His most obvious major failing that makes him pretty unrecommendable are the extreme misogyny and resulting plot elements from the extreme misogyny - it's extremely blatant and not pretty.

His longest running series, the Conrad Stargard books, have some interesting technical details and so forth in a typical 'time travel to the past, start reestablishing technology'. The technical bits are well executed and it's generally good Connecticut Yankee type of story for a lot of the book - but it has sufficient bad bits that I can't really recommend it. Also, the protagonist benefits way too hard from luck at certain junctures - especially what he had with him when he went back, for example. However, I particularly like that he time-travelled to a time period where historically a major invasion was about to destroy most of the country he was travelling to, giving the character some concrete goals to work towards ('Stop the Mongol Invasion in 10 years'). The technical bits are well done and interesting. The book series gets progressively worse, though, and eventually is unreadable (under no circumstances should anyone try to read Lord Conrad's Quest For Rubber, it is just unrelentingly awful throughout). Conrad's Time Machine is notable as a prequel novel about constant time-travel abuse, which gets more and more stupid and misogynistic as it goes, but also has some interesting time travel exploiting stuff in the way of Bill and Ted's Big Adventure-style exploits, where people control their own access to information to allow them to go set up time loops later on consistent with their own understanding and so forth. Copernick's Rebellion is a standalone book about biotech taking over and revolutionizing the world, transhumanists extending immortality to others and increasing their own cognitive abilities, and prominently an extremely powerful artificially created biological intelligence becoming divorced from human goals and allowing many humans to get killed a lot because those human deaths were orthagonal to it's own goals of it's survival. Copernick's Rebellion has so many cool plot elements stuffed into it's ~200 pages that the rampant misogyny etc nearly doesn't ruin it all!

Goddamn thinking about Frankowski's stuff makes me feel sad now. So much potential, wasted.

In terms of better counterparts: If you want less misogyny and so forth in your 'guy takes present day knowledge and uses it to take over a society and implement technology', then David Drake and David Weber and Eric Flint and SM Stirling have done that plot to death much less objectionably (The Safehold series and Heirs of Empire [Empire from the Ashes #3] for Weber, the Belisarius and the General books by Drake, 1632 by Flint and Island In The Sea of Time books by Stirling). In terms of timetravel-exploit books, there have been innumerable well done timetravel books but the aforementioned Bill and Ted Big Adventure finale is probably my favorite in terms of raw exploits. Copernick's Rebellion has a heady mix of a bunch of different ideas that I don't think has an exact analogue anywhere, but every single idea has been done at least a few times in less objectionable books.
