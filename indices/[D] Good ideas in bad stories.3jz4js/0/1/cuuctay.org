Stirling's Emberverse books are pretty good as well. The basic premise is that suddenly gas compression beyond a certain point as well as electricity over a certain threshold just stop working. While those rules are not entirely clear, they are upheld throughout the series and none of the characters are too stupid. Since most modern technology stops working, food is scarce, so the first novel (Dies the Fire) is mainly about different groups organizing to fight off bandits, adapt to the suddenly-medieval world and cultivate food. If the idea of pikemen riding to battle on bycicles sounds appealing to you, you should definitely check it out!
