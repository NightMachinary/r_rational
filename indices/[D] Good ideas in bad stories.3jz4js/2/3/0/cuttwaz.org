For a second I thought that your sentence implied people lie is actually getting updated, but then I saw it wasnt :(

I will say about the romance that it was interesting seeing two really badass MCs in a relationship without too much cheap stuff. Also while I think they explanation for the polyamoury was not perfect it wasnt too bad when you take the setting into account.

But yeah, the fact that the story is about sakura being badass definitly made it possible to get away with way more OP Naruto than would be possible otherwise. Allthewhile keeping the powerbalance interesting. So the action was a huge plus
