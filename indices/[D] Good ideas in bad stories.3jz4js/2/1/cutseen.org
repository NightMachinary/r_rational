My own enjoyment of it came mostly from how thoroughly the concept of "souls" were explored (and exploited)---turning them into something that felt more like ems participating in a consensual-reality simulation, with the ability to split, fuse, etc. and having to work out rules about how to keep various experience-lines of oneself from corrupting the whole. This is also in large part what I enjoyed about Alicorn's /Effulgence/, and a part of what entertains me about /Dungeon Keeper Ami/: as a distributed systems programmer, I just really enjoy reading about the practicalities of (what are effectively) the distributed-systems problems of AI.
