I don't see the simularities from a reader, but in world each spell requires "will" intent, and "word" which is a statement. The spell is crafted by your will mostly, then funneled through the word(s) you see more single word spells than in eragon. It does feel a bit like eragon if you remove the mysticism surrounding the ancient langauge that the first books has, then require a nebulous "ability" to do magic, casters are far more rare in this series.
