I think that the current chapter lengths are fine at the moment, since the current story seems very much build up over action. But once the story gets going I'd be more interested in longer chapters, even at a slower update rate. I've found with other stories that if updates are too short during climactic parts it feels like those are being dragged out, as there's little progression in each update
