Exactly. As a creator of other media (I do both board game design and software development) I'd highly recommend ensuring that you identify your target audience if considering any major changes to your structure.

If your eventual goal is for this to be read in a single sitting as a published work, then the only real concern that you might want to consider would be the release schedule, rather than the content organization itself.

If, on the other hand, it's more the process of writing and interacting with people as you tell the story, then some parts of the organization of the story itself might help with that.
