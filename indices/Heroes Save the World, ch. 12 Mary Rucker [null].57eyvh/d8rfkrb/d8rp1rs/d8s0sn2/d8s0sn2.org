I don't think that it's inherent to writing as a serial. There's a sort of "penny dreadful" format that I read a lot of (and wrote in) with 1,000 word chapters, which made for faster updates, but I haven't been intentionally going for that style in HSTW and there are plenty of serials with long chapters (there are some that I'm reading right now that have 6-7k word updates).

I'm not sure if it's because I'm becoming more comfortable with the story and finding a rhythm with it, or just a consequence of the story beginning to pick up speed, or some other third thing, but the next few chapters are between 1,300 and 1,500 words and I expect that to gradually increase (for comparison, most of these chapters have been around 1,000 words).

I'm also working on sensory detail. I'm one of those people who can barely form mental images, but adding more sensory detail would also flesh out my chapters without giving them unnecessary padding.

(My poor mental imaging makes it really weird for me whenever I hit it out of the ballpark with a particular description. It's like being a Chinese Room of storytelling, because apparently it was really good and all but I have barely any idea how it's working unless I was literally looking at a picture reference while I was writing).
