The main feedback that I think I have right now is somewhat related to pacing - chapters currently feel very short, in a way that may preclude building up much momentum.

I don't know if that's a restriction of reading it as a serial; it might be less of an issue with all of the chapters available immediately, especially if presented not as separate chapters, but as a single chapter with multiple cuts between characters.
