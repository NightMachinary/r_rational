Oh, I see! In that respect it probably would compare more favorably when being read in a single sitting, like you say; I haven't paid attention to MoL but I imagine that "total words per month" for HSTW would be comparable to or greater than the same for r!Animorphs and Origin of Species, which have longer chapters and shorter update times.

(That'll might be something else to consider in the future--less frequent updates but longer chapters)

Thanks for the estimates on reading time.
