Ah, I didn't mean in writing, actually - I more meant that consuming in serial format might predispose me to liking the shorter format less than if I was consuming it long form.

As a single data point, most stories that I read from here in serial format (Mother of Learning, Animorphs: the Reckoning, Pok√©mon Origin of Species, and Unsong, to name a few) generally seem to take me between 10-30 minutes per new chapter to read. Most of your chapters thus far have been closer to 5-10 minutes per new chapter to read.
