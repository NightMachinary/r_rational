Next week we have an interlude chapter, and then...I have a month's worth of buffer, but we might be skipping Friday so that I can see how traffic is affected by some other things that I'm doing (like fleshing out the TV Tropes page). I might just be missing something, but Wordpress doesn't look to be quite as good for figuring out traffic as Blogspot is.

As always, let me know what's working for you and what isn't. Because I'm doing a few things with this story that I haven't done before, reader criticism can potentially have a lot of influence over the way that this story is structured.

(Especially pacing. I ultimately chose to not have *too* much of a buffer for the reason that, if the story seems to be progressing too slowly or the pacing is off for some other reason, fixing that is more viable than if I had two or three months' of chapters already written out).

*Synopsis*

Across the world, one hundred adolescents unexpectedly find themselves in possession of superpowers, running the gamut from conventional to world-breaking to annoyingly limited. But despite the diversity of powers, certain patterns emerge, and as the Children begin to find each other, they realize that the world itself may be in great peril.

Heroes save the world, but will they succeed in being heroes?
