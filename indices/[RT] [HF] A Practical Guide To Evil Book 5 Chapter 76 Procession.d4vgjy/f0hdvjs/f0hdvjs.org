Something I appreciate this, is how Procer is treated like a first-world country.

To them Salians, Villains are just stories, something your nanny tells you as she puts you to bed, or some waylaid disaster to your cousin's neighbour's hometown.\\
But for Callowans, Villains were a part of their lives. Fighting them was something that their country lived for, an implicitly important part of their identity.

I don't think the Accords would really resonate or be understood by anyone in the Highest Assembly apart from Cordelia. They may be facing the Dead King now, but they've never truly suffered for it.
