Neither do I, though i remember reading it and feeling like that was a decent explanation. Riddle definitely takes big risks when smaller would do- why break into azkaban to rescue belatrix when you can plausibly tell harry the secrets yourself, keeping the source secret? Belatrix may be useful, but not worth the risk unless i highly underestimate her value. Why give harry the potential blackmail material, and the leverage?

Yes, having equal blackmail for harry is nice, but not only is it asymetrical- you're the teacher that tricked harry into stealing someone from azkaban, and harry, for all his competence, was an innocent 11 yr old- it's not going to be beneficial for their relationship if that's needed, and voldemort likes his alter ego.

In retrospect, it does feel like voldemort's problem solving methods are reckless, and heedless of consequences- he kills skeeter on a whim, and while it might have paid off, the azkaban breakout revealed far more of his capabilities to harry than anything else.
