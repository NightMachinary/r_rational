Personally, I thought the signs were always there- Riddle tries to be sane, but is neurotic and misses obvious stuff at times. He's mostly sane, but little bits have been lost to rituals, not to mention the bhals supification on the mirror, so he's simultaniously more and less rational than an average irrationalist.
