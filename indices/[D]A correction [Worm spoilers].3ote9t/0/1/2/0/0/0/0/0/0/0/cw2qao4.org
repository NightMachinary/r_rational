And yet it was a plan that involved holding the person prohecied to destroy all but a remnant of him beside him while in the middle of an already dangerous mission, and i'm sure there are more effective methods of achieving it. He may not have been able to predict the patronus incident, but he should have been able to predict the risk level, and it's not something i'd gamble with unless i'm fine with returning to my horcruxes, which i would only be if i had more backups that someone would pick up.

instead, I'd take harry legitimately, at least at first, if i could.

He simply didn't know harry all that well, and then he rushed on top of that. he's reckless, even if he wasn't incredibly careless that time.
