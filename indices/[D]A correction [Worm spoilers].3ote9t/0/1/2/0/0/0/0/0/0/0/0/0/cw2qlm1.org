You're right, I'm mistaken. I forgot that he had already fixed it.

He does feel reckless, still. dementor's effects aren't definite, but stealing souls sounds like a horcrux-bypassing death, at least potentially, and there's few levels of reward worth that. He doesn't have anti-oblivate measures, either. If that's the case, though, his death just means he has to start his relationship with harry from scratch. I think he does take bigger risks, but i forgot that he's all but invincible.

Maybe that's why? he felt leaving him with the wand was safer than someone taking it, and either way, death was no great loss- he'd be back shortly.
