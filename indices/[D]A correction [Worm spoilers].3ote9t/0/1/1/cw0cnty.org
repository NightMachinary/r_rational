Ehhhhh....

I really liked worm. And I also sorta disliked the timeskip. Your mileage may vary.

Since you are enjoying worm, I'd really like to link you to a wallpaper I made for it, but its super spoilery. Ping me when you've finished it and I'll link you!

Edit: Link to spoilery wallpaper incoming. ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/2gzqwf/spoilers_dual_monitor_wallpaper_taylor/][Link]]) You have been warned.
