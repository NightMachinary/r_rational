: ) Glad you like it.

It's dual-screen because that's my desktop setup. My top screen is physically bigger, and the desktop there is visible about half the time so it made sense to make it nice and flashy. It has served to get a friend or two interested in the story. The bottom screen is obscured 99% of the time, and has the biggest spoiler. But it has the strongest impact for me personally. I know some people didn't like how the story ended, but I felt it ended the only way it could and still be moderately satisfying.
