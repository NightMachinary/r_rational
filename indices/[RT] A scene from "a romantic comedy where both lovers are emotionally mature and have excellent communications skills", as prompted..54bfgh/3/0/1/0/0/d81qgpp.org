Yes, but not /this/ part of what you want...That's the point of the story right? The Grim Empress can't get what she wants merely by enslaving the hero.

I guess what I'm saying is that some people try to force <romance, love, monogamy, marriage, procreation> by means such as yelling and nagging, and a lot of why we think we can do that is because our Lightsider culture is descended from a Grim predecessor culture where forcing people to do <above things> by capturing and enslaving them as property was a norm. But it didn't work out any better for our ancestors - all they got were distorted and ugly mockeries of the love/affection they were hoping for.

Emotional maturity, at least in part, slides along the Grim <-> Lightsider axis, such that the Grim /culture/ is emotionally stunted. Recognizing that while you can <nag / yell / pressure / chain / enslave / lock in a tower / economically incentivize / threaten to leave unless they obey> someone to go through the motions of a wedding ritual, sex, exclusivity, and so on, you won't actually get their love and loyalty. (On the lightsider extreme, you get radical commitments to non-coercion, as seen in the polyamorous community and so on. This is extreme emotional maturity.)

That's what the classic rom com centers around. ~Hilarious misunderstandings~ arise because the two parties are essentially playing a zero sum game and trying to coerce each other / withhold information / assuming the other is trying to harm them. The fun part in this story is that we instead just /acknowledge/ one party is trying to coerce the other and run with it.
