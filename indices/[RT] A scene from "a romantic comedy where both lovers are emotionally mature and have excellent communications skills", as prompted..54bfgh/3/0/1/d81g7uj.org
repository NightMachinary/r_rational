I meant the "chaining him up and raping him" part, not the "flustered" part!

90% of "emotional maturity" in interpersonal relationships is recognizing that you can't force people into what you want. So the comedy here still derive from emotional immaturity. It's just that the emotional immaturity is so over the top that we don't even recognize it as "emotional immaturity' anymore.
