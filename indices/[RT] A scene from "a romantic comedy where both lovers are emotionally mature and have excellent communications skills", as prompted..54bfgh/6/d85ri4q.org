No offense to you, but the opening description was kinda... Garbage? It just read very poorly to my eyes. The dialogue was fine but it definitely couldve been much better. I'm also not really sure that the Empress as written is emotionally mature /or/ has good communication skills, let alone both, so I don't really think this fulfils the prompt either. All in all, not a huge fan.
