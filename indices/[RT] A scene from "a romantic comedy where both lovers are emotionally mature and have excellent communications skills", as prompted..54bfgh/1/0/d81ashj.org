It does read like Practical Guide to Evil fanfic, yes. The worldbuilding is totally consistent (especially that bit about being allowed to bend the Empire to your whim). Replace Grimm Majesty with Dread Empress, Lightsiders with Heros/Good aligned, Yoruun with Callow (and then the Unconquered Territory with Procer?) (....and then Malicia with a Empress more interested in men). Possibly no Roles, though, Grim Empress could easily be a mere title.
