Can't speak for Detsuahxe, but I also generally never upvote posts. It's mostly habit for me (I'm used to platforms that don't have a voting system, or else lurking without an account on those that do), but it also seems like an issue of fairness. I doubt I would remember to upvote half the things that deserve it, so upvoting some randomly-selected subset of them seems like an arbitrary way of making very little difference.

I do upvote comments, though. I see it as a better alternative to choking a discussion thread with comments like "Me too," or "I appreciate the pun you made there." If I feel the urge to leave such a comment, I upvote instead.
