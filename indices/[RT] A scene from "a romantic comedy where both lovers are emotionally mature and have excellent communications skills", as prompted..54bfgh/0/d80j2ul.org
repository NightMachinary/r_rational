Very nice scene and I want to read an entire novel (or watch a movie) around this!

Off topic question to everyone reading this:

How many of you upvoted this because you first saw it was a post by Eliezer before you actually read anything here?

I'm curious if people are more likely to upvote or comment on something when they see a familiar/famous name is associated with it.
