Could be a language thing.

"Thief of Stars" might be a single word in the language the story comes from. And "Ranger" might translate to "Wandering Huntress" in some language(s) on Creation.

But, it's probably more that since there can be only one instance of any name at a time, and many names have overlapping concepts you get cases where the more general name is unavailable, or the individual fits a more specific name too precisely to be any otehr variation. I doubt there's a strong correlation between power, or even versatility of the Name itself, but there probably is a variance in how similar different holders of the same name are with the less specific names having more variance between individuals.
