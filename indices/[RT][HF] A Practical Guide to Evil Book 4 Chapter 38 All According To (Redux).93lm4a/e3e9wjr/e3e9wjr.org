I've been wondering, does it matter that Thief and Archer have such simple Names? I understand that it's probably just a relic of when they were introduced into the story, but nearly every other Name since the start of Part 3 is at least /Adjective Noun/ or /Noun of Noun/ in construction. Like /Thief of Stars/ in this chapter, for example. Meanwhile, Vivienne is just "Thief" and Indrani is just "Archer".
