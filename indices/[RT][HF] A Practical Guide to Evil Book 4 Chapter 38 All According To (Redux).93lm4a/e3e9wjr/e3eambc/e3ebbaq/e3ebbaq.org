I think the exact opposite: that the one-word Names are less specific, and so can draw on all related stories, while the Names with epithets have a story attached that narrows their scope. In [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2015/07/08/chapter-15-company/][chapter 15 of book one]] Black mentions Champion derivatives in early Praes, and Akua thinks about the common traits of the Bard family tree in [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2016/04/27/villainous-interlude-coup-de-theatre/][interlude Coup de Th√©atre]] (even if she's wrong about the "tree" part). That seems to point that the core nown in the Name is a rough description of the Role, and the epithets get added if there's need to remove possible overlap with, say, other potential Champions around.

I wonder whether or not Names can be called the same words but in different languages, or in cultures isolated from each other.
