Thief of Stars is a title, not a Name. I took Catherine's first card to imply that her Name is Spellblade. That Vivienne and Indrani aren't legendary yet is their own fault for underplaying their influence. Even Masego is /just/ "Heirophant". They're all young yet.

Give them as many years as the Grey Pilgrim has and nobody will know which of their storied titles was original.
