I find it somewhat puzzling that he can Recall heroes whose souls are still bound on Creation. Dead King's whole deal with becoming a lich rests on an implication that a soul is this immaterial "object" that keeps the body moving, without any functional difference between natural connection and a binding. This, though, implies there's a fundamental divide.

Is that why the undead are less capable of learning? Is the afterlife just a point behind "now" on a temporal axis of a graph depicting a trajectory of a being, making the soul not able to evolve because the only way to progress is to be in Creation, in the "now"? In that case the necromancy is binding a corpse by magical puppet strigs to the past, and any development goes only as fa as the spell itself develops.

I'm coming up with all this four-dimensional bullshit because Pilgrim mentioned that any memories of the afterlife are sealed, which is strange given that classic mythology has its Heracles and Orpheus, but in the Guideverse anything regarding the afterlife is a matter of faith. My hypothesis is that the reason for it is that the afterlife doesn't exacly /happen/ here: from a dead person's perspective, their time ends with their death. The dead people are more or less fossils of their lifetimes beneath the surface of the Creation (or, at the very least, fossils with a Choice).
