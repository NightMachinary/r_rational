As a reminder, "All according to" is the title of the first chapter of the Grand Melee in the first book. Now, will the next chapters follow the initial naming scheme and go "[X]'s plan"? And if so, how many people have a plan? I'm see the base bet of "the Dead King, Malicia and Catherine" and raise you Akua.
