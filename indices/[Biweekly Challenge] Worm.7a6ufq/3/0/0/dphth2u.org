Thank you, "enjoyable" is what I was shooting for.

That second sentence is interesting, and I'm not sure that I parsed it correctly. What do you mean with "Narrative"? The prose/exposition-parts, as opposed to the dialogues? Also, what do you mean with "robustness"? I'm not trying to nitpick or anything, I'd just love to see you elaborate on this :)
