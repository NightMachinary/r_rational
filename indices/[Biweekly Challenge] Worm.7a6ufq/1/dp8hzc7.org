[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1viyQgTpbghk112IKdoZ-WYHyQ8r4GoGBaPutTsKZAKk/edit?usp=sharing][Training Wheels]] --- 6505 words. A graphic novel inspired short that I polished up for the challenge.

Inset illustrations in higher resolution:

I had to resize them to fit into the page formatting without leaving big paragraph breaks. The larger sized images are better to look at.
