Thanks for responding.

I got the notification about chapter #6 today. Is there a reason for why it's only a sentence long?

The only reason I can think of, assuming that it's intentional, is that Alyx just interrupted in a way that's different from how the reader would have expected. By stabbing him in frustration is my guess.
