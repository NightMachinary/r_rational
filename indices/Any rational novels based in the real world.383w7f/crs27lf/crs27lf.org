I can think of any number of examples. Both SF and mainstream fiction are full of works that the author clearly believed to be rational, objective, and objectively presenting a rational world-view, from various renaissance utopias onward. Try /The Moon is a Harsh Mistress/ for a rigorously (for the time) hard SF example.
