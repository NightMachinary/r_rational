Huh. His love for his nephew ultimately is his undoing.

I'm having a bit of trouble suspending disbelief on literally every single lioness failing to attack Rafiki when he threw the dust at Scar, and on top of that him managing to grab Zira in the process. There's only so much bystander apathy any scene can have, especially after the resolve to attack has been made.

And the ending seems... well, anticlimactic.

Rafiki had all of the advantages, magic powers, the truth-as-the-lions-would-see-it on his side, apparently superhuman fighting powers, and on top of all of that he wins by fluke?

That's... not really a satisfying ending.

We don't even find out how much of the Spirit World stuff is true or false, and suddenly in this chapter Scar is implying that Rafiki is making up the afterlife in his own thoughts when we apparently had prior evidence that spirit magic was definitely a thing.
