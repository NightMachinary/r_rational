I enjoyed the chapter, but I agree that the lions not attacking Rafiki was annoying to me as a reader. He's allowed to use magic to defend himself, he's done it before, but a quick mention of holding lions off with his staff is not sufficient unless we should not be expected to think there's any threat to him whatsoever in the scene.
