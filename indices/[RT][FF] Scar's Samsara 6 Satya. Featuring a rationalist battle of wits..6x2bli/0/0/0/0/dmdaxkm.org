Hmm, okay... So if I changed it to him doing his "conjure a wind that blows everyone away" thing, that would be more satisfying?

I originally did not go with that because A) they're in a cave, and B) that would blow the red vapors away, surely. But maybe it's better than the alternative?

I could also just change the situation so that only Zira is ordered to attack him, and not the other lionesses - maybe that's a better way to do it.
