This chapter felt like it veered close to this, although it was well executed enough to be good writing either way. I guess if you are looking to revise, make it clear that Rafiki is just that good at manipulation, magic, and hallucinogenic drug use? (You could address this in Scar's musings either before or after this chapter if it would clutter this chapter itself.)

  I just mean that part of the way this story teaches rationality is through the POV of a very flawed rationalist who is haunted by his past mistakes.

Right, and if sometime in the next couple of chapters, Scar reflects on events in a rationalist fashion it will play out like this. I was primarily saying *if* the story ended right here or without further resolution it wouldn't be rationalist.

Agreed that EY kind of cheated to make HJPEV into a rationalist. I do like seeing a rational fanfic were the main character is more realistic in their rationality.
