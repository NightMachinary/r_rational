Huzah, a falsifiable prediction! If it turns out to be right, you'll be awarded highly desirable rationality points + bragging rights.

I'm not saying if your prediction is right or wrong, but the things Simba is quoting are literally what Mufasa told him in Canon: "Simba, you have forgotten me. You have forgotten who you are, and so you have forgotten me. Remember..." The rest is interrupted by Scar, and Simba, already feeling guilty about his father's death, interprets the vision in a way that comforms with his beliefs - as his father blaming him for his death.

Scar is surprised that Mufasa did not mention being murdered by him (again, same as in canon), and comes to the same conclusions you do:

#+begin_quote
  Simba, I've known my brother all my life. The Mufasa I knew would never have said that to you, not in a million years!
#+end_quote

Which is what inspires his thoughts in this chapter when replying to Rafiki:

#+begin_quote
  “I was not, and I did not.” He had only ever intended to migrate Mufasa's spirit to greener pastures after all, which could hardly be considered a deliberate attempt at murder -- it was not his fault if the afterlife turned out to be a lie perpetuated by the likes of Rafiki.

In the next chapter, we'll see if you (and Scar) are on the right track!
