Huh. You know, that's one of the issues I have with hints and foreshadowing - I never know when something is clear enough.

With Banzai, the whole "coming back brain damaged" thing was supposed to be made clear by the set-up with Ed who is described that way, and then with Banzai being described and laughing in the exact same way. And then the sudden scene shift is supposed to leave the reader with a sense of "and that was the end of /that/".

But yeah, I can totally see how you might have missed that. It should be more obvious in the next chapter though.
