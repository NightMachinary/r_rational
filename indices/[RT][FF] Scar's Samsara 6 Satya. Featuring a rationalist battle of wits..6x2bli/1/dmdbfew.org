I notice that Simba says he heard Mufasa tell him it was his fault. If Simba is right about this(As in not lying to help Scar or suffering from delusions.), I think we can conclude that this was done entirely via hallucinogens, as this is something I don't think Rafiki would want to show Simba and it certainly isn't something the actual Mufasa would say.

I'm betting that Rafiki's power is mostly just weird herbalism and hallucinogens. So the afterlife is probably not as described and possibly nonexistent.

As for Scar's spiritual attunement, I honestly don't have a clue. As an out of there guess, that's probably some sort of actual magic which may or may not run on some sort of emotional enlightenment(which would explain how Scar lost his).
