PSA: This is not the end of the story! There's still a few more chapters coming up. So don't despair to see the end just yet.

By the way, the next chapter includes The Reveal(tm) wherein our heroic villains (or villainous heroes) finally find out more about how the spirits really work, thus uncovering the source of Rafiki's power. So if anybody wants to earn rationalist points in the eyes of the community, then now is the time to make your predictions!
