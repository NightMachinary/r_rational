Yeah, I hesitated a bit as to how real I wanted that particular bit of magic to be. In the end I settled for making it ambiguous: Scar doesn't think it's real, but he's playing it safe by not saying any outright lie. Basically, he figures that as long he puts himself into a mode of thought where he genuinely believes himself to be innocent and acts that way, he's safe from the gas regardless of how it works. Of course it's also possible that there really is a gease on him which is causing him to think that way.

If this were NTBS I would have clarified it, but in this setting I really like the mystery aspect of the spirits, and so I chose for this. Not sure if it really worked in this case though.
