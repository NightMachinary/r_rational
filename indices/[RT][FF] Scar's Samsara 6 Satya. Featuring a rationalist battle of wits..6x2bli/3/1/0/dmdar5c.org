Yep. This might have been a valid criticism when Scar first introduced his scheme to give everyone immortality and they just complained about it (though Scar /really/ should not have taken Zazu's word for that, given their latest conversation), but he just confessed to gleefully murdering their beloved ruler. Other motivations notwithstanding, that part is kind of unambigously evil.
