  It's not that he wins by a fluke. The story is called "Scar's Samsara", not "Scar vs Rafiki". The concept of the story is that Scar is his own worst enemy, and so he is the cause of most of his own problems.

I think this works in terms of it being a good story. *If the story ended here*, I would question this as fitting into the "rational" fanfic label versus a tragedy with a slightly smarter/more sympathetic scar... but seeing as how there are a few more chapters I'll see how it plays out. Either way, still a good fanfic and rational enough to be worth putting on this subreddit.

Edit: emphasis on *if*
