Why not rational? And why only slightly smarter? Compare it with HPMOR: Yes, Harry might seem very impressive for an 11 year old, but I see that as cheating because he just magically has all the knowledge of a superpowerful 60 year old wizard. Scar literally does not even have access to books. If you look at what the characters actually do, then both are responsible for causing their own problems due to their own irrational biases and issues, but both try to tackle their problems with science and experimentation, and they perform about equally well. I actually would say that Scar is the more potent rationalist despite his flaws.

Mind you, I would totally agree with you if I had said "Scar cannot possibly win because this is a greek tragedy" and used that as an excuse for bad writing, but that's not what I meant. I just mean that his story teaches rationality is through the POV of a very flawed rationalist who is haunted by his past mistakes, and so that's what causes him to fail in this instance.
