  I'm having a bit of trouble suspending disbelief on literally every single lioness failing to attack Rafiki when he threw the dust at Scar, and on top of that him managing to grab Zira in the process.

True, that was a bit iffy, but to be fair the room was literally being covered by a (possibly magical) choking gas at the time. Would /you/ have gone in there? It's easy to say 'burn the witch', but the prospect is far more appealing when the target is not actually, you know, a witch.

Also, bear in mind that Rafiki is a kung fu battle wizard: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDRm36U7V70]]

  Rafiki had all of the advantages, magic powers, the truth-as-the-lions-would-see-it on his side, apparently superhuman fighting powers, and on top of all of that he wins by fluke?

It's not that he wins by a fluke. The story is called "Scar's Samsara", not "Scar vs Rafiki". The concept of the story is that Scar is his own worst enemy, and so he is the cause of most of his own problems.

Throughout the entire trial, you may notice that Scar is morose and defeatist: He expects everyone to betray him, but nobody does. He expects Rafiki to sway them, but everyone including Mufasa's wife and son keeps faith in Scar, which only hurts him /more/. He voluntarily enters the circle of truth and keeps speaking even after he's won, just to spite Rafiki. This is because his own guilty conscience is haunting him, /willing/ him to fail - and so in the end it's Simba, not Rafiki, who really gets to him.

  That's... not really a satisfying ending.

The story is not over yet! There's still some more chapters to come, and that includes most of the reveals regarding how spirits actually work. Scar in this chapter is still speculating because he does not /know/ how it works - he's basing everything on his own experience with wielding the Spirit Kings' power in his youth, but he can't actually be certain that it's really the Kings of the Past who gave him that power. And as you could see in chapter 4, he's totally crippled in his investigations.
