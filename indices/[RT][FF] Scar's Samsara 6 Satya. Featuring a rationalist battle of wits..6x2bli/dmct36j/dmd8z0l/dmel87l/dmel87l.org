  Throughout the entire trial, you may notice that Scar is morose and defeatist: He expects everyone to betray him, but nobody does. He expects Rafiki to sway them, but everyone including Mufasa's wife and son keeps faith in Scar, which only hurts him more. He voluntarily enters the circle of truth and keeps speaking even after he's won, just to spite Rafiki. This is because his own guilty conscience is haunting him, willing him to fail - and so in the end it's Simba, not Rafiki, who really gets to him.

  I'm not talking about obscure card interactions or unwitting basic play mistakes - I'm referring to plays that you make (or not make) that you know (or highly suspect) are incorrect. I'm talking about finding an excuse to lose.
