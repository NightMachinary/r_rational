I thought he admitted his guilt because he couldn't stand to see Simba continue to blame himself. His internal monologue indicated that "truth gas" isn't a real thing, it was just some drug that causes impulsiveness. The setup for the confession was that the combination of the drug messing with his head, his gradually building guilt over his whole family wrongly defending his honor, and Simba admitting that he was convinced he'd caused his own father's death, culminated in him freaking out and confessing. So ironically enough considering the subreddit, he's probably /not/ thinking rationally enough to take your advice in this moment. I would have been surprised if he'd shifted instantly from such an emotionally driven, impulsive, counterproductive act to a calculated one like you describe.
