Exactly! This might be rationalist fiction, but the characters are still only human/lion. That's one of the common criticisms of rational fiction, actually; that we ignore the human factor in favour of writing about cold calculating robots. In fact, I think lessons in rationality are much better taught by occasionally showing charactes /not/ acting rationally, and the consequences thereof.

Also, even if Scar were rational right now, there's no way he could reasonably expect the lionesses to be willing to talk things over: They just heard Nuka say that they were planning to kill them all - Scar's confession immediately afterwards seems to confirm that initial setup, acting as a perfect one-two punch.

They're not in a good way right now.
