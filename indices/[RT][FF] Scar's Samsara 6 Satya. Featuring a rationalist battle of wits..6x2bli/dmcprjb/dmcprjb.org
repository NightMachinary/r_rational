Omg. These lions are dumb. Scar didn't kill mufasa merely for angers sake, he also did it to save the lives of all the sentient beings of the pridelands INCLUDING THEM. Scar should have mentioned that as soon as the truth gas forced him to admit his guilt. He knows that he'll lose everything he worked for otherwise. He needs to at least make Simba understand why he did it, so that Simba will be a more ethical ruler than Mufasa. Scar should not run. The most effective thing he can do right now is probably to stay and make himself a martyr for his cause, and let Simba continue the fight in his stead.
