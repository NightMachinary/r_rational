I think one would be better served to view the proffered gold as an enticement rather than simply as a reward, though it has qualities of both. For instance, I'm writing a piece for the current (“Eschaton”) challenge, but it will likely not be finished in time. But it /did/ get me out of a spell and into spelunking into one of my old universes again, so there's that. Now I merely want to explore this aspect of it, and the original challenge is merely the incitement, not the root.
