Hm. The term 'caste' is telling--it sounds as though the preferred course of action would be to (use the last of their influence to) dissolve the caste system/boundaries (spreading literacy for one thing...), temporarily becoming a caste of warrior-mages or even just having most of their children train in other jobs.

Hmmm, now imagining a 'spearhead' for the Crown that was half as effective as the warrior caste in youth, then half as effective as the mage caste when elderly. With only mages, ones could use the older generation while the newer were weak, but you'd spread yourself too thin in trying to guard all the borders that unwhittled half-warriors could cover more easily. Granted, automatons ultimately spell the end of that in one form or another, depending on costs.

If the aim is to avoid warrior-obsolescence, rather than to migrate the genes and personal histories/culture of the existing people to a more favourable standpoint, then the position becomes one of trying to drag down the rest of their society to preserve an inefficient status quo.

Hmm, also a little fun to imagine what such a war would look like--the warriors would have to pretty much institute martial law in order to go everywhere a mage lived and seize them.
