I hadnt seen it update since chapter 67 so I got a delightful bunch of chapters to read through.

For two of those I kept on mixing this with The Need to Become Stronger, cosntantly worried about how The Enemy was working his plans. When I remembered that was from another story I reread the chapters.

I find myself worried about several things. Fuu, I now believe he is merely a smokescreen or distraction for Danzo's real plans. Possibly suborning a different clan altogether, or just to keep Kakashi and co occupied.

Secondly, Ino's section just threw up so many red flags. From the chekhov's gun of her moral dilemma argument with Shikamaru, to the whole introspection about freedom. I feel like Tobi wants Kakashi to become Hokage.

Furthermore, I find it disturbing that Kakashi and the Hokage didnt look into Kakashi's sudden lack of recall as something worth investigating.

The tension is creeping higher and higher but I love it so much.
