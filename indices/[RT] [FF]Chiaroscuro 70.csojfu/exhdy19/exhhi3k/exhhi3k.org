I did not write as it have been often posted before here. This was to notify that the new chapter is up.

It is the standard Naruto fanfic but people are LVL 1 intelligence and Kakashi is the best troll I have seen in fiction so far. Not troll as in "Lol I'm so random", but as in "He has a method to his madness and carefully prepares stuff and then blames it on luck."

World politics in a ninja world are also among the best I have seen in naruto fanfics.
