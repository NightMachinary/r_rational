Bruce Kent is a billionaire playboy anyway. He can not have the unimportant guy moment. Neither can Batman.

He does not have the stress of actually having a hidden identity. A conflict of being two things. He can at least be honest with people saying he is who he is. No cognitive dissonance, he does not have to deal with living a double life.

But no. I do not accept his superhero status. Someone doing something heroic does not make him a superhero, and not being immune to bullets makes him a bit less of a superhero, as it is more about the powers, and consistently getting the heroing done.
