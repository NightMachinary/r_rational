  Why?

All they did, so far, is consistent with Bruce Kent being a normal person and at the same time with him being secretly Mongoose, rather than it only being consistent with him being secretly Mongoose.

E.g. Bruce Kent wore a bulletproof shirt. He appeared to be in pain from what seemed to be a broken rib. He carefully navigated the conversation with his date in a way that can be interpreted both ways. If someone questioned why he's not leaving in an ambulance, I'm sure there would be a baseline-human-compatible explanation (like Bruce Kent still being in danger). Etc.

This is possibly because Mongoose has a reputation for being intelligent, and if there was an obvious "oversight" like Bruce Kent getting money from nowhere at the same time Mongoose gets money, his intelligent enemies could suspect he's trying to throw off his less intelligent adversaries by creating a false appearance of being Bruce Kent... but that's just my guess.
