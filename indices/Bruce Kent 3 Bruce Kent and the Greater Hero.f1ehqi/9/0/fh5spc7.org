My interpretation (or headcanon, at least) of this is that, given that Mongoose was there and watching, he would have heard what the Pyrofessor was wanting to steal (the gems), gone to the deposit boxes, then taken them out first. That would be the reason why the Pyrofessor gave Bruce the "significant glare" before she left, and would make it so that her escape wouldn't have mattered as much.
