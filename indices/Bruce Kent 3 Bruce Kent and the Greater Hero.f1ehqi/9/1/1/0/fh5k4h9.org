Irrespective of the ethics of bank robbery, I'd expect a superhero like the Mongoose to stop any he came across.

In the eyes of the public, the robbery unfortunately happened when he was in his civilian non-meta identity. And since the Mongoose follows the mask code so religiously that he'd never reveal his identity, preventing violence in exchange for a promise not to catch the villain was the best he could do.

Of course, in actual fact, the Mongoose wasn't even present and thus couldn't prevent the robbery, but the promise stands.

You can see the outcome either as a rare defeat for the admirable Mongoose, or as a triumphant victory of preventing violence without having to fight.
