  Timing-wise, I don't see how Pyro could've been dealt with before the end of the vignette. So Bruce would've informed the Mongoose of the deal, and I don't see why the Mongoose would violate it, since it would harm Bruce Kent's reputation, which everyone knows is his own.

I mean given that we're talking about gadgets made by smart people with super-tech, the watch probably records everything that happens while it's off-network and then passes it all along as soon as it comes back online. The Mongoose would've received a summarized packet of everything that happened as soon as the watch was back up.
