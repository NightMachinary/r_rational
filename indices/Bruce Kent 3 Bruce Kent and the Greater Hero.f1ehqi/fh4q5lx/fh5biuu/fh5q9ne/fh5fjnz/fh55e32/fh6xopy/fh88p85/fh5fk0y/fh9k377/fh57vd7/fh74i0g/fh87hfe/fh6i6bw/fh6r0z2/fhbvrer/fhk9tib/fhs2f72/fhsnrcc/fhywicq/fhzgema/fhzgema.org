The only reason that everything surrounding Bruce Kent is consistent with Bruce Kent being a normal person is because Bruce Kent /is/ a normal person. He's agreed to - and is being paid to - be the Mongoose's public 'secret' identity, and he does so so convincingly that Professor Pyrofessor would rather believe he can fool her voice analysis software than that he's not the 'Goose, so there must be /some/ incredibly suggestive evidence somewhere.

And I'm sure it's not as blatant as the 'Goose depositing money directly into Bruce's accounts. It probably passes through a bunch of steps to get there, to obscure its source. But every time the 'Goose gets a large amount of money, a week or two later Bruce Kent's bank account gets bigger... sure, Bruce can claim it's "an investment that paid off, just coincidentally at the same time" but who will believe that?
