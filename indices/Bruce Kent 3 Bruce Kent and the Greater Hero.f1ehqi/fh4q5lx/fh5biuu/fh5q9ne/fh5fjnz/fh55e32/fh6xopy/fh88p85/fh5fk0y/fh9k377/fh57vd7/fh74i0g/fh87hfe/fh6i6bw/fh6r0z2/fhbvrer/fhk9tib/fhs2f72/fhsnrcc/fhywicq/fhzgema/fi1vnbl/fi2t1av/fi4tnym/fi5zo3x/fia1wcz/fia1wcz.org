  But it'll take a very rare enemy to believe that the 'Goose is giving away pretty near /all/ his money, just for a trick.

The payoff, in case of success, isn't merely a successfully executed trick, but

1. Having your identity hidden (if a villain meets you on the street, they not only they won't hurt you because of the code, but also won't know it's you)
2. Being safe from the possibility of investigation (everyone "knows" you're Bruce Kent, so who would even start an investigation into your identity?)

The advantage of pulling this off successfully is enormous, so giving away almost all of his money to achieve this advantage isn't strange.

But maybe there are some reasons why nobody would suspect that.
