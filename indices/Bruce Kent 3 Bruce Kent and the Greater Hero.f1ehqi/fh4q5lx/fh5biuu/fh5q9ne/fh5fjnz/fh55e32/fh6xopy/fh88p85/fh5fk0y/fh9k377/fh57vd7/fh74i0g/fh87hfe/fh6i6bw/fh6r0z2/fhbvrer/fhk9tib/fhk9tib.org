Deliberate, concerted effort on the part of both Bruce and the Goose, no doubt.

I imagine it included, at minimum:

- Bruce Kent vanishes every time the Mongoose needs to be somewhere. (Arranging for a couple of these vanishings to be from very public places - such as large billionaire-style parties - would have been easy, Bruce just needs to party until the Goose calls his watch).
- Every time the Mongoose obtains some monetary reward for stopping some terrible crime, the cash appears in Bruce Kent's bank account. Bruce Kent has no other source of income.
- Bruce Kent might occasionally 'slip up' and mention some things that very few people aside from the Mongoose knows.
