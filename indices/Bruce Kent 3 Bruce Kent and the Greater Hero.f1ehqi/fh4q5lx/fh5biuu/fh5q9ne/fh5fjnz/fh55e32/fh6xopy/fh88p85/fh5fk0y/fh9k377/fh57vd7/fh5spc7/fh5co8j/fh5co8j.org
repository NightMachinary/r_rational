Timing-wise, I don't see how Pyro could've been dealt with before the end of the vignette. So Bruce would've informed the Mongoose of the deal, and I don't see why the Mongoose would violate it, since it would harm Bruce Kent's reputation, which everyone knows is his own.

(Not to mention EY's background in decision theory, which stresses that lying has consequences, and having a reputation of keeping one's word is very useful but requires that one actually does keep one's word.)
