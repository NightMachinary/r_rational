  sure, Bruce can claim it's "an investment that paid off, just coincidentally at the same time

It might be also plausible that the revenue from this investment will be verifiable by a third party (or its unverifiability will have a plausible explanation too).

In reality, what might be going on is that Mongoose helped Bruce to invest intelligently - deliberately just enough to obtain the right about of money, and this is Bruce's payment. Meanwhile, Mongoose kept the money /he/ got and invested into e.g. a better supersuit - but better in a non-obvious way (for which there is nevertheless some "evidence").

(Edit: Or something else.)

  so convincingly that Professor Pyrofessor would rather believe he can fool her voice analysis software than that he's not the 'Goose, so there must be /some/ incredibly suggestive evidence somewhere
#+end_quote

That's a good point - if there is always plausible deniability, what tipped off everyone in the first place to notice Bruce Kent "is" Mongoose?

I think it's possible the evidence was in public long enough for everyone to notice - and so, when the plausible explanation (that provided Bruce Kent with plausible deniability) finally came to light, it was "too late" - everyone already "knew" he was Mongoose.

(Edit: The explanation being "too late" might itself have an explanation.)
