Short story idea for #4:

The Setup: Continuing from #1, Bruce Kent is still looking for a date. He's finally found the woman of his dreams - besides whatever else he's looking for in a romantic partner, She seems to truly believe him when he says he isn't the Masculine Mongoose.

The Conflict: ... which is unnerving, because, after all, *everybody knows* that Bruce Kent == Masculine Mongoose. Suddenly Bruce and his date switch roles from #1, as he is put in the position of having to explain to her all the circumstantial evidence, getting increasingly confused why she just doesn't believe him.

The Development: Bruce tries to find out why she so adamantly takes his words at face value (insanity? gullibility? hidden motives?), possibly with some assistance by the Mongoose who after all has a tangential interest in the trustworthiness of Bruce's romantic partners.

The Resolution: The date fails or succeeds, and Bruce ultimately decides whether to continue this relationship - whichever result is preferred by the author.

---

The Optional Twist (if such a thing is even necessary in this short story): In a superhero setting, naturally the romantic interest has a mask identity: she's a villainess, maybe even one who has fought the Masculine Mongoose before.

Her inability to accept staggeringly obvious notions like Bruce Kent == Masculine Mongoose stems from a side effect of her meta powers, for instance an extreme form of empiricism, or because she takes Bayesian inference very seriously but somehow had a prior of 0 for this hypothesis, so no amount of evidence could persuade her.

She could have hidden motives for the date, but the story might work better without any. She's there in her civilian identity, after all.
