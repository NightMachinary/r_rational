... That's my point.

Mongoose* can stay sane by being Hegadi, who no one actually expects anything from. As far as anyone is concerned, Hegadi is just some guy with a good excuse to always be running off whenever the Mongoose* is needed.

Bruce Kent doesn't have that. There's nowhere he can go to escape from the presumption that he is the Mongoose*. The first story shows that he can't have an honest love life, as, if he tells the truth, people will assume he's lying. The second story shows that he can't have a normal work life: people will try to unmask him, or otherwise treat him as if he's someone he's not. And this third story shows that he can't even run errands without being in the Mongoose's* shadow.

Superman can escape being Superman by becoming Clark Kent. Batman can hang up his cowl and be Bruce Wayne. Mongoose* can put on his thong and just be Hegadi the mediocre.

Bruce Kent has no escape from who people think he is, a presumption so powerful that the person who /really is/ who people think Bruce Kent is calls it a superpower in its own right.

And maybe the commenter who said that Mongoose's* sanity is more important than Bruce Kent's is right. But it's still a shame, if not outright hypocritical, that Mongoose* gets to go home and be unimportant for a while, where "the greater hero" never, /ever/, gets that opportunity.

*Mongoose, not Mandrake.
