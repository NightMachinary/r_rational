I'm now picturing Bruce Kent paired with a love interest who has paid /a meta/ to participate in a similar "fake secret identity" arrangement for the sake of bolstering her own reputation. She might have honestly figured out what's going on with Bruce, except that she's right for the wrong reasons, and severely misunderstands how his arrangement works, assuming it's something more like her own.
