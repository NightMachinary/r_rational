I find it interesting that one of the big points here is that superheroes need a secret identity to stay sane... and Bruce is a superhero without one. If his power is that people think he's the Masculine Mongoose*, then he doesn't really have an identity where he can hide that power.

I wonder if there will be consequences to his sanity because of that.

*Mongoose, not Mandrake.
