That's true, if for no other reason than Hegadi appears to be a walking lie detector.

Yes, that would be someone he could talk to, and it wouldn't even present any serious risk towards the Mongoose's secret identity (because /of course/ someone whose job it is to report on the Mongoose's location would hang around Bruce Kent).

I agree with you that, while probably better than nothing, discussing the secret that is causing turmoil in your life /with the person who asked you to keep that secret in the first place/ might not be enough to defuse the stress caused by that turmoil.
