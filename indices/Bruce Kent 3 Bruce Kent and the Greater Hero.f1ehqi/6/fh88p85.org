story idea:

A few years ago a man named Clark Wayne walked into a police station and confessed to being the Feminine Falcon; arch-nemesis of the Mongoose. He plead guilty to all charges, and knew the details of many crimes that could only be known to the Falcon herself. He is now serving a life sentence, avoiding the death penalty only because he turned himself in.

But of course everybody, including Bruce, knows Wayne is innocent. The Falcon must have bribed, threatened, brainwashed, mind-controlled or otherwise convinced Wayne to pose as her, in order to further some byzantine plot. The Falcon must still be out there, biding her time.

Facing public outcry, the president has pardoned Wayne for all the crimes he confessed to. But Wayne does not want to leave prison, and so wishes to confess to more crimes, but he will only speak to Bruce Kent.

Bruce is bent on getting this poor patsy out of prison. Clark wants to stay. A battle of wits ensues.
