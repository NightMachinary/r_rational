[[/twiwink][]] Bruce Kent is well known for his ability to confound walking lie detectors when he continually claims not to be the 'Goose.

...no, the real reason that Hegadi will believe Bruce is that Hegadi /knows/ that Bruce is /not/ the 'Goose.

Fortunately, Bruce seems to believe that the 'Goose is even smarter and more Good than even the 'Goose's reputation, so it seems that there is /some/ good in discussing the matter with him.
