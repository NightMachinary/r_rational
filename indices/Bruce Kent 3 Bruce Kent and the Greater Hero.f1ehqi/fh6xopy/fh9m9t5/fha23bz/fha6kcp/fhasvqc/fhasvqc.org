  Bruce Kent is a billionaire playboy anyway. He can not have the unimportant guy moment. Neither can Batman.
#+end_quote

BW plays the "spoiled rich kid" (a kind of unimportance) all the time. Look at the scene in /Begins/ where the girls on his arm start swimming in a fountain, and he buys the hotel when the concierge asks them to stop.

BK, on the other hand, probably wouldn't be asked to stop, for fear that this is all one of the Mongoose's* plans, and they might disrupt it by intervening.

#+begin_quote
  He does not have the stress of actually having a hidden identity. A conflict of being two things.
#+end_quote

Look at the scene in the bank. BK /can't/ just be who he honestly is, the billionaire playboy. He has to take into account what people will think of the Mongoose* when choosing how to act. Whereas when BW takes off the cowl, the fact that they won't associate his behaviour with Batman is /entirely the point/.

#+begin_quote
  He can at least be honest with people saying he is who he is. No cognitive dissonance, he does not have to deal with living a double life.
#+end_quote

Yes, he can be honest. And everyone thinks he's a liar for it. They react with "one part sheer incredulity, and two parts also sheer incredulity." If he values honesty as a virtue, then it has to sting that it's a virtue that no one will /ever/ associate with him.

I disagree entirely that he doesn't have a double life. Someone without a double life wouldn't have to disappear whenever the Mongoose* was active, or risk his life to stop someone from getting hurt at a bank robbery.

And it's fair to think that's not superheroism. But I /don't/ think it's fair to say that his identity as "guy who everyone thinks is the Mongoose*" is not causing him the same kind of stress an actual superhero would experience. Especially when there's no one he can go to with his problems who will believe him. And, even if there were, /he still couldn't/ because that would require compromising the secret that he's just a body double for the Mongoose*, which would put Hegadi's identity in danger.

*Mongoose, not Mandrake.
