Good point. I suppose it would've been very loud defeating the pyromaniacs. There's no way he could've missed it.

Still, bank robbery isn't the sort of thing that should be tolerated. Wouldn't EY have something to say about social norms, about the long-term damage to financial confidence, the risk of hoarding and so on if bank-robbing becomes endemic? I'm sort of grasping at straws but at some point through HPMOR he points out that effective altruists didn't just rob a bank to send money to charity, that banks were more than just a piggy-bank that could be emptied willy-nilly?

Oh well, I can hardly expect a detailed analysis of economics in 5000 words that focuses on a completely different branch of logic and philosophy. I suppose the point was that the Mongoose isn't an always-totally-victorious Superman who could manage to find some clever solution every time.
