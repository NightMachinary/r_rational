This series of vignettes has been consistently enjoyable. Thanks for this! I also appreciate that besides the humor, other themes also get their fair shake.

That said, "Pyrofessor" and "Inacan" are groan-inducing puns whose existence makes all other puns worse off. Boo! It reminded me of a quote, by you or another rationalist, saying something vaguely along the lines of "This pun is so bad that it will be cursed until the heat death of the universe".
