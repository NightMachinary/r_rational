From Part 1:

  I couldn't go on being a millionaire playboy without the Mongoose's money. But I've saved up enough that I wouldn't need to go back to work.

So it's clear that there is a direct money flow from the 'Goose to Bruce, and it only makes sense that they'd use that to suggest that Bruce is the 'Goose. (In Part 3, I note that the 'Goose is officially known to pay Hegadi 'standard meta-on-call rates', described as enough that he doesn't need to work but not millionaire playboy levels, which implies that that's all he's keeping. Though, of course, anything invested /as/ the 'Goose, e.g. into a better supersuit, can also be spent from Bruce's share).

And it's very possible that Bruce's only official explanation for where he gets his money from is "none of your business", which is more suggestive evidence that he's the 'Goose.
