Thought about it a bit, and (even besides the added complication of an additional possibly-discoverable lie like a "special material") it actually makes sense: Even a useless superpower might be hired as *entertainment*, just to amuse people by demonstrating it.

If he needs be near-nude however, he can simply proclaim he's too embarrassed to appear in public like that. He certainly can't demonstrate it around kids, etc, that's indecent.

So it makes his seeming power even more useless.
