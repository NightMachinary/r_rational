I would recommend not looking at ANYTHING on [[/r/HPMOR][r/HPMOR]] until you finish reading HPMOR. It's still ostensibly against the rules to post unmarked spoilers there, but being years later, those rules aren't enforced particularly strictly, and people will casually rattle off ENORMOUS SPOILERS like it's NOTHING, don't even visit that subreddit, I see a spoiler /in the title of a post/ and it's related to something that happens in chapter 85. /Chapter 85./
