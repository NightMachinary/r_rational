Don't click on my name, either.

*Don't click on the names of anyone who replies to your post.* You probably wouldn't've checked out [[/r/HPMOR][r/HPMOR]] until you were finished reading it, but sometimes people, like, idk.... Everybody probably does it, but I don't see it talked about. Somebody starts talking to you and maybe you check out their post history...

Point being, I have no idea who all might respond to you with recommendations and I have no idea what conversations they may or may not have been participating in recently, but you could easily have BIG IMPORTANT THINGS spoiled for you if you get curious.
