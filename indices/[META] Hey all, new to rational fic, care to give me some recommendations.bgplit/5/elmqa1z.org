It might help to know why you didn't get into those three works; if there's something about them you didn't like, we can try to recommend works that don't have those things.

That said, if you have no particular reason, then, well, I highly recommend /Worm/ and /Madoka Magica/. They're both excellent.

Regarding rational fanfic, /To The Stars/ is a great /Madoka Magica/ fanfiction if you're into sci-fi worldbuilding. (Note that it will basically spoil all of canon.) (It's also fairly tonally different than canon. It doesn't have the same dark atmosphere, since it depicts a world where magical girls have mostly pulled themselves out of their nasty situation.)
