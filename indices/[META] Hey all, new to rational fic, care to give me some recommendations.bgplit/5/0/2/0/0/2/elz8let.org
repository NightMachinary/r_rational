As far as I've followed Wildbow's comments, he doesn't want to publish Worm as it is, because he wants to do some major polishing work on it first. That ranges from Spelling/Grammar errors, to some foreshadowing that could have been made clearer, to outright cutting some parts. The timeskip in the later arcs is also a point he's not content with.

The problem is, he's still putting out 10-20 000 words on his main story Ward every week. Editing is tedious work with little immediate reward, and so is easy to set aside.

I've even read comments from Wildbow that he's thinking of writing a "Guide to the Parahumans Universe", and then handing the editing of Worm over to someone else, though I'm not sure he ever pursued that option.

Also, he's making a lot of money via [[https://www.patreon.com/Wildbow][Patreon]] already, don't think he needs the additional revenue from book sales all too badly.
