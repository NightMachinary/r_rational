Yeah, it's just, like... a really good Superman novel. It's the right length to not be intimidating - fanfictions like HPMOR tend to lean on the 'would actually dwarf War and Peace if printed out' side. It's driven by cleverness and rationality while also being easy to read and without getting slowed down by digressions or author insert speeches. And its core theme is a genuine moral dilemma. It's got in many ways the same appeal as something as Death Note or Breaking Bad, where we follow a villain protagonist morbidly fascinated by their actions, however morally wrong, because we get to see into their heads and understand their motives. And also because evil geniuses, as a rule, are always a blast to watch do their thing.
