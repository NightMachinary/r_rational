/The Metropolitan Man/ is a really good one, and all you need is a passing familiarity with the Superman canon (cultural osmosis alone should have provided that unless you live under a rock). /Friendship is Optimal/ is great too, and all you need to know is that My Little Pony features ponies (bonus if you can appreciate the ironic contrast between the sugary aesthetic and... all that happens in the story). I read and appreciated /Luminosity/ and /Radiance/ without ever finishing a single Twilight book or movie. /A bluer shade of white/ needs you to have watched a Frozen, but it's just a single movie.
