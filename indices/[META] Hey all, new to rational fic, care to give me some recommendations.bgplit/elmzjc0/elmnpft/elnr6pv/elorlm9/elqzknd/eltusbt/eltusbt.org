The key thing missing from the 2011 version is the bit where Gon is 8 and he meets Kaito for the first time. It is however inserted as a flashback later on. There's also the cooking test in the Hunter exam, which is not exactly plot essential but it's funny, and in the 2011 version is severely abridged. Other than that, everything else the 1999 version had that isn't in the 2011 one is anime original content.
