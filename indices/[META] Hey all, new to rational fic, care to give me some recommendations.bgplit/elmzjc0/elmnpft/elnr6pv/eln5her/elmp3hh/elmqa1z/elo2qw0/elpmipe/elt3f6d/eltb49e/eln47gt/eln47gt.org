I suggest you follow up HPMOR with reading [[http://www.anarchyishyperbole.com/p/significant-digits.html][Significant Digits]]. Worth the Candle and PGtE too as already suggested above.

Then you can follow up with [[https://qntm.org/ra][Sam Hughes' Ra]] + [[https://qntm.org/structure][Fine Structure]], or anything else from him really. If you didn't like Worm (neither do I) there are still plenty of [[https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/06/02/and-i-show-you-how-deep-the-rabbit-hole-goes/][other stories from Scott Alexander]] that you can enjoy.
