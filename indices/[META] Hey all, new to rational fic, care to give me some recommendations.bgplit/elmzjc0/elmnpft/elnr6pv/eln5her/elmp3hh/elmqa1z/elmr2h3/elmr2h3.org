Eh, I just never got around to them past the first episodes or so.

Oh, I already know many of the big plot twists of PMMM, so spoiling all of canon isn't a big deal. Not a fan of super-dark stories either, so thats good to know! And I LOVE worldbuilding, so that's a definite must-read.

And is there a good singular spot to read Worm? I heard it was written over a series of several hundred to several thousand forum posts.
