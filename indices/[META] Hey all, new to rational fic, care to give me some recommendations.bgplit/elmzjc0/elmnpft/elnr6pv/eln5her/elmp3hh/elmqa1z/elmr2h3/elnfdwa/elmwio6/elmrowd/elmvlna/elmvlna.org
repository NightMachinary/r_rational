Yeah, epub is the easiest way if OP doesn't want to click the 'Next Chapter' link after finishing a chapter. I made my own epub with [[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webtoepub/akiljllkbielkidmammnifcnibaigelm][this Chrome extension]]. It's also compatible with other fiction sites such as AO3, ffnet and fictionpress.

About the reason why Wilbow hadn't done it himself, IIRC is because when he contacted publishing companies they did not want free-to-read version scattering around the internet. He doesn't discourage people from creating their own copy though, he just doesn't want it to be distributed.

EDIT: Also, I'm curious on how someone would be missing boatloads of cash and exposure by forcing people to read it on their website. I think opposite will be the case. More people visit their site and more cash the owner will get through ads, patreon and donate button on their sidebar. And the owner gets more exposure and credit on their work if people link to their site instead of some site by an anonymous person who re-upload their work.
