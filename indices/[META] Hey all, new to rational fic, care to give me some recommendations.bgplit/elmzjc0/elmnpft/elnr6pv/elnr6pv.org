Hunter x Hunter is an amazing anime which I think might count as rational fic. One of my friends introduced it to me recently. It's a shonen anime where "reality ensues" is pretty much a rule of the setting. While none of the characters are geniuses, they are often quite clever and tend to solve their problems in intelligent ways, the characters' motivations are also realistic. You'll want to watch the 2011 version though because the 1999 version is kinda crap.

I would also highly recommend Marked for Death (naruto fanfic quest that's really good)

Also Alexander Wales has written some pretty good stuff, like "Shadows of the Limelight".

There's also Luminosity by Alicorn (imagine if Twilight had been written by an author who was smarter and better at writing)

You might also like the musical "Twisted: the Untold Story of a Royal Vizier" by Starkid.

Also highly recommend stories by Eliezer Yudkowsky like "the Sword of Good" and "The Finale of the Ultimate Meta-Mega Crossover" He's also written some great one-shots, like "The Simple Truth" and "A Fable of Science and Politics"

Also Code Geass: the Prepared Rebellion by SeerKing is another good story that's in progress, although it updates kinda sporadically because he has a bunch of other stories he's writing at the same time.

There's also Unsong by Scott Alexander, which takes the premise "what would the world actually look like if Hebrew scripture were true" and plays it straight to its natural conclusions.

Strong Female Protagonist is a great one too. It's a superhero webcomic, technically, but it's *really* good.

I also really like the schooled in magic series by christopher nutall, but the story starts out really weak. It gets a lot better later though. Most of the books in the series are designed to be read independently of each other, but for the best possible experience it's better to start earlier in the series and read on from there.

Animorph's: The Reckoning is really good too, but I think it's probably been abandoned. Same with Harry Potter and the Natural 20. Both of them are still probably worth reading though even though they'll never be done. *cries*
