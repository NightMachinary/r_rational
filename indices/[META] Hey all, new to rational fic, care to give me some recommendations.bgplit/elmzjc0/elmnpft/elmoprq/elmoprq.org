/A Practical Guide to Evil/ is looking pretty great, but it's a BIG story, is there any way I can download it to read offline?

In fact, they're ALL huge, but at least Worth the Candle is from AO3 and has an easy downloadable format. Don't know about Mother of Learning, since I've never used FictionPress before (looks an awful lot like FF.net, though, maybe it works the same way?)
