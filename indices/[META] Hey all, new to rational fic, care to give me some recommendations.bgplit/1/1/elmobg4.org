Sorry, maybe I should have clarified.

By "working knowledge", I mean that I have read/watched the series in question to a significant extent /(if not the entire series)/ and that I am well-acquainted with not just the protagonist(s) and basic plot synopsis, but with several side-characters and major story events.
