Hi, welcome to [[/r/rational][r/rational]]. This community has wiki. I don't know why mods do not place it at most prominent place, but you can get [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index#wiki_defining_works][good stuff there]]. We also got Monday recommendation thread, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/bauwc6/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/][check it out]].

I'm a Mother of Learning fanboy ([[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21220/mother-of-learning/chapter/301778/1-good-morning-brother][click here]] if you wish to read it at RoyalRoad), I did tame critic from time to time, but my love for it is immense. The fiction's opening was fairly weak, but there's reason why it's this community current darling.
