The 2011 version shortcuts the beginning though. The first few episodes of the 1999 version have some heartwarming scenes and a brief bit of character growth that I think benefits the later 2011 show. I think it is only one episode but I forget which one out of the first 5 that has the expanded plot I'm thinking of.
