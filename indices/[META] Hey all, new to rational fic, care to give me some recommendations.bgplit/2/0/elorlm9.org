  There's also Unsong by Scott Alexander, which takes the premise "what would the world actually look like if Hebrew scripture were true" and plays it straight to its natural conclusions.
#+end_quote

Reasonably sure taking Hebrew scripture to its natural conclusions doesn't end with sentient peyote cactus hive minds.

Definitely seconding the recommendation for unsong though. It's bizarre, but in an excellent way.

  Animorph's: The Reckoning is really good too, but I think it's probably been abandoned.
#+end_quote

Wait, Animorphs the reckoning is abandoned? I thought the author was just having super long breaks between chapters.
