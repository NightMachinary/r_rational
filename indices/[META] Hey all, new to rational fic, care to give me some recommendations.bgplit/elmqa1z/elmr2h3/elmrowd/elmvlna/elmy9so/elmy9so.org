One of the major complaints that I see people make for worm is accessibility. Having to read it on his website really pulled the wind from his sails when he had amazing word of mouth a few years ago, in my opinion. I know that every time I recommend worm to someone it's an issue, and if I could have linked an amazon book with a professional cover(or given it as a gift, even), the chance that they will try it is much higher than some rando website.

And ebook Self-publishing is very easy nowadays, and actually a major advantage if you're over the crucial marketing hump, like wildbow is, where he has great name recognition, dedicated fans, and amazing word of mouth. With a normal publishing contract you're looking at maybe 10% of the gross, if you're very lucky(normal ~5%). For ebook self-publishing, you get as much as 70%!

Self-pub authors like Will Wight and Andrew Rowe got big entirely off of word of mouth on subs like [[/r/fantasy][r/fantasy]], [[/r/litrpg][r/litrpg]], [[/r/noveltranslations][r/noveltranslations]], and so on. Just Wight's latest book(a piddly little ~70k words novel) made a few hundred thousand in the first week, which is more than wildbow ever made from worm, I'd wager. It's possible Wight made more in the past 2 years just from the Cradle series than wildbow has made from everything he's ever written.

Imagine how different it would be if every time it were recommended, people could point to a $5 ebook?
