If you love worldbuilding, then I feel I should tell you that Mother of Learning actually started as a play-test for the author's worldbuilding ideas. He found that considering the perspective of someone inside his imagined world helped him to spot flaws; thus, he planned out a story based on that.

So, naturally, it comes with a rich background - geography, history, politics, structured and unstructured magic (including magical programming), spirits and religion, etc. It never reads like a textbook - all these things are brought up as and when they're part of the story - but it means that everything is supposed to make sense, and the author will attempt to fix anything that doesn't. Though honestly, he's done quite well in that regard and is only occasionally caught in an inconsistency.
