[[/r/HistoryWhatIf]] is I believe the most active subreddit on althistory and you're right that they don't exhibit many of the obvious flaws of other stories. I think a large part of this is due to the focus usually not on an individual but on the world as a whole whereas many stories, shows, anime, etc focus on individuals emotional reactions to world-changing events and their individual decisions regarding them which leads to one, more obvious idiot balls and two, a restricted narrative perspective which causes some creators to limit their choices.
