Generally speaking, alt-history does a lot better than any other sub-genre of speculative fiction. The biggest reason for this is that the authors who have an interest in alt-history also have an interest in history itself, which usually means having a more analytical mind, and often means better exercising empathy for people (because you want to know what life was actually like during the American Revolutionary War, so you go reading soldiers journals instead of imagining them as heroes). If you really care about history, you're less likely to view things in black and white, because you're driven by a need to understand.

Which is not to say that people can't screw it up. /Sometimes/ alt-history is just a way of projecting the author's own personal politics onto a world of their own creation. There's a sub-genre of alt-history where the point of divergence is a group of people getting sent back in time with no hope of return to the future, and often these people are American military, and often the plot and characterization warps itself around how great the American military is.

By and large though, most alt-history novels can be summed up with, "What if /X/?" which tends to make them rule-based, and which in turn tends to push them more toward "rational".
