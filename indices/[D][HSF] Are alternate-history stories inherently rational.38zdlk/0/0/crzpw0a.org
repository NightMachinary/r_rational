My summary of the points of advice in that thread you helpfully linked, from you and others.

One should make sure technology advances beyond the modern day in time travel stories so there can be some excitement, not get too bogged down in the details of logistics.

They should have a wide focus on all of the downstream effects of whatever change, rationally thinking of all the likely consequences.

They can suffer from the average person not being very intelligent or rational in dealing with people. It's hard to write level 2 intelligence characters.
