I don't get the 11/27 reference. Google only gives me math questions, so it's a reference to a typical question in math class?

Hm... I suspect this is not really relevant, but /if/ Joon's level-up provides him with the equivalent of a good night's sleep, then by now his sleeping schedule should be rather screwy. I mean, a big part of the schedule is determined by day length and colouration of the daylight (statistically, you fall easier asleep after a dusk spectrum than a noon spectrum), but you can't neglect the pure length of the day. Just consider it akin to waking up at the hour of Joon's level up. I can't talk about your experiences, but I know I'd have trouble falling asleep after at midnight when I woke up, fully rested, at noon or just after, to give an example.

Of course in this case he was more or less shot just after â€˜waking up', so to speak, and the rest was well-needed.
