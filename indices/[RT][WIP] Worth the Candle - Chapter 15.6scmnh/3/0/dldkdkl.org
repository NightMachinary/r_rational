'If I had to put a number on it' is a common expression. With the 11/27 rather than something normal like a rating out of 10, the joke is that he's not putting a number on it as in the idiom where you make an estimate, he's reading the number for it on his health bar. It's a joke they don't get since only he can see the numbers.
