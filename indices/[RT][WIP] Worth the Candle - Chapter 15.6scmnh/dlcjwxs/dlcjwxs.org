I really like where you're going with all this!

I do feel like I preferred when the flashbacks to the gaming table were spread out; interleaved with the story. It took me a bit to figure it out, but it created this nice impression where the MC's mind is wandering off onto relevant things during the plot downtime. Like; "while all this is going on, this is what's on his mind."
