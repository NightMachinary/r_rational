If you understood the statistical models sufficiently well, you could simply utilize the same data they used, change the assumptions, and come up with a different answer.

The problem with the specific example given is that there may not be a 'real' truth. If two referees are clearly giving more cards to dark-skinned players, that says nothing about the other referees.

What about if a deeper analysis determined that the referees actually seemed to be giving more cards to players with brighter-colored uniforms, and an analysis of those teams determined they had more dark-skinned players. Were the referees just able to see the movements of players in brighter colors better?

Real life scenarios are so much harder to isolate and perform analysis on - especially when you start looking at human reactions. The number of variables can be staggering, and the data extremely difficult to collect accurately.
