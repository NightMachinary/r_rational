Replying here rather than on the [[/r/skeptic]] crosspost. FULL CYNICISM MODE, ENGAGE.

Personally, when I realized I'd blundered my fucking way into an empirical MSc project, I tried to learn statistics. So I ended up taking undergrad Stats 1 and postgrad Machine Learning 1+2ish, and self-learning Bayesian Stats 1. I'm currently, ever so slowly, making progress on Computational Bayesian Stats and, some day, will manage to work through Jaynes' /Probability Theory/ and actually get the fucking point.

Now, what does that avail me in my actual research? /Jack shit./ How do I actually identify a significant result? /However my advisor told me to/, which seemed to primarily involve some very frequentist data-analysis methods he'd picked up over the ages. Did my results really mean all that much? /No./

What methods do I really suggest? /What your conference/journal editors like./

Of course, I was in computer science, which is /unusual/ for its widespread ignorance of and failure to care about statistical rigor in empirical research.
