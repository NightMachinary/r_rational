I didn't say that you couldn't tell if two referees were giving more cards than others, I said that two referees are clearly giving more cards than others. If you don't account for that, it can taint the data for the rest of the referees. How you define and eliminate outliers is important.

Even if you prove that some referees are giving more cards to dark-skinned players than others, you have to also be able to show that they weren't simply refereeing matches where there were larger than normal percentages of dark skinned players playing! (I have no idea how referee choices are made) Some home teams may have far more dark-skinned players than others. A referee who only worked home games for such a team might be perfectly fair, but have a higher card-giving ratio for dark-skinned players simply because their home team was disproportionately dark-skinned.

A lot of studies fail to consider things like this. Just look at all the absurd studies around gun control, both for and against.
