This doesn't apply to Star Trek, but it's an idea I've been playing with...

There's no such thing as an unarmed space ship. In fact, there's no such thing as a space ship that is not a weapon of mass destruction. And when it comes to interstellar flights, there's no such thing as a space ship that can't render an Earth-like planet uninhabitable. Furthermore, such threats are basically impossible to defend against. As a result, there's no such thing as a winnable war between spacefaring civilizations. The typical shape of a war is that one side wipes the other's homeworld, and then the other wipes the first from a hidden base, and the only survivors are those who were in space at the time. Generally not enough to repopulate either race.

If you can't win a war, you need to avoid one. There's diplomacy, cultural and economic ties, hostage exchanges, and threats of retribution. But most importantly there needs to be a culture on both sides that regards war as unthinkably evil.

If a civilization without such a culture developed interstellar travel, the devastation would be vast.

This doesn't happen all that often. It usually takes several centuries to go from fusion bombs to warp drives, and civilizations without peaceful cultures rarely last several centuries with fusion bombs.

/Unless/ someone gives them the technology.

That includes visiting them with no intent to reveal anything, but then getting caught, and one's ship stolen and taken apart.

So contact with pre-peaceful civilizations is extremely restricted.
