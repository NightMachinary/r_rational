I do a fair bit of making - I sew, metalwork, carpet, upholster. I know my way around machine tools. Do you want to know what I know about it? It's slow, and it depends on buying things. A lot.

Feedstock. Chips. Cutting heads, cloth, needles. (.. a stupid amount of needles, actually. When doing fine work / sewing silk, have to use very thin needles. And they bend. Fortunately, they also cost cents..)

Slow matters because if you don't produce life support hardware fast enough, you die. More importantly, this entire thing is a part of that entire industrial web. Not an alternative to it. Believing it to be so is an error. What it is for is art and customization - I can (and do!) pay in time instead of money to have silk lined suits in nice wool that fit, and make shelves that conform exactly to that odd corner. I can't hex silk, wool or teak into existence. Which a colonist on an asteroid cut of from the homeworld would need to do. It isn't just the formal industry that would need to be replaced, its the biological too.
