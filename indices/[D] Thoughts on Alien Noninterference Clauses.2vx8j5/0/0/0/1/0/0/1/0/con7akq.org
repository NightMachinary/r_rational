The historical trend isn't towards ever greater self-sufficiency in production. Rather the opposite, in fact. So what a "more advanced" industrial base means could easily be "We collect 84 % of the sunlight from this star, launch scoops at it for raw materials, employ over 40 billion beings at or above Citizen grade intelligence, and 8492 beings of full Exult class intellect, all to bring you the Jauntatron 90! Get yours today, and get 9 tonnes of antimatter free with purchase" - Ie, starships are out and out cheap, but self-replication? /Howling laughter/ Just.. No. Take the computer you are reading this on - the industrial web that produced it spans the planet, and markets it's products to it, and that scale of operation is vital to making it possible. It's not a trend that's showing any sign whatsoever of reversing.
