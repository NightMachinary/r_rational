"No user serviceable parts" - Starships are ridiculously advanced tech. So is long-term off-home-world life support. And the various medical and cybernetic mods the crew, themselves are using. All of that is going to require a large and very complicated economy to maintain - Far more specialties involved than can fit on a starship. By necessity, it must have the capacity to run on it's own for a minimum of one return trip, but that is almost certainly going to involve consumable supplies that simply cannot be replenished without the aid of someplace with an actual industrial base.
