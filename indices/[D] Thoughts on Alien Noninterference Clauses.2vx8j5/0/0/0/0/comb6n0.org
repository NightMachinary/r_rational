Well, I figure if you've got 10,000 planets (or whatever number you regard as sufficient) then the chances are pretty high that at least one of them would manage to shield against / divert / destroy the inbound WMD(s). Any single planet with a self-sustaining population base will be sufficient for a race to repopulate itself.
