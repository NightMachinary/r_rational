well there is also "the road not taken" explanation. advanced race does not contact others so as to not taint their technological and cultural output. think it on terms like heirloom crops, sure commercial crops yield more food reliably and cheaply but people still value weird unusual fruits and vegetables because they're unique and something you don't see often. I can easily picture elder races monitoring younger sapients and saying "you know that communism thing seems like a neat idea!" or "hey they developed a global network BEFORE reliable atomic power! :D"
