I generally agree that the Prime Directive is not a great idea - I would prefer an established set of procedures for first contact and a detailed set of rules that govern how to deal with a primitive culture in an appropriate way. The amount of caution that Star Fleet (and some other fictional organizations) show is a little bit of cultural skittishness which has historical foundations, and I think they go too far in their caution.
