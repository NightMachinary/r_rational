The prime directive is a fictional reaction to real world colonialism. When it was written, Roddenberry was probably thinking of how the major powers of Europe had royally fucked up Africa and the Americas. If you had posited a show then (or even now) where the technologically advanced society came in and enacted extensive change on a different, less technologically advanced society, it would probably be read in a historical (or even modern) context, where you were taking about British colonists coming to the New World.

It's very easy to say "Oh, well they weren't as smart as us" or some other such thing, but you can see where that sounds like the sort of thing you can't really trust yourself on.
