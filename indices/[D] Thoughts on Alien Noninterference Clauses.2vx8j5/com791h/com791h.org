I've often wondered about that and I've been meaning to look for a specialist's opinion on this subject. While it's prevalence in fiction might be a reaction to colonialism, there are also several real life examples of uncontacted peoples, living in South America, India and New Guinea, and several groups that defend these people should be left alone. Like the OP, my gut instinct has always been that these people would have much to gain from contact with a civilization that's careful not to infect them with viruses they've never gained immunity to and that doesn't attempt to impose on their culture, but like I said, I've yet to look for good arguments on either side of the issue.
