A lot of the damage that the Europeans caused was intentional, as a result of mercantilist policies. Look at opium in China and the divide and conquer strategies and destruction of the textile industry in India. A lot of other damage done by the Europeans was just because of neglect. For the most part, they weren't even trying to improve the livelihood of other countries. Obviously you shouldn't let your civilization's corporations to get anywhere near a less-advanced species (how you would enforce that, even with a prime directive, is another issue). There'd still be a huge risk when getting involved with a less-advanced species but I think it'd be worth it if you could prevent many generations from dying, suffering from disease, etc.
