  How easy to access is the technology?
#+end_quote

The victorian era version is quite simple, if the high failure rate and random nature are acceptable. For the targeted version(s), especially depending on the range you are content with, it's about as difficult as building a good radio from scratch, albeit with different (vague) materials. For making the possession machine, it's about as complicated and difficult to source as building say, a CT scan machine? The knowledge is the hard part to find, the materials themselves are far less important.

#+begin_quote
  Is it really a technology in the sense that it has more applications than described? You have already described two.
#+end_quote

I suppose it isn't much of one. The two different processes are only useful for what they each do, with little application beyond that. (The second process being the posession one, which includes posession, depuppeting, and the detection of puppets, either via trying puppet someone with a tester ghost, or depuppeting someone suspected of being a puppet.)

#+begin_quote
  Again, if it is a technology, does the amount of resources/time spent creating it increase with complexity of the application?
#+end_quote

For contacting the dead, yes. For posessing or de-posessing, no.

#+begin_quote
  I might have misunderstood this part but does the technology summon them from anywhere or does it have to be within a certain range? There are some interesting applications no matter how you answer this.
#+end_quote

Yes, range is a limitation, as is the willingness of the spirit to talk. Significant effort would be needed to get a currently catatonic spirit to accept a "call" and someone unwilling to talk can simply refuse from answering the call outright. For getting a human posessed, it is even more range restricted, requiring the deceased to be within the building.

#+begin_quote
  You only described some simple applications of the technology so I will try to extrapolate a little:
#+end_quote

Only human beings can be posessed. Trying to posess a pregant woman wouldn't posess the child, just the woman. Infants work, I guess? There have not been any animal ghosts observed in the afterlife, and research into whether there is a seperate animal afterlife has been unsucessful.

For ghosts attempting to communicate with one another while in the afterlife, the ease of locating one another and then communicating largely depends on both knowledge of the other's existance, and emotional connections. Husband and wife, mother and child, fellow soldiers, and to an extent simply being coworkers. While posessing humans, they can form those needed emotional bonds which eases communication while back in the afterlife. Ghosts posessing humans cannot see other ghosts by the way, both would need to be out or in at the same time, unless one used the contacting device.

Speaking of the contacting device, it absolutely needs a human being to operate it. The reason is unknown, and the mechanism behind it is also unknown, with theories wondering about whether consciousness is needed for it to function. Electronic and analog devices can record the voices, so a switchboard like affair with one operator managing a few contacting devices is what the arrangement converges to.
