The way I see it, it completely depends on the nature of the technology of communicating with the dead. If I reply to this seriously then I'll end up going through the possibilities one by one listing all the ways it can be solved.

To help out:

- How easy to access is the technology?

- Is it really a technology in the sense that it has more applications than described? You have already described two.

- Again, if it is a technology, does the amount of resources/time spent creating it increase with complexity of the application?

- I might have misunderstood this part but does the technology summon them from anywhere or does it have to be within a certain range? There are some interesting applications no matter how you answer this.

- You only described some simple applications of the technology so I will try to extrapolate a little:

  - Definitely not instantaneous, but as a simple and maybe even secure way to communicate.
  - Do they have the capability to possess animals and are there animal ghosts? There must be a few applications to a yes to this but really this question only makes you flesh out the technology more.
  - You mentioned that ghosts are on different wavelengths in a sense, is it possible to use the tech to make two ghosts the same frequency? If not is it possible to use the tech to create two machines that have the ghosts talk to one another? What is the mechanism used that allows them to speak with the living without possessing?
