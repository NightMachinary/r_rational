If exorcism works than other things may as well. Perhaps finding the Victorian era method of contacting the dead to conduct tests? Like a method of keeping ghosts out of places and then just setting a up meeting places and random locations as keep ghosts out places. Or some ghost repellent for when they're inside of puppets.

Either getting rid of the government's monopoly on ghosts or the ghost's viability as spies is a step in the right direction.
