I think it's been pretty tastefully done so far, which I appreciate. Bunny definitely has some signs of dysphoria that I can relate to, although coming from the other direction. My one 'hope' is that Bunny doesn't magically become better through acceptance of their new body. I know it's cruel to wish that on a character, but that would be the cheap way out in my opinion.

(My opinion may not be the correct opinion, your mileage may vary.)
