I think, after reading Deeprise, that you should be very able to avoid it. Especially with me as a new reader submitting commands I can try and steer it away if need be. :P

I'm not sure what advice I would give right now because I don't want to taint your process too much unnecessarily, so if you have a question feel free to ask I guess?
