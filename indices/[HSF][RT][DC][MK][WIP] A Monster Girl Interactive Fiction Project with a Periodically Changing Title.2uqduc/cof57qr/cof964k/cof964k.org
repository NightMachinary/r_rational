Any advice to avoid it being less authentic in the way you describe would be greatly appreciated. I've become quite aware I'm probably the equivelant of "low potential for dysphoria if you managed to swap my physiology around". For a while this made me upset with stories that were focusing on that aspect of the experience. I've been trying to get a good and authentic model of what that's actually like (among several other aspects I seem to differ from others). The intent of this story is to explore these experiences both from a cultural and personal side of things. But present them initially with premise that 'should' initially make some one with your perspective nervous in exactly the way you describe. And for exactly those reasons.

But I don't want it to devolve into what that fear/nervousness expects. I want to subvert that particular expectation.

The deconstruction is not just monster girls, I'm trying out gender roles, sexism, racism, prejudice in general and a few other things about humans That confuse me.

Again any help making that actually happen will be appreciated.
