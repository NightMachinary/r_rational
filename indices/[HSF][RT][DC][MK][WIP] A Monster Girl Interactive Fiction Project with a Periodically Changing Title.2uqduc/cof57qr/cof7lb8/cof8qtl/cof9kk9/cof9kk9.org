  My one 'hope' is that Bunny doesn't magically become better through acceptance of their new body.
#+end_quote

Bunny may 'accept' her body, in at least a tactical sense, over the available alternatives; but I don't expect her various and varied psychological issues to change because of that.

  it's cruel to wish that on a character
#+end_quote

To a large extent, writing is mostly about being cruel to the characters. If nothing bad happens to the protagonist, then where's the story?
