  CelestAI has nothing in common with Cthulhu, where does that comparison even come from?

When the original stories of the Cthulhu mythos were written, we knew little enough about how the universe worked that the many-angled ones sleeping in cities deep in the Pacific, Hounds of Tindalos running through time, and our own evolutionary background including the option of turning into fishy non-humans were within the realm of possibility. Today, we've sat-mapped the ocean floors, pinned down a lot more about physics and the unlikelihood of FTL signalling, and know of the existence of DNA... and yet it's still possible that someone who figures out the wrong incantation will call up an intelligence vastly greater than our own, with values we don't share, who will change us into whatever it sees fit as it arranges the universe to its making. The fact that one such being's public face has squiggly tentacles and the other a flowing mane and horn are mere trifles.
