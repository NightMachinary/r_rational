Have you read /The Laundry Files/ series by Charles Stross? The intersection of computer science with the Lovecraftian is something he explored a lot. I think only he and Greg Egan have ever published anything in the mathematical cosmic horror genre; not surprising, it's a bit of a niche.

Either that's where you're getting the idea from, or you think very similarly to him and you'll enjoy the books.
