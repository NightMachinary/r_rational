Nevertheless, there's something to be said for the deep-seated "oh /crap/" you feel when you realize something really heavy-duty is coming out to play. It doesn't have to be something "rationalist", but those are examples of things that would send most rationalist screaming if they saw them even hinted.

The moment in religious horror when someone makes contact with a demon is similar, as is the moment in fanfic when you realize they're about to encounter something extremely bad from canon. It's the horror of /implications/.

No idea if that's "the" Rational Horror, but it's certainly /a/ Rational Horror.

(CelestAI is Cosmic Horror - when played for horror, and done well - as is Cthulu; but beyond that they have very little in common I can see.)
