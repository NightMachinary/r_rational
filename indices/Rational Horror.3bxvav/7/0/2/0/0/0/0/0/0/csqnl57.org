I'm reminded of the original poster here, and the implications of the Fermi Paradox are probably good fodder for rational horror: In the entire universe, no other sapient species has ever arisen; we're the only people in all of existence, and if we do something wrong and kill ourselves off, that's probably it for sapience /ever/... and thousands of times more people pay attention to (insert pop culture item here) than any individual existential risk that might kill us all off, let alone are trying to think of any solutions.

Or: Imagine that both Heaven and Hell were destroyed... by some jocks just being good ol' boys blowing **** up.
