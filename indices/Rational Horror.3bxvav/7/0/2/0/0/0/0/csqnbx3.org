The mane and horn are trifles - the fact that they can be generated by computers running on the laws of physics we have very good reason to believe are accurate is the difference I was trying to highlight. We aren't going to find R'lyeh in a submarine; genetic analysis of New England populations isn't going to reveal hidden chromosomes for gills; we've gathered enough evidence to introduce the Fermi Paradox instead of considering the possibility of a race of sapient fungi in Earth's prehistoric past.
