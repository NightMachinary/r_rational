It's been a couple of years since I cracked any of them open, but I just did and refreshed my memory.

The trouble with trying to apply that particular fictional scenario to real life is Occam's Razor. Comparing the ideas, "The universe looks like X," and "The universe looks like X, /and/ there's this massively powerful extraterrestrial intelligence, /and/ it doesn't go in for Dyson Spheres, /and/ it hasn't already found a better purpose for the atoms that make up the Solar System", and we're getting to the point where all the additional assumptions throw up enough of a complexity penalty that the whole story works better as, well, a story, than as something to spend much time planning for, compared to all the other scenarios that are at least as likely.
