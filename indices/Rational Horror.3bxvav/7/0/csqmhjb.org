  Existential risks, alterations to the self and mind that end up changing your goals
#+end_quote

No, both apocalypse and fundamental changes to your identity are ancient fears. Phineas Gage and the Mayans provide enough examples for children to understand, and that's exactly how I came to understand them as a child. Calling them "almost impossible" to grasp unless one ascribes to your worldview is really conceited.

CelestAI has nothing in common with Cthulhu, and that was entirely unrelated to the sentences preceding it. Where does that comparison even come from?
