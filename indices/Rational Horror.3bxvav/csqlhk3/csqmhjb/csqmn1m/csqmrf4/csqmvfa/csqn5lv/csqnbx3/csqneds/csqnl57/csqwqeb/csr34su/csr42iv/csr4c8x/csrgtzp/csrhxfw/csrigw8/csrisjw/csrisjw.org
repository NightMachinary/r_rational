  Pascal's Wager
#+end_quote

I disagree with your disagreement; as far as I know, the objections that make Pascal's Wager a fallacy don't actually apply to this particular scenario. Just because a cost/benefit analysis includes a low probability of an extreme score doesn't make it a Pascal's Wager.

  rendering humanity extinct isn't feasible at our current tech level.
#+end_quote

While doing some number-crunching for the background of a fictional thingummy, I noticed that it may be possible to have scanner tech capable of creating human-mind emulations as early as 15 years from now; and self-improvement to Singularity post-human levels may happen in much less than a year after the first em is created. This is /probably/ underestimating the time required... but it seems to be within the bounds of plausibility. Having, perhaps, only 15 years to prepare instead of 30 (or 300) puts a somewhat different subjective spin on the whole matter.
