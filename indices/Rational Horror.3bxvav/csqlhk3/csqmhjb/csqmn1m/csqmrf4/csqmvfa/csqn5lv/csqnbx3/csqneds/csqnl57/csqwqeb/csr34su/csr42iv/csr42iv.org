Hm, you're right. Looks like I originally encountered / understood it wrong. Thanks for the correction.

My point stands: it seems vanishingly unlikely that we are the only form of life, and the only form of sapience, that will ever evolve in the lifetime of the universe. That's a /very/ long time in which to assert that something categorically will not happen.
