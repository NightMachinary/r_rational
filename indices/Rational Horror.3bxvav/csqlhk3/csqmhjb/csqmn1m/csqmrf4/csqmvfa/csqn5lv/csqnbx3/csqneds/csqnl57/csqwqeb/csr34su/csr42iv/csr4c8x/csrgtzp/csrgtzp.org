  Think less in terms of the lifetime of the universe, and more in terms of the duration of the Stelliferous Age, and the extrapolation from the current data may look a tad more reasonable. :)

Not really, no. The Stelliferous Age is cosmological decade 40 < n < 100. It's logarithmic; each decade is 10x the length of the previous one. We are currently in decade 69.

  Or, from another point of view; say that, with some set of data, the most accurate possible conclusion is that there's precisely a 5% chance that no other sapience will evolve should humanity go extinct. How willing would you be you to gamble on that 5%?
#+end_quote

Do you have such a data set?

Your motte appears to be "humanity is precious and it would be bad if we went extinct." I agree with that, of course. Your bailey -- that no other intelligence will ever exist -- I do not agree with.
