That's only /one/ version of the Great Filter. There are a number of points in the evolutinoary chain which the GF might be: kickstrating life in the first place, or the development of complex eukaryotic cells, or multicellular organisms, or the development of sex to speed up development, or the development of a neural architecture that has even a chance at sapience, and so on; all the way up to "blows themselves up before they make it out of the Solar System".

Given our current knowledge, the GF could be at any point. The more knowledge we gather about the lifelessness of the universe, the more likely it is the GF is earlier in that sequence. At the moment, given there's no positive evidence of extraterrestrial life, I currently conclude that the GF is more likely before the development of sapience than after it.
