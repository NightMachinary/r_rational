My intended bailey is that there is /some/ significant, non-zero probability that if humanity goes extinct, no further sapience will ever develop; and that given the evidence we have, there is some particular value that can be assigned to that proposition.

The tricky part is that, as far as I can determine, almost by definition, the existence of sapience is required for there to be any minds capable of assigning any value to anything, so the existence of sapience is required for the universe to have /any/ value; and thus, the permanent and complete /lack/ of sapience is as close to having infinite negative utility as can be imagined; which means that even relatively small chances of that state happening are to be avoided with as much effort as feasible.
