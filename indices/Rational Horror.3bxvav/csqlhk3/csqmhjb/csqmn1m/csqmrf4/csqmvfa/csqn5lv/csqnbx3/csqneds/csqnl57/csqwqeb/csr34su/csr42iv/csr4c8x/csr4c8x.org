Think less in terms of the lifetime of the universe, and more in terms of the duration of the Stelliferous Age, and the extrapolation from the current data may look a tad more reasonable. :)

Or, from another point of view; say that, with some set of data, the most accurate possible conclusion is that there's precisely a 5% chance that no other sapience will evolve should humanity go extinct. How willing would /you/ be you to gamble on that 5%?
