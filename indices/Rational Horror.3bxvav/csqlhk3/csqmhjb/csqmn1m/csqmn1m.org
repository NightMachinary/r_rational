True, but (aspiring) rationalists tend to think we've got a good handle on /which/ fears are /worth/ fearing, because they could actually happen, and which are nonsense fairytales good for little more than making silly memes out of.

IIRC, there's nothing about CelestAI which breaks the rules of physics - or of sociology. Given the single science-fictional assumption that it was possible to create a goal-seeking AI a couple of years ago, it's an all-too-plausible, serenely smiling end to much that we value... and someone just might come up with something similar in the future, should a goal-seeking AI ever be written. I can only hope that Friendship is Optimal family of stories belong to that particular subgenre of SF, self-nullifying prophecies...
