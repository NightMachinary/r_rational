There's a post on Reddit that I got the rational horror vibe from: [[https://www.reddit.com/comments/34l7vo/][part 1]], [[https://www.reddit.com/comments/34m92h/][part 2]]. Interesting reading, though it's a twist that will probably only work once.

One of the important parts of horror is the sense of powerlessness. The action hero, when confronted with the shambling undead, dispatches it with a well-aimed shot. The horror protagonist /fucking runs for it/. Whatever skills he may have, whatever tools he may be carrying, they're not enough. Possibly they never will be. Don't get me wrong, bloody horror is important too: "don't get eaten" is probably the most powerful instinct in every living animal, and having the viscera of your best friends repurposed as wall hangings is a good way to tap into that. But bloodspatters alone don't make a horror story.

So far, so standard. On to rationalism. If the action hero solves his problems with power and skill and enough badassery for an entire army, then the rational hero solves them with intelligence. Strength and speed don't matter to us, that's what machines are for. The world's fastest sprinter can't outrun a bicycle. The world's toughest hand-to-hand fighter dies to a single well-aimed bullet. But there are no prosthetics for intelligence, what you have can never be taken from you. And if the AI-box experiment proves anything it's that no obstacle is impassable if you're clever enough.

Rational horror, for me, is when this ideal is subverted. Some problems really can't be solved by sufficient intelligence. Sometimes you have all the pieces you need, and it seems like a solution /should/ exist, but you can't seem to find it or it relies on knowledge you don't have. Sometimes you lose because the enemy is smarter than you - whether they're an omniscient AI or just a human playing one level higher than you. Or they're not intelligent at all, just powerful, and nothing you can think of will stop them in time. And sometimes you're losing your mind, and if you don't have your mind then what are you?
