I can imagine a story where the protagonists seemingly solve a puzzle, leaving a happy ending, but there's a note at the end, telling the reader to think carefully about what was hinted in the story, revealing the actual narrative.

Alternately, a story where the protagonists do everything /right/. But it's not enough. An entire story where it looks like they're succeeding, but in the end, they examine their every action, and realize that there's nothing they could have done differently, and they're still going to die.

Or a story about a malicious entity that can intelligently warp reality such that rational enquiry and action is the wrong choice, even when you try to take the entity into account.

Or a rational horror story from the perspective of the antagonists, acting rationally towards their goal. Not in a way that makes them sympathetic, even if they're understandable. In a way that makes you want the victims to win.
