FWIW, I definitely got chills during Metropolitan Man at this line:

#+begin_quote
  "Why do you exist, Floyd? Did God have any purpose in mind when He created you, other than to test me?"
#+end_quote

That was my favorite line in the story, not because of how scary Superman was in that moment, but because of the implications about how Superman was thinking/feeling at that moment and what that might imply for humanity going forward. Definitely a fear reaction in that moment for me.
