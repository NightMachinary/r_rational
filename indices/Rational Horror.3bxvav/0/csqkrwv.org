You'd need to first define horror. If you mean "something that provokes a fear reaction" then I think there's a case to be made for rational horror as "thinky horror". As to what that means ...

Maybe it means that the horror comes from knowing. If rational fiction is a puzzle that the reader is meant to solve, then rational horror is a puzzle whose solution leaves your blood running cold, and the more you work through the "math" as it were, the more the story provokes that fear reaction. This would be in contrast to a fear reaction mostly driven by surprise, like the jump scare, horror which relies on a revelatory twist, or "squick factor" horror.

If I had to list out things that I think are /rationally/ frightening, which provoke a fear response in me that I can't make better with more thought or help with aversion therapy ... loss of control and obliteration of the self are two of the big ones. I'm afraid of deep water and needles, but those aren't /thinky/ fears. Losing my mind is a thinky fear, as, I think, are most existential fears. Lose of choice (or negation of choice) is another.

(For what it's worth, I've been told that both [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man][/Metropolitan Man/]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9915682/1/The-Last-Christmas][/The Last Christmas/]] have provoked a not-entirely-unintended fear reaction in some people. I am somewhat curious how much this can be generalized to the larger group of people that read them. I wouldn't call either of them rational horror though, because the point wasn't primarily to horrify.)
