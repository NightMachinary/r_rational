  I can imagine a story where the protagonists seemingly solve a puzzle, leaving a happy ending, but there's a note at the end, telling the reader to think carefully about what was hinted in the story, revealing the actual narrative.

The way to do this would be to have a very short "epilogue" that reveals a piece of information that can't be fit into the supposed narrative. Offhand, I can't think of any cases where this has been done in writing, but I know a few TV episodes that end on a shot of a supposedly dead character plotting their comeback.
