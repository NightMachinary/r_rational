I think the most terrifying SF I've read has been written by John Barnes. There's a short story in his collection Apocalypses & Apostrophes, and the fourth book of his Thousand Cultures series, The Armies Of Memory, has a terrifying sequence. (Unusually, that series started off incredibly weak and got stronger; I'm glad I stuck with it, since #4 was great. These days I'd give up.) Both are more horrifying, not less, the more you understand the nature of the threat.
