I'd also posit a third category, which is physical horror. Sometimes things are scary just because they're things we instinctively fear, even absent any suspense or surprise. Spiders are scary. Snakes are scary. They can be made /more/ scary with surprise or suspense, but you can scare someone with them even without having to use those. (I am somewhat reminded of the Little Albert experiment, where a boy was taught to fear fluffy white things through classical conditioning.)
