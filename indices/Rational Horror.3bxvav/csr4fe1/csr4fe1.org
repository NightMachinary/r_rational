First, consider the difference between suspense and a jump scare.

Some movies are scary because they deal with subjects that have terrible consequences and implications. Some movies are scary because suddenly there's a screaming thing in your face through abrupt transition.

Scary rationalist fiction should come about as the slow assembling of facts and reasoning. Flicker goes on a plasma dance through time zones to make the sun appear to rise and set on beat to the music. The engineers find it beautiful and confusing. While a cold nauseous terrified trembling tightens the throats and sinks the stomachs of the physicists.

I release a (perfectly?) reflective marble from my hand, apparently the same as any other highly polished ball bearing or mirrored glass sphere. Upon leaving contact with my fingers, it fails to fall towards the ground. In fact, it seems to have become completely immobile to any forces - and yet it maintains relative position. Begin generating hypotheses as to what the hell it is I have done or can do, and what that implies about your safety if this effect is applied in other ways.
