Yes, I should elaborate. The first is just a standard horror film with protagonists that aren't feckless nitwits. [Wild Hunt] is about the only example of this I've ever seen so I'm not even sure it can be called a genre. The second is the type of thing alexanderwales is talking about further up. Things that are abstractly horrible in an 'I have no mouth and I must scream' kind of sense.

While not /necessarily/ exclusive I've not seen the two put together beforehand.
