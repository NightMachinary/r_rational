Looks like there's two categories here. Horror stories with rational-ish characters that make decent decisions and die anyway, and then there's the more cerebral existential horror where truly awful things are happening because the system (either sociological or artificial) is imperfect.

The first is so absurdly rare that you might as well go for the second. I can count the number of horror films I've seen with reasonable protagonists on the fingers of one hand.
