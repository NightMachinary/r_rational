Rational horror is the unknown becoming exposed.

Reality is slowly and imperfectly informing the characters about the world around them, a world that makes a terrible sense once you know enough about it. There is no ultimately benevolent hand of fate, no innately malevolent forces plotting against our reality, only powerful chains of cause and effect surfacing like the tip of an iceberg.

The characters in a rational horror story aren't paper cutouts, ready to feed themselves into the hungry maw of the world because of their sinful flaws, but are the surviving result of millions of years of harsh evolution. They'll go down hard--kicking, screaming, and scheming all the way. Or suddenly, and for no /readily apparent/ reason.

Even though the world has underlying rules that are consistent and logical, rational horror needs to be something that appears beyond understanding and control, at least at first. To the characters and the reader, there need to be unknowns.

--------------

One last point. The stakes aren't what makes a rational horror story. All too often, the assumption is that everything needs to be going quite literally to hell for it to be a rational story as well as horror. That is not a requirement, or even desireable.

Hunting down a bank robber (in and of itself) isn't a rational horror story because, despite being rooted in real-world risks and drama, the elements are well known. Banks, robbers, and the processes involved on all sides are all understood. Even if it gets really Quentin Tarantino, that isn't a horror story.

Hunting down a thief who is stealing toenails from people in public places, using unknown techniques, for unknown purposes is the seed of a horror story--even if no one dies or seems very badly threatened.

In the rational horror story, there is a promise that the world makes sense, but also that you've really misunderstood or are missing some information--not merely that some old god with a cool backstory we've now exhaustively explored is going to eat the world.
