Aerb isn't the Harry Potter magical world. The biggest thing that will come up when Amaryllis reads up on Earth is that she'll be amazed by the lack of catastrophes. "If we went to war with [Russia], it would probably kill everything" is really cute when Aerb really did have a thermonuclear war, and it ended up with nukes being excluded.

Earth has advantages in the form of plastics and electronics, and everything else is inferior, at parity, or blocked by some aspect of Aerb. (And possibly plastics aren't on Aerb because they don't have petroleum.)

- Intercontinental flight - Worse than teleporting, plus dragons\\
- Global Communication - They've also got global communication\\
- Vaccines - Worse than Aerb medical magic\\
- Luxuries - We haven't seen Aerb be any worse than Earth\\
- Wealth of Information to anyone - Not an advantage in a world where knowledge is literally power, and power keeps killing billions\\
- Lack of monarchies - Aerb is superior if you live in a world where levels and stats are real, and arguably democracy is similarly untenable in said world\\
- Orbital Mechanics - A cute but useless endeavor on a flat planet\\
- Traveling to the moon - They already did that with an entire population\\

We've got arguably a better economy (although they've got some post-scarcity stuff going on) and better electronics, but Aerb isn't full of backwards rubes.
