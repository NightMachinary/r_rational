For a number of your points, the results that Aerb have accomplished may be better, but I wouldn't say that the achievements are comparable. Intercontinental travel on Earth is accomplished through massive engines that push our knowledge of material science, aerodynamics, and mechanical engineering to their limits. These engines represent millions of man hours of testing, design, and analysis from some extremely smart people. On Aerb, some guy made these magic things one day, in a feat that no one can replicate, and now you can teleport. It's a similar story for vaccines, and space travel. The medical magic is more comparable to medical science, but I don't get the impression that they are siginificantly refining their knowledge of the field over time. Not to the same degree, at least.

Does Aerb have global (or whatever the adjective is when the world isn't a globe) communication at decent speeds? They have radio, but I can't remember a time when messages have been sent across the world.

I'm not sure what youre saying about your point on monarchies. Joon and co. are the only ones who have to deal with levels and stats.
