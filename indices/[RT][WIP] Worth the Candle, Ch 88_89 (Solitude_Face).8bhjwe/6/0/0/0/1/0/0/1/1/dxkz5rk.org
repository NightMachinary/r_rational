Digging around, here's a response from the author on higher tiers:

#+begin_quote
  The problem with higher tiers is that I don't really have much more to give. I'm actually not quite writing as fast as I can, given that I still watch television and read books, and occasionally pump a few thousand words (or a half hour of editing) into other projects, but I really don't want to suffer burnout, nor promise that some of the other works I have brewing will come to fruition.

  I suppose that I could offer acknowledgements or cameos or something. Actually, probably not cameos given that I have a problem with money dictating art, even in ways that don't quite matter to the text itself.

  I'll have to take a look at what other people are doing, I guess. Let me know if you have any suggestions.

And my response:

  I saw your front page post saying you're not offering goals; I didn't mean higher tiers with rewards but adding extra tiers as a kind of decision simplicity (a bit late but I just checked and patrons can write-in a higher pledge amount). The higher tiers don't strictly need to come with progressively better rewards (e.g. [[https://www.patreon.com/user?u=4240617][pirateaba]] of The Wandering Inn).

  Or work with creative rewards. I'm thinking something like the pastebin you linked of one of your past campaigns. Presumably you have a huge archive of those and if they're not private or too spoilery for WtC, worldbuilding geeks, aspiring DMs and such might appreciate them. Tangentially, I've been feeling it's a shame WtC doesn't have a banner on topwebfiction despite being in the top 15. Perhaps there could be a tier where some of the money can go to commissioning art or book covers and those patrons can vote on...whatever.

By decision simplicity, I meant something along the same lines as [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8882ln/rt_worth_the_candle_ch_8687_headdown/dwjxz6l/][the post I linked]]. There are surely patrons who would pledge more, but one tier gives the illusion of one choice.

I really like pirateaba's system of funneling patrons to the "reasonable" tier of $5 and offering them the satisfying reward of reading one chapter early (and voting on side stories). It's the only tier with a reward, and anything higher is just the generosity of patrons who want to give more (and a snazzy Discord channel tier). Practically no additional effort besides setting up a place for Patrons to access the latest chapter and it's much more attractive as a purchase perk if updates are frequent/consistent.
