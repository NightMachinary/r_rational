Probably i should preface all of my stuff with this is one of the better stories i read and i was super glad that i found it and maybe post less, since it stresses him out.

I believe in alternative explanations. Really, amount of my responses made it seem like it's a bigger deal than it is.

  In all of your examples, there is no narrative reason to mention the dragon union without going off into a world-building tangent

Yes, this would be true, but it's explained in a short 6 sentence paragraph that could have been anywhere. It feels like and late addition doesn't mean it is.

If i just suddenly said, well, actually i wrote a similar, but total different story in my days, but i wasn't satisfied with it, so that's why i'm so critical - you would probably react with - You wrote paragraph upon paragraph of complains and questions and you only mentions this now, frankly seems like a stretch. - *This is just an example by the way, i never wrote a similar or any kind of story that i can remember*

I wouldn't even notice it if it wasn't in focus so much. I noticed it because of this sentences.

  I was supposed to fly that helicopter. Narrative convention dictates that I was supposed to fly that helicopter, I have a fucking very specific skill in my backstory, mentioned to both of you, and what the hell, I don't get to fly the helicopter? This is garbage. There wasn't even a fight.

  Also, there was no doubt in my mind that we were going to have to fight a dragon at some point, but that thankfully seemed like it was going to be a long time coming.

Yep, that's exactly one exception of the word dragon being used when talking about the world of Aerb. I fact 5-6 aka 1/3rd of the word "dragon" used is in that small paragraph.

  There's a difference between your perception of missing world-building (subjective) and an actual world-building hole (objective)
#+end_quote

Well, my other perspective is, a lot of of the world building, character powers and item powers placement in the story is rather unfortunate, so it seems like it's too conveniently\inconveniently placed. I still think the problem is the story takes routes in the D&D adventure so it comes with it's strengths (building on the fly, changeability, adaptability) and it's weaknesses (weak connections between places, imbalance of powers that is hard to address, ways of solving conflict)
