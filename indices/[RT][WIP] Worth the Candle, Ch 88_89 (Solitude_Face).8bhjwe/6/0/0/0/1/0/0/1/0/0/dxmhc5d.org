I will mention these suggestions to him - I am actually his wife and am going to try and take over some of these things, like Patreon managing and whatnot.

I think more tiers are definitely an idea we will move on, although deciding on what rewards they come with will be tricky. I think possibly giving access to the next chapter a day before it goes on AO3 would be good, but he is concerned about segmenting his audience and the discussions.

He has a website already and it wouldn't be too much work to add WtC to it, possibly as a subdomain so that it could have its own branding/theme.
