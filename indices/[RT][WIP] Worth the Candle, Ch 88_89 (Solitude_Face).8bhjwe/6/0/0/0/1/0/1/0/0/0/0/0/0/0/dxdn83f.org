It's an empty preface when the rest are complaints. Maybe it's best to come to terms with the fact that the actual story won't be tailored to your idealized vision of how this story should be. I don't recall you ever entertaining alternative explanations - your posts are unfailingly railroading your list of gripes (occasionally organized like a backseat-writing agenda). And forget being an author- I'm only a reader and it's been frustratingly tedious explaining why your points are usually your personal opinion or reading of the text - which is hard when you're always presenting them with such conviction/aggression, like you can't possibly be wrong (your post to CRJ above was almost unbelievably arrogant and condescending if you didn't already have a track record for that tone).

I don't quite follow the rest of your post since most of it is quite rambling, but you predictably replied like I described:

  When people respond to your long-winded critiques, I might be misremembering but I don't believe you ever acknowledge their points but instead repackage your criticism, often into something else that annoys you.

I think I decisively pointed out why your points were silly and you twist it to why you think telling a story using a D&D frame has weaknesses. Cue eyeroll. Relax, get off the backseat-writing high horse, and enjoy the story for what it is.
