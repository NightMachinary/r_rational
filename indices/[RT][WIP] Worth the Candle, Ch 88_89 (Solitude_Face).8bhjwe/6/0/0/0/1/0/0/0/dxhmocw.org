I don't have a ranking of readers, but if I did, you'd definitely be in the top five.

A lot of the criticism I get stings, but is nonetheless helpful, or at least confirms my own understanding of what problems I've been running into. When I write I'm usually /really/ close to the work, and unable to see how it looks from the outside; I've posted chapter thinking "ugh, that was garbage" only to have people say that they loved it, or I've been anxious about whether it was any good only to get great feedback. Sometimes stuff like "this scene didn't have clear enough or high enough stakes" hits me like an epiphany, and I instantly realize what the problem I'd been having was, I just hadn't been able to figure it out because I was mired in trying to use the wrong methods to fix the uneasy feeling I had.

... and then there are other kinds of feedback that are just negative without offering anything, or which come down to disagreements about what the story should be, or which point at trade-offs that I decided to make and just say "hey, there was a downside to that trade-off", which I already knew. Or people who just say "kinda garbage, didn't get past ch 11, don't understand why people like this", and logically, this is someone for whom the story didn't work, but it still kind of hurts to get rejected like that, even when you weren't trying. And yeah, some people are just assholes; I've gotten PMs from people that just wanted to let me know how much they disliked me personally for writing a story they didn't like.

I think there's a limited amount of negativity that I want to let into my life, and that's why I've scaled back on reading and replying to comments, which I never did all that much to begin with. I don't want to dissuade people from giving feedback, even if it's negative, especially in a public place where it's meant for other readers or community members, not me. It's more the tone and form of some of that feedback that gets to me, which I'd rather not subject myself to.
