Hi [[/u/Ace_Kuper]]. Your opinion here is pretty obvious; and you're entitled to have it and to explain it.

However, we also have a rule "Keep [[/r/rational]] pleasant (and on-topic)", and the extent of your criticism is pushing up against that line. Why not just accept that other people will enjoy stuff that you don't like, and skip over it? There's just no need for an argument and nothing at stake here except for the community :)
