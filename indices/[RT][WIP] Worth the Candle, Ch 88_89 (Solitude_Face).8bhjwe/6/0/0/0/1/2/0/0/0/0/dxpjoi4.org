I'm glad that you are trying to improve your interactions and communications. I hope that you reach (and pass!) a point where your posts become well-received instead if causing people frustration, but would like to point out that doing so definitely will take introspection.

Separetely, I hope to change your mind on the following (and though it might be humorously self-referential, I intend it as a serious point: you seem to think that it is futile to fully change your mind when presented with conflicting arguments

It is rational to update your beliefs in the face of new evidence! Sure, many things are a matter of personal preference (and I admit that maybe those are the only matters you were speaking of, here), but being willing and able to change your opinions in a way that invalidates your previous ones can be highly valuable and respected, depending on the circumstances!
