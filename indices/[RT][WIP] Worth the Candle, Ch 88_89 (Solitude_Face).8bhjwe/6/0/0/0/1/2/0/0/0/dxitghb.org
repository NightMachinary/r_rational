Since this unrelated i guess i can post here and it would be fine.

In some of my posts i mention that i'm trying to improve. That's the reasoning to post here in the first place. It's really hard to discern tone on the internet. That's why i'm always baffled by the fact that people think i'm making fun of them or being condescending.

I write my long essay like paragraph for that exact to avoid that confusion, so that my points are explained in detail and reason for their existence is provided to the best of my effort. The worst tone i intend to convey is "Really, i don't see it like that" or "Sure, but i don't buy this explanation" or "I'm kinda doubtful". I want it to be "sassy" at worst.

I fully admit that my points especially in the early posts are kinda of a structural mess, they are probably full of typos and read like a direct mind transmission on to paper. That's why i tried to structure them more, cause someone gave that advice. Next step was to limit the number of points i bring up.

I can't really do anything about the complaint of "you act like you are right". Well, that's why i try to be detailed as to why i believe in what i believe and if i didn't think it was true to some extent why would i bother talking about it in the first place. (see already a repeat of my earlier point) I change my opinion on some stuff or somewhat, but it can't be a straight 180, otherwise i didn't have that opinion in the first place and was posting to only pointlessly say "this is bad or this is good". I'm not going to 100% agree with people, but neither should they. Thanks to some feedback i started organizing my posts somewhat better, even test posting them somewhere else to see how the formatting is, they are still a mess, but i'm slightly better at it.

Funny enough i found another, this time pretty small question to ask people about, but i will not do that, cause i promised to not ruin stuff for others. Most of my questions carried intent of "How do improve if i was an author or people i interact with would do it in their work", because i think a lot stuff in this story is world prime material for munchkinry and i would not want it to exist in those obvious ways, cause it breaks immersion in some aspects. This is the selfish aspect of my posts.
