One pathology of government is that there is no limit on how cruel or absurd (or even inconvenient to the state) punishments can be --- politicians can almost always gin up some support by suggesting ever crueler and more labyrinthine penalties. Anglecynn has a weird system of government, but I can imagine someone suggesting the drops in the Risen Lands as part of a “Tough on Crime” campaign.
