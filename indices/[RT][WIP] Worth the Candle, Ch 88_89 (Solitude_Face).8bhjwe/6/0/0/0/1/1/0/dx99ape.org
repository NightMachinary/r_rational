It's not really that dragons attack. You can run the numbers; there are five hundred dragons, and the surface area of Aerb is ten times that of Earth, which means that it's like fifty dragons holding the entirety of Earth's airspace. Each would be responsible for about four million square miles, or about a square about two thousand miles to a side.

The /individual/ odds of an aircraft being attacked by a dragon are, therefore, low, so it's not really a "don't fly or you will be struck from the air by a dragon" type of thing, it's more "an aircraft needs to fly pretty much every day, full of passengers, for three years, in order to pay for itself, which means 13,000 hours in the air before it's turning a profit. If the odds of a dragon attack are greater than 1/13,000 per hour, then planes are unlikely to make a profit. (And obviously a plane crash isn't just a matter of not being able to make a profit on a plane anymore, there are significant expenses involved in clean-up and liability, which can be handled by insurance schemes, but almost increase time-to-payoff for someone building or buying an airplane for commercial travel.)

But the dragons /don't/ really attack, they have a regulatory agency that constricts air travel to within certain quotas, times, and places, with various penalties for infraction going all the way up to "a dragon notices and destroys the plane and everyone onboard" (though it's more "one of the reporting apparatuses notices and informs a dragon" than a dragon actually noticing). All of that results in a chilling effect on aviation -- but not an actual /halt/ to aviation.
