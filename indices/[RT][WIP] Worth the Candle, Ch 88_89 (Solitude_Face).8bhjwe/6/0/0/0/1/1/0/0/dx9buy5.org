Hmm this is a very good explanation- I had not considered simply how few dragons were around. It also justifies the use of helicopters in the two cases seen. But why would they do the trial by adversity at the risen lands, since there is no little value there, compared to simple execution? After all, if only one in 100 people make it back, the Host isn't getting much value out of the sure drops.

Naturally, this isn't as much of a concern if dragons need to take substantial amounts of time arriving to an illegal flight- short, unscheduled flights will be back on the ground before a dragon can chase them down, and presumably ground based defense can take a dragon down at some level
