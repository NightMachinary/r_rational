Sure, only no one even mentioned the Dragons when chapter upon chapter Juniper talked about him knowing how to fly a helicopter and wanted to take one as a trophy, no matter how absurd that was.

Also, the story opens up with our hero dropping from a plane. Why would government waste precious "negotiate with dragons for a long time to fly anything" chance to dispose of criminals for little to no gain? It was kinda stretching the believability on it's own, but revealing dragons 80 chapters in only made me question every instance of the flight tech used in the series.

Edit: There are other mechanics\aspect that appear as a problem\challenge\motivation when get dropped as conveniently as they were introduced. Is more the case of i see how the world is build as we see it, which is not a problem on itself, but aspect start to contradict each other so the plot could progress or the party finds a macguffin that circumvents very specific thing that was the crux of the previous couple of chapters. I'm reluctantly wait for one of those things to become way to noticeable and hope it doesn't happen. For me train chapter was very obviously written the way it was because it would not work otherwise.
