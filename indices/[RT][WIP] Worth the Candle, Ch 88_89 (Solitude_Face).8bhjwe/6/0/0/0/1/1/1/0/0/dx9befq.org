Juniper had chance to fly. Amarilys was flying with the Anuman, they were chased by 5-6 helicopters. The amount of times and technology used is my problem with that. Also, he could have easily said "Dragons are a problem in this particular part of the world", but blanket statement of they are a huge problem for this world that is 10(?) times bigger than Earth, while dragon population is extremely low makes me question it.
