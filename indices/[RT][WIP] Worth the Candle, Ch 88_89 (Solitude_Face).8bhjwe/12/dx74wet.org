Various thoughts- (warning - I'm a munchkin)

Sounds like Kuum Doona is not the best permanent base after all. "Tiff" seems unstable at best. If they could win her over it would be OK, but I think Amaryllis is a lost cause.

On a related note (from chapter one), CHA: Charm - How much people like you. Used to convince princesses, barter with barmaids, or plead for your life. LOL, nice use of "princess" instead of "party members". That said, I betcha that if Joon had more SOC, he would not have had any trouble using the chamber for free or having unfettered access to the fortress.

It's increasingly clear to me that MEN/magic is the thing to focus on, for a few reasons

- In general, having many different schools of physical combat is not so useful: you can't take advantage of your axe skills and bow skills at the same time, and trying to switch between them incurs a cost. However, each magic can (in general) be switched between seamlessly. Likewise, each magic taps from a different resource (although some, such as Gem, are distasteful). Still and Revision magic seem especially useful for survivability.
- Soon, 2-3 party members will have Symbiosis, so simply having the ability to use the bone magic+essentialism trick gives them a huge advantage
- It makes the party far less predictable: nobody expects the bow expert to have crazy magic skills, too.

On a related note, you really need to unlock and level as many magical skills as possible to take advantage of its potential. This is likely actually quite easy, and the party is likely to finally have the time to do it once Solace brings the locus back. In the simplest case, you just teleport into the city for the appropriate athenaum. Creep around and find an unwitting subject who's out for a night of drinking. From here, the options are endless!

- "I'm writing a novel with a water mage in it. I'd like to have a realistic training sequence... care to show me just the very first exercise you were ever taught? That's all I need, and I could make it worth your while"
- Hire a water mage for some petty task. Establish rapport in doing so. After all is done, offer more money to get a 10sec lesson.
- (act drunk, or be drunk) "Dude, my friend's totttaaallllyyy full of himself. He says he can pick up a bit of any magic just by trying the first exercise for a second or two... Wanna help us settle a bet? I'll give you $10k when I win ;-)"
- Creepy games involving using soul magic to copy the appearance of their best friend, seducing them, applying the fools choker on them, temporarily modifying values, etc
- And then just pack up ASAP and teleport to a new city. For all cases, give yourselves fake faces just to be safe. Rinse and repeat
- Getting this for fire and water magic seems like an especially good idea, in light of what I say below

After doing that for any reasonable magic, it would be a good time to consider re-speccing. Do the sacrifice again, but this time save a bit of extra skill so that you can boost skin magic as well. Re-spec out of anything that you get from symbiosis, and likely into magics and things which your team does not have access to. Use scar magic (skin boosted to high levels) + soul symbiote to give everyone scars (the soul symbiote has good synergy with this). Focusing your points into MEN gives you extra flexibility here.

Once your Soul magic is at a decent level, it might be a good idea to flip-flop your points back and forth between SOC and PHY, depending on the situation and provided that you don't lose virtues to do so.

Likewise, since they'll have time after this, it seems like a good time to start building their technology base. None of the exclusion zones are urgent matters and they have almost no immeadiate threats, so preparation is key

Perhaps the right answer to saving the locus is simply to get Grak or Joon up to super competent at Warding, and extend the interior dimensions of the bottle? Make the bottle larger on the inside and it'll be stronger, giving you more options. Or just combine Art and Essentialism on some later Sacrifice so you can interpret what the Locus' soul is telling you.

Magic is interesting in Worth the Candle, because it appears to be sorted into a relatively small number of related categories. We've only really explored the first of these in depth, but I wouldn't be surprised if magics within a category are interfaced with in similar ways...

- "soul": blood bone carapace ink pustule skin (scar, tattoo) essentialism (not quite the same)

- "force": constriction still velocity vibrational

- "elemental": fire flower glass ice steel water wind wood

- "mental" (??): gem library revision

- "unsorted" druidic gold spirit(?) ward

Speaking of Spirit, I would have expected Joon to ask for a quick lesson in the Spirit blades after the rescue. Doing so would likely unlock that telepathy trick, too.
