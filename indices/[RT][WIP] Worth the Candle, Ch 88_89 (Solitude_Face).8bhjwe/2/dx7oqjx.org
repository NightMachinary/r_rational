So let's see:

- Another forge frenzy building.\\
- Explicit talking about a hidden theme, only revealed later. (Fallatehr and the identity theme of the prison)\\
- This forge frenzy mansion has a person living inside of for centuries, bored with repetition.\\
- Amaryllis is about to spend a long time inside a room, with little company besides books.

There's some sort of deep thematic connection between those two...\\
Oh. Do notice how Tiff... changed, in various little ways, from how Joon remembered her. Also, we don't know how was she way back when, personality-wise.

The theme of this place is /changing with time/. Amaryllis won't come out the same person, and this time the change will be more permanent that random soul fuckery.
