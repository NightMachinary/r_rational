Agree. No reason not to send Juniper is, for example, or Val (use teleportation key to fetch her, costing about 2 hours of real-time).

Also, I don't understand why Mary is not going for weekly check-ups: Once a week, come out for half an hour of conversation, to help keep her sane. I mean, they are not under the kind of time pressure where 3 extra days make trouble.
