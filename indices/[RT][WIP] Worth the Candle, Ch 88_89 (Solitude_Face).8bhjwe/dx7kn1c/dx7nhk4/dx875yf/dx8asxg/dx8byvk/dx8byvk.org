When you're at a distance reading a story, you can just say "don't give in to temptation" and then the hero won't. People who want their relationships to last shouldn't put themselves in situations where there's any possibility of trouble.

Who's your favorite pornstar? Can you seriously say you could get locked in a room with her for a month of her desperately wanting you, and nobody would know what happens in there except you, and you wouldn't do anything? Even if you're married, I'm not buying it. Staying faithful means not entering that room in the first place.
