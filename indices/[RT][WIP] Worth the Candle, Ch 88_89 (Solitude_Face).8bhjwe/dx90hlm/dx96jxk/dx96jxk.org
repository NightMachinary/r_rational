I hope that they can negotiate to keep the glove, backpack, and teleportation stone. Everything else is replaceable to one extent or other, but losing any of those three would severely hamper their ability to do anything in the future. Losing Sable means that they have about a thousand pounds of gold that they would somehow have to store in a secure location that they don't currently possess. Losing the teleportation means they have no ability to actually get out of the pit, much less move around Aerb at a non-glacial pace. And the backpack provides huge utility in it's ability to just conjure food, information, and gadgets at will. It's an almost strictly better version of the clonal kit. All three have no replacement, while losing some useful armor or a versatile weapon is harmful but only mildly effects their overall performance.
