I feel bad for Taft. He just wanted to give tours and be with his wife. Instead he gets to see if the bottomless pit actually is. For everyone else that Joon and co. have killed, they at the least signed up for guard duty or an equivalent. Lots of the people they killed were also either evil in some way, or at least complete assholes. They generally knew what they signed up for. Taft had a cushy job acting as a tour guide.

Anyways, I've forgotten a few minor things about some of the entads, and was hoping someone here remembers.

Fenn had her artillery bow, and it has a limit on the number of artillery shots she can use. How does it recharge? And is there a limit to the number of charges it can hold?

How does Grak's axe work? It makes his hair grow, but I forget what the condition is to use that ability.

Is Ropey more durable than a normal rope?

And I suppose one more question relevant for this chapter: Is Amaryllis planning to just store months/years worth of excretion in Sable? This would be an inconvenient time to discover whether Sable has a limit to its sorage capacity. I suppose she can dump everything into the pit every time she comes out of the HTC, assuming Zona allows it.
