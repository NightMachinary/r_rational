  Most of the climbing faces had velocity wards beneath them, layered so that you would be slowed by degrees as you passed through them and hit the ground no harder than if you'd tripped over your own feet on ground level, which meant there was no need for spotters or someone to belay her.

when my sister was 13 she tripped over her feet on a carpeted floor and shattered her forearm bones into several fragments, requiring years of reconstructive surgery

it was not particularly likely but id want to make the wards a /bit/ gentler
