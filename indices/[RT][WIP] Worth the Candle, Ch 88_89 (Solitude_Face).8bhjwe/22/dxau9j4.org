Can someone confirm that the following is their current list of entads? Am I forgetting one?

- teleportation key: high power level, very high utility; hard (but not impossible) to replace

- storage glove (Sable): extremely high utility; sentimental value (Fenn)

- Anyblade: low power level, high utility;

- Ropey: negligible power level, some utility, very high sentimental value (Joon/everyone?); should be considered a party member/friend

- immobility plate: (apparently) infinite power level but narrow; some utility

- artillery bow: only long-range "big gun" (especially with the void grenade trick) in a fight; might hold sentimental value (Fenn)

- hairy axe: low power level, minor utility; might hold sentimental value (Grak)

- fairy jar: medium utility, fairly redundant given Joon's healing powers

- clonal kit: minor marginal utility since most things it produces can be produced by backpack or bought in advance and stored in glove

- Earth backpack (?): medium utility; literally irreplaceable; provides access to the combined knowledge of a civilization

- returnable dagger: low power level, negligible utility

- countdown bow: low power level, medium utility

- first-hit armor: high power level, negligible utility

- Amaryllis' sword: can't remember the power

- Amaryllis' amulet: can't remember the power

- various random entads (?) looted from various enemies
