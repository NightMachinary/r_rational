(I feel that this is separate enough from my previous comment to warrant a new one)

I really want Amaryllis to come out of the HTC having gone through an equivalent to a wiki walk or twenty. Joon may be decently well versed on Earth's culture and some aspects of technology, but being in high school I doubt he really comprehends how advanced Earth is compared to Aerb. Aerb may have a few electronics, but is medieval in a number of ways. I want to see Amaryllis marvel at some of the things that modern Earth people kind of just take for granted. Intercontinental flight that is only subsonic because it's more fuel efficient rather than physical limitations, global communication, vaccines and how multiple diseases have been eliminated or virtually so, the luxuries that are available to even the poorest people in the first world, the wealth of information available about all aspects of nature, women's rights, the near complete lack of monarchies in advanced nation's, and so on. Hell, the entire concept of a globe Earth and orbital mechanics, since she lives on an explicitly flat one. Imagine explaining to someone on Aerb that we sent up some humans to another planet that's thousands of miles away, launched on a vehicle the size of a skyscraper that goes up due to a barely controlled explosion, that said vehicle was single use only, and that we thought it a valuable use of resources to send up a hammer and feather to test the known effects of gravity, and a mirror to measure the speed of light. Oh, and we also brought back some rocks. We did all this to prove that we were better than some other nation that we kind of sorta weren't at war with. Oh, and if we did go to war with that nation, it would probably kill everything.

Data storage! How could I forget. Try explaining to someone who thinks of "computer" as a profession that we have devices that fit in your hand that can hold libraries worth of books, meter scale resolution maps of the entire planet, hundreds of thousands of paintings, and it's available with a few days' wages at the lowest you're legally allowed to pay people.
