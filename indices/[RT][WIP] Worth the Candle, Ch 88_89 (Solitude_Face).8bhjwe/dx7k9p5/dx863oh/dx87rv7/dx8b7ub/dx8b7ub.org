They've got helicoptors and airplanes; they know about aerodynamics. They just can't use any of that because of dragons.

Aerb medical magic is post-singularity compared to Earth Medicine. They can cure any disease that doesn't have magic backing it, instantly fix any wound, bring people back from being cut in half, etc.. A generic doctor can go get a bachelor's degree at the Aethenium of Bone, setup a practice, and heal people of mortal wounds for reasonable prices in an afternoon. How much more advanced do you want?

Aerb has global communication fast enough for information about Amaryllis to every keystone on the planet. They can bulk send materials, and news (being inorganic) gets instantly transported.

Everyone in on Aerb has levels and stats, it's just that Joon can see the information on companions and he levels a lot faster. 'People' like Quills aren't just doing things that normal humans can do except better, they're performing genuinely superhuman acts like blocking bullets jedi-style. High level characters are vastly more powerful than the common populace. It's unlikely that 10,000 commoners with guns could deal with Aumann and his party.

On an idealistic level, a philosopher king who is superhumanly wise and confirmed to be moral good is absolutely better than a democracy. Such a person can't exist in real life, but is fairly straightforward to find on Aerb.

We know that wisdom and knowledge and cunning are stats, we can reasonably extrapolate that people have 60+ in a skill (because Fenn is amazing with a bow but isn't the best archer /ever/), and we know that takes at least 20+ in a stat to reach that skill. Joon reached the point where his personality would diverge too much due to stats at 7 int/wis. If you add it all up, this means there are people who are literally orders of magnitude more wise and intelligent than the general population. Aerb also has ways to objectively measure morality. Boom, philosopher king.

On a practical level, democracy only works because of the implicit threat of force of the populace. A state can only survive if it has a monopoly on violence, and democracy ensures that the greatest possible force (the majority of the populace) is always on the side of the state. This comes crashing down if the greatest force isn't the populace, but a handful of adventurers.
