Nicer to who and how should have i've been nicer in this case. I wasn't even talking to him or even mentioning him. I was specifically discussing how dragons seem to pop out of nowhere and that government seems dumb wasting their resources on pointless stuff.

My whole take on the government was based on your comment.

#+begin_quote
  One pathology of government is that there is no limit on how cruel or absurd (or even inconvenient to the state) punishments can be --- politicians can almost always gin up some support by suggesting ever crueler and more labyrinthine penalties. Anglecynn has a weird system of government, but I can imagine someone suggesting the drops in the Risen Lands as part of a “Tough on Crime” campaign.

Me saying there are flaws or asking if other people see them as flaws is not a personal attack against anybody.

All that aside. Even famous meme of flying on eagles is explained in LoTR by enemy also having flying units and constant mention of dragons long before they even needed that.

1. Story starts with him and presumable the princess of said government dropped from a plane. She never talks about dragons.

2. Anuman hovers in a helicopter and Juniper mention being a pilot. Again no mention of dragons.

3. Five attack choppers chase them, Junipers wants to take one as a trophy. No one conunterpoints it with - well dragons.

4. Dragon mentioned in Uthers assistant\love interest Morana(man that's an unfortunate name) "Three months in, she was skinned alive by a dragon" No one mentiones theri alliance

5. First real and only mention of dragons in bulk is that small paragraph about (we can't fly so let's take the train).

My point is there was 0 establishment to that and it didn't even need to be there. I noticed it not because i "hate the story" or specifically focused on air politics, i noticed it because it felt forced and Juniper was were much focused on flying before.

I don't try to be an asshole and hate on anyone. But can you tell me with a straight face that reveal of Dragons own the skies doesn't seem out of nowhere and that all of the major villains just happen to be lucky and own flying vehicles with no one ever caring about that?
