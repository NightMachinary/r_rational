    If dragons were in fact a consideration from the start, a lot of people and situations our heroes encountered should be the result of dumbest decisions that other people made.

  Your comments, especially lines like this, read as really rude and aggressive to me, as well as completely lacking in the principle of charity.

Huh, i was talking about people in the story aka government and ruling class being dumb.

1. Larkspur using 5 helicopters to chase people when he knows dragons are a thing was dumb and desperate in my opinion.

2. Using airplanes to drop prisoners while every flight is valuable and needs to be negotiated for is a dumb move from the ruling party.

3. Having multiple worst accidents when as you said "dragons only crash airships as last resort" is incompetence and stupidity from people that made those decisions.

I never tried to insult you personally or say that you are incompetent or dumb, even if i hated the story i would not do that. You do great work writing and creating your world. But i notice problems that should not really be problems, but they are because there are a lot of blanket statements about the world, that get disproved\dropped when it's convenient for the story.

It's the exact problem that we are having here. You perceived me saying "it's dumb" as a personal attack when in fact it wasn't like that. I see those "revelations about the world" as spur of the moment changes sometimes, because you write weekly and often more than one chapter, so it's reasonable that you can forget things.

  I left you a comment explaining my stance on exposition
#+end_quote

I think i mentioned it in that thread, but here it is again. Not describing the whole world at once is fine. Text upon text would be boring and pointless. But Juniper was obseessed with helicopters for a good amount of chapters and "you can't fly them cause dragons" was never a counter point and it would only take 1 sentence. Plus dragons appear only in chapter 82 in a small paragraph, that is easy to forget and to me it reads like a justification for using a train that didn't need to be there.

I dislike elements of the story and especially stuff i see as unwarranted inconsistencies, especially when they crop up, but i like the overall story. My problem is some things are a heavy focus and crux of the plot for a group of chapters, but when they get dropped, forgotten or completely invalidated by introduction of a magical item and when cycle begins anew with a different thing. It is pretty much D&D adventure, but the problem is the world is consistence and power spikes\drops are that more noticeable for me.

  You probably disagree; that's fine, but with due respect, I have my own opinions about how to write, and have disagreed with pretty much every "add more text" solution you've suggested, especially since the more I try to communicate, the more you find to criticize
#+end_quote

That's fine, but my point often is don't add that text, don't use blanket statements, because when you need to work them in for the whole world or all balance crumbles or you set limiters that don't feel natural in the next story arc. Character seem to bounce from ultimate power and a lot of solutions, to no power and all the solutions.

This is me being arrogant, but you could have easily said "Dragons are a thing in this particular region, not all of the Aerb., or here is 1 especially active dragon resides" have Juniper joke about " I told you we should have stolen that helicopter, it would be so much easier to fly". But the problem is now "dragons are not acknowledged when Juniper talks about helicopter and narrative of him piloting one", "Him wanting a helicopter is not mentioned when they would benefit from flying in one".

  I don't want to write "Mary and Juniper sit in a room while he gets things explained to him for several days"
#+end_quote

Yes you are right in not doing so, but one of my "gripes" was in the chapter there Juniper and Mary literally set down and talked in a room for the whole duration of it.

Edit: I have a perfect analogy about how i feel about dragons. You know when shows introduce brother\daughter\lost cousin of the main character and try to make it look like he was a thing all along. That's how i felt with their sudden and brief appearance.
