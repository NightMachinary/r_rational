There's a difference between your perception of missing world-building (subjective) and an actual world-building hole (objective). The relevance of the dragon union has never cropped up until that segment explaining why train travel is more common than air travel. In all of your examples, there is no narrative reason to mention the dragon union without going off into a world-building tangent. There's also a difference between discussing/deconstructing the consequences of a dragon confederacy with readers versus calling the dragons an "afterthought" like the author just half-assed their existence into Aerb.

1) Why would Mary have any reason to tell a complete stranger about dragons? "Hey stranger, don't you think it's weird that they flew us here in an airplane? Want to hear about dragons while we prepare our getaway?"

2-3) Helicopter travel over short distances != long distance air travel over dragons' territory. Alternatively, "hey we're in an emergency right now, but what's really important is the remote risk of dragons swooping down on these copters!"

4) "Morana was skinned by a dragon and now's a good time to tell you about the Draconic Confederacy since the dragons' chilling effect on air travel is directly relevant to our talk about Uther and narratives right now."

5) Compare to ch. 82. "Hey we're traveling by train. Why are we using trains when Aerb aerodynamics isn't far behind Earth? Is this a good time to talk about dragons and their influence on air travel?"

I'm being sarcastic, but as I said above, it's useful to think about "alternative explanations, narrative convenience or even the law of parsimony" and save yourself/the author from inanity.
