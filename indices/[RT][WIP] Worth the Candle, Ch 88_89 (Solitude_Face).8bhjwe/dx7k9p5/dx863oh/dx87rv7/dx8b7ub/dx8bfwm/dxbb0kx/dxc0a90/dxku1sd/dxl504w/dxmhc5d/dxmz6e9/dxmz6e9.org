Plot twist! Your handle was vaguely familiar...

It's tricky for sure. I was carelessly throwing ideas geared towards increasing Patreon yields, but opportunity cost and (unforeseen) consequences are a thing. It's very convenient that the latest WtC discussion is centralized in the [[/r/rational]] threads, but I don't think segmenting the discussion would be a disincentive for readers because other stories also work with the similar problem of discussion dispersed across multiple forums. The [[/r/rational]] crowd and predicted majority of free readers that usually hang around for the discussion will still be there once the threads are posted. It would mainly hurt enthusiastic Patreon readers who are eager to discuss the fresh chapter but wouldn't have an outlet. That'd be another benefit of having your own site and hidden comment section ([[https://wanderinginn.com/2018/04/17/4-29/][example]]). Another possibility taken out of pirateaba's book is to create a Discord channel for discussing all of wales' works and give Patreons exclusive access to a live-discussion WtC-spoiler channel. Discord is also a way to plant a seed for building a community around alexanderwales as an author to support, rather than say, a writing hobbyist. Downside being another thing to keep track of.

I don't think a one day advance is sufficient incentive for someone to subscribe to (for example) a $5 tier. It's the itch of wanting to know more, but having to wait several days, that likely drives people to commit for a month of hair-tearing-cliffhanger-free relief.

I just checked the website on mobile and it has a neat and very readable interface. I don't know how much trouble it would be to copy over the more complex bits of formatting (character sheet) and how it would look on mobile.

Another stray thought:

Crossposting on a site like [[https://royalroadl.com/][Royalroad]], even temporarily, may be a useful way to reach a new "market." I know crossposting is a terrible and evil chore, but fantasy/litRPG writers who later branch to publishing their finished work on Amazon have found a lot of success by posting their "draft" version on RRL. It's a free way to get (usually generic) feedback and reach a large audience at the cost of crossposting annoyance and possibly a hit to respectability for posting on a site of mostly amateur writers.
