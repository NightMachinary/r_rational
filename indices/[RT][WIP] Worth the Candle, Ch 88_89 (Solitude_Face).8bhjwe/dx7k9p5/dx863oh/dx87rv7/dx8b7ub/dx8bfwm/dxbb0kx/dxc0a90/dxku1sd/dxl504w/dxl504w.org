Other thoughts, mostly addressed to [[/u/cthulhuraejepsen]]:

If earning enough money through Patreon to be self-employed is the goal, then CRJ/AW will need to commit to financially-minded managerial decisions for maximizing voluntary patrons. pirateaba has had the most explosive web serial earnings increase that I know of ([[https://graphtreon.com/creator/user?u=4240617][interesting graph for tracking Patreon growth]]) since she made the decision to add that $5 tier last year and it's been steadily rising for two main reasons (as I see it): (1) she's written an amazing story that people like to read and (2) she's a writing machine who consistently puts out at least two ~10K word chapters a week.

WtC started last year and its reader-base has also been growing. CRJ/AW has put out an average of ~7-12K words a week the past 2 months and I think that's more than enough to attract a regular readership. However, I think some factors are limiting its Patreon growth:

1. AO3 is excellent for readers (e-books!!) and has nifty in-built features for authors (the mouseover character sheets are great). But as far as I can tell - since I don't have the statistics for how many new viewers find it by exploring the site, it's a poor venue for attracting more readers - at least the type of readers who are looking for and would be interested in an original litRPG like WtC (AO3 does have a reputation for fanfiction and smut). By comparison, posting on RoyalRoad gives stories a huge influx of readership if they're popular because the reader-base is specifically looking for these types of stories (arguably a trade-off at the cost of reader and feedback quality).

2. Patreon tier amounts. WtC is currently at $1.9 per patron and it seems 101 of the 103 patrons are pledging the only option of $1. With higher tiers, there should be a marked increase in the average. And if low effort rewards like access to the latest chapter are thrown in, who knows? It does come with the mental shift of treating the story (at least partly) as a source of income, as opposed to the free personal story that WtC is written as.

3. This one is more iffy. But creating a site for WtC (like the ever popular Wordpress) may be useful to exert some overt ownership over the story. A site tailored specifically for WtC makes the story seem like a product and WtC like a brand - much more marketable to potential Patreons. It's also a place to build a community around, as I see many programmers around who have offered a place to host or can contribute to polishing such a site. *Especially since finding that Patreon links are banned on AO3. Also, fanart!

Important/obvious caveat: one story isn't a sustainable long-term source of income. No matter how popular it gets, WtC appears to have a clear ending in mind; so unless it's deliberately prolonged into a decade-spanning epic, it will end as the main reason people pledge.
