I really don't think that you like this story, and wish that you would go read something else rather than get annoyed by various elements that bother you. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/82v9go/rtwip_worth_the_candle_ch_8384_familiarline/dve5jgj/?context=3][I left you a comment explaining my stance on exposition]], and don't really want to communicate with you further.

Dragons having a chilling effect on air travel was intended from the start; that passage was originally intended for ch 9, when they arrived at Silmar City, but I didn't like how it played with the pacing, given that it would have extended a "lull" in the text. You probably disagree; that's fine, but with due respect, I have my own opinions about how to write, and have disagreed with pretty much every "add more text" solution you've suggested, especially since the more I try to communicate, the more you find to criticize (which, again, I think extends from the fact that you simply don't like the story, and aren't of the mindset to enjoy it).

  If dragons were in fact a consideration from the start, a lot of people and situations our heroes encountered should be the result of dumbest decisions that other people made.

Your comments, especially lines like this, read as really rude and aggressive to me, as well as completely lacking in the principle of charity. Honestly, it really bums me out to get comments like this, and is one of the things that's made me stop reading or replying to comments as much.
