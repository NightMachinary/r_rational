The thing is you're nitpicking every little detail. You don't consider alternative explanations, narrative convenience or even the law of parsimony. When people respond to your long-winded critiques, I might be misremembering but I don't believe you ever acknowledge their points but instead repackage your criticism, often into something else that annoys you.

You're not hating on anyone and I even admire your investment into the story, but to a writer and others, that stubbornness and attitude of "this is wrong, that is wrong" easily comes across as being an asshole.
