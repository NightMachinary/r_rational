I read your March report on Patreon ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8882ln/rt_worth_the_candle_ch_8687_headdown/dwjxz6l/][add more donation tiers]]!) and I felt irrationally guilty when I got to the part about negative feedback since I'm a critical reader by nature.

More seriously, every writer struggles with negative feedback, but in Ace's case, it seems generally unproductive or incompatible criticism that you can't act on and it's wasted effort trying to respond when you're hounded by (often derogatory in tone) complaints of the same gist. It's a downside that comes with having an online presence as a web-serial author - people will dislike it and express it. Book writers talk about developing a thick skin, but they don't really have to deal with a bad review until their work is finished and the distance is already there. It might be useful to not treat all criticism as equal(ly reliable) or meriting a personal defense.

If you're invariably fixated on the need to respond, then it could be constructive to get RES (Reddit Enhancement Suite) and set those comments on ignore indefinitely until it loses its immediate demand on your attention. I think dealing with these comments is more distracting when they're directed to your latest chapter than if they refer to some previous arc. At any rate, substantive criticism will recur and crop up again from multiple readers.

I do dearly hope the negativity doesn't deter you from the comments because I've always enjoyed the responses and seeing how comments occasionally leave traces in subsequent chapters. Please don't ignore all the love!
