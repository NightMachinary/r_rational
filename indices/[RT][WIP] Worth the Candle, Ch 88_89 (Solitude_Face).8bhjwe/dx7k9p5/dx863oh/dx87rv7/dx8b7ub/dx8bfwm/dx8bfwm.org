  They've got helicoptors and airplanes; they know about aerodynamics. They just can't use any of that because of dragons.

I still think Dragons were added as an after thought, because the party needed to be on a train, cause story would not work on an airplane. Every chapter prior to train showed 0 evidence that dragons were somehow a problem with flight transportation\use, in fact helicopters\airplanes were used pretty freely. If dragons were in fact a consideration from the start, a lot of people and situations our heroes encountered should be the result of dumbest decisions that other people made.
