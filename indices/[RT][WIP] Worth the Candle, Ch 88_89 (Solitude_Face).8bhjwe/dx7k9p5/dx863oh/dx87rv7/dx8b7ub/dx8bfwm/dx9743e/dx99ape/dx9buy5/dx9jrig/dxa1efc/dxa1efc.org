I wanted to respond with something about using teleportation and it kinda raised more questions.

1. How did the retrieval group Fenn was part of got into the zone?

2. If teleportation key is so valuable why not send a group via teleport and let them get out via retrieved teleport, worst case scenario they have to wait 2 hours of recharge on their own teleport. You may say it's not practical cause you need a teleportation anchor or someone who was there, but somehow increasing the zombie population via prisoners and planes is more practical(insane) at the same time.

I still think dragons explanation is kinda flimsy and it's because it's to specific so it works when it needs to, but at the same time conveniently to vague and hard to enforce so it gets ignored.

There was 5 helicopters chasing the party that took off from a pretty populated area. You might say it was prince being desperate, but why exactly there were 5 ready to fly helicopters in that area and no one even said "Boy, Larkspur and goverment is gonna get a nice scolding from dragons".

  But the dragons don't really attack, they have a regulatory agency that constricts air travel to within certain quotas, times, and places, with various penalties for infraction going all the way up to "a dragon notices and destroys the plane and everyone onboard"

Also, this doesn't really explain anything, because it seems there are no "various penalties" just straight up drop the plane type of deal. How incompetent would you need to be to cause multiple "worst disasters"

  some of the worst disasters in Aerbian aviation history were caused by dragons going after improperly cleared flights, which was obviously the kind of thing that had a chilling effect on passenger air travel.

I only know noticed how funny the next sentence is in retrospect.

  Also, there was no doubt in my mind that we were going to have to fight a dragon at some point, but that thankfully seemed like it was going to be a long time coming.

Because of this

  I was supposed to fly that helicopter. Narrative convention dictates that I was supposed to fly that helicopter, I have a fucking very specific skill in my backstory, mentioned to both of you, and what the hell, I don't get to fly the helicopter? This is garbage. There wasn't even a fight.

Would be nice of both of those inevitabilities were introduced at the same time. Again i have a problem believing dragons were a consideration from the start, because they appear 60 chapters after that "destined to fly a helicopter" speech.
