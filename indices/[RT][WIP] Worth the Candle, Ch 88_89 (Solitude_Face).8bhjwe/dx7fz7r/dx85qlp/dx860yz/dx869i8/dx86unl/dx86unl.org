Wow I failed on a memory check there. Thanks.

*Narratively,* I am confident in saying that Amaryllis won't die because she doesn't know how gas exchange works and never pulled something out of the backpack to convert carbon dioxide back into oxygen.

Honestly, they should just let Amaryllis have everything they can provide her with. Including all their weapons. She has plenty of time to, say, get good with bows or Anyblade. It's not like everyone else will get more use of them in 45 minutes than she will in a month.

The backpack is especially great for her because she doesn't even need to cook, just pull out whatever hot food she wants. Same with books or items. I mentioned a wiki walk in my other top level comment, and I think it's a good analogy. She'll want lots of random information that is impractical to load up ahead of time.
