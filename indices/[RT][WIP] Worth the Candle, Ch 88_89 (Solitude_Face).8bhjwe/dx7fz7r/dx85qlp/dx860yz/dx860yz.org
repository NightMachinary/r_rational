I actually didn't think about air usage (it wasn't mentioned explicitly so in retrospect it shouldn't be a concern) but my assumption is that she's going to be pulling food, drink, and anything else she needs from the backpack. The backpack /does/ create mass, or at least teleports it from somewhere else, so if she stayed inside long enough she could find Sable's limits if it has any.
