Putting pieces together. Most of what we get about Tiff comes from [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/27769455][chapter 42]]:

  “I did [like Arthur],” said Tiff. “And I knew that he liked me. I kept waiting for him to ask me out or even just confess to me, but months and months went by and he never did, and then my interest started to fade because there was this other handsome boy, so what was I supposed to do?”

  “Yeah, I am [an asshole],” said Reimer, rubbing his forearm. “This difference between the two of us is that I know I'm an asshole, and you prance around like you were his bestest friend in the whole world. You and Tiff could have told him, he'd have been upset but at least it would have spared him being made a fool of. He died a virgin, pining after her, and you were just laughing behind his back about what a moron he was.”

So Arthur either didn't know or had only guessed about Tiff and Joon when he died, and she probably got the tattoo as a commemorative thing. Zona is Arthur's memory of Tiff, not Joon's. That's why she's different, Arthur didn't know her so well. She's also a locally omnipotent magical sentience that's been murdering people for centuries... which might tend to alter one's personality.
