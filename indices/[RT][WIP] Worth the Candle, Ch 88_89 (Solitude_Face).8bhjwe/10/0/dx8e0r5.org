When you put it that way, I can almost see chapter 89 as a hint to an inference about (Uther-era) Zona:

| Character | _                                                                               |
|-----------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Tiff      | Interested in Arthur, gets no response, gets attention from Juniper             |
| Zona      | Relationship with Arthur, he does a lot of adventuring, gets attention from ??? |
