I've been imagining Kuum Doona as Howl's Moving Castle ever since we found out it moves. Maybe I glossed over it, but I haven't really gotten the image of how it's oriented. It's more tall than wide, but is that height on the Y-axis? I'm imagining it looks like an encyclopedia pancaked against the wall with any cannons or towers built on the broad side sticking over the pit. So Mary climbed down the "spine of the book" onto the "bottom" where the door and the jutting walkway presumably sit right above the empty expanse of the Pit.
