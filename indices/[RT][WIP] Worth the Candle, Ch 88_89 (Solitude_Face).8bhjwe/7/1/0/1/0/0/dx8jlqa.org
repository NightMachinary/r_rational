  Who's your favorite pornstar? Can you seriously say you could get locked in a room with her for a month of her desperately wanting you, and nobody would know what happens in there except you, and you wouldn't do anything?

... Yes?

Like, maybe this is me being naive, but... I don't think doing the right thing is /that/ hard? Like, this isn't an ambiguous situation where the right thing to do is complicated. You just have to /not/ put your tongue / fingers / other organs in the lady you're spending time with, for a month.

This is like if someone asked "Imagine you're spending a month in a closed room, with a pile of cocaine. Do you really think it's possible you'd never, ever touch it for the whole month?". I can imagine people with drug antecedents might give in, but you don't need monk-levels of self-control to... like, not do the stupid thing.
