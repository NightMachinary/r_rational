  Can you seriously say you could get locked in a room with her for a month of her desperately wanting you, and nobody would know what happens in there except you, and you wouldn't do anything? Even if you're married, I'm not buying it.

Well, i'm kinda older than Juniper and currently single, so i wouldn't really care. I would say you have a point, but when i'm in a relationship and someone looking hot and being close is enough for me to cheat, i might as well end that relationship, cause it's going nowhere. Plus, unlike Joon i have multiple look only types that i would consider gorgeous and even when personality is a factor after some time even if the girl looks like she is my dream.

Considering Joon spent enough time with Mary already she should know better or stop lying to himself. Like every past insert paints him as caring about Tiff or girls being more than just cute dolls, but every interaction on Aerb is about "Boy she is so hot and that one is so hot too", i'm exaggerating, but he talks about how girls that he interacts with "are hot" too much.
