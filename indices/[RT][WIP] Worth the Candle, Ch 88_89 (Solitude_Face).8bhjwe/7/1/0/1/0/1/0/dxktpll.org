  Like every past insert paints him as caring about Tiff or girls being more than just cute dolls, but every interaction on Aerb is about "Boy she is so hot and that one is so hot too", i'm exaggerating, but he talks about how girls that he interacts with "are hot" too much.

I don't think that's true. He has, like most adolescent males, a part of his brain that's constantly nudging him to mate with attractive exemplars of the female sex, constantly reminding him that they're there (and even more, accessible if he just made the effort, or not even that in the case of Val), and constantly putting on the top of his mind their attractiveness. Despite this, Joon puts in the effort to "behave honourably", focus on the things that the group has to manage, maximise utility for the whole of Aerb, and think of his female companions like very complex people rather than the mere objects of his desire.

The only peculiarity being that the author doesn't care to mask the sexual aspect of the human experience, and I'm completely down with that.
