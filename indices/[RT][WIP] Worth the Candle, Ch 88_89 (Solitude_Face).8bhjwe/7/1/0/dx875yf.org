Juniper would be an interpersonal issue.\\
Mary still wants to get with Joon but she's given up, and Joon still thinks she's the most attractive woman he's ever seen. Several months of time spent together, cut off from the world, with perfect birth control already applied... that's a recipe for disaster if Joon values his relationship with Fenn.

Val is also an interpersonal problem.\\
Mary is less prejudiced to her than she was before and seems to have a good relationship with her now, but Val is still a terrifying boogeyman. I don't see anyone but Joon willingly spending a month with her as solitary company.
