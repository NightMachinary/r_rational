Like I said, those juatifications seem flimsy. I'm not sure what to say about Fenn -- is total isolation really better than being cooped up with her? That seems like a caricature of Fenn rather than real Fenn, and you shouldn't make serious decisions like that because of a joke. But even taking it for a given that it's a bad idea, that still leaves Joon and Grak to alternate. Still enough time to talk to Zona, and no nead to inflict isolation torture on a friend.
