Okay, some wild guesses despite my horrible track record.

- Zona really is Uther's wife. She was turned into Kuum Doona after he tried to make her invulnerable to damage from The Plot.

- The dungeon master is an instance of Arthur (maybe Uther after becoming a god? who knows) and gave Joon Amaryllis to make up for the fact he basically stole his girlfriend.
