Mary just became the DnD equivalent of a weakly superhuman AI, she can:

- do a months worth of thinking in 45 minutes

- has access to Earths total knowledge

- create technology in minutes that would take the rest of the world decades to invent

She even has several handy targets to AI box, including Zona, her party or the DM (by designing the perfect plot derailment).
