There are also:

- Amaryllis' sword (blade can be switched on and off; telefrags)

- sand bow
- Joon's armor
- Fenn's destroyed armor might still count
- Amaryllis' amulet (holds a single personality imprint)
- the leafy cloak
- the bottle with the locus

Stuff that hasn't seen any use:

- a sickle with a rich oak handle (uninvestable)

Auman's stuff:

- a shortsword
- bracelet (maybe anti-poison)
- necklace (maybe anti-poison)
- pocketwatch (shows the equivalent of latitude and longitude)

Also Larkspur's stuff, I guess.
