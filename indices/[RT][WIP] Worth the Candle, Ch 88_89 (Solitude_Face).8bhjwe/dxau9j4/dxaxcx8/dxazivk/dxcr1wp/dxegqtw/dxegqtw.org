You are assuming Zona will pick maliciously. This is, of course, a possibility, but not the most likely outcome. Other Possibilities:

A: Zona eats entads, but does not care at all what they are, thus picks 3 they wont miss.

B: Zone does very much care what she eats, and will be picking on the basis of what will be most useful to her.. Which will sting, but is not optimized for being hurtful to the party - This could for example mean the cookie jar, the bottle of the six-eyed doe (dumping the locus back into the world in the process of claiming it) and the amulet of mind storage.
