It's kind of scary how close to death the adventurers came in this chapter.

The only reasons they're all still alive is:

- They discussed the possibility of inhabiting Zona while in her earshot.

- The fortress was too bored of killing people after all the people she'd previously killed to put serious effort into killing the adventurers.

It's like a cross between /Tomb of Horrors/ and the Heterodyne Castle.
