That's true, but he has a number of skills that he hasn't properly unlocked yet. Given some initial book learning, he should be able to unlock still, velocity, vibrational, revision, water, and fire magic. Then also get engineering and a few of his less used combat skills maxed out. After that, he can still do normal learning through the books stored in Sable or the backpack. He would be limited by the size of the room, and given that I doubt he could max out fire or water magic, but even some simple fire spells used by multiple people could provide a nice combat advantage. There's also thinking of ways to use his current abilities better, rather than simply making them more powerful. He hasn't tapped into soul magic body enhancement significantly as of yet.

There was another comment in this thread that I think makes a better case for why Joon shouldn't go in with Amaryllis. Fenn can't go in because she would annoy Mary way too much. Amaryllis is extremely attractive to Joon, and that attraction is returned to some degree. Joon and Amaryllis living in such a small confined space together, with basically complete privacy, is potentially very bad for Joon's current relationship with Fenn. It's best for him not to put himself in the situation in the first place.

Hopefully, Fenn and Joon could use the room for a subjective month or week, where they could both train without the potential problems of Amaryllis and Joon sharing the room.
