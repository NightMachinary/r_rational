Random thought about the parallels betweeen Zona and Juniper & co. They've been getting progressively more casual about killing people, even innocent bystanders like the pilot. They've been thinking about it in passing but not going into detail examining it. Now they are encountering this sentient location that cheerfully admits to killing and torturing various groups of adventurers in creative ways for its(her?) own amusement. May be leading up to a "not so different" moment
