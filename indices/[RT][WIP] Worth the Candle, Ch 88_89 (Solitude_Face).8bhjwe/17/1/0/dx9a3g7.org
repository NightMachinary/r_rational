Fixed the first part. The second part I'll have to spend more time going over, a lot of it is stuff that just takes two or three editing passes for me to see. It kind of sucks that writing and editing take from the same pool of time and effort, because I do think I'm capable of writing prose at a higher level, the problem is that it comes at the expense of /quantity/ of prose, which isn't really a trade-off that I want to make.
