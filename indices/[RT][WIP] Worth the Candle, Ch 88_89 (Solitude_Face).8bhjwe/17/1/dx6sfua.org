My brain has opinions about commas; I don't know if those opinions reflect english grammar, so take those complaints with a grain of salt. LMK if those are too opinionated, and I'll try to stick to just typos next time.

#+begin_quote
  It had been coined by Fenn, but the ‘tele-' prefix meant ‘far', and all arrows, almost by definition, were already traveling across great distances, and further, the telearrow didn't actually go any further than a normal arrow, and in fact, due to weight, balance, and worse aerodynamics, tended to go quite a bit less far.
#+end_quote

I get that it's probably intentional that this scans poorly, but maybe if some of the commas were semicolons ("distances; and further", arrow; and in fact") it wouldn't be quite that extreme? I had to read this sentence three times to parse out which clauses were independent ;p (is 'and further' about the great distances, or a variant on 'furthermore'? etc)

#+begin_quote
  Amaryllis had freed both her armors from the armor, while one hand rested gentle fingers on the glove, feeling its magic, the other held a pocketwatch, which was counting down the seconds
#+end_quote

"gentle" feels out of place there, did you mean "while one hand rested gently on the glove"?

Also feel like you need either a full stop after armor, or some kind of conjunction after the comma. "Amaryllis had freed both her arms from the armor, and while one hand rested gentle fingers on the glove, feeling its magic, the other held" seems to scan better.

#+begin_quote
  arrow fired against glass, metal, or stone, would be too likely
#+end_quote

Don't think the comma after stone should be there. "arrow fired against glass or stone would be too likely" -> "arrow fired against glass, metal, or stone would be too likely"

#+begin_quote
  which would slow down the glove-carrying shaft of the arrow. A fast-bonding adhesive would then be carefully applied to the arrow before it was fired, and ideally it was stick to a wall, which would allow Amaryllis to get out of the glove, stick herself in place with the immobility plate
#+end_quote

in 'would then be applied ... before it was fired' the then seems off, messing up the chronology; 'stick' is repeated twice in short succession (try fix?:

"A fast-bonding adhesive, applied carefully to the arrow before it was fired, would ideally stick to a wall, allowing Amaryllis to get out of the glove, fix herself in place..."

#+begin_quote
  For that, Amaryllis had specialized tools, not just ropes, pitons, and a harness, all things she'd bought way back in Barren Jewel for the assault on Caer Laga, but a wound crossbow that she loaded with a heavy arrow, the end of which was attached to a length of thing, elven-made rope that had been purchased at great expense.
#+end_quote

don't think you need a comma between thin and elven-made; the comma after 'specialised tools' should be a colon, the commas around 'all things' could be hyphens:

"specialized tools: not just ropes, pitons, and a harness - all things she'd bought way back in Barren Jewel for the assault on Caer Laga - but also a wound crossbow that she loaded with a heavy arrow, the end of which was attached to a length of thin elven-made rope that had been purchased at great expense."

#+begin_quote
  The steel-tipped arrow was fired from its specialized crossbow, hurled across the relatively short distance separating them, then broke off part of the wall where it struck and fell limply down, trailing rope behind it until Amaryllis grabbed the end and began pulling it back up to reload it.
#+end_quote

The arrow changes from object to subject in the third part of the sentence, and I feel like you need to make that explicit; "then it broke off part of the wall where it struck", maybe? As is the transition is jarring.
