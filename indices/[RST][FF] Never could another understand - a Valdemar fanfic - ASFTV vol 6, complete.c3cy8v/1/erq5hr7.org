Author's note: this is part 6 of a reaaally long series. Doesn't require having read canon.

It's a fairly nonstandard example of rationalfic, and takes its time building up - book 1 in particular is guilty of being slow and starting off in a totally different genre from the rest. IMO the first 11 chapters of book 1 are skippable, especially if you're read canon and/or don't feel like slogging through a whole bunch of angsty teen romance; it may also be feasible to start at the beginning of book 3 if you've read Magic's Pawn or skimmed a summary of it.

(I'm planning to create an abridged version of the entire series once I've written to the ending.)
