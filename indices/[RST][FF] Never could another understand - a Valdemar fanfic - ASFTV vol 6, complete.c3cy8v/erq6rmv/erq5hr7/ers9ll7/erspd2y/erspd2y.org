Oh man, that is super flattering, aww. Said character has been really interesting to write, but also one of the biggest challenges I've attempted. I have really enjoyed the arc where he starts out rational and the main POV character /doesn't/.

...Uh, I would not quite describe the original trilogy as "things always work out", though.
