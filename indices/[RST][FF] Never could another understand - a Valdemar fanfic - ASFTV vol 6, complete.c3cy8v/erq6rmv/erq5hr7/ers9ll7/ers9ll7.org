This is really, really good. I read the Valdemar books as a teenager and they are of a genre I call, "Candy fantasy." They are angsty but dramatic angsty and the good people are good, the bad people are BAD. And things always work out.

This fic starts in that universe and is essentially Magic's Pawn for the first few chapters. It starts diverging and essentially takes the BAD person from the original series and makes him what the canon version of him should have been all along. He is rational in a way that doesn't scream, "I AM RATIONAL"
