This is pretty good, if really angsty. The pacing suffers at times, especially when the main character is not in immediate crisis, but for the most part this is a captivating read.

No knowledge of the setting was necessary when starting from book 1 for me. (I tried reading the original books after the first 2-3 books of this fic, but couldn't really get into it)
