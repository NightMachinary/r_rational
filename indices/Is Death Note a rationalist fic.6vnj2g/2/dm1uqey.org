One of the best (IMO) ways of putting it is that Death Note is an attempt at [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level2intelligent][Level 2 Intelligent]] fiction that /almost/ succeeds (some may argue that it largely /does/ succeed), and while that doesn't automatically qualify it as /rationalist/ fiction, it certainly makes it a lot closer to /rational/ fiction than most other mainstream works.
