  I'm sorry but "the gods are bored" is not really adequate explanation for giving a weapon of mass destruction to a random megalomaniacal Japanese high schooler. It's the quintessential handwavium "let's just get on with this" backstory.

I'd say the rule only applies to the story itself, and not the backstory. The point is that the characters have actual control. Things happen because of what they do, and not just because of what the author wants. But they obviously have no control over the backstory, since it already happened.

Edit: Though I should add that three different death gods get involved. The first one gets a pass. The others are more of a problem. Sure we've established that it's something that can happen, but deciding exactly when is still a literal deus ex machina.
