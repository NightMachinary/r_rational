  *Characteristics of Rational Fiction:*

  #+begin_quote
    Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. If characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason.
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

I'm sorry but "the gods are bored" is not really adequate explanation for giving a weapon of mass destruction to a random megalomaniacal Japanese high schooler. It's the quintessential handwavium "let's just get on with this" backstory.

Also, what are the odds that Japan has someone of equal intelligence investigating stuff like what Light was doing?

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    Any factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

Sure.

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

Yup.

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    The fictional world has consistent rules, and sticks to them.
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

More or less...Though the death note rules aren't all known in advance so the story doesn't 100% pass this bar.

#+begin_quote
  *In Rationalist Fiction:* As well as the above,

  #+begin_quote
    Rationalist and scientific methods are used to demystify mysterious phenomena.
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

The only thing that can even be barely argued in this direction is Light's somewhat blundering verification that the notebook sort of seems like it does what it should. No attempt whatsoever is made to scientifically confirm/experiment on anything that happens (how the fuck does Ryuk float?!?!?!).

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    The story shows rationalist techniques, which can be applied by readers.
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

Maybe. It has some clever deduction stuff which may be possibly called rationalist techniques, sure.

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    The story is like a puzzle; readers can reach the same solution as the characters by using the information provided earlier in the story.
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

Yup, except for the unmentioned DN rules.

So....It's tied for my #1 favorite anime but it does fail or almost completely fail some points above which is why I'd say it's aspiring to be rational but not quite there and definitely not rationalist. Too many failed points.
