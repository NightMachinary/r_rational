My [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/3r320c/heres_a_list_of_anime_ive_seen_sorted_by_how_much/][anime rankings list]] has a "loved" tier and a "god" tier, where the god tier is shared by only two shows, Death Note and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. They are very different but I find them both approximately equally captivating. Obligatory plug for [[/r/haruhi]].
