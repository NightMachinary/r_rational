That is good list. It's not often one sees Death Note in Loved and Code Geass in hated. But I absolutely agree on your assessment of that anime. Main character is smart, genius level intelligence but far too many things there happen out of the blue, because that would be cool, or because he needs rescue and in the last moment someone enters a scene to save him. Will check the others if I have some spare time.
