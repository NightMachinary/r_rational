I've heard it said that the premise of a work is unassailable. This is to say that one can't really argue that it's irrational that a guy from another planet gets his power from the sun, is invulnerable, and flies, as that's part of the premise. The story is "what happens /given that/ superman exists and he's on earth", and if the dominos that fall from that don't fall properly, /then/ it's irrational. It's sort of like arguing that HPMOR is unrealistic because "magic exists", even though the story itself gives us no concrete explanation for the phenomenon. That's part of the premise; so long as the magic is more or less consistent and the actors involved use it in a not-stupid manner, then it doesn't impact the rationality of the work. If this weren't true, then no rational fiction could possibly exist that was set anywhere but "Earth, present day or recent past".

Similarly, the premise of death note is "Light gets the Death Note". This part is unassailable. So what if it was a bored demigod, what matters is the ramifications of that event.

Even if that weren't true, I'd argue that an immortal being that literally feeds on human deaths deciding on a whim to fuck with humanity sounds like the most natural result in the world. What's unrealistic is that this seems to be the first time it's happened (at least in a long time).
