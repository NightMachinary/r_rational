The non-killer Near was expecting to win because of the switched notebook, according to Light. According to Light, he was going to lose because Near had underestimated Mikami's cleverness and diligence. Near did expect to win, but Light was wrong about the reason, wrongly believed Near was wrong, and wrongly went as Near expected.

As for why kick the entire duel off in the first place, I don't recall what the trigger was.
