From what I recall, the chain of reasoning breaks down because of Light's ultimate mistake in underestimating Near's ruthlessness in using the DN on someone (to control Mikami); this leads to Light's mistaken confidence in terminating the reasoning at 'Near's ploy is replacing Mikami's DN with a fake to disarm him but Mikami can't be tricked as easily as that' and so explaining why Near is willing to show up (Light mistakenly thinks Near is mistaken in believing the swap worked). The reasoning cannot continue indefinitely once you think you have found a mistake in your enemy and have deduced his object-level plan; that breaks the symmetry in reasoning. Errors and mistakes and bad luck are always highly likely. Of course, rather than being one level below Light in the hierarchy, Near was one level above, and willing to show up for the same reason, and won. This is ironic and adds some literary qualities to the otherwise confusing ending, because Near wins only by abandoning L's refusal to kill and by exploiting Light's belief that L's successor would live up to L. (I cover this in one of my other DN essays, [[https://www.gwern.net/Death%20Note%20Ending][on the ending]].)
