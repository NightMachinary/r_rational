Ok, how about why Light gets Misa? There's no real reason why she'd meet with him and fawn over him throughout pretty much the entire series, except to give him a super-loyal accomplice because he needs one because plot and fan service.

The scope of Light and L's actions pretty much fits into that first rule but the world around them tends to twist to suit the drama.
