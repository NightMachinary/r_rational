  Ok, how about why Light gets Misa? There's no real reason why she'd meet with him and fawn over him throughout pretty much the entire series, except to give him a super-loyal accomplice because he needs one because plot and fan service.

I'm pretty sure Misa was more of a hindrance to Light than a boon, at least at the beginning. Saying she existed solely to be convenient to him is... disingenuous.
