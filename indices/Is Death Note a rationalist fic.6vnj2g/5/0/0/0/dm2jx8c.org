Harry does at least attempt to investigate magic though so there's at least an attempt to give it some sort of rational basis. Further, discounting the scar "defense of love" thing which isn't really brought up in HPMOR IIRC, Harry is a random kid in the magical world, not someone specially chosen to be given an unstoppable force. He's not someone an outside force picked to be the main character, in other words.
