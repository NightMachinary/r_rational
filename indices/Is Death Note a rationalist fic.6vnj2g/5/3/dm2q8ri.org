    The fictional world has consistent rules, and sticks to them. More or less...Though the death note rules aren't all known in advance so the story doesn't 100% pass this bar.

I don't think /any/ RF story tells all the rules of its system in advance. In fact, Harry discovering the rules of magic via experimentation one of the central plot points of HPMOR.

I agree that sometimes the rules are introduced late enough that readers can't reach the same solution as the characters using previously-provided information, so DN wouldn't qualify as Rational/ist/, but it pretty clearly meets the RF criteria.
