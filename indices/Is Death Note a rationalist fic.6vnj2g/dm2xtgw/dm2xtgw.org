I think it's a bad idea to define "rationalist fic" as "good rationalist fic"; for one thing, that turns every dispute about quality into one about category. If the series is supposed to show character acting rationally, but the author misses some things, it should still count as a rationalist fic, although perhaps a poorly done rationalist fic.
