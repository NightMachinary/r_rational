The ending of the manga made no sense. It's not fresh in my mind, so here's something I wrote when it was:

#+begin_quote
  Why didn't Light know that Near knew that he knew that he knew that something was up?

  In the final showdown, what did Light think that Near thought that Light was thinking? Near wouldn't have come unless he replaced the Death Note with a fake. Light would know that, and thus wouldn't come unless the Death Note that was replaced was also a fake. Near would know that, and thus wouldn't come unless he replaced both the fake and the real one. That should continue forever making the final confrontation impossible, but somehow, Light missed that last step, and Near missed the one after that.
#+end_quote

Another way to look at it is Aumann's agreement theorem. They both had common knowledge. They both knew the other was pretty smart. So how could each expect to win the confrontation? Once they see the other fail to back out, they should start worrying themselves.

In general, the whole thing seemed to me like a bunch of people that thought they were smart doing stupid stuff. It was an attempt at a rationalist fic by someone trying to write characters that were smarter than they were.
