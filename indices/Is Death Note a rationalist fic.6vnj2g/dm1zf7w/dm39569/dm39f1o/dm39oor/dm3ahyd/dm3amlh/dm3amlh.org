  And this non-killer Near who underestimated Mikami and expected to win, why did he think Light would expect to win?
#+end_quote

Because he would simply trust Mikami as part of his plan, which is the assumption of a /single/ error which breaks symmetry. After a single error, the recursion is over, it's done, it doesn't infinitely regress. A single error ends the regression at that level and the plots unfold and they see which of them made the error. (Light did.)
