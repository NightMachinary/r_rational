What does the sidebar say?

  *Characteristics of Rational Fiction:*

  #+begin_quote
    Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. If characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason.

    Any factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".

    The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.

    The fictional world has consistent rules, and sticks to them.

  *In Rationalist Fiction:* As well as the above,

  #+begin_quote
    Rationalist and scientific methods are used to demystify mysterious phenomena.

    The story shows rationalist techniques, which can be applied by readers.

    The story is like a puzzle; readers can reach the same solution as the characters by using the information provided earlier in the story.

So:\\
- The story as a whole is rational; and\\
- L is a rationalist, but Light (unfortunately) is not, in the grand scheme, despite his minor experimentation on the minutiae of the Death Note's rules (IIRC).
