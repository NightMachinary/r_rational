  Could the reason been "He didn't expect there was a super intelligent detective guy who tracks people like him and have never ever prior to Kira existence been revealed"?

In-universe, L is globally famous, and everyone recognizes his name, which is why he needs to take such precautions to hide his face and voice etc. All the police know him instantly, IIRC.

Even if you grant that Light reasonably didn't know about L or suspect L would come after him, he certainly knew L was brilliant after L revealed how he had tricked Light with the Taylor TV trick, so mistakes 4 & 5 can't be covered by ignorance. Mistake 1 & 2 also do not require you to be worried about superintelligent adversaries, as timing and correlation attacks are rather ordinary things in computer security and law enforcement. Mistake 3, the TV trick, is a little more excusable since very few people would arrange something so clever - but merely responding to such an obvious provocation by getting angry is itself a serious mistake and demonstrates the hubris that would kill Light! No superintelligent detectives required.
