yeah, he should not have used heart attacks for the bulk of his killings. First step should have been to use the deathnote to acquire more traditional forms of power - money, political influence (possibly through proxies to avoid suspicion.) Market manipulation is a simple anonymous way to get started. (plane crash kills CEO of competitor to company you've invested in)

Quietly weeding out corrupt and immoral politicians and world leaders is a next logical step. You can do a lot more long term good reforming the system than just instilling general fear of punishment.

I'd actually like to read (maybe write) a rational fic with an honestly intelligent and utilitarian Light (not egocentric as depicted.) I know there are a few deathnote ratfics out there but haven't seen one that really captured me.
