See this [[https://www.gwern.net/Death%20Note%20Anonymity][essay]] that details how Light completely squandered his initial advantage of anonymity.

tl;dr:

  /Death Note/ is almost a thought-experiment---given the /perfect/ murder weapon, how can you screw up /anyway/?

  *Mistake 1:* Light's fundamental mistake is to kill in ways unrelated to his goal. Killing through heart attacks does not just make him visible early on, but the deaths reveals that his assassination method is supernaturally precise. L has been tipped off that Kira exists. Whatever the bogus justification may be, this is a major victory for his opponents. (To deter criminals and villains, it is not necessary for there to be a globally-known single supernatural killer, when it would be equally effective to arrange for all the killings to be done naturalistically by third parties/police/judiciary or used indirectly to crack cases.)

  *Mistake 2:* Worse, the deaths are non-random in other ways---they tend to occur at particular times! Just the scheduling of deaths cost Light 6 bits of anonymity!

  *Mistake 3:* Light's third mistake was reacting to the provocation of Lind L. Tailor. L narrowed his target down to 1/3 the original Japanese population, for a gain of ~1.6 bits.

  *Mistake 4:* Light's fourth mistake was to use confidential police information stolen using his policeman father's credentials. This mistake was the largest in bits lost. This mistake cost him 11 bits of anonymity; in other words, this mistake cost him /twice/ what his scheduling cost him and almost /8/ times the murder of Tailor!

  *Mistake 5:* If we assume Penbar was tasked 200 leads out of the 10,000, then murdering him and the fiancee dropped Light just 6 bits or a little over half the fourth mistake and comparable to the original scheduling mistake.

  *Endgame:* At this point in the plot, L resorts to direct measures and enters Light's life directly, enrolling at the university. From this point on, Light is screwed as he is now playing a deadly game of Mafia with L & the investigative team. He frittered away >25 bits of anonymity and then L intuited the rest and suspected him all along.
