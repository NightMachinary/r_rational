The silly thing is, if he's such a megalomaniac, why kill with heart attacks?

If I let the megalomaniac in me out, I wouldn't kill with heart attacks at all. I would pick a time every week (say, Sunday at 1:56pm GMT). Then I would write "X dies BY LIGHTNING on Sunday at 1:56pm GMT" for every X I wanted to kill. So every week there would be a mass lightning strike killing tons of criminals at the same time.

It would then become blatantly obvious that this was an act of god, smiting evil with purifying light.
