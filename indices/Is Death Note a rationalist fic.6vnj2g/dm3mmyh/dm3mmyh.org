Not even close.

I'm sure that more hardworking and insightful people than me have weighed in a hundred times over already in different parts of the internet, but Light was an idiot, and he was an idiot from the very first second he started killing convicted criminals. He was a lazy, stupid, idiot.

You don't change society by killing people who've already been tried and found guilty. Society's already caught them. Meaning that they were neither truly dangerous (since they got caught) or capable of distorting the system any longer. When's the last time we've seen an evil billionaire go to prison??? Light said that he wanted to make the world better, but I saw no evidence of a plan to do that, aside from killing people who committed obvious crimes and were /stupid/ enough to get caught doing it. What a stupid plan. What a waste of time.

No, to change things, you pinpoint the points of distortion in society (there are dozens, hundreds of these people - not the thousands to tens of thousands Light was killing. But it's hard to find them, and it takes a lot of hard, hard research. You never hear about the /really/ evil people. And /then/ you go to town on them, and do it in such a way (using the Death Note's more obscure powers over controlling the actions of people in the moments prior to death), that you never get caught. You don't let people even /begin/ to suspect that there's a supernatural killer on the loose.

But, no, that would have been a boring story to watch. A competent Light would never even have attracted L's direct interest.
