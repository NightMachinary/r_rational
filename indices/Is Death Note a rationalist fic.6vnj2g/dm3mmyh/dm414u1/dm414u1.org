Several points:

1. Light was operating on a theory of deterrence. He wasn't literally trying to kill /all/ the criminals out there; he was trying to kill enough of them that the rest would start fearing the wrath of this mysterious god capable of striking down evildoers with heart attacks, and stop committing crimes /because/ of that fear. At the same time, he was attempting to create a social and cultural setting in which crime would have been discouraged to a far greater degree than it currently is, and criminals pursued and punished with a far greater fervor. (This secondary aim is the main reason Kira exists, aside from Light's own hubris.)
2. In the very first episode of /Death Note/, Light mentions killing non-criminals that are nonetheless "leeches on society" (or a similar term; I don't remember the particular phrase he used) using accidents and diseases. This is more or less what you say he /should/ have done in your comment, but you don't seem to have realized that /he did this as well/. People simply focus on the "Kira" aspect of his killings because, well, that's what stands out the most, and because that was what L focused on.
3. The reason Light didn't target high-ranking, influential people at the beginning of the series was because Kira was a relatively new phenomenon that, despite having /some/ public support, didn't have /nearly/ enough to pull this kind of thing off. Had Light showed willingness to kill, not just lowly criminals, but high-ranking people as well, there would have been a backlash from practically every country in the world. This not only makes it much more likely for Kira to get caught, it also interferes with his plan to create a society that accepts Kira as their god. Note that in the second arc of the story, Light (or rather, Mikami under Light's direction) /does/ in fact target people in high places, because at that point Kira has accumulated enough public support that he can /get away/ with that.
4. Calling Light a "lazy, stupid idiot" is more than a little exaggerated, and I don't like that kind of rhetoric; it's the sort of thing you might find on SpaceBattles. (In fact, what immediately came to mind upon reading your comment was the massive Cauldron debates they like to have, most of which contain very little in the way of actual content, but a great deal of "lol Cauldron was fuckin' dumb".) Using high-intensity words too frequently drains them of their meaning; if you're calling /Light Yagami/ an "idiot", what word will you use for /actual/ idiots?
