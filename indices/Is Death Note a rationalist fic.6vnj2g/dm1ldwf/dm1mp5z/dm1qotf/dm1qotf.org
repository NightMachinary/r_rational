He did intentionally reveal it. He purposely showed that Kira knew inside police information.

This wasn't technically a mistake, but rather a gambit/sacrifice. Light was hoping that by revealing that Kira has police connections, L would suspect the police, and the police would suspect L, and may then drag L up to the surface for light to kill. And it did work (in the anime), Light eventually got to kill L thanks to this gambit.

Light's true mistake is bothering to fight L in the first place. Just let L keep bragging about being unkillable.
