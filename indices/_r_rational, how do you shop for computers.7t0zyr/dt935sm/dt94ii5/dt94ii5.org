I want to keep the laptop for at least three years. I don't care about weight, but it shouldn't be larger than a foot. Battery life isn't particularly important since outlets are so plentiful at the university, even in classrooms. SSDs are cool but I'd do without if it's significantly cheaper. $1000 is probably the upper limit. As for choosing between processor and RAM, I didn't think those traded against each other, but just on price. Probably processor over RAM. Colors over refresh rate.
