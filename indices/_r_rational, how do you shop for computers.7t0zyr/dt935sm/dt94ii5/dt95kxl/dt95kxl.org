Yes, this is more useful information. I don't know much about buying laptops, so I can't really help you in choosing one, but this is the sort of information you should present up front when asking. Oh, and I didn't mean "processor or RAM" as in either or but not both, I just meant do you want either of them. Same for the screen.

Also, $1000 is really low to say that you don't care about the cost. $1000 will get you a good laptop, but not top of the line or anything.
