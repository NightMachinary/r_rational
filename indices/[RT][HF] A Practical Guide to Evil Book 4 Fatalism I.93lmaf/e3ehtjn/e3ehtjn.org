  Especially the Black Queen and her cadre of wicked fae and perfidious villains, served willingly by her armies of Callowan heretics.

I love this chapter. It highlights just how unaccustomed the Proceran nobility is to the kind of warfare that's typically waged in Callow and Praes. We get to see that Cordelia really would follow up on her promises and probably leave Callow alone (alas fractured) and that her grasp on the crusade is tremulous at best.
