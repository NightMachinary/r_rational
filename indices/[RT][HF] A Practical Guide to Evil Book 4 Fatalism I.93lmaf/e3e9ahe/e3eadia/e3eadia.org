So Cordelia off handedly approving this religious conference somehow had metaphysical consequences I'm guessing, since I'm assuming that this is the same conference where the whole excommunication stuff from last chapter came from. By giving her approval, she obligated her nation toward enforcing Above's decree, possibly in the same way that the Lone Swordsman's plan would have done for Callow. And once that happens, Cordelia would lose all control since people would stop acting like rational people with free will and more like brainwashed zealots.
