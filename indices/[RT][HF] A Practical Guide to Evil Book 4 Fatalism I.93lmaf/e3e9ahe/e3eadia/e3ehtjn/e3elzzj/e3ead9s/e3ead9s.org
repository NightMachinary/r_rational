I love how sympathetic the First Prince is. She could never be a protagonist - too trapped in her own plots and her confederacy's politics to have an entertaining amount of control over her destiny - but she is clever and steadfast and neither selfish nor cruel. The sort of benevolent dictator any country might wish for in times of such turmoil.

And what a brilliant foil for Catherine: Born into (not quite) absolute power, but hobbled everywhere by unfortunate knowledge and fair play.
