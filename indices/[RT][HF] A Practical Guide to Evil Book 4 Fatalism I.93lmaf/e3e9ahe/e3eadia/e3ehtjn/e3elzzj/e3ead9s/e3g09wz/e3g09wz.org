I dunno, Cordelia seems like she's only nominally on the side of Good because she was born into a powerful position in a nation that is itself Good-aligned. She's motivated to carry out the Crusade not because she wants Evil vanquished in Calernia or Callow liberated, but just because she wants to use it to consolidate her own power. She's not upset that Amadis and Klaus were defeated because it means the cause of Good has been stalled, but because it weakens her position in the Grand Alliance.

It strikes me that if you switched Cordelia and Malicia, not much would actually change. Both just want their nations stable, powerful, and under their complete control. They even have the same flaw of thinking they know all the rules of the game, and getting surprised when Catherine breaks them to get what she wants.
