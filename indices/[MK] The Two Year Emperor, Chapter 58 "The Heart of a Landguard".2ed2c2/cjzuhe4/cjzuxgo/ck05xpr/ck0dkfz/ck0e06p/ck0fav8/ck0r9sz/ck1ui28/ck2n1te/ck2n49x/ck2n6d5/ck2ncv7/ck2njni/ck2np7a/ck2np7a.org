They hold the copyright for D&D, but it's easy to reskin it to avoid use of their copyrighted material. Stop calling it "Mage's Magnificent Mansion" (which is already a genericified version of "Mordenkainen's Magnificent Mansion") and call it "Ethereal Abode" and you're all good. Obviously, also remove mention of specific elements such as "move actions" etc.

If you go over to [[http://greendogpress.blogspot.com]] you'll find that I'm selling "One Hot Night", a novella spun off from 2YE. It's based in Anundj√• in the Time Before. The premise is that Ingfred is a young man in his late 20s, living in a society where everyone is immortal. He's got no great prospects, but he's got an entrepreneurial spirit and a fire in his belly. He comes up with a get-rich-quick plan: undergo a somewhat illegal transformation, then sell the memory to The Experiential Herald for a fortune. He has two problems: how can he convince Master High Mage Calder to risk his Mage license by doing the transformation...and how does he deal with the legal problems afterwards?

It's on sale for $1; I wrote it as the MVP to see if anyone would pay for my writing. I've had a few sales so far and the feedback I've received has been positive.
