  Got bored and found the Gray Linnrom in MMII (pg141) which is a CR20 dragon with only 13HD. [...] Only downside is they are huge so it will take polymorph any object instead of polymorph other if the FLEA is going to run on worms.

I realized after the fact that Polymorph Other doesn't actually work. :( It can only change something by one size category; worms are Fine and fire giants are Large, so that doesn't fit. So, I guess the FLEA runs on PAO until I can find a Dimunitive creature with a high enough CR to be worth it.

Problem with the Gray Linnorm: it has SR and DR 15/+1. The wall of force isn't a +1 or better weapon, so it can't actually hurt a GL. Which is stupid but that's why they call it Stupidworld.

[[http://monsterfinder.dndrunde.de/]] tells me that there are several (Fine or Diminutive) creatures with CR(6-15), but all of them are swarms and so not good candidates.

Could use black puddings, I suppose. They split, and if you can keep feeding them temporary HP so they stay above 10 HP, then you can split them indefinitely.

As to the rate of caster increase -- the new ones need to rest and rememorize before they can participate, or it would be truly ridiculous. Although...hm. The Landguard all have Fortifying Bedrolls (which is why Duncan can do a 23-hour/day punishment schedule). If they loaned those out to the new casters, you could have the noobs online in 2 hours. That's pretty sick. Wow.
