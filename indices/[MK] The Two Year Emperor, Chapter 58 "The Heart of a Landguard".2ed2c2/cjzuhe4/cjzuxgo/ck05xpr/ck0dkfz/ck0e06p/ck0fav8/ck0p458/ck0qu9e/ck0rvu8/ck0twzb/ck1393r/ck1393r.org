On DR: "The creature takes normal damage from energy attacks (even nonmagical ones), spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities."

Wall of force doesnt allow SR and is a spell so no problem there.

If it wasnt a spell, DR 15/+1 only stops the first 15 points of damage from a wall of force. Infinite-15 will still do the trick.
