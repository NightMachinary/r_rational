About 28 million. The demographics are very different, however. Anundj√• is comprised of a bunch of refugees from an apocalypse; character-leveled folks have been selected for, especially casters and especially casters of high enough level to teleport away from, or blow the crap out of, the things that are trying to suck out their tasty lifeforce. Also, there has been a ton of combat, so they have leveled pretty quickly.

Flobovia, on the other hand, is a country of rich farmers and merchants that hasn't had anything more dangerous than a few bandit raids in centuries. Furthermore, it was settled by a bunch of refugees from the fall of Ainaalacar; the area they settled was uninhabited and out in the boondocks when they got there (that's why they chose that place), so there aren't really any ancient ruins or long-lost dungeons to explore. The ones that there /were/ have been picked over pretty thoroughly in the last 5800 years, so any adventurers that do come along have to leave the country to find any adventures worth the name.

Most Flobovians who gain class levels are doing it with an eye towards commerce: lots of fighters for caravan guards, bodyguards, etc. Lots of thieves because there's craptons of money floating around. (Even before Jake broke the economy.) Casters are mostly priests, and most people have strong local ties -- family and businesses -- that mean they don't go adventuring, so they level relatively slowly.

Flobovia is 28 million. Of that, about 0.1% (28,000) have character levels. Of THOSE, only about 10% (2,800) are casters -- most are some sort of martial class or rogues. Of casters, it's a 30/70 split between arcane and divine (840 arcane) and the level percentages skew heavily to the bottom: about 70% from levels 1-7, 29% from levels 8-14, and 1% levels 15+. In short, when Jake arrived he was greeted by 3 of the 8 Archmagi in the entire country.

It's a little better on the divine side, but not much. 2800 casters, 70% divine (1960), and the levels go about the same: 70/29/1, meaning in the entire country you have about 20 clerics and druids of levels 15+. And the druids mostly stay out in the woods and don't interact with people very much. The Archpriest and the Dark Lady are the only people in Capital City capable of casting True Resurrection.
