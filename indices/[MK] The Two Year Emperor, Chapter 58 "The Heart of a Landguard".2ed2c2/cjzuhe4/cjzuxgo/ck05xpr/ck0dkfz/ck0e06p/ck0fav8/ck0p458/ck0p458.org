Is having class levels really important with the FLEA though? A level 1 commoner (3.5 doesnt have level 0s) gains xp just like anyone else and with the stat bonus they get from leveling even the average 10 int commoner will be able to cast 6th+ level spells. Tack on a +3 headband so they can wishx3 the next commoner-wizard to 19 int and carry it down the line to get entire populations of archmages.
