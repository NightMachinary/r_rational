I think high level wizards are probably a lot like nukes: You want to think /very carefully/ about how many you keep around, even if, in theory, you could have as many as you want.

(Last I checked, the wizards are already a bit unhappy with Jake. This scheme should ultimately not help that, as it doesn't help any of them gain economic advantage over the other, it just raises /all/ their abilities a fixed amount, meaning that Jake has just greatly enhanced their ability to express their unhappiness destructively.)
