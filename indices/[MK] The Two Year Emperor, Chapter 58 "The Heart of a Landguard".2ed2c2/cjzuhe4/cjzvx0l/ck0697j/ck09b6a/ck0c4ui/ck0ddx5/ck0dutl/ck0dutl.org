Thanks for explaining. How does someone get anywhere near 45 intelligence? Is there a feasible way for Jake to do it? And this means that FLEA could potentially grow even faster. Would it be useful to get some high level people in other classes? Or would that just be a waste of potential wizard?

And is there a way for the other 95% to get character levels?

Incidentally, did Jake investigate getting class levels off screen? It seems the obvious first thing to check after he arrived, but I can't recall him doing so
