Would making a spell which affects a single thing a mass spell count as an improvement? Such as, say, Mass PAO. So as to make FLEA even more overpowered.

And as magic items appear to be able to cast limitless spells, could Jake make one to cast Mage's Magnificent Mansion? Given Grofhamr's housing problem. Is there a limit to what level spells an item can cast for him? Because a resurrection wand or an Hourglass of Time Stop seem pretty useful. Could he create an Improved Resurrection which took care of the surprises left by Neklos? Or would that be too large an improvement? And does an improved spell need a higher spell level or cost?

Presumably it couldn't cast infinite Ice Assassins for him though or any other spell with XP cost. Can magic items grant XP or stat points? Or create more magic items? Plus, this seems a definite improvement on spell engines, as they can be customized.

EDIT: Also, is there a limit to how many different kinds of spells an item can cast? It's at least 2, given the Rule of Size, but could you create a, say, Book of Self Improvement which cast every buff spell Jake could find?
