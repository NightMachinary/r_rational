  What limits would there be on these spells? For instance, could you create a level one spell with no XP cost identical to wish? Or one which would ascend you to godhood, or increase your level by 1? These would of course utterly break the story, but everything we've seen so far doesn't indicate any limit.

I forgot to answer this bit.

So far as I'm aware, D&D has basically no rules for researching new spells. There are a couple of mentions of it, but it pretty much comes down to "DM choice." I'm trying to mostly stick with canon rules, so I'll probably do "you can't Wish for spells that are more than slightly improved versions of existing ones" or something like that. Haven't decided yet.

But, yeah, Wishing up too powerful a spell == get bonked by a god. Probably Arros.
