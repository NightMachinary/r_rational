Well, these new mages can cast Wish. And according to the wiki, that can create magical items. So, could that be a shortcut to make spell engines?

Also, given that Jake appeared to make up spells when creating the Rule of Size, and they now work, could those be learned when people go up a level? And could this then be used to make arbitrary spells? Or were those spells already real spells?
