Yes, if there is no 'denying the antecedent', then Thomas is under no obligation to do Y.

My hypothesis meant to explain Thomas's insistence on /not/ doing Y by assuming that he somehow /is/ under an obligation to do not-Y. (If this is not the case, then of course the hypothesis fails.)

Searching for a cause of the postulated obligation, I looked at the vow. The form is basically "If you do as I say, then I will be good to you." So the DTA postulated is the use of this reasoning:

- If you do as I say, I will be good to you.
- You are not doing as I say.
- Therefore, I won't be good to you.

As denying the antecedent, this is logically invalid---but it is a /pragmatically/ likely outcome: normally if someone says "if you stop now, I won't hit you", there's usually an unspoken "if you don't stop now, I /will/ hit you" to be inferred. Thomas' explicitly referencing intent would make this reading possible, but given that it's you I'm having this conversation with, I suppose it is unlikely. :p

(I tried to make the example parallel to yours but it looks like your example is straightforwardly a valid /modus tollens/.)
