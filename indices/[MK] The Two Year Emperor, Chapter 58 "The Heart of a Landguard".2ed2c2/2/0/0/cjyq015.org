Thanks for the reminder. But it doesn't really explain Thomas' sudden, specific insistence. It would explain more if Thomas had been this insistent right from the start.

In case what I said before wasn't specific enough: "Is there some reason to believe that, when Icefi sacrifices all the knowledge he got from Jake, that Jake will lose all of that knowledge too, leaving him merely a clever person with no special knowledge?"

Of course, there is also the question of who gets the 'credit' ("share" in Herrun) for the knowledge. I suspect this is Icefi, and the credit would be quite substantial for that amount of rarefied knowledge.
