  Thanks for the reminder. But it doesn't really explain Thomas' sudden, specific insistence.
#+end_quote

I assumed it was a consequence of the unbreakable vow he'd just gotten done making:

#+begin_quote
  "Allow your alignment to be changed and I will recall the magi. Allow your alignment to be changed and I will prevent these messages from being sent in future, so long as you and all of yours maintain faith with us and do not cast yourselves against us. I swear on the Land, and in the name of the True God of Flobovia, to keep my faith with thee, [...] I bind my honor and my soul in earnest to this vow: my word is good, my intent is without deceit, I shall not waver from its completion."
#+end_quote

Afi wouldn't allow his alignment to be changed, therefore the leniency that Thomas vowed would come from doing so will not be granted. (Logically this would be "denying the antecedent" but the oath having wording like "my intent is without deceit" suggests it's do-what-I-mean, not do-what-I-say.)
