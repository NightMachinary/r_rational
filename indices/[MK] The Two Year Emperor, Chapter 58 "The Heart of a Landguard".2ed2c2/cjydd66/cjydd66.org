I'm taking a trip where I won't have internet soon. I've already downloaded the newest chapter to my phone, but /damn/, it's hard to resist reading it until then.

Urge to read... rising.

Also, Nat20 and Overlady had recent updates. It's like trying to resist eating a piece of cake that's /just sitting there/, right in front of me. [[/celestia][]]
