  But they become sentient when their Int hits 3, so all we need is a mass-produced way to give +2 to intelligence. (Suggestions welcome.)

Simple. Get a +2 Headband of Intellect, give it to the first guy and have him sacrifice everything, then drop it into the hands of the next guy. Lather, rinse, repeat, commoner railgun.

  Polymorph Other might even be superfluous; depends whether non-humans can contribute towards the god's totals. If they do, Deadboy's massive army of undead must exist for precisely this reason.

Anything sentient enough to make a sacrifice or offer a prayer can help. As you surmise, that's why Neklos is so incredibly powerful right now -- he converted a billion people (plus an unknown but large number of Underdark dwellers) into undead who worship him. He's not curbstomping the other gods, but that's only because they are working together to keep him at bay.
