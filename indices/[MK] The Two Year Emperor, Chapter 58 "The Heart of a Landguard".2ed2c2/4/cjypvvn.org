That's not where I thought he was going with the worms.

I'd thought he was going to polymorph them into humans, to get more worshippers for Team Life. Rob Deadboy of his share of the prayers by sheer numbers. On close inspection of Polymorph Other, that doesn't work - Polymorph Other doesn't affect the mind, so they'd be humans with an Int of 1. Too low to be sentient.

But they become sentient when their Int hits 3, so all we need is a mass-produced way to give +2 to intelligence. (Suggestions welcome.) Polymorph Other might even be superfluous; depends whether non-humans can contribute towards the god's totals. If they do, Deadboy's massive army of undead must exist for /precisely this reason/.

I can't find any information on what a worm's Wisdom and Charisma scores are - I'm only guessing that their Int is 1 because animal intelligence is always 1 or 2 and worms are not particularly bright animals.

Oh, I know this isn't a very Lawful Good approach to the war, and in fact is utterly horrifying on many levels. Still, if nothing else you could sacrifice the plan to Herun.
