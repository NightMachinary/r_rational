  It's a brutal, ugly, vile spell, with a name that quite suits it. But it's probably not in fitting with the story you want to tell to have that word be used.

I dunno about you, but to me 'Mindscrape' brings to mind images of a jagged rock being dragged across someone's wet brain. Pretty vile, ugly, and brutal to me. :)

Minor spoiler: I'm actually planning to have some of the new Archmagi pick up Mindscrape.

And yes, it's less of a save-or-die and more or a save-or-lose-and-become-the-enemy-of-all-you-stand-for.
