Huh. So if that's how /Mindscrape/ works, Ice Afi One could use /Mindscrape/ on Ice Afi Two in order to spread the knowledge - so removing it from the leader might not be enough. Though I suppose that there are good reasons not to spread the knowledge too far, and letting another creature learn all of your secrets is terrible, even if they're an exact clone of you. Also also, /Mindscrape/ gives a lot of fodder for secrets that you can junk - gather up a thousand people, /Mindscrape/ them, then have all the ice clones /Mindscrape/ each other, then have them each dump a thousand people's worth of secrets into the ritual.

And I just now realized that /Mindscrape/ is probably a renamed [[http://dndtools.eu/spells/book-of-vile-darkness--37/mindrape--165/][/Mindrape/]], which is one of the most terrifying spells in existence.
