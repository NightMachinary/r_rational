(I'm away from my books at the moment so roll wih me if I have the specific numbers wrong -- the point still stands.)

I've always been a bit confused by the XP charts. It says that it requires (e.g.) 1000 XP to reach level 2 and 3000 XP to reach level 3. I've had some people tell me that these numbers are lifetime totals (meaning that you become level 3 when you earn your 3000th XP). I've had other people tell me that these are level increments (meaning that you become level 3 when you have earned 1000+3000=4000 XP). I'm not sure who is right, but I am ruling that the numbers are level increments.

Assuming that these are level increments, it takes 360,000 XP to reach level 13. (If I remember the number right -- three hundred something anyway.)

If I'm wrong and those are only lifetime totals, then just assume there were fewer Fire Giants on the platform. Oh and, next next time? We take our newly minted 13th level folk and create a bunch of Fomorian Queens for them to drop. Voila: 17th level Archmagi. The only reason I didn't go straight there is because the XP charts won't handle encounters between 1st level chars and 18h level threats, and the needed number of fire giants was prohibitive.
