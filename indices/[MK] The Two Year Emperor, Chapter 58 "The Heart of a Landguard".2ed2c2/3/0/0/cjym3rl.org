Just for future reference, those are indeed lifetime totals. The XP needed to reach the next level is always (Current level*1000). So 1000 to go 1-2, 2000 to go 2-3, thus 3000xp lifetime at level 3. Page 22 of the PHB has all this, unfortunately it is not part of the srd so I cant link to it.

As well the Epic level handbook goes into some of the xp formulas which work for everything but the very low range which the writers seem to have tweaked a bit. We can work out that base XP is CRx300 at CR=ECL, for every 2 CR above ECL the XP doubles (x1.5 for +1CR). CR below ECL works the same way in reverse.

A single fomorian queen (CR17) would give a single ECL17 character 17x300xp = 5100 xp which lines up with the chart. To find the xp that encounter would give a ECL1 character we can start with a CR1 encounter (1*300), then recognize that we are adding +2CR eight times (x2^{8} ) to get XP = 1x300x2^{8} = 76800xp for our ECL1 character. Of course ECL1 is in the weird grouped line so the table doesnt line up perfectly with the formula, but Ill just go for text trumping table and ignore the stupid table.
