  Just for future reference, those are indeed lifetime totals [...] Page 22 of the PHB has all this, unfortunately it is not part of the srd so I cant link to it.

Well, taking advantage of fair use, I'm going to quote one sentence:

"This column on Table 3--2 shows the experience point total needed to attain a given character level---that is, the total of all the character's level in classes."

I would prefer that this be a lifetime total -- it would mean that the FLEA would need a less ridiculous number of giants while still giving as good or better results -- but I'm still having trouble with the text. "The XP total to attain a given character level" -- that could mean either lifetime total or increment. Is there anything you can point to that clarifies it? If so, I would happily retcon it to work like that, but I'd prefer not to unless I was sure.

I read the info in the Epic Handbook and you're right -- it lets you figure out the award for any challenge. Three problems though:

- It gives the number, but doesn't speak to the total / increment question
- 2YE explicitly disregards all epic content, so this isn't part of the setting. I wouldn't feel too badly about saying "this isn't epic, it's just an explanation of the system so it's in", but...
- 2YE works off of RAW, and the info in the EHB only has RAW about levels 21 and up. The formulas can trivially be adapted to figure out what a 1st level vs 17 CR award would be, but that's RAI, not RAW.
