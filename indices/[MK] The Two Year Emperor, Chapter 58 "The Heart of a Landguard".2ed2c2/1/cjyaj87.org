Chapter drop.

Note: This is the closest I've come to missing deadline since the story started. (It's 11pm on Saturday where I am.) I've been driving most of the week, which prevented me from getting any writing done, and my muse was remarkably useless yesterday, meaning that I had to write basically all of this today. Note to self: don't do that.
