Grofhamr is 3 million, Flobovia is 28. Assuming that 70% of those are adults then yes, about 20 million megamages. Given time. They can only run 14400 people through per day per FLEA, so even setting up a lot of these things it would take some time.

The Lich Kings converted a society of 1 billion people, plus a large but unknown number of Underdark dwellers. Many of those had character levels and, being functionally immortal, many of them were quite high level. These people were preferentially targeted for conversion during the initial blitzkrieg. Exact numbers aren't available, but it's safe to assume that the Lich Kings have AT LEAST 50 million mid- or high-level casters.
