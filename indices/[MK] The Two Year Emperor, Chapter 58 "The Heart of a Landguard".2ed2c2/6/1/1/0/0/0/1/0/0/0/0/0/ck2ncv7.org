  Should FLEA not grow exponentially? Each caster can cast 8-12 PAO spells a day, they use around 30 per person, so the total should grow by around a third a day. Assuming that he leaves most of the casters in FLEA until it is finished, and infinite earthworms, and no PAO wand

Yes, true. I'll have to do the math to see how long it takes.

  Also, i believe you mentioned that this is only day 17. It feels way longer. Do you have plans for a time skip or anything like that? Because when it was established that Jake has a limited time to rule, i presumed that that would be relevant later, but at this rate you will never reach 2 years

"Feels longer" => good. That means there's been a lot of engaging elements. :)

Timeskip: I plan to finish the Drauga War cycle. I may or may not continue on after that. If I did, I would probably try to make some money off it, through a Patreon or such. Writing 2YE takes a LOT of my time and energy; I've been doing it for a year now, and I'm starting to think that a break would be nice after I finish this. Then again, I didn't expect to end up writing a 250,000 word epic when I sat down to write "a fun little D&D short story." We'll see what happens.
