Should FLEA not grow exponentially? Each caster can cast 8-12 PAO spells a day, they use around 30 per person, so the total should grow by around a third a day. Assuming that he leaves most of the casters in FLEA until it is finished, and infinite earthworms, and no PAO wand

Also, i believe you mentioned that this is only day 17. It feels way longer. Do you have plans for a time skip or anything like that? Because when it was established that Jake has a limited time to rule, i presumed that that would be relevant later, but at this rate you will never reach 2 years
