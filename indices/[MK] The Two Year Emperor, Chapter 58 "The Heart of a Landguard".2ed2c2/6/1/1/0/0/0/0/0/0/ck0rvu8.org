Got bored and found the Gray Linnrom in MMII (pg141) which is a CR20 dragon with only 13HD. It has a fly speed and some spells, but since everything happens with readied actions on a suprise round while it is flat-footed it cant save itself from the FLEA.

Only downside is they are huge so it will take polymorph any object instead of polymorph other if the FLEA is going to run on worms. Of course PAO doesnt require a creature so you could skip the worms and use pebbles. Worm into giant Wyrm is a bit more amusing though.

Killing one of them would give a 1st level character: 1x300x2^{9} x1.5=230,400xp. Just one of them will turn a 1st level into a 21st, almost 22nd, level character.

If we wanted that commoner to become a commoner 1/wizard 20/archivist 20 (ECL41) they will need 820,000xp. 4 gray linnroms and they will have significant xp leftover. And since both wizard and archivist use int as their casting stat, our commoner can sink all 10 of their leveling stat boosts into it for 20int.

Four eighth level spells to get a dual 9th level caster with access to the arcane sor/wiz spell list and /all/ divine spells. Before bonus spells a 20th wizard has 4 8th level spell slots, an archivist has 5 (and cleric trickery domain gets PAO). So we can more than triple the number of dual 9 casters every day. Oh and with their obscene amount of leftover xp, why not have them all wish themselves +5 inherent in every stat and make a +6 belt of magnificence while they are at it.

If only we could run them through the dweomerkeeper prestige class to get 4/day wish with no xp cost...
