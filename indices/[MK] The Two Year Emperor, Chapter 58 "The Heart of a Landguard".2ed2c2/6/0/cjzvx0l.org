Wizard spell progression caps out pretty fast. By 20th level you have 4 spell slots per level base, plus an additional 1-3 (ish) based on your Intelligence. So, yeah. Not all that many times per day.

But! You've got Polymorph Other (4th level) and Polymorph Any Object (8th level), +both of which can be used to power to FLEA+. [EDIT: Only PAO. PO can't produce an output critter more than one size category larger than the input critter, so worm => fire giant is a no-go.] So you can, in fact, grow your supply of wizards pretty damn fast. And each one that you FLEAify can, after 9 hours (8 to sleep, 1 to memorize) cast more PAO +and POs+ to help other people crank up. So, yeah, you can grow the supply pretty damn fast.

Spell engines come in several flavors: resetting magic traps, spell turrets, spell clocks. They have slight differences, but the basic idea is the same: they cast a specific spell at a specific frequency (1/round, 1/hour, 1/day, etc). You can't change the spell. It isn't specified, but I rule that you cannot put a spell that requires XP into a spell engine, so you can't have a spell engine casting (e.g.) Ice Assassin or Wish. Also, you must make all decisions about the spell engine when you create it. You can't set it up to "use True Creation to create whatever I want at the time" you have to set it to "use True Creation to create a longsword". And all of those longswords will be exactly identical.

The other problem with spell engines is that they take a long time to make. An engine that casts a 4th level spell takes almost a month -- the entire story so far is currently on day 17, where day 1 was when Jake arrived.
