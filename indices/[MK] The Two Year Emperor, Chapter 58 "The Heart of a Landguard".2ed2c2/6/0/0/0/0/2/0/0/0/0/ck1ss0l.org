  By granting stat points, I meant could an item permanently grant a stat boost, not just while it is equipped?
#+end_quote

Yes. There's a series of items called "Manual of Bodily Health", "Tome of <X>", etc that grant inherent bonuses to stats. They take a week to read though.

  Or cast stat boosting spells, which could work on multiple people.
#+end_quote

Yep, those can be done.

  Also, was the caster level of 1000 a result of Jake using a wish ring rather than casting a spell? Or could a new mage do the same?
#+end_quote

A magic item that you make normally, the caster level is the level of the mage creating it. Something created with a Wish (from spell or item) can have whatever limit you want. (I think. There might be some rules about that, but none that I'm aware of.)

  And could a pre filled XP battery be wished into existence? Or used to transfer XP between people?
#+end_quote

Yes. Also, when crafting magic items you can have multiple people cooperate so that one person pays the XP and another does the casting or etc.

  Also, if Jake begins creating more items, a PAO wand would be extremely useful. And if improved spells require a higher level, can 9th level spells not be improved? And can an item cast spells with an XP or material competent?
#+end_quote

Respectively: True, correct, and sort of. By default, an item has no XP in it so it cannot be used to cast spells that require XP. That said, you can create an item that has XP in it. See the author's note at the bottom of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9669819/26/The-Two-Year-Emperor][Chapter 26]]

  Jake getting Wisdom or Charisma would break the story, but might make an amusing omake, where he ROFL-stomps all his enemies and ascends to godhood. Which I would totally love to read. Just putting that out there
#+end_quote

Heh. Yeah, that could be fun. Maybe I'll do that.
