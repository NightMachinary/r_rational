  Would making a spell which affects a single thing a mass spell count as an improvement? Such as, say, Mass PAO. So as to make FLEA even more overpowered.
#+end_quote

Yes, but Mass PAO would be over the limit. Thinking about it, I'm getting more and more edgy about the idea of custom spells. I think I'm going to have to trot Arros out pretty early on in the process.

#+begin_quote
  And as magic items appear to be able to cast limitless spells, could Jake make one to cast Mage's Magnificent Mansion?
#+end_quote

Yep. And it would be a great choice.

#+begin_quote
  Is there a limit to what level spells an item can cast for him?
#+end_quote

Nope.

#+begin_quote
  Because a resurrection wand or an Hourglass of Time Stop seem pretty useful.
#+end_quote

They're already having enough issues with resurrections that an item of it would probably be unwise. Hourglass of Time Stop would be hella powerful -- Jake thought about putting that into the Eternal Hourglass when he first created it, but decided not to because he didn't want to cross the line with the gods.

#+begin_quote
  Could he create an Improved Resurrection which took care of the surprises left by Neklos?
#+end_quote

Nope. Gods trump mortal magic every time.

#+begin_quote
  And does an improved spell need a higher spell level or cost?
#+end_quote

Yep.

#+begin_quote
  Can magic items grant XP
#+end_quote

Two responses:\\
* Magic items can act as an XP battery; you create them with XP and then you draw it out for various purposes. * Stop reading ahead. :P

#+begin_quote
  [can magic items grant] stat points?
#+end_quote

Yes. That's what the Headband of Intellect does.

#+begin_quote
  Or create more magic items?
#+end_quote

There aren't any canon items that do that, but there's no reason you couldn't Wish one up...except that generating infinite (or very large numbers) of magic items seems like the sort of thing that the gods would step on.

#+begin_quote
  Plus, this seems a definite improvement on spell engines, as they can be customized.
#+end_quote

Spell engines are, by definition, customized. You create it to cast whatever spell you want. Although, yes, you're right -- a magic item can fine-tune the effect at the actual moment of casting.

#+begin_quote
  EDIT: Also, is there a limit to how many different kinds of spells an item can cast? It's at least 2, given the Rule of Size, but could you create a, say, Book of Self Improvement which cast every buff spell Jake could find?
#+end_quote

There is no canon restriction, no. And there is actually something called a Belt of Magnificence that add +(2,4, or 6) to all of your stats.

It would make a lot of sense to give Jake Wisdom or Charisma boosts. Sadly, doing so would turn him into a Mary Sue and make the story boring. He has two character flaws: he doesn't think things through and, unless he's really focusing on it, he's not very good in social situations. Giving him Wis and Cha boosts would mechanically remove those flaws and remove all real challenge from the story.
