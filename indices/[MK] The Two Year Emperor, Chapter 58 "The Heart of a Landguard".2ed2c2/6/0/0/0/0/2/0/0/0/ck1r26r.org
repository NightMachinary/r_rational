By granting stat points, I meant could an item permanently grant a stat boost, not just while it is equipped? Or cast stat boosting spells, which could work on multiple people. Also, was the caster level of 1000 a result of Jake using a wish ring rather than casting a spell? Or could a new mage do the same?

And could a pre filled XP battery be wished into existence? Or used to transfer XP between people?

Also, if Jake begins creating more items, a PAO wand would be extremely useful. And if improved spells require a higher level, can 9th level spells not be improved? And can an item cast spells with an XP or material competent?

Jake getting Wisdom or Charisma would break the story, but might make an amusing omake, where he ROFL-stomps all his enemies and ascends to godhood. Which I would totally love to read. Just putting that out there
