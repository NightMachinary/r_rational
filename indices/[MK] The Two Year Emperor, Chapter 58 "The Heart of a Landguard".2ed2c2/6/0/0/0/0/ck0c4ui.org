What limits would there be on these spells? For instance, could you create a level one spell with no XP cost identical to wish? Or one which would ascend you to godhood, or increase your level by 1? These would of course utterly break the story, but everything we've seen so far doesn't indicate any limit. Another visit from Ilara perhaps?

The description for PO says

#+begin_quote
  The new form can range in size from Diminutive to one size larger than the subject's normal form, and can have no more Hit Dice than you have, or that the subject has (whichever is greater), and in any case the assumed form cannot have more than 15 Hit Dice
#+end_quote

But fire giants have way more hit dice than 15. Would FLEA still work so well with weaker monsters if they used PO?

The wiki says that you get a maximum of 4 spell slots for each spell level. Assuming this cannot be increased, that would mean you can make 24 mages with PO or 8 with PAO a day, from a group of around 30. You have said that PO works, so that's 5/3 times the total mages a day. I love this idea. If they're left for a week that would be a 35 times increase
