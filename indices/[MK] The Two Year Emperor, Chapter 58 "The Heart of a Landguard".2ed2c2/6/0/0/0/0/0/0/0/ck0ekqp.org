You can get an Int in the range of ~30 by having an 18 to start (optionally plus a racial bonus) +5 inherent bonus (Tome of X, or 5 Wishes), and then having a +6 magic item like a Headband of Intellect.

You can maybe boost it a little higher temporarily by using a buff spell (although I'd have to check -- they might all be enhancement bonuses, which wouldn't stack with the Headband). As far as I know, though, there's no way to get a permanent Int higher than ~30 as a human.

What you CAN do, though, is to PAO into a high Int non-human, like a dragon or whatever. You could even PAO into a dragon and then Polymorph Other back into a human; that would leave you with the dragon's mental stats but a human body. I've been debating that but not doing it. Maybe I will at some point.
