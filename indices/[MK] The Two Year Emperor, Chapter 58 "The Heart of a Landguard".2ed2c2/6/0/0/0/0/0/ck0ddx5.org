You're looking at this chart, right? [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/sorcererWizard.htm]]

Those are your base spells. You also get extra spells from having high Intelligence (or Charisma for sorcerors): [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/theBasics.htm]] (scroll down to 'Ability Scores'). Plus, if I were using feats and prestige classes you can get extra slots from those too.

Fire giants have 15d8 HD (plus a 72 HP constant) so they are the max you can create. And yes, if I'm being honest, it actually doesn't work because the worms are Fine and the fire giants are Large and I missed that restriction. You can get around this (inefficiently) by sending someone off to find lots of horses or dogs or whatever, bring them back with Teleportation Circle, and using them. Or I could dig through the "creatures by CR" charts again and find some devil or demon that's 10HD and Diminutive. Or by putting Animal Growth on the worms and then turning them into something Medium sized. Or by using a ton more worms. Or by using only PAO instead of PO. I can't bring myself to care enough to rewrite it. Maybe at some point I will, but not today.

As to number of wizards and growth rate: the Big Damn Heroes have a population of 3,000,000 to work with, an unusual percentage of whom (about 5%) have character levels. Many of these folks (about 60%) are casters, and about 60% of casters are arcane casters. That means 54,000 wizards and sorcerors. Of those, a little under 10% are of level 15+, meaning about 5000. Most of those will have the brainpower (either naturally or enhanced) to cast 8th level spells (PAO). Then there's a bunch of lower level folks who can cast PO but not PAO. Long story short, they've got plenty of mages available to run the FLEA.
