  Fire giants have 15d8 HD (plus a 72 HP constant) so they are the max you can create. And yes, if I'm being honest, it actually doesn't work because the worms are Fine and the fire giants are Large and I missed that restriction. [...] I can't bring myself to care enough to rewrite it. Maybe at some point I will, but not today.
