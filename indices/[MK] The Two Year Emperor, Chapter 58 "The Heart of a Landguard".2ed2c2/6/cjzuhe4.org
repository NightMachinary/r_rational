That was glorious. It's nice to see Jake using munchkinry to wreak righteous destruction upon his enemies again.

Does Jake have any plans to create spell engines? They seem as though they'd be pretty useful. How exactly do they work, anyway? Do they just cast a single spell? Or can they have the spell they cast changed? And can they cast the more incredibly useful spells, like Ice Assassin or Wish?

How many times can the newly minted Archmages cast Polymorph Any Object per day? Is there a sufficiently large supply of level 1s that Jake could just leave FLEA with a lot of worms and grow his supply exponentially?
