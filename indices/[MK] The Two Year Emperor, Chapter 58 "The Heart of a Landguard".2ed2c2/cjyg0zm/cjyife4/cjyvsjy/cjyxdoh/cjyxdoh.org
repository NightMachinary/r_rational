Sort of.

The effectiveness of a sacrifice is how much of a sacrifice it is -- how big a difference it makes, both to you and to the world, that you've given up this knowledge. If it's a secret, then you're sacrificing the only copy of the knowledge; think of that as a multiplier, because it makes the sacrifice more significant when there is no one else who could act on the information.

When Jake sacrificed his "blow up the world" plan, it was a really big deal. It would have effected every single undead and living creature on the planet, it was the only way that Jake then knew to win the war of extinction he was facing. Also, it was the only copy of the information -- no one else knew what he'd come up with. Even without the secrecy multiplier, it was still a big deal.

The fact that the Ice Assassins have spell slots isn't a secret, but for a spell caster to /permanently/ give up a spell slot is a huge deal for that person. They don't get the secrecy multiplier, but it's still a big sacrifice.
