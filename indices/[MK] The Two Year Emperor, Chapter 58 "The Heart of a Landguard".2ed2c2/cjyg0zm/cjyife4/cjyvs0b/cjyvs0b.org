I get why you changed the name, but it was always one of my favorite spell names specifically because it conjures up such ugly feelings that so perfectly match what the spell actually does. It's a brutal, ugly, vile spell, with a name that quite suits it. But it's probably not in fitting with the story you want to tell to have that word be used.

I'm curious whether any of the mages that can learn/cast 9th level spells would be alright with knowing and using /Mindscrape/. For all that I just said about it being brutal, vile, and ugly, it's also got some of the most utility of any of the mental magic spells out there. You can ensure absolute loyalty, you can rapidly share information, you can change alignment without using the Helm (and presumably forcing a much more difficult save), you can do /so many things/. I'm not sure who would willingly submit to it, but it's an incredible spell. If /Mind Blank/ weren't continuously applied to all of the most important people, it would be even better than save-or-die, since instead of killing your opponent you turn him into your instant ally.

(I once ran a D&D campaign which featured a villain who was famous for the use of /Mindrape/ and other mental magics as a sort of Moriarty man-behind-the-man-behind-the-man role, and have a deep affection for the spell.)
