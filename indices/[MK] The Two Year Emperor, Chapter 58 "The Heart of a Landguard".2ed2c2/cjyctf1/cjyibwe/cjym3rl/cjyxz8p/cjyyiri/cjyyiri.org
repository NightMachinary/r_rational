Experience points are running total throughout your entire career, they are not lost when leveling up. XP is only spent/lost for certain things like crafting or permanent level loss. So a 19th level character by definition has an experience point total of at least 171k and as soon as that total increases to 190k they will be able to level up to 20th. Also, page 6 of the ELH it does spell out that you only need an additional ECL*1000 xp to reach the next level: "For instance reaching 31st level would require an additional 30x1,000XP (or 30,000 XP), taking the character's XP total from 435,000 to 465,000."

As for RAI vs RAW, that is unfortunate. It is very obvious its the same formula they used in the DMG beyond the first few ECL's, but it does not come out and say that. You can derive that formula from the DMG tables, but Im not sure how you feel that falls on the RAW or houserule issue. It is following the logical trend established, but not spelled out, by RAW. Quite frustrating the ELH didnt say "for party levels and Challenge Ratings above /or below/ these ranges" instead.

Luckily getting people to 21+ should be pretty quick with the FLEA and then the stupid-worlders can use proper xp formulas. The 360k xp from 34 giants would actually send that apprentice to level 27, so its not a total waste. Im scared to think of the kinda of xp the FLEA will generate once Jake figures out he can use templates to get around the 15HD limitation of PAO.
