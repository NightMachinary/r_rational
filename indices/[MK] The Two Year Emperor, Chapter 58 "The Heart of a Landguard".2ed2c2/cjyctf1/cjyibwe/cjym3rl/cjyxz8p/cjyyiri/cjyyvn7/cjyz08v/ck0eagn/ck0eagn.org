One thing that really annoys me about D&D: wizards effectively stop improving by level 20, and mostly stop improving around level 17. A 30th level wizard should be substantially more powerful than a 20th. It bothers me so much that I very nearly houseruled "number of spells continues to increase", but decided not to. The tables don't support that at all, so it would be a very large and very arbitrary change.

It still grinds like sandpaper on my nonexistent immortal soul, though.
