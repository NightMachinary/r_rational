The epic rules are fairly disappointing if you dont multiclass. They really did not seem to put much thought into that system. Extra feats are just in no way better than getting more class features.

I would check out the [[http://dndtools.eu/classes/archivist/][Archivist]] from heroes of horror as it is essentially a divine wizard and might help with keeping the feel of wizardyness out to level 40. It is also an incredible class since it can learn /any/ divine spell it can find in scroll form. So that would help open up druid and other non-cleric/pally spells for Jake en masse.
