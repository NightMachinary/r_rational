Again, I don't know much about LOTR, but that reads to me more like Boromir knows how powerful it is and wants to use it for himself, rather than it having any kind of supernatural influence on him. If it were exerting this kind of pull on everyone there--the kind of pull that can make someone with /40+ in all stats/ fail her WIS save without even seeing it--the Council would have turned into a bloodbath.
