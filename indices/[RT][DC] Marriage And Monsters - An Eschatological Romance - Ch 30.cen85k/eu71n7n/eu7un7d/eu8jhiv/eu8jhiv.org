It was a homebrew RPG I played back in college where your character could "pull" in stories almost exactly like the kid and Superman. What you're doing and how 6/7 worked were very different, but it's really (positively) reminding me of all that.

Also I wrote a thing inspired by Chapter 29, and put it in that thread :D
