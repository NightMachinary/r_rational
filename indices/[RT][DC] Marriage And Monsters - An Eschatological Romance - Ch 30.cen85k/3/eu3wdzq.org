Oh man now I can't stop picturing Sean in the future being the old wizard running the magic shop-- always in the background, but also obscenely powerful so that the main characters can't just loot the place.

At first I was a little leery about fanfiction being a considered a valid part of each story-verse since that opens up all sorts of different interpretations about how characters will behave in this story, but then I realized that this is basically what's been happening the whole time. Dunno why, but it feels weird to me to have a back door in to other stories through non-canon material. Does this mean that Sean can convince, say Hermione, to write a fanfiction about Star Wars so Sean can learn Force powers? They have Star Wars in Harry Potter, right?
