Its basicly a webcomic about a girl who is contacted by a powerful ai called Turry. As of yet the story has focused mostly on the impact this has had on her personal life with a subplot focusing on the long term aims and goals of the ai and its creators. What these are is as of yet unclear.

The chief Rational thing about it would be its so far realistic depiction of what an actual ai might be like and avoidance of many of the common tropes about them which seems to derive a lot from ideas that Eliezer has discussed. I don't know to what extent if any the writer considers it a rational work. I haven't come across anywhere where he says so. In certain ways it isn't particularly typically rational. The protaganist, Emma, for example, isn't what you would call a typical rational protaganist although I think she is a well done character.
