I would say that she's "rational" in the sense that she mostly acts like a real human being and doesn't seem to take actions for the sole purpose of advancing the plot. She isn't a "rationalist" character that some popular stories on this sub have. In my mind, rational fiction doesn't mean hyper smart characters that behave according to rational tropes and ideas (that's rational/ist/ fiction), but is instead just fiction wher ethe rules are consistent and make sense and the characters act in reasonable, realistic ways according to their personalities and goals. This can sometimes include making objectively bad decisions informed by biases since real humans do that sometimes. It tries to avoid having people carry the idiot ball or otherwise do things solely because the plot requires it. In that way, one could argue that rational fiction is really just "well written" fiction, with rationalist fiction being a specific subset within that. So far, Seed seems to match those ideas pretty well, although that could change.
