Hmm. I wonder if turry has anything to do with this attack. He doesn't seem the sort to be interested in revenge (why on earth would that be programed into him) so his obvious motive for attcking Simplex would be to destro their ability to release another ai which may be something that could threaten him.

One thing I do wonder is if this story does ends in some kind of foom (such as in Friendship is optimal) or if it continues on a more personal note with the relationship between a girl and her ai. And if Turry is planning to go foom why is he interested in Emma. Is she a sort of guinea pig where he learns how to deal with humans. Untill the link between Simplex and Grandpa was revealed I assumed that but now I wonder if it is something more fundemental. Then again Grandpa was suprised when Turry contacted Emma so it isn't like he programmed it into her.
