  The point is that what those people who are guessing want is not the same as what JUROR wants. Juror wants an empty canvas - and an empty <input> box is pretty much the same as an empty <canvas>. [[/r/rational]] readers should be familiar with the artificial intelligence trope that defining one's desire precisely is nigh impossible - except for the null case, a malicious genie can always misinterpret. No guess whether the prompt will accept "my coherent extrapolated volition" as a valid answer for everyone, though.!<
