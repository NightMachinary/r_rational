I like him. The idea of someone who reads not out of love, but because hate is cheap and fueling in a different way, like some Anti-Matilda, is great.

I am also fairly sure he's a Dio reference in some way- his portrayal here is too similar to S1E1 Dio's background of "Asshole waiting for guardian to die out of spite". I'm hoping it doesn't go to far, since I'm sick of Jojo references, tbh.
