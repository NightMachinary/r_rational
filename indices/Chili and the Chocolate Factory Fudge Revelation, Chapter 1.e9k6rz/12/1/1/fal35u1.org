I don't know about that. In the Wonka movies and books, adults are often kinda condescending to kids and greedy.

I wouldn't be surprised if the fictional public is less competent than in real life. It's also possible that there are adults who put in the right answer or tell it to the kids, but there's some magic that can tell if it's an adult or a kid who didn't figure out the answer themself.
