First of all, hi Teddy! Glad you're feeling better.

Second of all: [[/r/rational][r/rational]] seems to have been nerd sniped by the game, but nobody seems to have dug into the lore yet.

Charlie and the great glass elevator appears non-canon

Zamboni apparently manufactures hypersonic transcontinental aircraft, and operating them is cheap enough that news agencies can use them.

That reference to Wonka being secretly horribly racist but ultimately probably just an accident of statistics is probably a reference to how the oompa loompas were originally african pygmies, before they were changed to the orange things we know today.

Apparently there were multiple attempts by corporations to secede from their parent nations. Urkel conquered Philidelphia? The fact that Wonka is a sovereign nation explains how they haven't had to deal with inspectors, and apparently they have enough power to enforce "And if anyone ever attempts to steal your ambrosian confections or in any way threaten your copacetic candy consumption, you may also call me and my delightful drones will proceed to erase them from the face of the earth."

There's probably stuff I missed, but that's just what jumped out to me reading it.
