Charlie and Wonka haven't been seen since he went in, except for when Charlie buried Wonka. On top of that, everyone has no fucking clue what is up with the factory. I feel like "Saving a space hotel from aliens" would be a rather notable development in the wonka/charlie saga, you know?

Possibly their involvement was covered up, but... how would all the rest of it be explained? People were rescued, the hotel was destroyed, aliens existed... there was a lot going on. People would talk, explanations had to be written. The great glass elevator is much less popular, and doesn't really add much to the whole "magic chocolate factory" angle, so there's not even much reason to include it.
