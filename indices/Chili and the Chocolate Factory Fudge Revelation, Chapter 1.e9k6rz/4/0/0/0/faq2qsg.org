  Charlie and Wonka haven't been seen since he went in, except for when Charlie buried Wonka.

They've made no official public appearances, or well-attributed private appearances; their presumptive off-screen dinner at the White House could have been kept quiet (at Wonka's request, I imagine). Both Charlie and Willy would have been fairly nondescript in normal clothes, so it's not like they had to /stay/ locked up in the factory all the time.

  People were rescued, the hotel was destroyed, aliens existed...

Charlie did not know about the aliens; thus, they are probably a state secret. (I imagine that if aliens were not a state secret, they would be such common knowledge that everyone would recognize them). Same thing for the hotel in space.

Honestly the whole sequence of events is nearly an anti-meme. "You're telling me that Willy Wonka, the chocolate guy, rescued the President from space aliens during a visit to his secret space hotel? Pull the other one, maybe I'll turn in to a Reptilian."

The people who were rescued were on the POTUS' staff, and thus accustomed to keeping Top Secret stuff, you know, secret.
