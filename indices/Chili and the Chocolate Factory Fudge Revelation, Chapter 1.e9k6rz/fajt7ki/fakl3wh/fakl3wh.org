Fudge revelation? Sludge reformation? I don't know, you might be reading too far into this brand new Reddit account posting a story to this subreddit in particular with a brand new ff.net account and referencing, in-story, an artistic philosophy of incompleteness being a form of artistic expression in and of itself.

I'm sure gazemaize isn't associated with or in any way referencing teddy_teddy_teddy, nope. Not at all.
