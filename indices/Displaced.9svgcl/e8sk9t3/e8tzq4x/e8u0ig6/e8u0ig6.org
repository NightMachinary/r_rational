Blake has several very convenient things happen for him, the first being that he is a metal observer, thus letting him break free then he manages to get away despite running into Yarec, then he hides in a cave that just happens to be full of crystals and metal with names I won't even try to spell, then he learns about 'hyper mode' which I believe has something to do with his feeler abilities, though it has yet to really be explained, then he immediately replaces the arm he lost, then he beats 4 highly trained and specialised fighters in mortal combat with little to no injury.

All of these are kind of hard to believe, however they would be worse if Blake was the only main, he isn't, and later on quite a few of them are resolved, mostly the crystal and metal's presence, as It is explained they are everywhere.

The other problems don't bother me too much as it seems like Blake's role in the story isn't as a martial force but as a political and moral question, is it right to force people to do things that you know will be ultimately beneficial for them against their will? Possibly. Is what he is doing to Samanta right? Almost definitely not.

This is why I say that I'm mostly gone with those early problems I had, as they don't really matter after Blake's position in the story is established.

I'm just as interested in the other two who seem to be adapting to this world much more poorly, though they have themes and questions of their own to explain them.
