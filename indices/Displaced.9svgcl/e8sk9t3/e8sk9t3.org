I'm having fun with this! I'm at chapter 21 and the series is pretty fun, though I'm not sure how rational, while I agree with the course of Blake's thoughts and generally with his direction, but quite a few of the events in those first few chapters was horribly convenient.

I can get over it though, and it makes enough sense after it is explained further. Artelle is an interesting character as well, though I'm honestly waiting in with baited breath for Blake and Sofie to meet.

Thanks for the recommendation, I needed something relatively light and entertaining as I just came from dropping the heaping pile of trash that is "Chaos seeds: the land" I got 4/7 volumes in before the authors writing style and the absolutely atrocious main character made it to bad to continue.
