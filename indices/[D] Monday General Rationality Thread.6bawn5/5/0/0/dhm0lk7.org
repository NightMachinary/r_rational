Ooh! discussion of transness, alright!

First of all, as a trans person, I'm really really confident that transness (I haven't heard of a good noun for "the state of being transgender" so I coined this one. Transgenderism is an alternative) is something which transitioning fixes. I have personally observed the symptoms of gender dysphoria in myself, and transitioning physically and socially has helped with those symptoms. I also know that the overwhelming majority of trans people who transition see similar improvements - moreso the younger they are. So the question of "is it a good thing for people with gender dysphoria to transition?" is settled - yes, it definitely is. Especially when they're young.

But your questions are a little more interesting to me!

  Gender is "real" outside of social convention

Earlier today I found [[https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/6baxm8/parents_are_doubtful_keep_giving_me_science_to/dhl7u5f/][this highly informative comment]] on [[/r/asktransgender][r/asktransgender]] which - while sadly sourceless - was a great anecdote of what the commenter learned from a Physical Anthropology course at the University of Colorado about the causes of transness. Again, it unfortunately doesn't cite any sources (besides the commenter's personal experience), but there are some sources in the replies which support it, and it doesn't blatantly contradict any information I can find by googling for a few minutes about pregnancy timelines.

The comment is about a 10 minute read and it presents a pretty convincing explanation of trans identities (including non-binary ones) which, at the very least, isn't /obviously/ false. Check it out.

  Other people can sense their own gender
#+end_quote

If you ever have the opportunity, I would suggest that you try presenting as the gender that you aren't - male if you're female, female if you're male. I've spoken with some cisgender men who, for various reasons, presented as and were socially read as female at some point. They described to me a strange sensation of discomfort when they were referred to as female - female pronouns, perhaps a female name they had adopted, etc. Their description of that sensation sounded extremely similar to my own dysphoria!

In other words, you might not be able to "sense" your internal gender until your external presentation doesn't match it. I would poetically liken it to the way that you can't feel the air on your skin unless there's a breeze.

  We should draw boundaries based on internal-sense, not experience or social convention.
#+end_quote

Actually, I don't believe in defining boundaries based on any of those. Or rather, I believe that trying to define boundaries carries an extremely high risk of gatekeeping - leaving someone who is trans on the "cisgender" side of the fence, and hence not forbidding them from transitioning. Rather than trying to define such a boundary, I think it best to let anyone transition if they want to. Far more trans people have been prevented from transitioning, than cis people been accidentally allowed to transition - and it seems that the first outcome is worse than the second, since a falsely-transitioned cis person won't be forced to continue living as the wrong gender.

That said, I do approve of RLE (real life experience) requirements for surgery (one year living fulltime as your true gender), and I do believe ASD youths who express a desire to transition should be watched carefully as they start puberty; I have read about cisgender people with ASD who, at some point, expressed such a desire temporarily - I know one such individual personally, actually.

And if one day society is so accepting of trans people that cis people mistakenly transitioning becomes a big problem, we'll fiigure that out then.

  But at that point, surgery wouldn't matter.

I don't get what you mean by this? I don't see how those 3 points lead to this conclusion, let alone just the first 2. A mostly [female/male] brain with a [female/male] hormone balance is uncomfortable having [male/female] genetalia, that's my picture of why some trans people want bottom surgery.
