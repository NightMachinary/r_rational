I think that people, generally, have a 'module' running in our heads that compels us to find tribes, imprint on them, and convey that social identity. We feel dissonance if other people don't recognize us as parts of the tribes that we think are important.

I think we'd both use an explanation like this to explain why people "come out" to their parents as atheists. Or why people would get offended if I repeatedly got their occupation, name or nationality wrong.

My model of transness is that some people's modules imprint on the gender that's maximally inconvenient for their body. An agender person could fail to imprint on either group and feel dissonance when they're described as either male or female.

I think this explains the examples you've raised, without needing any extra notion of a uniquely "male" or uniquely "female" inner life.

We'd expect transitioning to help because it brings someone's public identity in line with their private model of themselves.

I'd feel insecure about switching my gender presentation. But only if I did it in pubic. Trap me on a desert island, and I don't care what I wear.
