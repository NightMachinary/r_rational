Interesting! I'm not at all familiar with this stuff (beyond reading a handful of blog posts for social justice-y, don't step on any toes reasons), but since testosterone and brain androgenization are named explicitly, one quick test of the mechanism could be to look at the gender identities of those with androgen insensitivity and XY allosomes, especially since there can be continuous variation in the (in)sensitivity of the androgen receptor... googling around quickly, it sounds like "CAIS girls and women have a female-typical core gender identity, and female-typical gender role behavior in adulthood, usually choose a male partner and do not appear to suffer from gender identity disorder" (and the case study I'm quoting here might be the [[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477513110002020][exception that proves the rule]]). I'm not seeing much in way of hard numbers re: the frequency of gender dysphoria in individuals with PAIS/MAIS, but I'm sure it's out there.

Hell, I'm sure if this is a contended mechanism people have tested it in some model with sex dimorphism approximating gender identity (e.g. flood an XX mouse embryo with test and see how it behaves as an adult? does it exhibit behavior that looks sort of like induced dysphoria? to what extent can non-human animals even be transgender, and what would it look like?). I'm also not seeing much poking around briefly but it's such a basic and easy experiment that somebody must have done it.
