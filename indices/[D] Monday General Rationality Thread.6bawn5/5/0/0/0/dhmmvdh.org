  If you ever have the opportunity, I would suggest that you try presenting as the gender that you aren't - male if you're female, female if you're male. I've spoken with some cisgender men who, for various reasons, presented as and were socially read as female at some point. They described to me a strange sensation of discomfort when they were referred to as female - female pronouns, perhaps a female name they had adopted, etc. Their description of that sensation sounded extremely similar to my own dysphoria!

Entirely coincidentally, I've been through that experience myself. Someone (on an internet forum, with little to no cues to go from) misread my gender and referred to me with female pronouns. I found the situation surprisingly disquieting. (I explained the error, the other person apologised, and all was well).
