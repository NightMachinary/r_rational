The idea of presenting as female to experience dysphoria is really interesting to me, because I've always been stymied by the fact that I can't imagine what it'd be like to "feel" like one gender or another.

My initial reaction was the realization that it /would/ be quite uncomfortable, and I thought I might have finally gotten a glimpse of dysphoria...but then you mentioned that getting misgendered was the uncomfortable part for the male friends of yours who had run the experiment. For me, that would be a huge relief. The uncomfortable part would be wondering if I was passing, and having female pronouns directed at me would make me feel a lot /more/ at ease.

Thank you for the fascinating insight. I will have to consider this further.
