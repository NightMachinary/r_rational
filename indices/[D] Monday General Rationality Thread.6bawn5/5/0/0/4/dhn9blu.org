WRT biology, I'd unpack the causal chain a bit. The "gender experience is real" model seems to suggest a causality like:

Hormones give a brain a 'masculine' structure. This masculine structure leads to "male" thought patterns. An AFAB kid notices that his thinking has more in common with boys than girls. Based on this, the kid starts hanging out with boys. Eventually, they identify themselves as a boy. Gender expression changes to match.

There are several things that seem odd about this explanation.

The first is that I find myself asking, what, specifically, these "male" thought patterns look like. I'm not really convinced that there's anything going on in my head that we couldn't find in a woman. Perhaps an unusual woman. But a woman.

Then, I'd notice that it's relatively common to find girls who say that they have more in common with guys than other girls. That might make them tomboys. But it doesn't make them trans.

If transness was really just a matter of "masculine" thoughts, then I'd expect transitioning to be much, much more common than it is.

Another oddity is "masculine thoughts," if they exist, should be extremely dependent on culture. A modern american man won't think like a 12 century Chinese farmer, or a 4th century Roman patriarch. So, why don't we see people 'transitioning' across notions of masculinity?

Finally, the "gender experience is real" causality doesn't really line up with self-reports I've read of trans people's experiences.

Brain structures are ancient. If brains are sorting themselves using a rule like "find people who think like me," the relevant inner experiences shouldn't have anything to do with gender expression.

Under this model, people should start changing their gender-expression AFTER they've started to identify with their gender.

But most of the stories I've read from trans people go the other way. People play with gender-expression first. And later they realized that they were trans later.

I think this all fits better with my model where there isn't any gender-experience, just imprinting. My causality would be something like:

Brains have a notion of 'same' and 'opposite' biological sex. We use this for sexual-imprinting. And for gender-imprinting. The brain's notion of "same" depends on hormones. So, atypical womb environments could cause changes in sexual attraction or gender-identity.

In this case, you don't need to any particular inner experience. The drive is just, "identify and (join/be attracted to) the group with the following secondary sex characteristics ..."

In this model, the changes in brain structure could also cause changes in mental traits. But that would be a side effect.
