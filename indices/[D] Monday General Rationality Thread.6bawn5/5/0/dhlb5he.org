I'm not sure I understand the question you're asking. I'd look at most of them and just see a person who's had surgery.

The surgery might be more-or-less complicated, or more-or-less gross. But "knee surgery is gross" feels like an aesthetic judgement.

I don't feel any particular dissonance with the idea that knee surgery is grosser than make-up. Or that Inspector Gadget had a better cosmetic outcome than Frankenstein's monster.

If the question is a round-about way of getting to trans-surgery:

I'm not convinced that there's an "innately male mind" anymore than there's an "innately male height" or "innately male muscle mass."

Sure, some mental configurations / heights / muscle masses are more common among men than women. But outliers exist. Some women are tall. Some women have preferences or muscle mass that's more common among men.

So, the 'standard' progressive trans-position needs to convince me of:

- Gender is "real" outside of social convention
- Other people can sense their own gender
- We should draw boundaries based on internal-sense, not experience or social convention.

But, at that point, surgery wouldn't matter.
