I think I've found something I hate more about the rise of populist politics than the blatant tribalism. It's the fact that the policies and politicians these movements are supporting don't actually seem to benefit or represent their tribe. I still find the values these people hold to be despicable, but I can't even respect them as competently attempting to optimize those values.
