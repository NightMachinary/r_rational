I have ADHD as well (emphasis on the H, as the therapist who diagnosed me phrased it), and I've also been spending lots of time thinking about how I should relate to it on a personal level. ADHD may technically be a disorder in that I can point to certain aspects of my life that suffer as a result of my ADHD, but I can also point to certain aspects of my life where it has been a boon. At the very least, it was extremely helpful to me academically once I taught myself how to "harness" it.

I have a perfectly valid adderall perscription that I deliberately do not use. I think about my life if I lost all those costs and benefits that come with my ADHD, if I treated myself with adderall, and for some reason it just doesn't appeal to me. Sometimes I wonder if my reasons are bad-- maybe I like my untreated ADHD because it gives me an excuse for whatever shortcomings I have, maybe I like it because it helps me feel different from the crowd, maybe I'm just so used to it that I fear what life might be like without it-- but then I find myself in a situation where my mind is going in several different directions at once, and I can't help but love it.

As a side note, you mentioned looking for treatment that doesn't affect your self expression. One thing that's actually promising is the currently trendy [[https://www.amazon.com/Street-Fidgeteer-Fidget-Spinner-Bearings/dp/B06XVXYC6Q/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1494908413&sr=8-1-spons&keywords=fidget+spinner&psc=1][fidget spinner]], which has great utility for people with ADD/ADHD. We have an easier time focusing when we have something else going on in the background. In this case, a simple tactile activity that is repetitive and constantly provides at least a bit of feedback. Even if it's not that product, something like it that you can do absent-mindedly with your non-dominant hand can lead to a marked improvement in focus and retention for people with ADD/ADHD. I have a friend with ADD who started doing much better in high school once his teachers let him knit during lectures. He didn't even have a free hand for notes, but he got much better at absorbing the information. There's a potential avenue, if you haven't explored it.
