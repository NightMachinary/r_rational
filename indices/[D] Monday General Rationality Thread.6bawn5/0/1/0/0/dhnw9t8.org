I didn't even really feel the adderall at doses below 10mg. When I hit 20, I found myself just feeling tired and sluggish, both mentally and physically. With my untreated ADHD, I feel like I just generally have too much energy, but with treatment, I feel like I don't have enough.

That was a while ago, however. If you say that adderall has been good for you, I'll take that into consideration and maybe revisit the whole thing. It has been five years since the last time I tried a treatment regimen, so maybe things will be different this time around.
