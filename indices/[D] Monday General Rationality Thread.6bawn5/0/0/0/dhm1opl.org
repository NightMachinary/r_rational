I agree for depression, but what about something like autism? I'm in kind of weird position in this case since I haven't faced any prejudice in my life and think of my autism as a disorder to be overcome, but have been informed by my peers who have suffered prejudice that it is integral part of our identity. I feel pressured to take pride in my neurodiversity, which I never have before.
