Weird question I just thought of:

Is the existence of billionaires a net evil? And assuming it isn't, would there probably be a cut-off point, like a trillion dollars or something like that, where we can confidently say no human should wield this much monetary power?

One big problem is that owning a billion dollars almost inherently puts you above the law. That is, if you choose to kill someone or commit some other terrible crime, the lawyers and bribes required to cover it up are likely to be a small fraction of what your fortune earns in annual interest. This suggests that until completely bribe-proof enforcement is possible, permitting large fortunes to exist stands in contradiction to the notion of legal equality for all.

Another problem is that it creates unfair advantage in business and other competitive games, which hurts smaller players (middle class / small business). As a billionaire you have a thousand huge fortunes, which is what a million dollars is to most people. You can in principle make anyone you please immensely rich on a whim. This possibility, while mostly counterfactual, gives leverage over people who hope to be beneficiaries, which you can then use to make yourself even richer. Less wealthy people don't have this kind of leverage, and the poorest end up unable to even borrow from the bank at a tolerable rate (often falling into high interest credit card debt, for example).

Another ethical issue would be the Peter Singer argument, that there are places in the world where life is cheap, such that a single billion could save a million lives. While we are pretty much all somewhat guilty on paper, the drowning child in a pond analogy implies that billionaires are literally /thousands of times/ more guilty of failure to prioritize distant lives than middle class people who make the same mistake. If it is at all right that ordinary folks should feel vaguely guilty they don't do more for children dying of Malaria, logically, billionaires should experience a thousand times the anguish.

So why do we tolerate billionaires?

One possibility is that we have no other choice. They are too powerful to get rid of (by which I mean "tax until they are merely very rich") and are good at resisting attempts to do so. They can hire violent people for protection of their assets, so there might be no way to confiscate them without the prospect of escalating to unacceptable levels of violence.

Another possibility is that very powerful people are frequently a good solution to various hard coordination problems that can't be solved any other way. If these problems went unsolved, perhaps the world would experience significantly more disutility.

We could also consider the possibility that private property is so important and foundational that it outweighs other factors, and that collecting tax is immoral and intolerable from the get go. This may be how some libertarians see the world.

Also perhaps the possibility of becoming a billionaire drives people to perform great acts of goodness that they would not otherwise do. I can't think of a real world example here that doesn't fit under the "accidentally solves coordination problems" heading mentioned above, but perhaps they exist. That the prospect of becoming a billionaire drives some people to great evil is also worth considering, needless to say.

The real answer could be a combination of the above. We may see some motivation to to better individual behavior as the result of aspiring to own billions (although scope blindness probably limits this vs mere millions), some coordination problems that couldn't otherwise be solved (what would be the way to test that?), some moral disutility for the prospect of confiscating wealth above 1000 million, and some inability to accomplish such a thing without an unacceptable cost in violence.

On the other hand, it seems like prohibiting anyone from ever being a /trillionaire/ would be easier because nobody is yet a trillionaire, the prospect of becoming one has never yet motivated anyone to do anything in the real world, and as an unknown phenomenon it doubtless carries economic and existential risks which could motivate such a ban. Billionaires might even support such a ban because their own chance of becoming a trillionaire is slim and they don't want to be lorded over by someone else who gets luckier.
