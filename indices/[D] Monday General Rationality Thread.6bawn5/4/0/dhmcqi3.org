Progressive tax brackets exist to reduce financial inequality without distorting the market too badly.

I'm curious what progressive interest would result in. A system where the more money you put in your savings the less interest each additional dollar earns. It wouldn't work in practice because the rich would just use international banks or move to another country but it is interesting to think about.
