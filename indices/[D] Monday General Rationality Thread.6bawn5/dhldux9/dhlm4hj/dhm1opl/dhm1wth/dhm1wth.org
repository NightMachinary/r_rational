There's an argument, for high-functioning aspies, that they do not have a disorder. After all, it does not interfere with their functioning in life because they have learned how to work around it or even use it productively.

Disorders are things which prevent someone from being functional, like depression, anxiety, untreated schizophrenia, and the like. ASD doesn't necessarily do that.
