Claim: We need a better vocabulary for "non-standard brain configurations."

I have ADHD.

Imagine wearing an earbud that has a voice reading possibly-relevant Wikipedia articles. This earbud is running all the time. The reader likes to follow random links in the articles.

This is a mixed blessing. Short-run, it makes it astoundingly hard to follow conversations. Long-run, it means that I've been semi-actively reading an encyclopedia since I was 12.

I took abnormal psych classes in college and was impressed by the way they approached mental illness.

Roughly (and from memory):

#+begin_quote
  Mental illnesses are conditions, outside of societal norms, that: cause mental distress for the patient, cause distress for people around them, or make the person unable to fulfill their normal societal roles.
#+end_quote

Effectively, the illness as the cluster-of-symptoms that are causing problems. The doctors aren't trying to "fix" my personality. They're trying to solve the practical problems of "can't focus when I want to," "can't follow a normal conversation," or "fails classes for stupid reasons."

So a "successful treatment for my ADHD" is an unambiguously good thing, and any unwanted changes to my personality become side-effects of medication. This makes it a lot easier for me to recommend that people get treatment for ADHD.

But it means that I don't have a good vocabulary to talk about "positive symptoms" or "neutral symptoms" that are correlated with ADHD. Similarly, I'd like a way to talk about "ADHD-type minds, after the negative symptoms are treated to baseline normal."

I'm aware of "Neurodiversity," but object to the use and philosophy that come with it. In particular:

#+begin_quote
  [Neurodiversity] frames autism, ADHD/ADD, dyslexia, bipolarity and other neurotypes as a natural human variation rather than a pathology or disorder, and rejects the idea that neurological differences need to be (or can be) cured, as they believe them to be authentic forms of human diversity, self-expression, and being
#+end_quote

This forces a false dichotomy between "ADHD-neurotypes" and "normal". In reality, I can (and do) look for treatments that remove the constraints like "can't focus when I want to", but leave all of my self-expression intact.

And I'm unhappy with language that tries to re-frame a negative into a positive. It feels like dishonest obfuscation.
