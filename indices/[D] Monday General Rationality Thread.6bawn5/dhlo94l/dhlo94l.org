Caffeine! Some love it, some hate it, some rely on it (and some are in all three categories). Do you use it? How do you consume it (coffee, tea, soda, energy drinks, pills...)? Is it a good idea?

I drink a cup of coffee on weekday mornings, usually with some milk. On particularly tiring days (or if I had trouble sleeping the night before) I will have another cup in the early afternoon. This happens probably once every couple of weeks. I know some people who don't drink any coffee at all, and some who drink much more than I do.
