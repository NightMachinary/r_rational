Not sure how that follows. If they've built up a personality cult around a certain personality, as you indicate, then that implies that they have to keep up that personality in public, right? And if that personality is a bumbling idiot, then they have to appear to be a bumbling idiot.

But bear in mind that, as with any high-profile position, there were - there always are - a lot of very competent people trying to get that position. And yet look who's in that position. This, at the very least, implies that he's /very/ good at political maneuvering.

By the way, are we talking about anyone in specific?
