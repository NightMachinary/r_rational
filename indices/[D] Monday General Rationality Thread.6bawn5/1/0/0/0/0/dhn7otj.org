I'm referring to the constituents as the force attempting to optimize political policy to their advantage, not the politicians. The establishment politicians are mostly competent at optimizing their selfish desires based on the constituents they have. Even most of Trump's populist contemporaries just seem to be openly bigoted authoritarians who run on that platform, but I believe that Trump himself has displayed no consistent set of values that he is out to optimize.

It's the voters who continue to stick by Trump while believing that his policies will benefit them that I hate the most. I already hated them for promoting ideas that I find abhorrent and inhumane, but the fact that they can't even pursue those values in a way that would actually achieve them robs me of any begrudging empathy I could have for them for at least looking out for their tribe. Valuing your tribe over other humans isn't a good thing, but they aren't even good at doing it.
