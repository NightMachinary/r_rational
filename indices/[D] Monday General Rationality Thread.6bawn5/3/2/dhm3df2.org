I have a mocha (homemade or from the cafe down the street, nonfat milk and no whipped cream) once a day around 2pm, which is when I start to flag. Of course, it might be that part of the reason I start to flag is that I've trained my body to expect caffeine at that time. I also have a can or two of soda once a week on Tuesdays, which is D&D night. Oh, and 5-hour Energy on road trips, but only for some pep, not as a substitute for sleep.

I think the biggest issue with caffeine consumption is probably the added calories that can come with developing a dependency if you're not doing straight black coffee or unsweetened tea. I personally watch my calories and know what I'm allowed, so don't have problems there, but for a while I was starting to get fat, and part of that was an increase in sugary drinks (all of which had caffeine).
