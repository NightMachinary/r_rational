I had problems with weight gain from sweet caffeinated drinks as well. I used to have an iced mocha with sugar every morning, which is of course a real treat, but not really something I could keep up once my metabolism began to slow down. I ended up swapping away from having too many sweet drinks after talking with my cousin (who is very into fitness) about it. He pointed out that it's a lot easier to drink calories without noticing than it is to eat them (along with some other advice) so now I stick to the way-less-fun coffee. Though, I do sometimes still get a latte or something with nonfat milk, this is pretty rare. I also used to drink sweetened milk with tea and tapioca, called by various names like Pearl Milk Tea, Bubble Tea, Boba, etc. Cutting that out helped me out a lot.
