Thermos of coffee on the way to work (1 hr drive), usually a cup of tea in the afternoon, around 3 PM.

I'll also do a glass of fake-latte (cold coffee concentrate and milk, instead of water) on Mondays, my online gaming night with friends. Only drink Mountain Dew every now and then (once every few Saturdays), mostly because of the sugar content.

In general, I find it does help perk me up in the morning, but doesn't do too much to prevent me from falling asleep. I might just be lucky in this.
