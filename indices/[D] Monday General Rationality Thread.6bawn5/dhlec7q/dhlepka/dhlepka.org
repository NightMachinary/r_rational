Yeah. I had the same reaction in my abnormal psych class. That was a pointless loss of a few years.

*PSA: Your mental health is as important as your teeth. Get regular checkups!*

Go to the dentist before you're in excruciating pain. A checkup every 6 months means that you can catch cavities early. And fix then when it's easy.

The same is true about mental health. A 6-month checkup should be normal for healthy people.

Worst case, you spend an hour unburdening yourself on a therapist. Best case, you catch depression early, and can do a mild intervention, without having to go through the years of suicidal ideation.

My teens would have been so, so much better if I'd taken this advice.
