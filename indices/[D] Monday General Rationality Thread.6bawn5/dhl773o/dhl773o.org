Fun with cognitive dissonance!

- A person who has undergone facial reconstruction surgery\\
- A person who has breast implants\\
- A person who has a chin implant\\
- A person who wears contact lenses\\
- A person who wears makeup\\
- A person who has an artificial heart\\
- A person who has an artificial knee\\
- A person who has undergone genital reconstruction surgery

Which of these people are Inspector Gadget or Adam Jensen, and which are Frankenstein's monster or "Kabutomaru"? Or are they all at the same level? Or is there a gradual continuum (based on what criteria?)?

Generally, I'm inclined to consider such people as existing on a continuum, based on the ongoing maintenance and inconvenience involved. Is setting off metal detectors like Wolverine or needing to replace batteries like a robot equivalent in grotesquery to needing to lubricate or pump up artificial genitalia manually, though? I'm really not sure...
