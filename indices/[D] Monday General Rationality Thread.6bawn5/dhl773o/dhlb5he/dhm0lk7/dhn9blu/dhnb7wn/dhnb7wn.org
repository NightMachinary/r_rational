  Hormones give a brain a 'masculine' structure. This masculine structure leads to "male" thought patterns.

I'm not sure where you're getting the "male thought patterns" idea from. The first sentence makes sense to me - hormones lead to a masculine/feminine brain structure in an otherwise female/male body (well, female-assigned/male-assigned body, but blehh words). But it's that mismatch between the masc/fem brain and the fem/masc body which causes the dysphoria.

I'm not sure how much of a role social gender roles have on dysphoria. They clearly have /some/ effect, because there are entirely social aspects of gender which have affected my gender dysphoria (or gender euphoria, as the case may be). But it is also clear that social gender roles aren't the ONLY thing causing dysphoria, because many trans people (again, myself included) notice a significant improvement to their mental health after starting hormones, even if they're still in the closet to their friends and family, and even if they are still presenting as their birth gender 100% of the time!

In other words, when a trans person starts taking hormones and changes /nothing else/ about their lifestyle, there still tends to be an improvement. So there may be a social aspect to dysphoria (which would presumably not happen in a genderless society, or on a deserted island), but there is also definitely a biological aspect (which /would/ still presumably happen in a genderless society or deserted island). The strength of each seems to vary from person to person, and I think it's reasonable to guess that cis people who are misgendered experience only social dysphoria; that guess would also explain the feeling you mentioned in your other comment:

  I'd feel insecure about switching my gender presentation. But only if I did it in pubic. Trap me on a desert island, and I don't care what I wear.

Regarding your "imprinting" model, I think I can get behind it as a potential mechanism for how trans people are born only feeling the "internal, brain-body mismatch" kind of dysphoria, internalize social concepts of gender as they grow up, and develop the "social, want to imprint on the wrong gender role and express the wrong gender presentation" kind of dysphoria.

And because I'm a bit paranoid about giving the wrong idea, I do want to again emphasize that regardless of what gender dysphoria is and what causes it, transition and supportive gender-affirming therapy is the only known cure - and a very effective one too.
