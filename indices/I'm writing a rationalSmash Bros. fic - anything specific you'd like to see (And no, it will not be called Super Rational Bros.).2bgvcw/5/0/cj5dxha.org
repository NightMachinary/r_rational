Good point about the tiers - I was just going to put a ton of restraints on some characters' wilder abilities.

As for a plot: Mwahahaha. No worries there. Delving into certain characters' histories led to some interesting ideas, and with the addition of the main character and his goals and motivations, it works out perfectly. The plot is not about the tournament - the tournament is merely a construct, a plot device. After the first arc, the tournament isn't even part of the story, at least not directly.

As for Gabon, unfortunately he does not compete. I could not think of a suitable reason any of the veterans would sponsor him.

Hey, Samus had some trouble there with Mother Brain - if not for the Baby Metroid, she'd have been toast. And Link, well - I'll think of something.
