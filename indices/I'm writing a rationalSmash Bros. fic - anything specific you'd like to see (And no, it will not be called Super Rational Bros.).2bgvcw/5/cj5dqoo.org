This seems like it could be an interesting worldbuilding exercise, and thinking about who could beat up who is always fun. (The Smash Bros. roster would need to be broken into tiers to be even remotely fair.) But I'm having trouble imagining any actual plot. Arbitrary tournaments aren't really interesting, as plots go, particularly since they put constraints on characterization. Why would the timid psychic toddler fight? Who would sign his release form? Why would the mountaineers fight? Why were they even invited? Why would the King of Evil consent to leave his Triforce at home so he's not literally invincible? Who explained the rules to the monkey?

In your place, I'd probably drop the entire fighting thing and just write a big crossover. But even then I'd have trouble writing an intelligent story where Link or Samus don't fix everything with time travel and overwhelming firepower.
