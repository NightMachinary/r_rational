I have since decided on a combination of both - some characters (Fox and Captain Falcon, and perhaps Samus) would exist in the same universe, because it easily makes sense and provides interesting intertwining backstories. And other 'verses, like Fire Emblem, Hyrule, and Dreamworld, would be universes of their own.

Luckily Kirby's Warp Stars provide easy transport between them. Hmm, maybe Fox can get a Warp Star-powered warp-drive made...
