The story behind the smash bros games, while quite different, might help.

The characters in the game are actually toys. They are being animated by the imagination of the child playing with them. When one character beats all the others, there is only one opponent remaining: the child. When the toy beats the hand of the child (master hand,) the child lets go and stops playing, thus rendering the character back to a toy. Pretty simple story, but it effectively explained why all those Nintendo characters were suddenly all in the same world and fighting.

Please, be careful with Samua. She isn't an easy character to write about.
