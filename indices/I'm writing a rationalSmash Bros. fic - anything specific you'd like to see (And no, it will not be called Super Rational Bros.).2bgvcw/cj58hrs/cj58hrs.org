I'm curious how you'll resolve the physics issue. Will there be a singular meta-universe and its rules be responsible for the various supernatural technique and features of the various canons, or will it work something like "each character's home universe' rules apply to them, unless noted" (Ike shan't be able to turn into a pinball like Sonic does).
