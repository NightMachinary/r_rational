I'm going the route of each characters' skills/powers only being applicable to them, because of where they are from.

Even in the fic, Kirby, for example, comes from a different universe - the Warp Stars are how he came to the Smash Bros. 'verse. So his biological/supernatural makeup is ridiculously different from any of the other characters, which allows him his unique powerset.

I won't go in-depth for the explanations of the characters' powers' origins, but rest assured the actual powers themselves will stay consistent in their interactions.
