I'm not so sure that a single underlining magic system that would allow anything from 'inhaling a living being to gain a fraction of their abilites' to 'become a blue pinball and home in on your enemies' to 'punch so hard the air around your fist bursts into flames' would be sustainable and explainable.

Not actually being all that smart, I'm struggling just with the 'keep everything consistent, have the backstories make sense, and write all the characters as rationally as possible without the Idiot Ball being held too much by anyone' part of this as it is. I'd welcome help if you're offering it - I just can't fathom being able to create that entire system myself, and have it work. I appreciate your input regardless, it's very helpful.
