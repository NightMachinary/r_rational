Honestly, going the supercomputer simulation route would feel like a cop-out, as tempting as it is. It also puts a bit of a wall between the readers and the characters - and I'm specifically trying to make the characters as real and relatable as possible. I'm going to try my hand at writing the 'verses together by combining their histories and whatnot, but if I find it to be impossible without a large amount of handwavium, I might fall back on the simulation premise.
