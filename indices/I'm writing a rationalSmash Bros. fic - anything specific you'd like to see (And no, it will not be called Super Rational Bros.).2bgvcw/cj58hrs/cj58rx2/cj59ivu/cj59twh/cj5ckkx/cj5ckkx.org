Well, you can always make the point of the universe being a simulation run on some supercomputer, with the magic rules being grafted onto the regular 'mundane' reality. If it's run by the same computer, you have technically all /magic/ derived from the same system. The system would be universe-relative reality manipulation, sure, but it's a common theme.

Alternatively, the universes are internally consistent with their own inherent features and qualia. The Masters of Smash 'verse allows for cross-'dimensional', or from our perspective cross-narrative, travel in some capacity. The multiverse containing all the various universes works for the travelling individuals by the individuals retaining the physics of their home universe -- Kirby will still be able to float and copy skills of things it swallows, Falcon's punches will still ignite or superheat the air, Sonic will still be able to run at the speeds his name implies, and so on.

My point being, depending on your goal, fusings canons into a coherent whole is not exactly necessary. Especially considering some canons are simply broken and barely internally consistent (Zelda, Pok√©mon, ...).

So no, I can't fuse all those canons either without relying on a deus ex machina either.
