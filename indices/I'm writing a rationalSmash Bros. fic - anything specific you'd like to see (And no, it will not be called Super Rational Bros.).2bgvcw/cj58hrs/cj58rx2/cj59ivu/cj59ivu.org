Well, you could have gone the route of magical schools, so to speak. The underlying principle and limitations are the same, but the specifics to each universe came into being due to the relevant school of magic being dominant.\\
Imagine for instance an Avatar universe in which the various nations never came in contact with each other: Given enough time each nation would have a broad swath of styles and mythologies, maybe even creation myth and religions; then they come into contact with each other and everyone is freaking out because these new people are doing magic; there have to be paradigm shifts in science and religion and revolutions are par of the course, but the underlying principle---bending---remains the same.
