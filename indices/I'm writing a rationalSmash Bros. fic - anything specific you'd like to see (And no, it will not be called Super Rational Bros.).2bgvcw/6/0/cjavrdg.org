I realize that to explain the situation in a simple, quick way, Nintendo invented that story, but that's definitely not what I'm going for with this fic. I'm essentially just making a mash-up of all of their 'verses, utilizing a multiverse concept combined with a few of the franchises actually existing side-by-side in the same universe.

I will of course try my best with Samus. As my story starts years after some mysterious tragic event in the Smash Bros. 'verse, many characters act differently than one might expect, but I will do my best to stay true to their games.
