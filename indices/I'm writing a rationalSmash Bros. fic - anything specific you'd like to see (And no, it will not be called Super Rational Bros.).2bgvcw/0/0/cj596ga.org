In respect to the tournament itself, the Brothers of Smash Judging Committee (composed of a few particular older characters from some of the franchises) has each fighter register a certain number of moves, each of which must be approved. These correspond to the moves in the actual game, i.e. b-air, n-air, down b, etc.

In respect to everyday things, it's less of a problem and more just 'that's how it is'.

Although in this world, Palutena - being a real-life goddess - would not be allowed to compete. In actuality she would never want to anyway.
