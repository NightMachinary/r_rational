I'm not starting "at the beginning", where none of the franchises have yet to cross over, and the characters have yet to meet: in the verse I'm building, they've always existed alongside each other. For example, Samus and Captain Falcon have been competing for the title of best Bounty Hunter for decades; Jigglypuff and Kirby hang out all the time; Peach and Zelda are best friends. The backstories and histories are all intertwined.

I'm starting at the "dawn" of the Brawl era, with the Melee fighters being the seasoned veterans and the others the aspiring newcomers to the scene. There's a ton of history with all all the characters, quite a few skeleton's in the respective closets, and more than a couple of major secrets being kept.

Zebes was pretty much destroyed by Samus, so they wouldn't hold matches there, but most of the other places will see the tournament visit. Kirby's Warp Stars are the most convenient form of travel for these types of situations.
