One thing I think might be interesting is some investigation into the connections between the universes inbetween the games.

I always found [[http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/tommy-westphalls-universe][Tommy Westphall's Universe]] to be incredibly interesting, and a rational investigation into how all that could conceivably work would be cool. Since you're starting out with a fighter, it seems easy to have reasonably loose rules connecting most major video game franchises. Especially with the presence of Snake, my immediate question is where everyone, and everywhere, else is. Some reasonable discussions about this, and some cameos from disparate (non Smash) franchises would certainly be cool.

Considering they travel to numerous locations that are distinctly within eachothers' universes to fight, I'd like to see all the unique reactions the characters have to the situations they're put in. How would Link react to Zebes? What would Marth think of the fountain of dreams? What schemes would Dedede or Bowser get into when they find themselves in Saffron City? And, of course, how would the occupants there react to them?
