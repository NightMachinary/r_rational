That still leaves open the question of new franchises. If Snake isn't already a veteran, then why is he competing now, and not before? And what about the franchises that have no competitors? If the people from there know about the tournament, why haven't they been competing? Are there some that don't know about the tournament? And why do some franchises (universes?) have multiple competitors, while others have one?

And, continuing on the themes I was talking about before, how many past cameos before the tournament were legitimate? Did Link, Samus, and Mario know about eachother before they knew about the tournament? That goes along with your intertwined backstories thing. I suppose my point is that such things would be worth addressing specifically at some point.

Edit: Also, a slight variation on my last paragraph on my last post still applies. What would Marth think of the fountain of dreams, even if he knew about it before? What schemes would Dedede or Bowser get into when they find themselves in Saffron City, even if they knew about it before?
