It's not really something I'm going to touch on much in the first arc, but I definitely want to address it, and a time-travel arc with all the characters would be incredibly interesting. As soon as I iron out the mechanics of his time travel in this 'verse, I'll start applying it to existing conflicts and brainstorming for a future arc.

Edit - left out a word. Luckily I can effectively time-travel to put it in.
