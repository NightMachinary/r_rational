An interesting little tale.

There are stories where the Overmind is insane (paranoia), others where it's aloof (The Eschaton), others where it's an omnipotent genie (Prime Intellect) and others where it's a pony.

This is the world we'd get if the Overmind was primed with the entirety of TVtropes. Could be worse I guess.
