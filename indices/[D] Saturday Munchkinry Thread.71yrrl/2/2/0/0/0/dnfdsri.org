Wouldn't you get to see yourself swimming in a vault of gold like scrooge mcduck or something? How would that be helpful? I don't think an average person would expect a psychic to get precise instructions to becoming phenominally cosmically powerful or every single one of them would be that already. Or most of them who weren't power-averse, anyways.
