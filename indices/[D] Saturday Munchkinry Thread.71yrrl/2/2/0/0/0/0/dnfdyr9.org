Of course you wouldn't get instructions for the personal power you have within the divination - they got their power by author fiat. Rather, such a divination could be steered by the version of me within it towards a future that contains a friendly superintelligence, which would know just what to make the world look like to maximize utility outside the divination. If my outside powers are such that if what I see would seem OP to a layperson, my powers are nerfed, the AI would presumably /see that coming/ and show me something that maximizes utility while being cryptic enough not to trigger a nerf. The hypothetical layperson judge may well end up seeing me turned mad by Cthulhu's whispers, as befits such hubris, and run away screaming while I start gathering a cult or whatever.
