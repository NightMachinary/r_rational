Looking too far into the future is of course just going to turn me into a Simurgh puppet. It will summon whatever AGI was going to control the future into the present, which might not be a bad thing if you, say, think nuclear war in the meantime likely. Less game-ending powers that sound literarily close are contacting the dead, bestowing curses, terminating timelines you don't like by causing paradoxes, reading minds, telekinesis, teleportation, clairvoyance, etc.. Which of these are available?
