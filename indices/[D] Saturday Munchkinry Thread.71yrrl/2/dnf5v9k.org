You wake up in the body of a 25 year old programmer of any gender in a metropolitan area of a first-world country, say Dallas, Texas. You discover you're employed and have the knowledge of where you work and how to do your job -- it's enough to cover your expenses and have a bit left for savings but nothing extravagant or exciting.

You eventually (re)discover your parents but see no trace of who you were. As far as you can tell, your parents never had kids.

Through a series of comical mishaps, you discover you have psychic powers. Anything that has to do with concrete answers gives you indeterminate results but you can get hazy nudges in the right direction from time to time that turn out to be right more often than not.

What I'm trying to ask is, if you start with modest resources and actually had the powers of an average person who purports to have psychic powers and can read palms, futures, etc., how would you gain unlimited power and achieve world peace and happiness, while also not becoming a strategic military asset locked up in a bunker? Is opening your own psychic shop and helping random strangers the optimal path of action?
