Dowsing for minerals? Go to places that have no solid indications of mineral wealth, buy the rights for a pittance, pay for /confirmation/ from a seismic company (which should be cheaper than a search), then sell the find to a mining company.

Futures trading? If you see good weather coming for the next year, then the local farmers will have a good harvest, etc.

Career counseling, lobbying, consulting, etc. Get people to trust and listen to you, then influence them that way.
