So you have really fuzzy future sight? Invest in stocks, but hedge your bets since you aren't completely certain to win. This should give you lots and lots of money fairly quickly.

Normally, the next step would be to get into politics, joining the side of the winning candidate and becoming a shadow ruler. But since your future sight is fuzzy, this has a small chance of failing and blowing up in your face.

You could try to become a mad scientist, using your psychic abilities to guess the actual unknown laws of physics and create powerful tools that rely on these unknown laws... but again, since your ability is fuzzy, there's a chance it will literally blow up in your face and kill you.

So actually, you probably shouldn't try to get unlimited power with this ability.
