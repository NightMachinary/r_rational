I suppose a heuristic for whether I can do a thing is whether a layperson would think it OP. Therefore, a power that might turn out well is conditional precognition - divine information about the future as it would be if something you choose were true. The layperson doesn't think AGIs can get out of boxes like that. Look as far as you can under conditions that are more likely to spawn an FAI - perhaps "What would the far future look like if I had phenomenal cosmic power?".
