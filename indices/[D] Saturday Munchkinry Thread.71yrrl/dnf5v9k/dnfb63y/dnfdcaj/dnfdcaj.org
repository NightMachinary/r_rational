I'm approaching this from the perspective of what an average street medium would likely have access to if they actually had powers.

So, you can contact the dead but they tend to gush general things about their relatives and not actually help you with your stuff.

You can do minor jinxes on noncelebrity people you don't know but other people do and have some animosity towards -- like, make someone's cousin stub their toe once a month.

I don't think you'd be able to do paradoxes, or remember that you've done paradoxes, that seems too OP.

You can read minds, sort of, enough to make people suspect that you're at least a con artist who's reading microexpressions, though your powers are actually magical so they are a bit more accurate than that and can go into stuff that someone trained to read people won't pick up, like how delicious someone found a burger this morning, when they weren't actually thinking about the burger. I guess this can make you into a pretty good psychotherapist.

I think telekenesis that goes beyond parlor tricks would be too OP as well. Same with teleportation.

You have some remote viewing options but they're of things that tend to be wrong a lot of the time, though on average they tend to be more right than wrong, to give you an edge over other psychics just making things up.
