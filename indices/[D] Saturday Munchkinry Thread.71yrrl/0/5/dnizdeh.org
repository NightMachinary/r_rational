Can you swap into non-human bodies like this and does this allow you to retain sentience and human level cognition inside the other body? If the answer is yes to both, this could be an ethical variation on the life extension tricks other people have suggested.

If the answers are yes and no, this gets more interesting.

*Step 1*: Become absurdly rich (see other comments or read a bit further for suggestions on this).

*Step 2a*: Fund a shitton of bioengineering research with the purpose of creating an animal that undergoes a dramatic growth in cognitive ability when introduced to some chemical cue. Make sure this animal is non-sentient before getting the cue.

*Step 2b*: Alternatively, fund a shitton of research into mind machine interfaces to increase the cognitive abilities of non-sentient animals to some acceptable level. This is likely easier to do, but I imagine it could mess with the body switching powers in case a second switch is needed later one, what constitutes your natural body if most of you is running on a computer? Also, I still find brain uploading (which is essentially what this is) icky.

*Step 3*: Mass produced immortality.

One option for step 1 is to sell your services as a safer alternative to cryonics by just storing human consciences into long lived but non-sentient animals (iirc certain species of tortoises are essentially biologically immortal already).
