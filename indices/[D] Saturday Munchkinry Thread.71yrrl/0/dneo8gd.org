You can instantly switch bodies with anyone upon physical contact, such as a handshake. The switch is accomplished by some mysterious magic that rewrites the other person's brain to be an instance of you, and rewrites your brain to be an instance of them, while fixing up all the obvious problems that this might cause. (You will not have to relearn to walk, talk, or otherwise move in the new body, but you will be yourself and not inherit any special skills the other person may have learned. You are susceptible to genetic brain malfunctions the other person may possess, however). The power follows your consciousness between bodies. There is no limit on how frequently you can switch bodies.

What do you use this power for, if you decide to use it at all? Keep in mind that the person you switch bodies with will inherit the body you just came from, and will probably be rather unhappy with this sudden change (if you did it without consent).
