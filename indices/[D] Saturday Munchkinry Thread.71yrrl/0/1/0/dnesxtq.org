Sure, you can possess world leaders, but since you have never been in power before and don't know any of the secret passcodes, you are very bad at it, and soon removed from power. (Well, unless you take over Donald Trump, then you would be instantly spotted as an imposter for being more competent than normal). Also, you leave a trail of bodies behind you to cover up the evidence, but if you make a mistake, then suddenly you've got a police investigation and/or a very angry powerful person who /does/ know the real passcodes after you. What would you do to eliminate these risks?

Alternately, suppose you actually want to use this power for good. Is there any clever way to do so?
