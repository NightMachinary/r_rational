Alas, I'm too much of a dirty socialist to take part in extending the lives of the superrich. They can fund life extension research that can eventually be used for the benefit of all humans, or they can die with the rest of us. Taking advantage of a single supernatural bodyswapper is not the key to humanity's future (near-)immortality and I will not give them that escape valve, especially at the expense of the poor and desperate whose bodies they would be taking.

Although, I suppose that I might permit such swaps in exchange for more than mere cash payouts - e.g. "My price for swapping you with this person is not only that this person's family is taken care of in a generous fashion, but that you dedicate a sizable proportion of your resources to combating existential risk. I will not extend your life a second time if I am not satisfied with your results."

It would be pretty expensive, but you can't use /any/ of your money if you're dead, so there's that.
