Maybe. Theoretically, you could rake in enough cash (billions) that anything you wanted to buy for yourself you just could and there would be plenty left over for good causes too. I suppose it would be more socially optimal if you donate $10 billion to good causes rather than donate $9.9 billion and spend $100 million on yourself, but I'd say you earned as a reward for doing so much good with the rest of it. Though It is possible that over time you'd become corrupted and end up keeping larger percentages, hoarding wealth and power and end up just like them, I wouldn't know, I've never been superrich and had to face such a temptation.
