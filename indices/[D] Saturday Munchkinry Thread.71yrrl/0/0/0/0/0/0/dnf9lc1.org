Partly decreasing an extra step, partly "It seems like it would be easier to avoid or at least reduce a shift in values if I'm explicitly requiring actions on the part of my customer, rather than just asking for money and distributing it myself."

If the money is in my hands, then it's easier to think of it as "my money" and easier to come up with arguments as to why I don't need to spend it on other causes. The probability that my values would shift that much isn't too high, really, but I'd still prefer to avoid it.
