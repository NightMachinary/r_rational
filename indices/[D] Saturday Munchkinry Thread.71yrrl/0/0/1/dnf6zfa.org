  Come to think of it, there might be a niche market for swaps between (1) people who find it relatively easy to work out, diet, and lose weight and (2) people who would prefer to slim down immediately in another body rather than slim down on their own. Alternately, this might be an extended body tour sort of thing, where your fitness swapper is expected to reduce your weight over a period of time, and then you swap back.

I read a short story or listened to a podcast with this as the premise: people would pay for a personal trainer to use their body for a one hour workout. You could do something like that.
