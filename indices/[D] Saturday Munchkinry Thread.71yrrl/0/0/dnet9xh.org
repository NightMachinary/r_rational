Some trans people could potentially get a use out of this, so I could sell body swapping services (if you've got two people who want to switch with each other, it's relatively easy to facilitate a swap by shaking hands with each body one after the other).

I could also sell temporary body tours and permanent swaps for people who aren't trans but would like a different body (and life?) for other reasons.

Come to think of it, there might be a niche market for swaps between (1) people who find it relatively easy to work out, diet, and lose weight and (2) people who would prefer to slim down immediately in another body rather than slim down on their own. Alternately, this might be an extended body tour sort of thing, where your fitness swapper is expected to reduce your weight over a period of time, and then you swap back.

There are romantic/sexual applications to this as well, come to think of it. Imagine a whole new form of swinging, where you're still sleeping with your partner but both of you are in new bodies.

If I could just keep the government from trying to kidnap me, I could stand to make a fair amount of money.
