More-or-less ethically sound. This is immortality trough stealing "vegetable" bodies. Heck, you can swap /other people/ into the formerly brain-dead by doing a trivial rotation, so.. you can cash in on this. Of course, the supply of people with non-genetic brain damage but otherwise functional bodies is very small, and if you make a habit of doing this for rich old people, people will catch on.

Much larger market: You can help transsexuals far better than any surgeon ever could. Find one preop MTF, one preop FTM. Swap a into your current body, swap into b, leaving b in a, swap back to the body you started in, get paid.
