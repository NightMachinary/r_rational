Well the obvious answer is to hack the definition of a cow (bioengineer whatever useful properties you want into one species of cow, kill all the other cows). But that aside, this ability can be supremely helpful in terraforming other worlds:

- Cows +contain fat that+ can be burned so you can extend a nice big middle finger to the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation. You'd still need oxidizer, but even if you can't manufactor some from the cow itself, oxidizer is a lot lighter than fuel + oxidizer.
- The use of a near limitless source of food speaks for itself.
- You can use the cow corpses to start a miniature ecosystem on whatever planet you are colonizing, introducing large amounts of biomass and CO2 for bacteria and other lifeforms to thrive in, maybe even eventually creating a stable atmosphere (although that seems unlikely with 1440 cows per day).
