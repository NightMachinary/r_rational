*Description*

To make illusions, you need Replica and Audience. With these two things your creations manifest into reality, gaining independence.

Replica is a 'draft' of your illusion, something that (vaguely) resembles it. Audience is the group of people who believe Replica is a real thing.

For example, to create an illusionary dragon, you must first create its Replica out of wood. You can start a spell then, but illusion will be very weak. It is better to build a large tent, put the replica there, add devices that make really convincing sounds of large beast and emit smoke. Gather large crowd outside and make a convincing speech about how dangerous the dragon is. Suggest that you can show it --- if visitors promise to be very careful. And /then/ you start a spell.

In this example, dragon is fed by fairly powerful beliefs. It will look like a real thing at the start of a spell, its behaviour dictated by Audience expectations. It will /become/ real thing in 8 months, if people still aren't skeptical (although the final result may differ from your initial concept: it is strongly affected by Audience beliefs/expectations).

If Replica is the living being, same rules apply until they start to question their identity. Then, illusion shatters.

For example, if you manage to convince Audience that you are a stone statue, you will stand unaging for centuries, only threatened by pigeons. You won't be surprised that you can think --- obviously, you are made from thinking stone! Only with a powerful mental discipline you can break from this trance.

*Details*

- You can support only one illusion at a time. If illusion became real, you don't need to support it.
- Anything can be Replica, but you have to build it yourself... I mean, you have to /believe/ that you built it yourself.
- Audience of 100 people will make illusion real in 8 months. 1000 people --- 7 months, 10`000 people --- 6 months and so on. It will require at least 30 minutes for illusion to become real.
- Number of people who strongly doubt your illusion will be substracted from the Audience.

So, how would you rule the world, break the world, improve the world? Any interesting uses of this ability?
