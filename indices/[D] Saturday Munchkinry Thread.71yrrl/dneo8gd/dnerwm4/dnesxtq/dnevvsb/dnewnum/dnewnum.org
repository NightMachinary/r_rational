But can you control when the poison kills? Suppose you want to swap bodies with someone without their consent. So you shake their hand. Suddenly, they are in your body. The poison you ingested will kill them in several minutes or hours, long enough for them to cause trouble. So you could inject yourself with a fast acting poison the moment you shake their hand. You have to time it right or you die. Suppose you succeed. Then you have a dead body right there in front of you. Great, so the authorities think he was trying to poison you, but got himself instead. Until this happens 5 more times to a chain of people. What to do?
