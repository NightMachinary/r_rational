Well, this is a munchkin thread, here it would be unethical /not/ to use arbitrary horrible powers :)

First, it is interesting to run several tests:

1. Imagine a thread: at one end it goes into your finger, another end is loose. Thread is soaked in your blood, so it is virtually an extension of your body. Will touching the thread register as physical contact? If true, I guess you can shoot long and extremely thin streams of blood to transfer bodies.
2. Touch two persons at once. Try to focus on both of them and then activate your ability. Can you occupy two bodies at once? In one case, you get your clone, probably with the same power (and mangled mess of two consciousnesses in your previous body). In another case, you can test how your ability chooses its target.
3. Can you switch with people you can't see? If two unseen persons are touching you, can you specify target with your power?

Results of these tests will determine my strategy (and avenues for further tests).

If cloning from (2) didn't work, I see the wielder of this power in guarded facility, at the center of sprawling web of blood transmitting tubes. Pairs of people come there to switch their bodies for a price (switch with Person A, switch with Person B, switch with you original body). It is unlikely the wielder will ever leave the facility or die --- at this point, they made themselves too useful.

If cloning from (2) worked... well, it would be like intelligent and deadly virus. World domination becomes even easier (until your copies begin to rebel, but well, it's still technically the wielder who is in power, so goal achieved).
