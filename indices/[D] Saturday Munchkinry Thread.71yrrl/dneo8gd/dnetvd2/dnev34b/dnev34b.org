1. The mysterious magic will only allow you to use parts of your body that grew naturally, and were not artificially added or modified later. These body parts must be alive and connected to your brain via unbroken nerve connection with a certain information bandwidth. There is a minimal surface area of contact required, say 3 cm^{2.} If you could somehow grow a brain with lots of nerve fibers extending far out of it, and transfer into that, then I suppose you could get away with something like what you're suggesting.

2. You can only be in one body at once. If you try to do 2, the tie will be broken randomly.

3. You can switch with people you can't see. If someone brushes against you from behind with enough skin contact, you can transfer into them.
