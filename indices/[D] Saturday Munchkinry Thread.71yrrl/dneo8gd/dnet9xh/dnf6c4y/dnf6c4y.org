There would be an extremely lucrative but potentially unethical market for permanent body-swaps. If you take someone with an old or sick or crippled body and give them a young healthy body, their lifespan will drastically increase, at the expense of whoever they swapped with. I have absolutely no doubt that there are a large group of wealthy people who would spend millions of dollars for the opportunity. If you want to be semi-ethical about it, you could find poor and/or suicidal people who would be willing to literally sell their body to leave something behind for their family. Or perhaps you could do compromise things, maybe a broke 20 year old would be willing to become a 30 year old in exchange for a few million dollars. And the rich guy could repeat the process with a new person every 10 years. Anyone can have eternal youth as long as they can find enough willing hosts and have ridiculous amounts of cash (of which, you can take a cut)

I'd expect the demand for good bodies would vastly outstrip the supply, so there is a 100% chance that a black market for bodies would emerge. Kidnappings for sure. Adoption of a baby only to steal their body and have a chance at a brand new life. Heck, you'd likely have people who would conceive and raise a child (or clone themself) for the express purpose of taking the body. Also, they could probably convince someone who was planning on having an abortion to have the baby instead and give it to them for swapping (although I'd expect young-adult bodies would be the most desirable). Depending on your balance of ethics vs. piles of money, you could either allow this to happen or try to find some way of preventing it, but good luck with that.
