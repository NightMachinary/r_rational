Those things are equivalent to cash payouts. There's not really much point in coercing someone to donate their money to a cause as a price for the swap when you could just make them pay you as part of the cost and then donate it yourself and do other moral things with it (unless you're trying to decrease an extra step that could be taxed)

You're not extending the lives of the superrich as the endgoal, you'd do it to make yourself superrich, and then achieve your goals with that money, whether that be selfishly making yourself happy, or donating to science and life extension or whatever other donations are most efficient to maximize human well-being. The main question would be how to obtain healthy bodies ethically, and whether extending the lifespans of the superrich would cause more harm than your money is doing good, given that they would maintain and increase their wealth and control over society for longer, and wouldn't die and split their estates among multiple heirs and have estate taxes bite chunks off of it.
