The fic is quite good, I followed it for a few months already. Thanks for your work.

However, one detail I don't understand. In one of the first chapters, Taylor makes a reference to a little-known aspect of power of Glaistig Uaine, whose existence is also fairly little-known to general public. She was never anywhere near the Birdcage, so how did she know that?
