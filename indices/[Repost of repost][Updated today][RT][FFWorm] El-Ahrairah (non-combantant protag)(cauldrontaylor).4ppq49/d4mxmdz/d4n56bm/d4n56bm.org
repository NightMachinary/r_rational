Maybe my SoD can handle too much, but I think the point of the fic is that this Taylor is the closest thing to the game changer Cauldron has ever found. She's too damn useful /not/ to have in the full inner circle. "Thinker 9 with the exact specialty we need" wipes away virtually any concerns over age and experience.

And frankly, I suspect that was the result of the Path to Getting Full Use From the Power Thinker that was run immediately after she pinged on Contessa's radar. Giving her authority was the path of least resistance to getting Taylor fully on board with Cauldron's goals.
