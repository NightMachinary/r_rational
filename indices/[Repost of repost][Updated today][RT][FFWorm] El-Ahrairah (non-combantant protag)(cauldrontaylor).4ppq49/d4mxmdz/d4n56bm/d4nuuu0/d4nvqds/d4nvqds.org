Well, as HPJEV put it, any form of precognition is an instant global victory condition. The reason I don't hate her as a plot devise is that the entity is enough of a challenge that "you can successfully prepare for the final showdown in any way you can imagine" is /far/ from enough to assure victory, or frankly, even a real fighting chance.
