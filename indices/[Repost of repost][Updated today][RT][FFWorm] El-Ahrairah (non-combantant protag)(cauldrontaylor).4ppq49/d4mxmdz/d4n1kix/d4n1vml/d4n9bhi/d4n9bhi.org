  Contessa would go for a Path that would get the information out of Taylor without giving away any information to her or letting her get any more than the most trivial concessions from Cauldron.

My view on that us that Contessa /is/ on a Path to get /as much help/ out of Taylor /as possible/. The Path just happens to include befriending Taylor and giving her any information she asks for.
