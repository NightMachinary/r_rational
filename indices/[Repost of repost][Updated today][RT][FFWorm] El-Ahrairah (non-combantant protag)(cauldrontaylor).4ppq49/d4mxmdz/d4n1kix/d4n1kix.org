I hear you. Every time Taylor speaks with that form of authority towards high-ranking characters I cringe; it just doesn't fit with how I'd expect the interaction to go. It's just I have practice ignoring this kind of response, because I feel it with a large number of social scenes in virtually every story I've read.
