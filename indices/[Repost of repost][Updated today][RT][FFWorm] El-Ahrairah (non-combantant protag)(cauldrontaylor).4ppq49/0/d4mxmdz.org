It is okay... on my first read through a while ago I liked it okay, but the way Cauldron lets Taylor dictate terms just breaks my suspension of disbelief (I had the same problem with Security!). In canon this was the organization that was really just two people in the know and everyone else was kept at some level of disinformation or secrecy... the way they share things with Taylor is just too much for me.
