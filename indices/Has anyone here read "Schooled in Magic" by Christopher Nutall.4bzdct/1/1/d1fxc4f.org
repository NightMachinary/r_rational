That doesn't sound at all like what I've been reading! Are you sure we're talking about the same book?

If so, I'm guessing she must have either gotten a good editor or significantly improved her writing skill since you last read it.

Yes she easily changes the face of civilization with a bunch of technological ideas imported from Earth. Those ideas changed the face of civilization here after all, and that was when they were built up bit by bit. The tech ideas that the MC imported were not merely preliminary ideas. They were the result of a lot of history and cultural development and trial and error on Earth. and when the MC brings these ideas to the other world, a bunch of people there actually /notice/ that. (although they don't know where the ideas are imported from)

Of course, there were some prerequisites:

1. If you're summoned into the world by an evil necromancer who thinks you're a "child of destiny", in order to sacrifice you, and then
2. the sorceror who rescues you spreads that rumor around

people are going to think you're important even if you're not. After that if you befriend a merchant's daughter, you have someone who can sell your imported ideas.

Basically, the idea seems to be that if the average modern person fails to change the face of a somewhat primitive medieval civilization after that, they are either very unlucky, very stupid, or dead because they got into trouble.

The main character of schooled in magic is definitely NOT a mary sue. The characters are definitely NOT flat, and the execution is very good. I'd give the book somewhere around an 8 or 9 out of 10.
