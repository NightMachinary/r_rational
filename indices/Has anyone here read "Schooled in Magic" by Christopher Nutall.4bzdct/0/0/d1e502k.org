How were they generic and uninteresting? I read through the whole book and I'm already well on my way to finishing the second book in the series, and the characters setting and magic system seems original enough. Or at least, the author had a very original take on a seemingly typical medieval fantasy setting. She does a very good job making the world building sane and consistent, and the characters were portrayed realistically and relatably. The main character is pretty average by the standards of the modern world, and she's sorely lacking in knowledge beceause of her pretty average education before she got whisked away to a medieval fantasy world. But even the little bit of knowledge that she has from a modern technological society is enough to have a really profound impact on a medieval fantasy world, and the author makes this very clear in the story.
