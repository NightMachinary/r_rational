  Edit: field report: this comment chain is not very productive. I would recommend against arguing with RMcD94 in the future, as both that or reading the arguments is a profound waste of time.

Yeah, but he's hella amusing once you let go of the idea that you can convince him of anything.

In fairness, he's getting at least marginally better -- the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/r/9669819/0/45/][first ten reviews he left on 2YE]] were utterly unprintable (and also left as guest reviews instead of under his name). After I called him out on it, he logged in and started writing without curse words, and he's been keeping it relatively clean here on Reddit.
