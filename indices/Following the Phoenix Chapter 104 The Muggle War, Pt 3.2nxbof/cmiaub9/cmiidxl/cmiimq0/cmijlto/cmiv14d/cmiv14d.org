I don't know about you but I would not be comfortable walking in a group of violent individuals who've just held a grenade and weaponry for their first time in their entire life. Have no concept of keeping their finger off the trigger. On top of that they're wearing uncomfortable gas masks are exploring Dean Forest either after sunset or near sunset (when are these attacks taking place April? I can't remember).

They'd kill more of their own than wizards would.

Also when you thinking about timing the grenade to explode when it hit the shield, not when it bounced back, etc.

People drop grenades after their live even in the military.
