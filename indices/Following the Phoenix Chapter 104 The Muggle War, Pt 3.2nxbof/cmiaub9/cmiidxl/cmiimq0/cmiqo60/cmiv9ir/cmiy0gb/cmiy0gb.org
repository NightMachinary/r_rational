  Which seems to be the appropriate move for the military. Since it's clearly working.
#+end_quote

Violating the Geneva conventions is the appropriate move? What the hell? Ruining your international standing, removing the option of negotiation, enraging your enemies and radicalising those on the fence. (See torture during the War on Terror, or Dutch war crimes during the Indonesian war of independence if the former risks making things too political). It may be in some military leaders' best interest to ensure violence continues, and for that these tactics are likely to be effective, but it certainly isn't their job description.

Also, how is it clearly working? What metric are you using?

#+begin_quote
  Remember that this is a military example, pretty likely they've thrown plenty of non-live grenades before this one too.
#+end_quote

Are you familiar with the concept of Bayesian evidence? If so, please demonstrate by explaining how that video is (not) evidence.

#+begin_quote
  Now think of the dozens of times you or someone you've known has tried to throw a ball or something and missed.
#+end_quote

Where "something" is everything in a 150 degree arc in front of you, and at an angle between 0 and +80 degrees from the horizon: I have managed to hit that window 100% of cases in my adult life (n on the order of 100). I expect the true rate to be somewhere in excess of 99.9% accuracy for people who trust themselves to throw live weaponry.

#+begin_quote
  Then think of the ball being a timed trigger, then think that you have to count the number of seconds and throw the ball so that it impacts as just the right time on a shield that you can't see.

  And if it bounces back it's going to blow you up, etc.
#+end_quote

Where do you get the idea from that this is actually what they have to do? For that matter, where do you get the idea that they actually bounce back? Molotov cocktails don't have timers, and for tear gas it isn't a problem if they fail. Military grenades might have this problem, but they aren't explicitly used in the text.

  Again, I know literally every single thing unlikely in the story is just going to be Quirrel did it. Every tiny thing that doesn't make sense was Quirrel.
#+end_quote

Could you rephrase that into a bet? I think we disagree on this, and that you aren't rational enough to fall pray to Aumann's agreement theorem, so I would like to pump you for utility and allow you to do the same according to your worldview. May evolution decide who has the better priors.

#+begin_quote
  That's if you assume that it was a wizarding Britain thing, rather than individual wizards thing, which is a lot more likely.
#+end_quote

Why do you believe it's a lot more likely that it's an individual wizards thing?

#+begin_quote
  Knowing how to interact with wards? Again, Quirrel did it.
#+end_quote

The wards thing was in the news and spread to others. Pay attention.

#+begin_quote
  but I think you can agree there's a difference between setting up a character to be Mary Sue, which you can usually do with the adjustment of one characteristic (see rationality) and then having that character also narrowly avoid death like you see in movies when the main character will run through no man's land for 789 miles without being hit by a bullet once, BUT they will all just miss him. TENSION

You forgot halfway through that you started the sentence with "there's a difference between..."
