Edit: field report: this comment chain is not very productive. I would recommend against arguing with RMcD94 in the future, as both that or reading the arguments is a profound waste of time.

A) (crazy) Military is a subset of crazy muggles

B) It was mentioned at least twice that the military bases were handing out their stockpiles to civilians for the sake of guerilla warfare
