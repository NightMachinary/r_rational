Definitely military not crazy Muggles. No one has tear gas and gas masks, certainly not mobs, nor would mobs happen to wander through the forest and already have knowledge of how to deal with magic (see that guy saying just look for when you can't go somewhere or whatever).

Still doesn't feel very realistic but I feel like Quirrel did it is going to be the solution to everything like that
