  A) (crazy) Military is a subset of crazy muggles
#+end_quote

Specifically the crazy point is what I was talking about. Military are not crazy muggles since they're doing their job.

  B) It was mentioned at least twice that the military bases were handing out their stockpiles to civilians for the sake of guerilla warfare
#+end_quote

Civilians are not capable of using weaponry, including grenades, tear gas, gas masks, etc, after not even 24 hours nor in large groups. Nor are civilians trained in coordinating that kind of forest sweep.

  Anthropic bias for the Muggle who discovered the house numbers
#+end_quote

Yeah but while there might have been hundreds (if that) of house numbers (which again, is extremely stupid if you think about it for even a moment) the chances of someone being involved in both figuring out how wards work at a house and then training in weaponry, and then taking charge of a group going out into Dean forest, etc. Very unlikely.

The whole time turner thing in the next chapter literally allows for the story to become story/cheap movie esque where you can have a character constantly "barely" survive everything (see every running scene ever)
