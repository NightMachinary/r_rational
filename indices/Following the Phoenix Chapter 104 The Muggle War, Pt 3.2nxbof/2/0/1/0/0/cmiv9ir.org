  Violating the Geneva conventions, escalating tensions into a full-blown civil war in their own country, and/or arming crazies who have done the same.

Which seems to be the appropriate move for the military. Since it's clearly working. Though, yeah, I'll admit the military higher ups are certainly crazy the difference between a mob and a military unit is enough that I deem one crazy and one following orders.

  If no: what reason do you have to believe humans are not, in fact, good at throwing rock-sized objects

Remember that this is a military example, pretty likely they've thrown plenty of non-live grenades before this one too.

Now think of the dozens of times you or someone you've known has tried to throw a ball or something and missed. Then think of the ball being a timed trigger, then think that you have to count the number of seconds and throw the ball so that it impacts as just the right time on a shield that you can't see.

And if it bounces back it's going to blow you up, etc.

Again, I know literally every single thing unlikely in the story is just going to be Quirrel did it. Every tiny thing that doesn't make sense was Quirrel.

That's if you assume that it was a wizarding Britain thing, rather than individual wizards thing, which is a lot more likely.

To be honest the Ministry probably has seven hundred billion filing systems that are all horribly mismanaged and wrong. Seems like the kind of bureaucracy they'd prefer.

  I might have missed it, but where did you get the impression that they are the same person?
#+end_quote

Knowing how to interact with wards? Again, Quirrel did it.

  . now that his story has become clich√©
#+end_quote

Good point, but I think you can agree there's a difference between setting up a character to be Mary Sue, which you can usually do with the adjustment of one characteristic (see rationality) and then having that character also narrowly avoid death like you see in movies when the main character will run through no man's land for 789 miles without being hit by a bullet once, BUT they will all just miss him. TENSION

  I would suggest decrying it only once its usage becomes problematic, rather than when it is merely introduced.
#+end_quote

Fair enough, I'll just make a note of it here, since it did happen twice in quick succession, and I suppose it makes sense to show us that he barely survived so we can understand what Quirrel is doing.
