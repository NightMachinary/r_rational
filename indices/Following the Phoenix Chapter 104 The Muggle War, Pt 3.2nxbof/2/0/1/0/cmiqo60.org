  Specifically the crazy point is what I was talking about. Military are not crazy muggles since they're doing their job.

Violating the Geneva conventions, escalating tensions into a full-blown civil war in their own country, and/or arming crazies who have done the same.

  Civilians are not capable of using weaponry, including grenades, tear gas, gas masks, etc, after not even 24 hours nor in large groups. Nor are civilians trained in coordinating that kind of forest sweep.

Do you have military or paramilitary credentials? If yes: holy crap, they let people who think arming mobs that set negotiators on fire is a good idea into the military? If no: what reason do you have to believe humans are not, in fact, good at throwing rock-sized objects or following directions with an uncertainty less than two orders of magnitude greater than the area being searched for? (Quirrel wanted to attack Harry, so he located Harry (trivial, since the wards were set up to prevent muggle attack, not wizard scrying), turned the local army leader guy (memory charm, imperio, etc.), and got him to tell the mob where to find wizards and witches to burn).

Welcome to +wizarding britain+ any human organisation, enjoy uour stay.

(e.g. switching to opt-out organ donation saves 0.01% of your nation's population per year (where 'saving' is ~5 extra years of life, for a total of 0.05% increase in total utility per annum) without costing extra money or reducing agency; the 90%+ probability that neither of us will shift our opinions by the end of this (prediction; not a signal of unwillingness on my part); the state of education; using owls to deliver mail; electrons having negative charge; QWERTY keyboards, etc.)

Consider the following: if wizards didn't have addresses, what should they fill in on their tax forms? How would they receive mail? It might need separate filing systems and everything! Obviously it's better just to give them proper house names and let the department of obfuscation or whatever deal with the difficulties: they're not paying me to do their job on top of mine, you know.

  the chances of someone being involved in both figuring out how wards work at a house and then training in weaponry, and then taking charge of a group going out into Dean forest, etc. Very unlikely.

I might have missed it, but where did you get the impression that they are the same person?

#+begin_quote
  The whole time turner thing in the next chapter literally allows for the story to become story/cheap movie esque where you can have a character constantly "barely" survive everything (see every running scene ever)

Oh no, whatever is the Destined Hero, The Boy Who Lived, Last Scion of the Most Noble House of Potter, Killer of Dementors, Most Competent Guy in the Room, Discoverer of Timeless Physics, Ward of Dumbledore, etc. etc. now that his story has become /cliché/?

As we have seen with Munroe, Quirrel is trying to craft a hero the only way his emotionally stunted self knows how: by throwing a bunch of Hero Tropes at the wall and expecting people to see a leader they want to follow.

That is, however, an in-universe explanation, which wouldn't excuse out-of-universe bad writing by doing the same as Quirrel and throwing hero tropes at Harry. So far though, I don't thing the author has done worse of a job at that than Yudkowsky, both being less clichéd than main canon (which is a children's book, and therefore good in different ways than the depth of the plot), and I would suggest decrying it only once its usage becomes problematic, rather than when it is merely introduced.

Since the author is a competent writer, I'd expect her to know that now that it has been explicitly stated that Harry is safe, a significant amount of tension drops in cases where he is supposedly under threat, so she'll know to handle it properly and escalate.
