That's still a lot better than "lets cluster together in easy-to-identify targets so that our way-more-powerful enemy knows /exactly/ how to find us, rather than having to carefully search and spy on members of their own population".

If you have magic, you can get pretty creative with not being caught as an undocumented. You can pretend to be a hunter-gatherer tribe in the Amazon. You can hide in plain sight as a local animal indefinitely (Well, in canon any skilled wizard can do any human transfiguration on anyone. I think that may have been nerfed on HPMOR). You can use mind magic to encourage people to not notice that you have no business being where you are. If you're feeling immoral, you can just steal an identity. Getting a fake ID or registration number would be laughably easy.

(Also, I've actually seen the mind control tech we have in labs right now, it's /cool/ and one day it might be scary, but it will be a while. And none of it has even been /tried/ on humans, unless there are secret military things.)
