  Why can't wizard civilians just stop using magic (except really subtle magic) and live undetectably amongst the muggle population until it all blows over? Like in the old days? Muggle borns are probably already on the census as registered normal people, and there's not that many purebloods to arouse suspicion if a few extra undocumented people start appearing.

Is it likely that muggles will avoid harming undocumented persons? Or is it more likely that every undocumented or questionably documented person is detained in Gitmo II, and any child showing signs of accidental magic is implanted with mind-control tech, or at least an explosive collar, right after their parents get a .50cal round through the head from a mile away?
