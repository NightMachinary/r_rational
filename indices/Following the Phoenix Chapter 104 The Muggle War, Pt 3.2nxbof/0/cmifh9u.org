Why can't wizard civilians just stop using magic (except really subtle magic) and live undetectably amongst the muggle population until it all blows over? Like in the old days? Muggle borns are probably already on the census as registered normal people, and there's not that many purebloods to arouse suspicion if a few extra undocumented people start appearing.

There might be witch trials but you can often fake deaths and divert suspicions with subtle magic. The Statute of Secrecy might be easily broken by a powerful wizard, it's true (I mean really, the SoS is near-unenforceable, but it's also canon so we should probably make the best case for it being enforceable)... but there is absolutely no way Muggle intelligence can beat people who can modify memories and impersonate people at will. A military showdown and/or using magic to hide is just about the /worse/ strategy for Wizards right now, the magical edge is subtlety.

I suppose if it goes on too long you'll lose too much knowledge due to the Interdict, but you've got a good 25-50 years of solid, easy hiding before you start really losing things. Plenty of time for bringing stuff mostly back to normal.

(In fact...given the Muggle leader's thought that they weren't human, it occurs to me that they could just hide the purebloods as pet animals, though that magic might not be subtle enough to escape muggle detection).
