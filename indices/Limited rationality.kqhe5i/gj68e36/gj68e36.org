A bit late to the party, but I'll chip in.

A rational story written from the perspective of Michael Scott would be functionally indistinguishable from a rational story written from the perspective of a child.

Michael Scott isn't just a Man-Child - he actually is truly childish. He somehow managed to absorb almost no useful information about how the world works until the beginning of the series, and he also completely failed to develop a full/adequate Theory of Mind. At the beginning of The Office Michael knows almost nothing about anything, craves attention above all else and, while he does have empathy, does not really understand how other people think or feel (e.g he can never understand why his employees don't enjoy his antics). Michael's character arc throughout the series is fundamentally indistinguishable from that of a child growing into an adult - he grows more worldly, more understanding of others, less dependent on external attention to satisfy his self-worth., etc...

So yeah. If you want to write a 'Limited Rationality' story, just write a story about a really smart but really young (and not too observant) kid. A character like that would naturally not have much prior experience with anything (including other people), and would be almost naturally inclined to the sort of experimentation that would result in antics like 'filling up on pasta right before a marathon'.
