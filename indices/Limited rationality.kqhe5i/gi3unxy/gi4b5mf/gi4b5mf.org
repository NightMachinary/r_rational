Leaning heavily on the prior probability is sometimes like this.

In statistics, a strategy for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias%E2%80%93variance_tradeoff#Approaches][beating the bias variance tradeoff]] is to use a dumb model that's inexpressive in conjunction with a smart model that's overexpressive. That might describe the underlying dynamic you're picking up on. I've been thinking about it a lot lately as a heuristic in my personal life, and it's a very general pattern. Try to optimize your decisions, but respect cultural wisdom. Try to stand out from the crowd, but don't look like a weirdo. Look for a spot in the market where you have an edge on assessing value, but practice bid shading.

We could also say that maybe Michael offloads much of the computational work going into his decisions into different places than someone who emphasizes explicit verbal reasoning. Perhaps he's able to get away with using very simplistic arguments because he's got very good filters for selecting simplistic arguments running in the background.
