Well scientists always make this error. There are countless models that have been thrown out as more information is learned. So perhaps you can have a rational character be a scientist. Either that or a detective. You can always come to a rational conclusion that is ultimately false given a set of truths that aren't complete. I think that even happened a few times in HPMOR where people believed things to be true one way when given limited evidence. Maybe if you make the character an alien? There are those comic strips, Strange Planet, that takes everyday things and makes them seem weird to any observer alien. Perhaps the main character can behave like that.
