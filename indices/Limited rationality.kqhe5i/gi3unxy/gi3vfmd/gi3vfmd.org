I really like Dirk Gently! I see your point about the trope, but it doesn't really apply to my example, or am I misinterpreting it? He isn't right at all, it's more like he is wrong for the right reason? We have the knowledge to know that he'll be ill and out of it because your body can't handle being really full and do exercise.

And is it a good exercise to write a rational character that is significantly less able than you are? Would that help you be more rational at all?
