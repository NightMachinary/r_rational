I think you're thinking of "Right for the Wrong Reasons" trope [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightForTheWrongReasons]]

"[D]idn't Aristarchus and the Pythagoreans propose heliocentrism in ancient times? If only they had prevailed, we might have had real science millennia sooner. What was their evidence? Well, you see, fire is nobler than earth and the center is a nobler position. So fire has to be in the center. QED. There are many names for this sort of thinking, but 'scientific' is not one of them."

Example: The climax of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone sees the Golden Trio going through the trapdoor guarded by Hagrid's pet three-headed dog to try to beat Snape to the Stone, which they believe Snape is trying to steal. Yes, the Stone is in danger of being stolen, but what Harry discovers at the end of the road is one of the first indicators that he and Snape were on the same side all along.

One show that I think you would like that has this premise is: Dirk Gently Holistic Agency is a tv comedy show and book series by Douglas Adams that's a really good example of this. Basically everything falls into Dirk's lap by the universe helping him/special ability/luck.

There is also Joker's joke at the end of the comic book "The Killing Joke": "See, there were these two guys in a lunatic asylum...and one night, one night they decide they don't like living in an asylum any more. They decide they're going to escape! So, like, they get up onto the roof and there, just across this narrow gap, they see the rooftops of the town, stretching away in the moonlight...stretching away to freedom. Now, the first guy, he jumps right across with no problem. But his friend, his friend daren't make the leap. Y'see...y'see, he's afraid of falling. So then, the first guy has an idea...He says 'Hey! I have my flashlight with me! I'll shine it across the gap between the buildings. You can walk along the beam and join me!' B-but the second guy just shakes his head. He suh-says... he says 'What do you think I am? Crazy? You'd turn it off when I was half way across!'"

The tropes page has a bunch more examples.
