Sorry for making you guys wait. I uh, think I underestimated how many people were waiting for this. Based on the stats from my website/fanfiction.net, it looks like some of you have been checking back on a regular basis even after months without updates. That's somewhere between heart-warming and guilt inducing, not gonna lie.
