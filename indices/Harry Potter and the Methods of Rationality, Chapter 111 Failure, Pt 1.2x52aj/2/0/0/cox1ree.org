The the thing that seems confusing to me about B): If Voldemort believes the prophecy is about Harry, then why wouldn't he just /shoot/ him? That seems like a much more reliable method.

Then again, we are talking about a villain whom, upon learning a baby was prophesied to kill him, decided to turn the baby /into a similarly intelligent copy of himself./ Perhaps Dumbledore finally drove poor Riddle insane.
