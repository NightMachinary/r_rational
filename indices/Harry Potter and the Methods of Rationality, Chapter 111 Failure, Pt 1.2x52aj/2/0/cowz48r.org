I am guessing either:

A) This is all still mirror-based wish fulfillment

or

B) This is all part of some deeper plan to make Harry think he "won" and has been "successful" and can thus /not rip apart the stars in their heavens/.

Even if B), the acting seems overly dramatic and the sort of thing I expect Harry to question shortly (hand back all Harry's possible tools, then violently exclaim "No if you kill me now while my back is turned I will really no-foolin' die!"? *Really?*) This inclines me towards A); It wouldn't surprise me if in an hour and a half, Harry will question his perceptions and realize he is mirror-bound specifically because of how implausible what just happened was.
