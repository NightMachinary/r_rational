Really? My reaction upon experiencing extreme depths of frustration, and I am a damned hammy person, is usually to lapse into apparent calm and mutter "oy gevalt" or "oh bugger". Seeing that actually shows, for me, /more/ exasperation than screaming and ranting. Screaming and ranting shows I am still /engaged/ and have not yet started wanting to just fuck off and /not be there anymore/.
