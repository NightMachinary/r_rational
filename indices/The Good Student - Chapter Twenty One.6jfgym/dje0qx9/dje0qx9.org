Talking to a dragon... talking to an archmage and saying no... thats kind of out of character for nic , at least for the nic we learned about in the first few chapters... but then again i dont like the way the story turns in the last few chapters and hope it goes back to a more rational scope. Hes a bookworm and stickler, making him interesting and refreshing as a character but now in this chapter you could take him out and put harry potter (or any other generic fantasy story mc) into his position and it would be the same... still i see a lot of potential and hope that this was now only to give him another naive target to follow ( or more like just the next girl to follow). Thus going back to worldbuilding and showing his character again like in the first 15 chapters...
