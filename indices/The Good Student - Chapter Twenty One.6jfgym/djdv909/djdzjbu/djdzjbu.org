I think that judgement is a little harsh.

If the story thus far has taught Nic anything, it's that he's been out of his depth since the beginning. I myself (and I think most other readers) originally thought Nic would get training by assisting Tenner with research. Instead, Nic was used and manipulated by Tenner, and his attempts to outmaneuver Tenner ended in complete failure. Simole is now stuck in a hell full of demons, from which she is unlikely to return. Nic's attempts to circumvent the social obstacles to his education would have been a failure too, if Minister Delcroix hadn't stepped in.

Now the most dangerous mage in the country, who is supposed to be locked up for treason, shows up and offers to train him. This is the same person who treated his daughter like a tool since infancy and shows little to no sadness over having lost "his sword." He's offering to "sharpen" Nic into a new one.

Even if you ignore the parallels to the Tenner fiasco this situation must present to Nic, anyone with a modicum of emotional intelligence could see that the Archmage plans to essentially use Nic, and that that is unlikely to end well for him.

Choosing to be whisked away by the wanted, dangerous Archmage who is likely to manipulate you for his own (in fairness, probably worthwhile) ends is just about the /least/ rational thing Nic could do at this point.
