I've been reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8484470/1/Potter-Who-and-the-Wossname-s-Thingummy][Potter Who and the Wossname's Thingummy]], a crossover between Doctor Who and Harry Potter, and it has a few of the best 'reasonable explanations for a seemingly crazy canon' I have ever seen in Harry Potter. Not particularly rational as fiction goes, but still pretty awesome anyways.

I am going to list a couple of the best examples from the fic below, but really you should just go read the whole thing, it's pretty amazing.

  PWATWT Ch. 13 - Duology (II) on Quidditch:

  #+begin_quote
    [Of course, quidditch was unusually interesting, come to notice it. It was a universal constant. Everyone was into it, even Asenion Izzard was a quidditch buff. Up to a point it made sense: a spectator sport with plenty of violence for the kiddies and plenty of graphable statistics for nerdy grown-ups was a perfect recipe for broad popularity. But with /that/ degree of enthusiasm?

    Oh. Oh ho ho. Wait. Of /course/ it's that popular, how could it not be?

    It's a ritual. A ritual performed by teams containing the occultly significant number of /seven players. Every match is an act of magic in and of itself./ But why and to what end?

    Obvious, really: In what passes for my memory, alchemists are silly people who save their own urine and discover phosphorous by accident. Here they're enormously puissant people who fail to run the world...because they're wrapped up in quidditch. /Quidditch is a memetically-engineered auto-hypnotic socio-magical control mechanism designed to tie up wizard minds!/

    Okay, /that's/ sorted, back to the Trophy Room Problem.]

  PWATWT Ch. 12 - Duology (I) on Neville's Remembrall:

  #+begin_quote
    "What /good/ is it?" he said. "Of course I've /forgotten/ something. Everyone's forgotten /something/. Goes without saying. What's the point of an /aide-m√©moire/ that just discreetly points out you've forgotten something without telling you what it /is/?" The only reason to do that would be if you wanted to be reminded /that/ you'd forgotten something you don't want to remember just yet, /and in that case she should have sent it to me, not Neville ---/

    Oh. Hello unexpected insight.

    /--- but it's not for me, it's for/ him/!/

    /He knows his faults! he doesn't need to be reminded of them! he needs to know how to/ fix /them and/ this can't help!

    /This is nothing more than an insult./

    The Remembrall disappeared into his closing hand.

    /I hate --/

    Wrong word. Not hate. Hate was for burnt toast...
