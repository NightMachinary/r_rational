Enforce a small wordcount and/or time limit to get more writers (and more readers). [[http://365tomorrows.com/][365 tomorrows]] has a 600 word limit, and their stories are fine. [[http://thirtyminuteponies.tumblr.com/][Thirty Minute Ponies]] gave writers a 30-minute limit and usually featured stories in the 1000-word range; some lovely things were written there.

You might also want to restrict fanfic writing to well-known franchises. Series like Naruto, Harry Potter, Evangelion, My Little Pony, Sailor Moon etc... are extremely well known and it is more likely that readers will be familiar with them.
