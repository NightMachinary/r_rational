Lord of the Rationality, the longest Omake, was legitimately rational, and a lot more of a serious fiction than some of the other Omakes (like the He-Man one, which was a single joke sentence). If we could get a bunch of people on this subreddit to participate in a competition to write the best/most rational Lord-of-the-Rationality-style short fiction, I think that'd be pretty great.
