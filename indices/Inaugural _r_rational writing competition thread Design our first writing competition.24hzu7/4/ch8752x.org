This might go without saying, but I would expect the bulk of our contests to take the form of a prompt about which to write a rational story. I would expect this prompt to be some sort of trope, either of rational fiction or of fiction in general, for entrants to embrace or violate or warp.

The other thing I can see us doing is perhaps more unique to our community. This genre has a habit of re-writing works from outside the genre (see: HPMOR and the bazillion copycats thereof). Because of this, we could have contests specifically for fanfiction. [[/u/Threedoge]] suggests explaining why some aspect of a story that seems not to make sense actually does make sense. We could also have "how it should have ended"s, in which some character or characters in an established work take some shortcut to the ending of the story they want. I'm sure there are many other possibilities in this vein, and these are fairly broad, so we may want to limit them further.
