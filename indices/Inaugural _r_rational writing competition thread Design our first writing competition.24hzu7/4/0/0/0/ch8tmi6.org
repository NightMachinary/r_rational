I support this plan. It's really hard to write any rational fiction at all, and to write a lot of it is a lot harder. And I don't think we should have competitions that last for over a month or so; better to have a lot of weekly competitions than like 2 yearly ones. And not too many of the people of [[/r/rational]] have the free time for writing long rational fictions in a short amount of time, so the competitions should be about writing very short fictions in order to gain more competitors.

I think having everybody write things that are about the length of Lord of the Rationality would be nice.
