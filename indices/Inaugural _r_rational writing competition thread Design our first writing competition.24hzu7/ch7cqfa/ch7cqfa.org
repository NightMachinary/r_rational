I think we should try something simple for the first time, since we'll need to work out how to best format the event and everything. I've messaged the mods of [[/r/fantasywriters]] (they run excellent writing contests) to that regard.

I would also like to drop [[http://www.terrybisson.com/page2/page2.html][Terry Bission's 60 Rules For Short Fiction]]. Extremely relevant and useful advice, paticularly:

#+begin_quote
  3 The SF reader is a gamer who brings a problem-solving intelligence to the story. This is the SF writer's one great advantage. Use it.

  4 The more extraordinary the idea, the more ordinary the language. Experimental writing is for quotidian events. James Joyce and Virginia Woolf understood this.

  41 Novels are made out of characters and events. Short stories are made out of words alone. They are all surface. Polish.

  54 Withhold as much information as possible for as long as possible. When the reader knows everything, the story is over.

  59 Ignore these rules at your peril.

  60 Peril is the SF short story writer's accomplice, adversary, and friend.

Edit:

Has anything like this ever been attempted at LessWrong?

I'll also link to [[http://yudkowsky.net/other/fiction][EY's fiction]], since he's basically the gold standard.

And heck, why not [[http://qntm.org/fiction][qntm's]] while I'm at it?
