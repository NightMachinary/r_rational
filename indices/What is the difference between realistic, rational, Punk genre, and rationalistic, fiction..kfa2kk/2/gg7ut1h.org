Punk as a literary meta-genre is about rebellion.

Cyberpunk, the most common genre in that category, is about rebelling against extractionary, extortionary capitalism-gone-wild. Cyberpunk is about how the corporation is both a leech and the Grim Reaper; cyberpunk is about how the individual is both exalted and powerless in the face of dehumanizing, inhuman institutions raised up as a prayer to Mammon. Cyberpunk is a literary genre that looks at the growth of corporate power and the decline of humanism everywhere from governance to the board room and says "This is the future we are building."

Cyberpunk isn't the only punk, obviously. Steampunk is a rebellion against the sameness of industrialization and against the streamlining of the world, a rebellion against a world without frontiers and without adventure. Solarpunk is a rebellion against the collapse we're staring down right now, a statement that actually we could be doing things differently, that we could be building a sustainable and green future (even as we continue to light the future on fire to line the pockets of our modern-day robber barons).

None of these have anything to do with realism or realistic fiction. No genre of "punk" fiction /can/ be realistic past a certain level; at that point you're not really writing speculative fiction so much as ... I dunno, Age of Sail historical fiction, rather than steampunk. Solarpunk isn't reality because in reality instead of building arcologies or city-sized upper-story parks and zipping around in electric mass-transport pods, we live and work in concrete boxes and mostly drive petroleum-burning cars.

Rational fiction and rationalist fiction are styles, which are completely orthogonal to other axes. Adequate definitions of those are in the sidebar.
