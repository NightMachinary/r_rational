I can't give exact definitions, but in my experience, there are definite differences.

*Realistic and rational:* the latter focuses on intelligent characters, while the former can be about anyone. You can write a perfectly realistic story about a bunch of idiots. Additionally, realistic stories do not need to challenge readers intellectually---again, you can write a perfectly realistic story with deus ex machinas, no munchkinry, and no fair-play whodunnit.

*Rational and rationalist:* the latter is didactic (tries to teach rationality and similar skills) while the former is not.

*Punk and the rest of them:* tbh, "-punks" are a bunch of such wildly varying genres, I don't exactly see what similarities can they /all/ have with the other three.
