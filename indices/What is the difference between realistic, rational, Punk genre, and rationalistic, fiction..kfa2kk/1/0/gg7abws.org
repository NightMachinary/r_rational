Punk genre is exemplified by cyberpunk which was a deconstruction of many sci fi stories about utopian places where technology solves peoples problems. Cyberpunk is how technology would still enable the same human fallibles and problems that we have all been dealing with since day 1. To put it succinctly, utopian science fiction is about how technology will eventually help us overcome the problems that have, up until now, been endemic to human nature. Cyberpunk is about how technology won't."
