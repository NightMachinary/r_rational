I do not think a rationalist Movie/Show is really possible, because it would have no space to explain the protagonist's reasoning, without literally having him a fit of Narrator's Monologue.

The closest thing to a rationalist movie I can think of is *Shawshank Redemption*. The protag is an immensely rational and focused person whos actions are almost always well thought out, he only fails when he is working with insufficient information. It also has a subtle progression theme worked in.

in *Watchmen,* Veidt is also a rationalist, albeit a villainous one (or is he??).

*Prison Break* at least attempted to portray the main protag as a careful rationalist, but it eroded with each season.

All the time-loop movies (*Groundhog Day, Butterfly Effect, Triangle, Primer* etc) at least attempt to show what a protag who wants to be a rationalist about time travel, but fails, would be like.

Cast Away has shades of rationality once the protag is stranded on the island. In fact, I would say that in all fiction, time-travel stories and robinsonades show rationality best. Time travel removes the issue of insuficient information, while a robinsonade removes the issue of pesky human interactions, leaving the protag to tackle practical problems rationally.
