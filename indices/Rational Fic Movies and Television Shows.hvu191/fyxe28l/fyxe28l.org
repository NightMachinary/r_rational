I think that if you take Walt as a rationalist character (rather than as a self-justifying paragon of toxic masculinity mixed with the sunk cost fallacy) you could easily take most characters from most TV shows as rationalists. A:tLA's Azula is more rationalist than Walt is, as is Iroh; BtVS's Anya is ten times the rationalist than Walt.
