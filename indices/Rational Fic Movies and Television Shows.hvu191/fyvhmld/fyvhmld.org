There was a tv show called Day Break with Taye Diggs which only lasted one season which was pretty good. I think it was a little ahead of its time, actually, in how much it expected the viewers to keep track of and the ratings quickly plummeted because of it.

It's a time loop show about a cop who gets stuck in a Very Bad Day where he's framed for a murder by a powerful conspiracy and, to make things worse, the injuries transfer loop to loop so if he dies, he dies. The protag is fairly rational about the whole thing - for example, he cottons on to being in a time loop, like, ten minutes into Day 2 and instead of wasting time on shock or denial he instantly jumps into exploit his new advantage and trying to change things.

The season finale wraps up reasonably well and doesn't feel unfinished. Give it a go.
