Abed from Community.

His personality revolves around self-awareness and deconstruction, and apart from the fact that he uses his powers to live in references, he's a pretty good example of rationalist characters in TV.

[[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic][Even the TVTropes page on Rational Fiction mentions him.]]

Edit: As was pointed out below, this is very much not a serious show in the slightest. In fact, it could be said that its self-awareness of real-world tropes allows it to /really/ play around with concept humour, and the rationalist aspect is a by-product of that self-awareness and general deconstructive humour.
