I mean, Walt's flaws are not mutually exclusive of being a rationalist. He's absolutely a villain. He absolutely has biases which a perfect Bayesian would do more to account for, but that doesn't mean he's not a Reasonable Representation of a Rationalist Fictional Character.

​

Additionally, there's a reason that I disqualified animation -- Cartoons don't have the same restrictions that live action television does, and you can kind of "retrofit" the rules of the world to not undo your characters' rationality if needed which means they're more gods than rationalists... Maybe that's not the case with ATLA, but it certainly is a possibility.

​

I certainly don't think that "most characters from most TV shows" can be taken as rationalists, and it seems like your disdain for Walt as a character is clouding your ability to judge .

​

I also don't really think a non-POV character **can** be a rationalist. Azula sets some traps and like, does strategy a time or two, but you don't fully see her process. Having predictable opponents doesn't make **you** a rationalist. Iroh, you could make more of a case for, but, again, it's tough to see all of his plots laid bare, because he's not the POV.

​

I didn't watch Buffy, and I'm not super-interested in doing a deep dive into a tertiary character to evaluate their strengths as a rationalist.

​

To me, Ender Wiggin is a rationalist, and Walter White is a rationalist, because they show their work (to the audience, if not to another character), and if you had a suitable understanding of chemistry/military strategy, you could potentially deduce what they would do to get themselves out of a complicated scenario where you knew the variables.

​

Walt isn't a "good guy" or a "hero" he's not a feminist ---- I mean, straight up *he's* the villain in the series, but I don't think that makes him not a rationalist.
