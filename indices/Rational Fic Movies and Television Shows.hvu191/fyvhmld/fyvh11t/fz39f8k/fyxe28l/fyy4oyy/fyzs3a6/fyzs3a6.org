That's... not a definition of rationalist that makes any sense to me, I guess. To me, the three defining qualities of a rationalist character (as opposed to a rationalist work) are:

- The character self-reflects and at least attempts to perceive their own internal reasoning (which Walter White catastrophically fails at, constantly)
- The character makes a best effort to treat other people as agents with their own rules, rather than projecting the character's own rules onto those others (likewise)
- The character applies a deliberate strategy towards getting what they want, refining it in both failure and success. This strategy should probably be goal-tools-process-cost or something equivalent (What do I want, what tools do I have, how can I get from here to there, and what will it cost me) (as above, White fails at it).

The fact that a character shows their work isn't that relevant to being a rationalist character, to me. It's what their work consists of, and what lines their deductions follow.
