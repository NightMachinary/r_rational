I am kind of stuck on thinking about the different zones.

If I understand your setting correctly, inducing errors in zones / sectors with less solution is easier, right? But at the same time the realtime zone, the one with the highest resolution, is 40k AU in diameter, or 20k AU radius around Earth. A distance, I might add, that is about a third of a light year, a distance that will only increase with population growth and will perhaps at some point, once humanity is sufficiently starfaring and not continue to propagate, crash reality given the system running reality is finite in resources.

Another way to /hack/ reality is by inducing changes after rendering, but before verification, with verification cycles being magnitudes slower than render cycles.\\
I understand the necessity of blocks or matrices of various sizes, but the size is pretty arbitrary, right?\\
Anyway, it would be nice to find out if the verification process checks every block at the same time / instant, or if it does so in a consecutive manner. (This of course refers to blocks of the same and highest verification frequency; blocks of lower frequencies may be checked at integer fractions intervalls)\\
The first, same-instant check would actually remind me of Conway's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life][Game of Life]].

If it /is/ consecutive, sufficiently artful hacks /might/ be able to propagate from block to block, I think. If it's sequentially verified a hack would only last as long as till the next and slowest verification cycle clocks. (An odd feeling tells me I'm missing something :/ )
