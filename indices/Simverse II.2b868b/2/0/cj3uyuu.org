As I mentioned in a comment, and as I will explain in Simverse III, there are ways to bypass the observer-imposed limitations on hacking.

Time travel is impossible. Each 'sector cube' has a time stamp alongside its spatial coordinates, and an inconsistency in this value (due to a hack) triggers the verification tool 100% of the time.

Also, the 'saved configuration' is akin to a replay in a video game. The simulation is not going to record 100% of the data stream it feeds the observers. What it is going to do is save only the bare bones of the data stream, ie: the modifications, the new forces, the added or removed elements, and feed it to the current simulation during a reset.

During a reset, the regular rendering operation is overridden by the 'replay' file. Instead of reading the current situation, applying algorithms and rendering the final result, it is told to read a saved situation, apply a set of determined operation and end up with a final result equal to what WOULD HAVE happened if there were no errors.

After a reset, the timestamp of the affected sector is equal to those around it.
