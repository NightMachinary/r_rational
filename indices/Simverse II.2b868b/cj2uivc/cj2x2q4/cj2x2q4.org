Well... no. A missile launching is not 'abnormal behavior, to be corrected'. It physically moves from sector to sector, something which is perfectly acceptable. On top of that, a resets mostly clear up errors, deletes anomalies and so on by taking a save file from literally microseconds earlier than the trigger point of the verification.

You can however duplicate sectors, and that method will be explained in Simverse III.
