Now it reminds me of [[http://qntm.org/responsibility][I don't know, Timmy, being God is a big responsibility]] and the [[http://qntm.org/structure][Fine Structure stories]] by the same author, rewriting reality and resetting memory.

+So far I can't see applications of the setting, though.+

So if I understand you correctly, with a quantum computer and sufficient understanding of the reality code it is possibly to overwrite the reality, but only in the absence of humans?

PS: As I understand it time travel is impossible, but is the access to information of previous states of the sectors possible? If so, then the all of our past, of our history would be open to our perusal.
