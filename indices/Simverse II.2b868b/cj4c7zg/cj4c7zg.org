  They sent it into space and devised a way to maintain the code looping in the processor despite the memory wipes. The rear end of the spacecraft was somehow far away enough from the 'memory wipe area' to be affected. The project never gave any new results, and it was abandoned. A decade later, the spacecraft appeared 100m underwater, over the Marinas trench, in the exact same spot where the diver had died, with a new set of data. It had teleported over fifty thousand astronomical units. [...] The data, was in fact a programming language for an advanced quantum computer, and it described reality, and that eventually modifying that code and running it on an adapted quantum processor could affect reality itself.

Why ... did this work? I'm not really a programmer, but if I build a computer in Minecraft and run some code on it, the code is not inserted into Minecraft's code.
