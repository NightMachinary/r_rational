Depends on what platform you're on, how long the story-within-a-story is, and how much the frame intrudes into the story. Line breaks, block quotes, and separate chapters are all viable, IMO, but it really depends on what you're going for. For a full book, the first and last chapters being part of the frame, along with some shorter chapters in the frame as interludes seems like a style that works well for keeping immersion.

(I would almost never do a story-within-a-story in quotes, because it calls too much attention to the fact that the story is nested. In my perfect world, coming out of the nested story is like coming back up to the surface and facing a moment of being disoriented.)
