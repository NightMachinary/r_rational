As GM, if the portals are supposed to respect spacetime, I would rule that in the portal you would feel half of each planet's pull, and in general at each point you would feel that part of each planet's pull which the portal does/doesn't take [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_angle][as a fraction of your three-dimensional field of all-around vision]].

So a planet-sized portal that makes two planets appear to be adjacent in space would make them crash. And a portal connecting ground-level doors on Earth would have no gravitational effect at all.
