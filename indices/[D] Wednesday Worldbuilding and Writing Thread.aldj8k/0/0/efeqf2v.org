Without a working theory of quantum gravity, it's up to you!

In my pretty much layman opinion, two situations might be reasonable (disagreement's/calling me out on bullshit welcome! I don't know any QFT):

- The Graviton exists and behaves similarly to known particles; Gravity is propagated by some elementary particle so the relative sizes and position of the planets to the portal affect the 'gravity flux' traveling through it and where on each side those particles hit.

- Gravity is the bending of the local spacetime in the literal sense. If the portal doesn't work on a similar principle (pure magic) then no gravitational effect is passed through the portal.
