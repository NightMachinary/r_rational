[[Using the term information to mean any subset of everything. Light, waves, particles, gravity, sound, matter, energy, and everything else also counts as information.]]

I mean the explanation behind the portal. Does it work by moving information from point A to B? In that case you have things like the absolute maximum speed any information may travel (aka the speed of light) and what happens when information is transmitted in both directions at the same time, whether something on the path in between the portals can mess with the system, and so on to explain (or work out). Gravity would pull gravity-affected information into the portal from both sides instead of acting on such information where it normally would behind the portal. This could affect the movements of planets and other celestial bodies over long periods of time.

Or does it physically connect the space so that there's no distance to travel? Well then you have sideways gravity and all kinds of other weird and nasty bs happening around both portals and any other areas/volumes of spacetime that is being warped to allow this connection. The portals might generate their own gravity that also may or may not pull things in to the portal, or push them away, or even make everything veer to the right of whatever direction it's moving in. In fact I suspect everything in between or within a few thousand miles of the portals would just collapse into a black hole, explosion, or some other more mundane state.

 

Either way if the portal is invisible from one side then light already can't travel through it. The law of conservation of energy tells us that the light can't be duplicated. if the portal is not entirely invisible then the light hitting the back of each portal also needs to go somewhere- it can't just vanish. So whatever people see when they look at the active side of the portal is some 1-1 mapping of whatever light is hitting the inactive side of both portals. So there's already some handwaving you have to do to explain why light is affected differently than other information.
