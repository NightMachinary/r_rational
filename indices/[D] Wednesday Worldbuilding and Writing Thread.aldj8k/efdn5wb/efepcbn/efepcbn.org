If it's long (think The Time Machine: the whole story is essentially the story-within-a-story) then separate chapters works well as alexanderwales said. If it's short (a page or two), then just leave it in quotation marks like normal dialogue. If it's somewhere in between, either give it a whole chapter, or a whole "section" (you know... with the three asterixes to divide them).
