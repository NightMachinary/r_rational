At a guess if your portal allows gravity waves to propagate through it, the portal would act as a point mass at the portal's location (destination, or at each destination if 2-way travel is allowed). Afaik no theory allows for them to bend or distort so your portal's properties would matter.

If the portal only allows entry from one direction (it faces west, trying to enter from the East won't work even for something that can phase through matter) then only the matter on the proper side of the portal exerts a gravitational pull through the portal.

If it's a touch this nexus type of portal then it might translate all relevant forces or none of them, depending on what counts as a touch and how it knows what counts as the entity touching it.

There's no rule that a fictional portal must interact with every kind of phenomenon. Maybe portals transfer mass, momentum, and the strong and weak forces but not em fields nor other space-time effects.
