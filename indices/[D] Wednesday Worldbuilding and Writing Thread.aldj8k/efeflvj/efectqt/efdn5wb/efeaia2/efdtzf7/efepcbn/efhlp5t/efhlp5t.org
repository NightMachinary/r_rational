All you really need is some method of making the stories distinct. The princess bride did this really well by using the setting. In the kid's bedroom is one, everything else is another.

In a written work quotes are the ultimate crutch for accomplishing that. Just about anything is at least a little bit better. Even just changing the font. Ideally you'd have some words that make it clear whether we're in the frame or story though.
