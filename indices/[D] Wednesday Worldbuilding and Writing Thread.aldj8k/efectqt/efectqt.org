Does anybody know much about geology and tectonic plates?

I'm working on a story in which a certain magic can be applied to any "rock". I haven't quite specified which materials count as rock, nor have I specified exactly what the difference is between "one rock" and "two rocks very close together" (although I have some characters who would be very interested in these questions).

So, tectonic plates. My understanding is that a tectonic plate is basically "a really big rock", and therefore, this magic should be applicable to any tectonic plate in the Earth's crust. But... I'm not actually entirely sure what a tectonic plate is? Like, is it actually one rock, or is it a bunch of rocks packed together? Wikipedia mostly just says that a plate is made of "oceanic crust" or "continental crust", and continental crust is "the layer of igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks that forms the continents". But if it's a bunch of rocks, how does the plate move as a single entity, and what separates it from the other plates it's adjacent to? Do these questions even make sense? Is the pressure underground so high compared to things I encounter in my everyday life that I can't even comprehend what's going on?
