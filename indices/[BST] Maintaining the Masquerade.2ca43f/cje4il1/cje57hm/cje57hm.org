The big thing that vampires need a cover for are always staying out of sunlight, getting blood from somewhere, being impossibly old, and the fangs.

- Explained as photophobia or a rare skin condition, on those occasions when it actually comes up. Bursting into flame on contact with sunlight happens rarely enough that we can just call it spontaneous combustion.
- Blood banks are an old standby. Maybe there are more missing persons than in baseline reality, kept in dungeons and used for once-monthly blood donations.
- Easy enough to switch identities prior to the computer era if you've got enough money and few connections with the world.
- Find a trusted dentist and file them away. Or find an untrustworthy dentist and eat him afterwards.

The big thing that wizards need a cover for is wealth generation (they can pull matter from thin air), since they very rarely have cause to use their combat abilities.

- Cook the books. Inventory shows that you always had that pallet of gold bars just sitting there in storage.
- Own a couple of mines, make tours every few months to seed new metals.

The vampires are much more problematic, simply because they have so much more restrictions on them. I'll have to think on it some more.
