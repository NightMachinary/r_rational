Monitoring and controlling your own personnel would help considerably. Supernaturals usually have some sort of convenient mind magic. They could easily turn it on themselves to keep their population under a collective geas to maintain the masquerade and root out anyone who could be a security risk. This is similar to the approach taken in Charles Stross's /The Laundry/ series.

This could allow you to have a relatively large secret society without the tremendous overhead that comes with real covert organizations. It might also give the supernaturals a way to stay secret without being so powerful that secrecy starts to seem irrelevant. 10,000 wizards might have the resources to keep 10,000 wizards in line without being able to do the same for 7 billion muggles.

I'd also give a little thought to history of the Masquerade. Why was it necessary to hide? What, if anything, stopped your supernaturals from simply presenting themselves as gods at the dawn of history and ruling openly from that point on? How would non-wizard/vampire/shapeshifting 4th dimensional reptile religions ever get a foothold? And if they did do this once, why were they later demonized to the point where the only option for survival was living in the shadows? The answers to these questions could help determine how powerful your supernaturals are and what means they could use to stay secret.
