I bet you there are hundreds of eccentric rich people who have never been seen by the public in the day time. "My employer values his privacy and as such his only public appearances are at these evening charity galas." Hell there's lots of people in any large city who work night shifts or have strange sleep schedules and nobody cares. If no one is looking for vampires they have no reason to care.

The practicalities can be dealt with by having massive piles of money and/or mind control powers. Billionaire with weird fetish is far more plausible than vampire. Or make up a disease that requires frequent transfusions and get it covered by insurance.

Wizard is easy, just do standard money laundering jobs. Especially good would be antiques dealer.

The main point is that being in plain sight with a plausible excuse is much easier than hiding entirety.
