Another way of looking at this is to look for real world masquerade type cases. Secret research projects would count, but are probably to low scale for your needs. Organised crime may be a better one, people have a vague idea of whats going on but there's never enough evidence to prove anything conclusively, and they use various front organisations for plausible deniability. So what real world thing what be a plausible cover for your magic?

E.g. schizophrenia doesnt really exist, but there are muggles who have attracted the attention of demons. Or SARS was actually a series of possession incidents.
