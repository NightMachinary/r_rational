  Think about it: if we went back in time and showed The Lord of the Rings to people back when movies were still beginning as a medium, they would be fairly convinced magic was real: either that the whole thing was magic, like a window into another world, or that the events it depicts were real magic, because they couldn't fake visual effects like that.

I mean most of LotR was just make up and stuff so they probably could reasonably imagine that from plays and the such. As well as having stuff like black and white puppet Godzilla's, maybe you're giving them too much discredit.
