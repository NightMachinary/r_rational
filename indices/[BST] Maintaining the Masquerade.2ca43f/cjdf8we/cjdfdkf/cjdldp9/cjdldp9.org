I think he means that this disinterest would occur through /magical/ means. So no matter how awesome it is, muggles just kinda... forget it. Their attention wanders, they simply can't grasp it.

Personally I'm not a huge fan of that as it seems too effortless, and not really a part of the story, like the Percy Jackson method of maintaining the Masquerade. This would fall under the "overpowered" methods you mention in the OP.

For a realistic masquerade to be just barely maintained, I think the invention of satellites and handheld cameraphones is really the major hurdle. Once that tipping point is reached, it becomes infinitely harder to keep evidence of magic concealed without constant vigilance and an army of wizards going around doing memory charms and wiping videos. Once the internet shows up? Hoo-boy.

Depending on when they occur, a few slipups here and there won't be a big deal: skepticism of the supernatural grows stronger with every decade. But the sweet spot is that age right after videotaping becomes a thing, but before CGI and editing is powerful enough to artificially create things.

Think about it: if we went back in time and showed The Lord of the Rings to people back when movies were still beginning as a medium, they would be fairly convinced magic was real: either that the whole thing was magic, like a window into another world, or that the events it depicts were real magic, because they couldn't fake visual effects like that.

Nowadays if someone uploads a video from their iphone of someone shooting a fireball, the top comment would be "Awesome effects, what program did you use?"

So yeah, if you want to maintain the masquerade just enough in a rational way, that's the kind of stuff you'll have to deal with. An organization like the MIB, constantly dealing with rogue wizards or magical creatures that don't know or care to avoid leaving evidence.

It's an interesting question, and one I've considered myself for the novel I'm writing, though not as a central focus at all. I look forward to seeing what you do with it!

(PS: I'm going to get around to reading Metropolitan Man soon, promise :) It's coming up next on my reading list, I've just been swamped with work lately)
