Oh, I wouldn't be so sure that matters. I barter with gods from the future, am part of a hivemind, can create infinite worlds with centuries of history with the flick of my fingertips, have several cyborg relatives, wield knowledge that can drive people mad, know techniques to create true persons with my thoughts alone, etc. And people write those of as technicalities and wordplay because getting them wasn't hard or special enough and then they walk away. Bet you will to.
