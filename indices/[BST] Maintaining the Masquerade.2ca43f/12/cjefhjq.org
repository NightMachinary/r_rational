Well, if your vampires don't have mind control, I'm not sure they even qualify as vampires. (Set the wizards aside for now, since they're sufficiently varied I'm not sure what you actually /mean/ by wizard.)

So it's a question of how /little/ mind control we can get away with, because we don't want to inadvertently turn this into a Philip K Dick novel.

Full-on memory erasure is definitely overkill. Muggle-only memory erasure would be a nice handwave, but it only works if we don't have any muggle PCs.

Muggle servants, friends, lovers etc. are probably good, because they're probably addicted to blood or hypnotized or something anyway. So we have three main threats: bystanders, accidents, and lunatics.

Bystanders can probably be neutralized as a serious threat with a little social engineering, assuming our superpowers aren't /too/ flashy. Really, what cop is going to conclude /vampires must be real/ because a witness came in talking crazy? Hell, most vampire-y actions are probably sufficiently mundane to be written off as merely weird by witnesses.

Accidents are harder. You mentioned that vamps explode spectacularly in sunlight, which ... well, if you say so. That makes it actually pretty hard to screw up - I mean, you can never be seen in daylight and that's a pretty obvious pattern, but ultimately vampires who do anything vaguely public are liable to suffer natural selection.

Victims who escape can, obviously, be killed. If there are other issues - mirrors, counting, photography, whatever - then this only confirms that vampires are basically enforced recluses who leave only to seduce a victim and take them home. Which, honestly, sucks. Maybe tone down the weaknesses, a la /Dracula/ or /Lost Boys/?

Finally, what do you do if a vampire /tries/ to tell the world? You mock them, of course. Pop-culture is already seeded, much like regular conspiracy theories genuinely helped suppress the NSA thing.

Ultimately, there's very little you can do that would prove to the world that vampires exist - over time, sure, but by then the offending individual sadly committed suicide. They were obviously mentally disturbed.
