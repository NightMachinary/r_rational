What's the scale of problem we're talking about? For instance, a Masquerade that can stay intact despite intelligent people who are in on the secret actively attempting to betray that secret to the world needs to be much stronger than one in which everyone in the conspiracy is on the same page. Is it just a mundane conspiracy, are there visible large-scale effects (people with superpowers duking it out in populated areas), are we trying to hide whole species of uncooperative megafauna (dragon preserves), what?
