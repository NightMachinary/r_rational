  Well, before that, is there a particular danger of whistleblowing in the first place? Why would a wizard or vampire want to expose themselves to Muggles, just sheer altruism?

Outside of sheer altruism (for vampires it would probably be the horror of feeding on people, for wizards probably the fact that they can make a lot of resources from thin air) ... I guess there are the old standbys of love and family, but they could (and would) screen out "applicants" for either of those traits, or simply not have a conflict of interests there. There's also loyalty to a race/nation/religion, which might be a little harder to screen for.

This mostly takes place in the background though, so maybe it's not even worth worrying about - the vampires broke their masquerade a few years prior to the story start because they saw that they wouldn't be able to maintain it in the face of technological progress, so one of the masquerades isn't even in play for the story proper.
