I don't think you need a very strong masquerade to make it believable.

73% of people in the modern era in the USA already believe in something supernatural.

So just say that while the vast majority of people have had a direct interaction with some sort of magic the conspiracy prevents this knowledge from leaking out into mass media or textbooks and encourages it to be mocked by the scientific elite.

It isn't strongly suppressed, numerous corporations, the military, and parts of the government regularly use magic and research it (according to publicly available records), there are hosts of tv shows and magazines about magic, there are many organizations that actively work to promote belief in magic, there are many youtube videos of magic, but thanks to the lack of mass media and rigorous science no one's really sure exactly what the magic does.
