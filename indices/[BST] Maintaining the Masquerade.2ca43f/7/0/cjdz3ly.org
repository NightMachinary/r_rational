  Another point are basic human desires. If there are extremely powerful wizards and/or vampires out there, why don't they rule humanity as a higher caste? That's what I expect would happen over time. To counter that, you'd need the first/most powerful wizard vampires to want to uphold the Masquerade for their own reasons and keep all the others under control.

So ... maybe they do rule the world? Each group has an enormous amount of money and essentially lives in their own little post-scarcity world. If a wizard wants to eat at the best restaurants and spend his time visiting exotic locales, that's his right. Vampires can pretty much do whatever they want so long as they're discreet about who they kill. While both sides are powerful, they're both fairly small, and there would be a fairly large element of risk in revealing themselves, because they're not invulnerable by any means, and they need to sleep.

I don't know, I'll work on it. Thanks for the input.
