I think it's impossible to make the Masquerade believable /without/ using some heavy-duty-magic.

If there are a large number of people (thousands or more) involved, who also influence the rest of the world to some degree, it's next to impossible to keep it a secret. Harry Potter is one of the few instances where I actually bought it. They use magic to make people just overlook their buildings, or suddenly remember an important appointment when they wander too close to a magical area. Coupled with Obliviation, to make people forget stuff they saw, makes it very plausible. Even if they don't get some people with it, the other witnesses won't remember so they just seem crazy. Additionally, it seems like they can use magic on /concepts/, which could mean you even overlook stuff in pictures or videos.

If you only have hiding, blackmail and murder at your disposal, it's hard to see how the Masquerade could ever get off the ground without using hyper-competent people and the rest of humanity being mostly idiots.

(Almost) Everyone /used/ to believe in magic, miracles and monsters. The majority only became skeptical (and you can debate how skeptical most people actually are) after people checked again and again and again and never found anything supernatural.

Another point are basic human desires. If there are extremely powerful wizards and/or vampires out there, why don't they rule humanity as a higher caste? That's what I expect would happen over time. To counter that, you'd need the first/most powerful wizard vampires to want to uphold the Masquerade for their own reasons and keep all the others under control.
