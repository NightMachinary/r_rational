One of the stories I'm thinking about trying to finish has two different ones:

- Order of wizards, 2K-10K strong, hide in the shadows and accumulate their vast wealth in secret - new members are inducted carefully, and there's never much need to use magic out in the open.
- Coven of vampires, 2K-10K strong, spontaneously combust in direct sunlight, need /x/ pints of blood per week to survive, controls a vast wealth thanks to the the advanced age of their oldest members, inducts new members carefully. Vampires have fangs (which they mostly file down) but otherwise appear more or less like pale humans.

The story takes place in the 1970s, prior to the invention of mass home video recording. I'm sort of wavering on all of the above points, since I'd like these masquerades to be as large as possible while still being believable. Neither side has access to memory modification, just lots of money, connections, and killing intent. This is more or less my take on the masquerade - small enough societies with strong enough incentives that it's conceivable that the secret wouldn't spill out. But even two thousand members with no dissent that's not instantly squelched seems a little iffy.
