It seems like the main difficulty is the coordination problem of preventing betrayal. The actual Masquerade is just "don't do anything supernatural in public", otherwise they're pretty much the Freemasons. (Well, I guess the vampires might have an incentive not to have legal existences to avoid something like jury duty that might get them attention for not being willing to go out in the sun.)

One option would be some explicitly supernatural means of solving coordination problems. Magically-enforced contracts, truth serums, vampire hypnotic gaze; but all that is very much inventing the nuke to swat a fly.

Well, before that, is there a particular danger of whistleblowing in the first place? Why would a wizard or vampire /want/ to expose themselves to Muggles, just sheer altruism?
