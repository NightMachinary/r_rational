Poor communication systems are a must. There was an XKCD that I can't find now, which said something along the lines of humans proving bigfoot doesn't exist by way of everyone being equipped with a camera in their cellphone.

If strange incidents are happening across the land, only people who regularly travel a lot and observe their environment in great detail would notice anything. Many villages could have their own "ghost stories" but only someone who travelled to a bunch of villages and learned a /lot/ of "ghost stories" would notice a pattern (in most fiction, this is the type of person who is "in on it", so to speak [go figure]).

With this in mind, you could probably keep up a Masquerade without /too/ much effort, especially if magic is available. But once the Cold War happened and people started becoming super-suspicious of each other and, most importantly, /lots of people in powerful government positions/ become suspicious, it becomes much harder to hide significant activity.

It's perfectly possible to have worlds almost completely cut-off from our own (the Alternate Dimension stereotype) but these can't really have too much interaction thereof, and what trades do occur must happen through trustworthy agents.

/Pact/ runs its Masquerade by allowing magical events a path-of-least-resistance interpretation to non-Practitioners (the doll/Midge fight becoming an obese woman throwing things at bystanders for one). I don't really want to go into magical systems here because there's simply too many ways to do it.
