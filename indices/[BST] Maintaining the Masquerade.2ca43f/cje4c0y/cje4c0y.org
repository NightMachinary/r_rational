The best version of the Masquerade I've read is in The Laundry series by Charles Stross, where the masquerade is maintained by a large government department who recruits absolutely everyone who sees anything interesting and uses a strong magical geas to stop them talking. [Very good series in other ways too, the 'magic' is based on advanced mathematics]
