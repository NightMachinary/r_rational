Disinformation and confusion. The Masquerade-maintainers would have the job (amongst others) of continually making up, cross-pollinating, encouraging, and disseminating supernatural stories with /elements/ similar to or even matching whatever was being hidden. Ideally, every investigation of a strange event would come across at least one or more aspects which could be dismissed as "Oh, that was based on a story from twenty years ago."

They would also fund and assist media which promoted incorrect and scrambled versions of the truth - everything from conspiracy publications to straightforward fiction of the time (books, movies, TV series, video games), plus metafiction (eg books about discovering that old myths are, le gasp, TRUE! (and possibly sparkly or aliens in disguise)).

They'd convince people who weren't entirely sane to dress up weirdly and emulate (in a trashy, low-budget way) the things the masquerade was hiding, so there would be police reports about pulling drunks and weirdos dressed as - and insisting they were - vampires/wizards/aliens/whatever. Useful in case one of the hidden supernaturals gets drunk and stumbles down High Street yelling in the secret language, gets pulled up by the cops, and insists they're a... whatever they actually are.

They'd heavily fund magic societies and sleight of hand tricks, get mundane kids interested in it either as a career or hobby, and generally make it widely known that normal everyday people can make it /look/ like they're doing impossible things, even if the mechanisms aren't immediately apparent. They'd see to it that articles like David Copperfield fooling a couple of muggers got widespread promotion.

They'd fund and promote the arts of special effects of all kinds. Not simply those which just happen to look like the ones being covered up, but the industry as a whole, so as many people as possible would use the effects, have seen the effects, or know that places like ILM exist.

If ghosts existed, they'd fund a movie about hilarious ghost chasers. If vampires existed, they'd encourage movies and books about vampires to become famous. If magic existed, they'd arrange for books and movies containing certain mostly-accurate details to become a billion-dollar enterprise. They'd pour immense resources into things like easily-obtainable desktop video effects packages, and upload detailed tutorials on how to create cool effects which oh-so-coincidentally resemble masquerade-breaking sightings.

They'd have fingers in major movie studios so that if there was any masquerade break which couldn't be attributed simply to loonies having watched too many fantasy movies, they could have a "production crew" on the scene ASAP with appropriate props and FX gear saying "Oh yes officers, that was our creature workshop's werewolf; we have a robot version which runs at 40mph for long shots which is what you saw, and a van over there full of extremely similar masks and props which you are more than welcome to familiarize yourself with. Please do take pictures and put them in your report."
