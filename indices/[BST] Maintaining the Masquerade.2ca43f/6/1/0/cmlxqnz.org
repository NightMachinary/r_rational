It is just human wizards that affect technology unwillingly (a little just by being nearby, a lot more by actively using magic), though anyone capable of magic has an easy time damaging electronic components.

As for the "blind spot" as you call it, it's not that technology doesn't work near magic, but rather that the more advanced some equipment is, the easier it breaks down around magic (So if you try to film a wizard using his powers, the film will likely be very grainy or the camera might short circuit or something).

Lastly, the "everyone knows there is no such thing" is explained more along the lines of "the magical beings became more discreet, science came along, people forgot". Aside from that, we're shown a vampire who goes around disproving magic and the supernatural under his cover identity as a professor, so it wouldn't be a stretch to assume there are others who do the same.
