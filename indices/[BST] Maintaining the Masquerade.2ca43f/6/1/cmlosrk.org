Technology failing near magic only makes it easier to notice the magic. If it didn't, a wizard would have to actually cast a spell before you get video footage. With it, every supernatural being would be a walking blind spot on England's massive network of cameras. Mages would have no way of disguising themselves as muggles.

As for everyone knowing there is no such thing as magic, you have to explain how they all know that. Someone must have been keeping the masquerade up before.
