Clever! Experiments that would seem reasonable to Muggles fail for reasons that you couldn't foresee /unless you already knew about magic/.

And when the wizard tries to defend himself with "oh but the camera won't be able to record it" or "it doesn't work very well if you don't believe in it", he sounds like he's making a bad excuse.
