I like the Dresden Files approach to this. At a first, it seems like there isn't even any Masquerade (the main character actually advertises he is a wizard in the yellow pages, and has no compunction about using magic in public) and getting to know about the supernatural stuff is actually pretty easy. However we do see cases where a video showing magic is quickly discredited by the media before vanishing (and those are rare anyway, since magic interferes with technology). The police department in charge of investigating strange occurrences is expected by the higher ups to write creative reports not mentioning anything supernatural, lest the one responsible be demoted and given mandatory psychiatric help. There is no memory erasing or anything, whoever is doing this is just reliant on the fact that "everybody knows there is no such thing as magic" and using some good deal of influence to make sure there isn't any official confirmation. The non human beings generally view involving the mortal authorities on their conflicts as something of a nuclear option, so they try to stay out of sight, and humans in on it know most people would just call them crazy. It's mostly quite believable, though the author's tendency to go for awesome stuff tends to stretch suspension of disbelief a little. There has been no mention of a case where someone deliberately tried to break it (for all that he doesn't hide, the main character also doesn't bother trying to convince people either), but I wouldn't be surprised if those were quietly dealt with by whoever is running the Masquerade.
