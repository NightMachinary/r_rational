I remember the Illuminatus! Trilogy's Illuminati used a variant of the first approach - they appeared to initial members as whatever would allow the new members to be converted, and constantly lied about their history in a multitude of historical sources to obscure their origins and goals, and were motivated to constantly lie about their power and extent of influence because of people's natural tendency to want to join the winning side. The trilogy presented probably >25 contradictory histories of the Illuminati, including everything from the rather mundane Bavarian conspiracy to the out-there Atlantean connections.
