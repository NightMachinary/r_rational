Not seeing the mind projection fallacy. Confirmation bias maybe.

Certainly it makes the mind no longer a black box. Two people doing the same thing for different reasons might get different results. Rationality might not be an advantage, and irrationally clinging to your beliefs can be good for your survival.

I dunno. I still think you can write rationalist stories in there. Humans /aren't/ rational, they barely even come close, no matter how many Eliezer Yudkowsky blog posts they've read. It's important to remember that sometimes.
