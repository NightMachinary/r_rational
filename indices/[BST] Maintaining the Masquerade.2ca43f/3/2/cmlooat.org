I don't see why it being a secret would be necessary, or even helpful, for keeping muggles away. It would also mean that you can't sell things to muggles that could only be produced by magic, since you'd risk breaking the masquerade. It would be nigh impossible to have mage-only cities, since once it's big enough it will be noticed, and you're not allowed to explain to muggles why they're not allowed in.
