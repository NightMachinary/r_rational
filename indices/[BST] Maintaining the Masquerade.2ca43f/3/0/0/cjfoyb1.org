Dunno about breeding. It's just... if you believe, you'll probably die, so there aren't a lot of people currently alive who believe. Evolution doesn't need to enter into it.

Note: If you figure out magic's existence on your own with nobody to support you, you're dropped instantly into the deep end with no training, no firepower, and no second chances. The ones who survive are the ones who were already a little bit unhinged when they started, and who find their way to the organisations that can mentor them. In a word, they have to be like player characters in an RPG. It's cleverly done, but I don't know if this approach would work for every setting.
