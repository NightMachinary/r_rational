I like Mage: the Ascension's. Magic simply doesn't work around Muggles. Or at least, it doesn't work as well, and anything likely to break the Masquerade is also likely to kill the offending mage.

Beliefs affect reality, that's how mages do their work. Muggles don't believe magic exists, so - in the presence of a large enough number of Muggles - it doesn't. Magic has to be done in secret, or at least in the presence of few enough Muggles that the mage's will can overpower theirs.

As a side-effect, any Muggle who figures all this out instantly loses this protection and becomes a juicy target for supernatural creatures. Natural selection ensues.
