Honestly, the simplest way is if the Muggles just can't, or can't be bothered to, /understand/ what your main characters are up to. You try to explain it to them, and they just get bored or tired and go away to do something else without remembering the real concepts.

I'm reasonably sure this is how most real-life Masquerades are maintained.
