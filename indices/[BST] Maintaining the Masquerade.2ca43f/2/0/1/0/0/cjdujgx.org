Yea, it doesn't work for things with flashy implementations. The uniqueness thing however... Most of those things mos people COULD do easily, and I'm glad to instruct them if they ask with takes like 10 min, or is true about a fair fraction of random people, but in fact they /don't/ do it, or don't /notice/ they are those things, rendering it still unique in some senses.

In the fire example, it's some people going around with fireproof gloves covered in sodium.
