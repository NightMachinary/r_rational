I don't think it's the method of "getting them" that makes people dismiss such as "wordplay" so much as their uniqueness to you. Confounding people's expectations only works so long as their expectations are met.

Someone who claims to be able to perform an exothermic reaction on something by touching it might glaze over a listener's gaze, but if they touch something and set it on fire, no one's going to just shrug that off as "Yeah, I can touch things and make them warmer too." And it's that kind of blatant show of "uniqueness" that needs to be explained away to keep a Masquerade in place.
