You /haven't/? I thought most LWers well known enough for me to recognize had. It's not like it's hard if you got a grasp of the basics, although I'm having a surprisingly hard time thinking of a specific good example right now, probably because I haven't made any relevant choices recently.

... I'd rather not go ahead.

Ok so I kinda dropped the ball on being concrete with the memetic hazards. Here's another attempt: Religions, Nithilism (to someone who've assumed otherwise and not exposed to it), Rokos Basilisk, Simulation argument, intuition pumps about astronomical scales, extremely graphic descriptions of extreme sex/violence, even spoilers are technically basilisks. And yea none of these sound very scary, but that's a selection effect of being a savy, thick-skinned, internet-going rationalist. Anyone from 100+ years ago, or sufficiently sheltered, and some other edge cases, might have quite a different reaction that'd hard to predict in advance.

I haven't made a tulpa, but everything I know about neuroscience says it'd be surprising if it /didn't/ work. Most definitions of person that doesn't refer to separation of physical body or legal status seems forced to admit it can be quite easily split within a single brain. More relevant questions is how much you should /care/ about there being an extra "person" when the amount of most smaller units like thoughts, reward circuits, memories, etc. stay the same, and it was not very costly to create, and no information will be irreversibly lost if it dies.
