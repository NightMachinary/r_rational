That's not how acausal trade works. You acausally trade with other humans all the time, for example whenever you refrain from harming someone so that they will not later take revenge, even thou the situation is not iterated and an agent running causal decision theory would consider the resource wasted. In the human example, it's mediated by an evolutionary hack called anger rather than an understanding of the decision theory involved, but it's basically the same thing.

I'm not really qualified to explain this at the moment, maybe you could ask [[http://www.reddit.com/user/mhd-hbd]] ?
