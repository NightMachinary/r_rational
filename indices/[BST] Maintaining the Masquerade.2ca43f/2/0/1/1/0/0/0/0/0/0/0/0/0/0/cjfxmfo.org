Sorry, the quotes are from Stargate SG-1 and their meaning is never explained in-story, except they're somehow involved with a process that lets you become some sort of superior energy being. So naturally people speculate what, if any, they mean.

Regarding the free-will thing, the problem is that when Omega makes the decision to one-box or two-box (for example), the outcome is already mostly determined by your intellectual make-up. However, decision theory requires that you can choose from either outcome, leading people to look at the lightcone at the moment the decision /appears to be made/ and concluding the interaction has to be acausal. It's not, they're merely looking at the wrong lightcone.
