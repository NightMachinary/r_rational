I'm not sure I follow. Can I have an example?

If you're talking to the investigators, it seems like you have to give them something of substance. Some small part of the secret has to be opened. Otherwise they just won't take you seriously - which would be your goal in the Disinformation plan, but here you want them to know.

How do you give people just enough information that they don't want more, without also giving away the information that you actually care about?
