It's quite hard to hide from a sufficiently dedicated searcher.

It's easier to hide when they already believe there's nothing to search for in the first place.

It's easi/est/ to hide when, deep down, they don't /want/ to find you.

In more detail:

If you're competent enough, blatant invisibility and/or extremely tight security can probably work ... for a while. But any leaks can and eventually /will/ escalate and tear the whole thing apart.

Deliberate disinformation and/or making the truth extremely low-status is more effective, although there will always be outliers - who have an inherent tactical advantage, by virtue of being right.

Persuading anyone who comes close that - for whatever reason - they /really/ don't want to expose you is very, very effective. If you can do it.

Attack the motivation, and they won't /try/ to outsmart you.
