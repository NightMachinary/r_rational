In reality, you would need to be either /terrifyingly/ good at manipulation, or have access to drugs or blackmail. This is probably doable - and very effective - but it would be /hard/. You need to steer people terribly precisely.

It's not really an effective strategy ... probably, although containing a patently dangerous secret might actually make this doable. This is a good tactic if, y'know, you're the good guys and the facts are on your side. Show someone get eaten by a monster or zapped by an alien or killed by a weapon because containment failed. Might shake the investigator into joining the conspiracy.

In /fantasy/, it's a whole different story. /Any/ sort of subtle mind-effecting magic will do the trick - as long as it feels like them wanting to do it, and not an outside force puppeting them. The great thing about magical methods is they may well be subtle enough to /combine/ with disinformation, rather than tearing back the veil in order to preserve it.

Basically, motivated cognition is your friend.

A few examples, generated as I write them:

Scaring anyone who gets too close with sudden pressure from authority figures (who are, of course, pawns of the conspiracy.)

Distracting anyone who gets too close by throwing something more important in their path - kidnap a family member, hint at a really huge story, sudden drug addiction, etc.

Constantly use low-level brainwashing on the populace, creating a SEP field around stuff closely tied to your work. Make a minority low-status if you want to kidnap and experiment on them. Make people feel disinterested, patriotic, scared, whatever when they see certain words.

Mindraping anyone who gets too close, so they will work to help you. (This need not be magical in nature, technically.)

Use mind-effecting drugs/spells/powers on anyone you suspect might be a threat, to make them ... easily distracted.

Use that pheromone thing Poison Ivy had to make Batman love you, and thus resist concluding you're really the villain he's trying to catch.

Permanently traumatize anyone who gets too close, so that they will fear the truth and maybe act to warn others away.

There's a lot of overlap between "spreading fake conspiracy theories to bury the truth" and "spreading fake conspiracy theories so anyone smart will pattern-match to low-status fakes when they hear about something real".

I'm sure you can come up with other examples of trying to neutralize the /desire/ to defeat you rather than the /ability/ to defeat you. It's a force-multiplier thing - all the power in the world is useless if they don't use it.
