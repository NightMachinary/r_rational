Mostly you need a reason for the masquerade to exist that doesn't make all it's members either idiots or assholes. Even if they are the villains of the piece, you really need a motive for them to go to those lengths that isn't stupid. Options: 1: The masquerade members are blatantly, obviously, Hostis Humanitis, and there are obvious ways to arrange for them all to hang from the metaphorical yardarm if their existence became common knowledge. Vampirism and the mandatory shirtless noonday parade every Wednesday, for example.

2: The masquarade is hiding things which would not survive exposure to the public for reasons other than the public setting out to destroy them in moral outrage - Such as: "Magic is real, but finite. All mages share the same source of power. 100 wizards in the world? Power of the greek gods for each one. 1000? Longevity, teleportation, communion with the dead. 10000: Parlor tricks. 100000: "I can make coins come up heads 60% of the time with great effort!"
