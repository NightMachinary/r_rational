One possibility is that magic is real and incredibly dangerous. If someone can do transfiguration, that's fine. If someone knows what antimatter is, that's fine. If someone fits in both categories, we're all doomed. They make sure muggles don't know mages exist, and mages think muggles don't know anything interesting.

El Goonish Shive uses magic being dangerous and far too easy to use. I can't find a relevant comic, but I did find a quote. Context: two of the main characters managed to defeat a supervillain, and after the authorities arrived, they asked about why the masquerade was necessary.

Mr. Verres: You know that man in the ambulance right now? The man capable of, and having already done, absolutely horrible things? There is NOTHING special about him. He's just an average jerk who, when younger, stumbled on a way to gain use of magic that almost anyone on the planet could use. You want a real-life, non-hypothetical example of why there's so much secrecy? It's lying in the back of that ambulance.

Edit:

The Gamer has an interesting one: If you don't maintain the Masquerade, the universe will kill you. Although it's not clear what happens to the occasional person who thinks spreading the knowledge of magic is something worth dying for.
