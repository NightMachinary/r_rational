What a fascinating conversation, especially since your perspective was so similar to mine (in the sense of, "I know this isn't rational but it helps me to believe it") back when I was in undergrad and was shifting from deist to agnostic. I didn't believe I could talk to spirits from the afterlife, but the belief in an all-knowing-and-just God, or at least a cosmos-wide narrative pushed forth by minor god-level intelligences and powers, helped me through many rough patches. I read a lot of Stephen King books, and I loved the multiverse he and other writers imagined, thinking it obviously true and just as obvious that I could do great things if I continued to believe in it and hold myself to the standards of the heroes in such stories.

I can't really describe what it was like to leave that belief system behind, because part of me still feels like I haven't. But for the most part, I definitely did feel "spiritual" moments that I don't anymore, and I definitely did occasionally think about my life as a minor narrative in a wider "fate" of the universe, which I don't really anymore.

I can't tell you if I'm /happier/ believing that the universe is (probably) completely impersonal and random and "cold." But I have gained great value in grounding myself in reason as much as possible, and the humanism that has always been just under the surface of my thoughts and feelings was able to really only flourish once I completely rejected the supernatural, and believed fully that the light in the universe, if there is any, is in us, and it's up to use to bring justice and heaven to earth (or beyond).

In any case, I hope your beliefs and worldview continue to make you happy and rational, whatever it takes to get there :) As long as you strive to do good and strive to do it in an intelligent fashion, I mostly don't care what you believe or don't believe, and am happy to call you my brother/sister.
