This is particularly amusing to me because that's the exact reaction I have to almost every afterlife concept I encounter :) My earliest memory of pushing back against my religious upbringing was questioning my rabbi/teacher's description of heaven and how to get there back in middle school. I stayed a believer for years afterward, but that was my first major moment of "Wait, what? Surely it can't work that way..."
