As someone who is not a materialist, I can answer your question as "Eh, not really." There's still plenty of stories that include supernatural elements that don't make sense to me. It's only when they conform to belief systems I already follow that I automatically suspend disbelief, though discussing my beliefs here has made them more rational.

I might also have some unique disbelief reactions for when a story touches on ideas that my belief system covers. For instance, I have a certain conception of the afterlife that I think makes sense given reality as I understand it, so for some stories that feature the afterlife I'll think, "Wait, that's what it's like? Seriously? How does that work?".
