I was very tempted to go on an utter tangent about the souls idea. I've stopped typing that up because I am too tired for it at the moment and also it is an utter tangent.

Somewhat more on topic, I personally feel that there entirely a point to both writing, and in my experience reading magic system write ups. Obviously, no formal critical culture really exists for fictional technical descriptions (that I am aware of, though I get the inkling that there is a place for it in the context of, say, space ships), but I know that I can enjoy a very writer-ish enjoyment from describing a magic system, and that I've derived a very reader-ish enjoyment from perusing some of the write-ups I've found, even the ones mostly devoid of non-magic world-building tidbits or story fragments.

Then again, I've also experienced aesthetic enjoyment of color palettes, without an associated form or arrangment, so maybe my senses on this matter are just skewed?
