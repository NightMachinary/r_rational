  Somewhat more on topic, I personally feel that there entirely a point to both writing, and in my experience reading magic system write ups. Obviously, no formal critical culture really exists for fictional technical descriptions (that I am aware of, though I get the inkling that there is a place for it in the context of, say, space ships), but I know that I can enjoy a very writer-ish enjoyment from describing a magic system, and that I've derived a very reader-ish enjoyment from perusing some of the write-ups I've found, even the ones mostly devoid of non-magic world-building tidbits or story fragments.

I agree with you here. For me, it's mostly manifested in reading the (magic-related parts especially) rulesets of various tabletop RPGs.
