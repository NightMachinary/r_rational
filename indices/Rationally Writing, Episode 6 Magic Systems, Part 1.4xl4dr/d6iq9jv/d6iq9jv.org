Good discussion. You may want to add a link to the Runelords, since that was discussed but I don't see a link to it.

Another interesting example would be Mother of Learning. The magic system is very heavily D&D influenced, but with more granular progress than just gaining levels. Also, there are Naruto-style bloodline abilities and training exercises.

The reason I find this particular example so interesting is that the story is very focused on exploring the magic system, but the system has so much breadth that there's still a tremendous amount of room for surprises.

This could be good or bad; I think it would be very unsatisfying if one of the protagonists solved a major problem with a spell we didn't see them learn (or even hint at studying), but the magic system is expansive enough that we could easily see antagonists or side characters pull off impressive things that haven't even been hinted at previously.

I'll be very curious to see if Mother of Learning gets a satisfactory ending.
