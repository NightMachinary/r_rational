NOTES: This is not intended as an official submission, as it is merely a rewrite of portions of Alexander Wales' “Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Zombie.”

As a heavily derivative fork of a fanfiction of a fanfiction, I'm not sure it passes the plagiarism test, but I happened to revisit this short story recently and felt like sharing some thoughts.

Anyone who hasn't should read Alexander's work first: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10023949/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Philosopher-s-Zombie]]. It branches from Hermione's death, where she has become a ghost. My slight rewrite of the final conversation with Quirrell occurs just in the last few pages, but might act as a launching off point for further AU exploration, as Alexander's work was fascinating and much too short.

Cheers!
