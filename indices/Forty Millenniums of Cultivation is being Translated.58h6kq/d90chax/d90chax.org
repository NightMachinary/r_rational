Some of you may remember the recommendation of the novel, /Forty Millenniums of Cultivation/, posted [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4zncxn/forty_millenniums_of_cultivation_%E4%BF%AE%E7%9C%9F%E5%9B%9B%E4%B8%87%E5%B9%B4_rt/][here]] which did a great job of hyping up the novel but with no English translations available (/grumble, grumble/ people should go to jail for tormenting me like that!) it was a teaser like only seeing the trailer of an amazing movie coming out in 50 years from now.

However, I just happened to check on [[/r/noveltranslations]] today out of random curiosity and found announcement posts of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/noveltranslations/comments/5689mw/cn_forty_millenniums_of_cultivation_chapter_1/][Chapter 1,2]] and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/noveltranslations/comments/57dfvs/cn_forty_millenniums_of_cultivation_chapter_3/][Chapter 3]].

It appears to be updating at a slow rate of roughly a chapter every week, so it's slow compared to other wuxia novels online which update daily. Therefore, I would recommend bookmarking it and waiting until there are more chapters. But at the very least leave a comment on the website to encourage the noble and valiant translator, Strivon! S/he doesn't seem to be an alternate account of [[/u/Drazelic]] according to this [[https://friendshipispower.wordpress.com/about/][page]].
