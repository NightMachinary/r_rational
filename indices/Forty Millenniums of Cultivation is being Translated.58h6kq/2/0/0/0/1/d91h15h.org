Overal literalism, for the most part, and that's a systematic issue that's just not something that can be edited out, because it comes directly from the stylistic preferences and technical limitations of the translator themselves. There's also some grammatical issues and at least one case of total mistranslation, but those can be corrected without total rewrites.

Literalism is an easy issue to fall into with translation, because the original text is /right there/ and the natural urge is to trace the original text as closely as possible, but a lot of the things from the translation seem to be trying too hard to retain perfect fidelity down to the sentence structure. This doesn't work very well when translating between languages with different grammatical rules. A lot of sentence structures that sound totally fine in Chinese sound awfully janky and riddles with passive voice in English, and the translator either didn't take the liberty of editing their translation for flow, or they just didn't realize they'd slipped into passive voice.

Also, there are some literal translations of idioms that seem really out of place, but that might be subjective. I'm mostly thinking of 'jade tree in the wind' right now. There's such a concept as a weirdness tolerance, where one wants to translate terms with approximately the same level of exoticness in both the original and translated texts, because people pay attention to things that stand out and this can be used to tell readers 'hey this concept is important'. When one translates foreign idioms literally without any forewarning it stands out in stark contrast to the rest of the translation, like a painting where somebody's face is purple for no reason at all; the divergence from the norm demands attention even if the object being depicted is totally reasonable.

I know that all these issues sound dumb and nitpicky individually, but translation is really about the small things. It's like paving a road- people expect a smooth experience from their ride and notice any bump that shows up, even if it's not all that significant in the long run, because roads are supposed to be smooth, right? I feel like reading experiences are much the same. You expect the translation to run smoothly, and inelegant translation creates frictional costs that reduces the potential readerbase's size down to people who can tolerate the bumpy road.

I guess I'm a bit harsh on it because I really love the source material and want to see it presented in nothing but the bestest light possible!

(And, no, I haven't contacted Strivon yet. No real reason, just, I got distracted for a few hours and forgot to do it.)
