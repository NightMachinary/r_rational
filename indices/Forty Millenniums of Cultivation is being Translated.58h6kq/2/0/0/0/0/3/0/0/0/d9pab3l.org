I don't really watch much of anything, english or chinese. I don't even have a TV!

I am not, like, a /huge/ xianxia fan. I'm just a casual reader; I certainly have't consumed everything in the genre, and since I don't watch TV I'm not really all that surprised that I'd miss out on these tv dramas.
