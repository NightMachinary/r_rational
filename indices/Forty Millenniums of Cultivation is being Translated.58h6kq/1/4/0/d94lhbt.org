Mmm... I don't think I can do that, regretfully.

I mean, it'd be /cool/ to support myself with translation, but at the same time it'd basically mean that I'd have to devote myself to somebody else's work for a very, very long time. Call me ambitious, but I kind of want to do my own thing someday, y'know?

I'm currently in art school right now, and it means a lot to me; I don't think I'm ready to abandon my own dreams of becoming a successful content-creator in order to cement myself into a subordinate role to someone else's magnum opus, if that makes sense. My constraining resource isn't money, it's /time/- the time I spend on translating is time I'm not spending drawing or writing or learning to program or whatever, and I've got a lot on my plate already. That's partially why I wanted to try to crowdsource it, because I really just can't do it myself, no matter what.
