  I tried doing some translation tonight. Over the course of six hours or so, I translated three chapters to my own satisfaction and got most of the way through a fourth. Let's just round that up to four chapters in a single day for the purposes of our calculations.

  I cannot be this productive and translate this much every day, obviously. I have other things in my life, after all, so let's make the (slightly optimistic) assumption that I can do four chapters per week on a regular basis indefinitely.

I just realized something. You are a die-hard fan of this series, so you have sufficient motivation to translate it. Your translation of the 3.75 chapters was excellent, so you are defiantly capable of the task. All you lack is the time and the funding to support yourself while translating it. Why not join wuxiaworld.com as a new translator? You'll be able to reach a sufficiently large audience who are very likely to pay you (through Patreon) enough money for you to support yourself. I know that Deathblade makes enough money translating /I Shall Seal the Heavens/ to support himself, wife, and baby son.

I don't know anything about your life situation, but is this something that could be a viable and desirable option for you?
