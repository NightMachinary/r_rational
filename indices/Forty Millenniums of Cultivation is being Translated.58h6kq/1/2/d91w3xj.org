I'm psyched to read this story even though I've never read a Chinese novel, but the sheer length of it has me worried about pacing. How can a story go on without padding itself out? This has got to be a record for longest continuous narrative written by a single author, but can he really maintain a consistent level of quality throughout? I don't want Sturgeon's Law to apply to a single work.

I probably shouldn't be worried considering that I've enjoyed webcomics like Sluggy Freelance, Freefall, and El Goonish Shive with extremely long and slow story arcs, but those had the advantage of all being comedies first and foremost. The story is good, even great at times, but because every page has a punchline it remains consistently entertaining even when it plods.
