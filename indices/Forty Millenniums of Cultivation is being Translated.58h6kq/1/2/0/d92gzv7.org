Well, I mean, it's subjective, your mileage may vary, this is just my opinion, etc. etc.

After 1500+ chapters, I haven't even /remotely/ begun to get sick of the story. Quite the opposite- I'm more excited /now/ than ever! It's just gotten better and better and more and more engaging, and the author's never let me down yet. The sheer volume is mostly generated by the crazy amount of worldbuilding and character-building introspection. It's long, but it's long because it's detailed and rich. There are no 'filler' arcs, as far as I can tell; every arc deals with a meaningful social, political, or economic commentary, throwing revelation after revelation at you in chains of intelligent analysis that just keeps building on each other.

/(In case you cant tell, I think this story is basically perfect in every single way- so take my reviews with a grain of salt! Not going to try and sugarcoat it- I am a diehard fan of this serial in every single way. I haven't enjoyed a story this much in a very, very long time./
