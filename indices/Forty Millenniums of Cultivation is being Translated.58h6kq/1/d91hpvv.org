One thing that I feel like I really actually have to mention, right now:

One of my friends suggested that I start a wiki to sort of crowdsource the translation; this is probably going to be necessary to get this translation finished on any sort of timely basis. Let me explain why.

Cultivation40k currently has 1500 chapters, and the author has said they plan on another year or so of writing before the story's wrapped up. They update with anywhere from two to four updates, every day. Best case scenario, this means another thousand or so chapters, making the book's total length somewhere around 2500 chapters- and I fully expect it to stretch on to 3000 chapters, because you never know when the author's creative genius is going to act up and he's going to toss in ANOTHER planetary-scale plot-arc just because he can.

Now, to do the math:

The current translator's schedule is, I've been told, to update with one chapter per week. /One chapter per week./ Do the math, and it turns out that, working alone, Strivon will be finished with Cultivation40k in, oh... /fifty years or so!/

(1 update per week = 50-ish updates per year. 2500 chapters divided by 50 chapters per year equals 50 years.)

/Fifty./

/Years./

(And that's the optimistic guess for if the author writes the /least amount possible/. I have too much faith in the author to believe that something like this would actually happen.)

It would be easier for most non-Chinese speakers to /just learn Chinese/ over the next fifty years rather than wait for this translation to be finished.

I tried doing some translation tonight. Over the course of six hours or so, I translated three chapters to my own satisfaction and got most of the way through a fourth. Let's just round that up to four chapters in a single day for the purposes of our calculations.

I cannot be this productive and translate this much every day, obviously. I have other things in my life, after all, so let's make the (slightly optimistic) assumption that I can do four chapters per /week/ on a regular basis indefinitely.

Even if you add my translation rate in, assuming I can match the productivity I had tonight, and round it up to 4 chapters, five chapters a week would still mean /twelve years/ before the translation is fully finished.

/This is not a task doable by any single human being./ If Cultivation40k is to be fully translated into english on any sort of sane timeframe, it's gonna have to be a really, really, really big team effort. Six or seven people working simultaneously at the very least (and honestly more than that would probably be a good idea) with a shared vocabulary base defined on a wiki page beforehand so people don't make up different translations for the same term without each other's knowledge.

So- yeah, um. I'm not really sure what to do about this either. This is kind of above my pay grade. (Which, since none of us are getting paid here, is really essentially /nothing/, after all.) I just figured I'd let you guys know about the numbers and statistics, here.

Plus, don't forget- the story's 1500+ chapters long right now, right? The /really good stuff/, the [[/r/rational][r/rational]]-relevant stuff about piercing the heavens, doing the impossible, and the themes about trust and betrayal and geopolitics and clever slytherin plotting and the question of whether human society can escape from the molochian deathtrap and the struggle for muggle rights in a world run by immortal wizards and the relative merits of darwinism and egalitarianism- all that only gradually starts to appear around chapter 100 or so.

I dunno about you guys, but chapter 100 feels very, /very/ far away to me right now.

:(

--------------

Other fun facts: My translation of 3.75 chapters had about 8,000 words in it. Using that as a benchmark, assuming chapter lengths remain constant, we can extrapolate the whole length of Cultivation40k at this time of posting as around 3,300,000 words, and its projected length upon completion to be anywhere from 6,000,000 words to 7,000,000 words.

That's a lot of words.

The original Harry Potter series altogether was somewhere around 1,000,000 words, if I remember correctly. HPMOR was somewhere in the vicinity of 600,000 to 700,000. Worm was 1,680,000 words, according to a cursory google search I just did.

This story is /already/ five times as long as HPMOR.

/This story will be ten times as long as HPMOR./

/This story will be four to five times as long as Worm./

Think about that for a moment.

I really wanted to take the task of translating this whole thing onto my own shoulders- I really did. Then I did the math, and... I don't think I can do it alone, and Strivon- well, brave, poor soul that they are, I don't think anybody can buckle down and keep translating something for fifty years. At that sort of timescale we're talking a crapshoot whether they're even going to /live long enough to finish./
