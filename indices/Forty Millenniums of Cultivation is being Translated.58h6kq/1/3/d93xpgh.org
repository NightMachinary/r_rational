Oh its totally fine if you want to take over. I took a read at your translation and I really like some of your choices for the terminology, such as "sigils" and "glyphs". As I'm not a native speaker of Chinese and most writing I do involve white papers and tech documents, I feel that you are a much better person for the job for conveying the story's atmosphere and mysticism properly.

I pretty much started translating this because the story seemed awesome and I wanted some motivation to improve my Chinese. My thought was, "hey no one else is doing this, might as well give it a shot."

As for a wiki, I feel that there would be conflicts between different writing styles and things would be pretty chaotic unless managed properly. Everyone's writing style is unique, though the difference may be minuscule between some people. So ideally you would find people with similar writing styles or someone could be the master editor who edits everything to fit one style. But yea, there's pros and cons for each.

If you do take over, do you have any recommendations for other Chinese novels that I could translate? Preferably sci-fi.

(I hope I don't die in fifty years, I think I'm still young T.T)
