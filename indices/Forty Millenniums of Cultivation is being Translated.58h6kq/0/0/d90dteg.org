ahahahaahhaaaaa oh my god I was /just/ about to start the translation of it myself /today/ actually!

I'm betting that this was elicited by the fact that someone in the FMoC reviews section said something along the lines of 'man all the other big novels have english fandoms, when are WE going to get an english translation?'

I mean, /that/ was my impetus for deciding to finally start the translation today. But Cakefleet is doing a damn good job of it so far!
