  I'm not quite sure where the story has to go after this "layer" though.

A turf war with the owner of the second Nurmaha's Ring, likely. Clementine and her commanders will get shocked at how powerful Hansoo is and at the existence of a second ring, Hansoo will start destroying armies of thousands just by himself, etc. By the end of the arc some stupid people will think of brand new ways to betray Hansoo and his allies only to get foiled again, some huge monster will appear out of nowhere and threaten all the work that has been done so far, Hansoo will destroy it by himself while almost getting killed, the fairy will appear to announce how cool he is, etc, etc.
