Have you guys tried [[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/reincarnator/][/Reincarnator/?]] It's not as good as how you're describing FMoC to be, but it has its interesting moments too (though some plot devices eventually get repetitive).

On this story itself, I think I'll at least wait until it's finished arc-by-arc and read it like that. Because otherwise keeping up with these updates is more frustrating than fun.

Also, I don't know what's the procedure, but maybe it can be arranged for this story to be included in the list of parsed stories on [[http://lnmtl.com/novel][lnmtl?]] It may work, depending on the difficulty of Chinese used in this story.
