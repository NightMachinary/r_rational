Reincarnator is pretty fun. I'm not quite sure where the story has to go after this "layer" though.

According to the lnmtl site:

#+begin_quote
  When the threshold of 100$ is reached, one new novel that is not counted as regular novel will be added.

  It will be added under 2 days, counting from the day it reaches the threshold. In case of delay, more than one novel will be added.

  If it will be many users that gather total of 100$, then leader of current survey will have been added.

  If it will be single person that donates 100$, then that person can select novel to be added out of the current survey options.

  It is also possible to select novel outside the survey, but only if you have contacted me and I have agreed to it, prior to the donation.
