I hope you don't die in fifty years either, or ever!

I'm not sure if I want to take over the translation entirely, is the thing- I don't have enough time to do a /full translation/, is the thing. Six hours per four chapters is a lot of hours when scaled up, and I already did all the math and stuff in a previous post, and it's just absolutely beyond my ability. I'm a full-time student and there's already a lotta other stuff on my plate, right now.

Actually, one thing I've been thinking of doing is making sort of a 'style guide' which would include a glossary of terms, a list of names and a breakdown of what those names /mean/ in chinese, how to pronounce them, if there are any puns built into those names, and then a list of terms and a guide to any puns that those terms end up used for. Just getting proper-sounding vocabulary would do a lot to make any potential translator's life easier, and I've already been working on this thing for a while.

If you want to keep working on the translation, I could finish up the glossary, polish it up, and then you could put it up on the blog as a resource for both you and the readers?
