[[http://dragondoctors.dhscomix.com/archives/comic/ch-7-page-1-last-victim][Here is the most obscure]], a webcomic I've recommended here before but few were able to get past the artwork. It's...bad, but I love literally everything else about it so I don't care. It's imaginative, intelligent, and inspiring on all fronts with wonderful characters, clever stories, and creative worldbuilding. In all seriousness, it's up there with Doctor Who. The link is to Ch. 7, my personal favorite and a prequel to Ch. 1, the worst chapter.

[[http://www.readcomics.tv/astro-city/chapter-7/full][This story arc from the comic book Astro City]] is about a Wonder Woman-esque superheroine who runs a franchise of women's shelters dealing with an attack on her image as she questions herself and her role as an icon. It does an excellent job at exploring themes of feminism, power, abuse, adversity, and the questions we ask ourselves about the choices we make in response to them.

Last comic, I swear. [[http://gingerhaze.com/nimona/comic/page-1][Nimona]] is kind of like Dr. Horrible in a magitech fantasy setting with better developed characters, a more interesting plot, and a sociopathic girl who wants to be a henchman even if the supervillain isn't hiring. I can't give any more away without spoiling it, but it's a great drama and adventure with everything I could ask for, except that it isn't free. The first few chapters are, which the link will take you to, but if you want to full story you'll have to buy it.

Yudkowsky already recommend the Haruhu Suzimya fanfic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7218037/1/The-Coin][The Coin]], but I'll put it here in case you missed it because it's just that good. I always had mixed feelings toward the anime, it had some really interesting ideas that I felt never reached their full potential and Haruhi's more abusive moments really bothered me. This fic addressed literally every problem I had with the show, gave me exactly what I had always wanted from it, and stayed completely true to the themes of the source material while also reexamining them in a more intelligent light.

This one is a little subjective, since I personally identify with the protagonist's situation, but it's still one of my favorite sci-fi stories ever. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/PaulsWPAccount/comments/3q223j/index/][It's the highest voted entry on r/WritingPrompts]] and the premise pretty much speaks for itself. The closest thing I can compare it to is The Martian, but it's still a very different story. I see it as about a man trapped inside his own mind, alive but isolated, and having to solve an intellectual problem with no known answer in order to escape. As someone with autism, that hit home hard.

[[http://kisscartoon.me/Cartoon/Superman-vs-The-Elite/Movie?id=22004][Superman vs The Elite]] ties with Avengers for my favorite superhero film. It single-handedly turned me into a Superman fan by showing just how mature, intelligent, and subtle that his stories can really be. Half the film is just Supes talking to people about the moral quandaries he faces in a post-9/11 world where many think problems aren't so straightforward. It's a fantastic examination of idealism in the face of harsh reality and cynicism, and the action looks amazing too. It flew under the radar since it was a direct to DVD film, but literally my only complaint is that they didn't use the title of the comic they adapted it from, What's So Funny About Truth, Justice, and The American Way?

[[http://kissanime.to/Anime/Suisei-no-Gargantia-Dub/Episode-001?id=82616][Gargania on the Verderous Planet]] isn't exactly obscure since it comes from the same creator as Madoka Magika and Psycho-Pass, but it's still awesome. I like to think of it as a mecha anime as made by Miyazaki, and it certainly has the visuals and heart for it. It's about a solider from an unending conflict with aliens crashing on Earth, a mere myth in his society, and having to survive in a world of peace when he has known only war. There's a ton of attention of detail bordering on hard sci-fi, but the best part is the drama and character development.

And finally, go watch Young Justice on Netflix so we can get a third season. It is everything a superhero show should be and more, even if the second season has some problems that seem to bother me more than other people. It's the most episodic story on this list, but it still has a complex ongoing plot with some awesome character development. It's from the same creator who gave us Gargoyles, which I haven't seen yet but have heard is also an obscure gem, and is just as entertaining for adults as it is for children.
