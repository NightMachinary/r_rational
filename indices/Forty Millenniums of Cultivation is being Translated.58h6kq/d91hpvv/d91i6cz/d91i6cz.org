It would be faster to improve current machine translation programs to decent quality!

The only solution I can think of is to recommend it to wuxiaworld.com and hope they pick it up. For example, one of the longer stories is /I Shall Seal the Heavens/ which clocks in at ~1,650 chapters total. Deathblade has been translating it at roughly a year and is up ~1,050 chapters. I also think the chapter lengths are roughly equivalent between it and /Forty Millenniums of Cultivation/ so they are capable of translating it in a short time span which is reasonable since for many of them, translating is literally a full-time job.
