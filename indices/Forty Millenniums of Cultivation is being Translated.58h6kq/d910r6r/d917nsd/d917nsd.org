Paging [[/u/Drazelic]], since s/he was the one to originally translate the title this way, then maybe Drazelic can explain?

When I looked on [[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/118508?redirectedFrom=millennium#eid][OED]] to see the proper pluralization of millennium, they are both valid spellings with millennia being the more common variant. I would guess the reason for the two different spellings to be valid is because the millennia version is due to millennium's heritage as a borrowed Latin word (and the -a stem in Latin indicates pluralization), but millenniums is also valid since millennium is (now) an English word.

Oxford English Dictionary:

#+begin_quote
  Inflections: Plural /millennia, millenniums./
#+end_quote

Languages can be very messy.
