I picked millenniums because I didn't like the two-consecutive-vowels sound of 'millennia of'. It bled together into 'millenniof' when I said it out loud.

The chinese format of the title is literally 'Cultivation 40k' in an isomorphic format to 'Warhammer 40k'. If you like Millennia better, that's your prerogative, whatevs!

I might go with 'Cultivation in the 40th Millennium' for my own version, actually- I have several significant points of dis-satisfaction with the existing translation, which are systematic issues that I feel like would be easier to address with a flat-out rewrite rather than with suggestions and edits.

Competition is good for economics, right?
