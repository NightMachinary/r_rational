Also, this is my parallel attempt at translating the first 3.75 chapters, if you're curious to compare and contrast. I say 3.75 because I took a break during the 4th chapter.

My philosophy of translation tries to emphasize the spirit of the reading experience over the literal wording, which is an issue that honestly bothers me a lot about the whole literalist translation paradigm over at noveltranslations. Like, look, I don't care how /literally accurate/ the definition is, if one is translating the mystic elixirs, tinctures, and medicines concocted by Cultivator alchemists with ancient magic as mere /pills/, then something has gone very very wrong with that translation's ability to /actually deliver an immersive experience with proper awe and grandeur./ When I read Xianxia, I want a sense of mysticism and grandeur. I do not want my goddamn kung fu wizards popping /pills/ every time they get hurt.

(Luckily, nothing like that has happened in this translation, yet. But that's pretty much the first thing that comes to mind when I think about the 'average' level of translation most xianxia novels get, and it's a fate I'd much love to avoid for Cultivation40k.)

I'm not sure myself on whether this is a significant enough improvement on the experience- if it's an improvement at all- to warrant me, well, basically doing the dick thing of pushing my way in and being all like 'outta the way, i've got this'. Because that /would/ be a dick move, but the alternative is to just sit there and stew in my own personal dissatisfaction that the translation doesn't deliver the experience I feel it ought to, right? Be the change you want to see and all that. I'd like to avoid being presumptuous here, if I could.
