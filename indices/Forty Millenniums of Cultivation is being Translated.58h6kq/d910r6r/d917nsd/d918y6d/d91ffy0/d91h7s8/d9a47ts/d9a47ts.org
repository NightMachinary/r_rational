Personally I found this to be a significant improvement upon the other translation. No offence intended to the other translator, who is significantly better at translation than I'll ever be, but they used a few phrases which I found jarring and threw me out of the narrative. while you found more natural ways of phrasing them which flowed better. eg. "broken nose" vs "embedded inside his flesh"
