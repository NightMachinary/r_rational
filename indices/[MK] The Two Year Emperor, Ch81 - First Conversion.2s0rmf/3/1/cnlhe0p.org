I wouldn't say that Afi was good so much as that he wasn't interested in conquering the world any more. When he WAS doing the conqueror thing, he was quite happy to create living, sentient beings for the sole purpose of having their souls ripped out seconds after they came into existence...and that was just Tuesday. There's a reason that the Lich Kings -- some of the most powerful and Evil beings on the planet -- were terrified of him.

For that matter, I wouldn't even say that Albrecht is good...he slaughtered every living thing in two entire cities, right down to the dogs and cats, in order to accomplish his goals. It just so happens that his interests are aligned with those of the protagonist.

I'm glad you like the faction-not-alignment thing, though. I've put some real effort into that.
