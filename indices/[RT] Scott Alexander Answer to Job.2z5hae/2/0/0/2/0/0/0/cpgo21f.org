Because the 'minimal level' isn't a question of an arbitrary boundary, it's a fact. At what level of happiness do people prefer to die rather than live? You'll find that level is pretty damn low. Saying the minimum is higher than that is effectively telling those people "hey your life isn't worth living, even though you think it is, you should die".

It's not any particular person living at that level that's intuitively appalling; it's the moving of everyone down to the minimally satisfying level in order to create more people.
