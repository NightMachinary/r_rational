Why would you set the minimal level so low then, if people living at that level appals you? The utilitarian reasoning is not the problem.

- set a target level of happiness
- adjust population, while maintaining a uniform distribution of happiness over agents until you reach your goal.

As your society develops, adjust the target happiness accordingly.
