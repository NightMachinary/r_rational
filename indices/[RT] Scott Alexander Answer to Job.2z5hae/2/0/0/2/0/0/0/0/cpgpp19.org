I think that this dislike of repugnant conclusion is reflected in your utility function. It's reflected in pretty much everyone function, so if you did a proper calculation of expected utility CEV-style over existing minds (if that is even possible), you'd find that the actual preferred minimal level of happiness would turn out to be rather higher than the bare survival minimum.

Since this kind of calculation is obviously beyond us, the best we can do is target some reasonable level of happiness and adjust population accordingly.
