  I suspect it's tough to make a moral system that works in both normal circumstances and "you're God and literally creating universes" circumstances.

I think that what we need here is a notion of bounded rationality for ethics: the degree to which we need our "morality algorithm" to be completely correct (in the sense that we would derive a clear contradiction if it was any /other/ way) scales with the amount of causal influence our agent's decisions actually have.
