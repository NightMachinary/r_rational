Proper utilitarianism requires some tough computation and nigh-omniscient knowledge. What we do in practice is take the crudest possible approximation and use that, because it still works better than alternatives. And then we are dismayed when the crudest approximation of a theory returns strange results in some extreme cases. It's almost comical.
