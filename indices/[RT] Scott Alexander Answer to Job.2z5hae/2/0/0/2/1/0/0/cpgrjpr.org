The basic problem is that a lot of the time, utilitarianism seems to work pretty well. Some ethical and moral systems or whatever are obviously false or can never be used, or contradict themselves in obvious ways. Utilitarianism only seems to do this in extreme or unlikely examples.

You can spend a lot of time thinking about Utilitarianism and have it make sense, only for it to appear to fail spectacularly later. For example, the idea of having some sort of progressive income tax fits well with utilitarianism. The first $50,000 you earn give you a lot more joy than $50,001 through $100,000, so we tax your higher earnings more and give it to people who make less than $25,000, thereby increase total happiness. To a Utilitarian, it makes sense. It also gives us some info about how much we can tax. Pretty great! There's tons of examples like this. We get plenty of chances to basically think Utilitarianism is correct in everyday life.

This makes it much more jarring when we talk about Utilitarianism and find problems. If someone told me that there were flaws in catholicism, I would not be surprised. I don't use catholicism in my every day life. If someone told me that the basic laws of motion weren't correct, this would be much more jarring. I use those all the time. There are tons of contrived examples where Utilitarianism does not make sense at all. Since Utilitarianism is useful so much of the time, this is surprising to many and we start adding patches to try to make it work.

I find this acceptable. People don't go into Utilitarianism planning to divert a trolley to hit one guy instead of 5, but to find a framework that will let them determine the best tax rates or structure of society. I suspect it's tough to make a moral system that works in both normal circumstances and "you're God and literally creating universes" circumstances. Utilitarianism works well in the former and poorly in the latter.
