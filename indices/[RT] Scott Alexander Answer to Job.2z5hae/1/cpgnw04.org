What if Job's suffering, while certainly sucking hard for Job, allowed his story to spread, and the results of that caused more people to obey God and go to heaven?

What if, when Job died and went to heaven himself, he learned of this, and in fact agreed it was right for him to suffer as he did, for the lessons his story would bring to so many for so long?

Any criticism of morality in the Bible that doesn't take an eternal afterlife into account is not worth very much. Eliezer Yudkowsky argued that it was OF COURSE better to torture a man for 50 years than have 10^^^3 people get a speck of dust in their eyes. So he at least should be totally onboard with what happened to Job... right?
