Biblical law clearly states that one cannot kill another person and a Vow is not a good enough reason.

A direct command from God is different from an obligation you took upon yourself.

There would be grounds to cancel the Vow anyway becase they didn't expect the subject to be human, even if it wasn't invalidated by not being legal.
