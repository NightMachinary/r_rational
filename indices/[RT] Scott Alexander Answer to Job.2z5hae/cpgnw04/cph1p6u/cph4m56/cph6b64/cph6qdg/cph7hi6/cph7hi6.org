While God does hate human sacrifice, we do know he hates disobedience more. (c.f. Isaac, holding that the correct answer is not "Strewth, that would be immoral.") And a vow to God is Serious Business, so God's opinion would be at the very least uncertain if it weren't for the fact that Jephthah made it onto the Hebrews 11 list.

It would obviously have been better all around if he had never made the vow, but given that he did it's about as clear as Biblical anecdotes get that he had to keep it.

As for what the vow /was/, I feel like "I will sacrifice it as a burnt offering" is pretty clearly fatal.
