[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Judges+11][Jephthah.]]

God didn't directly say "you must kill your daughter," but Jephthah promised that if he won this battle he'd sacrifice whatever (literally translated "whoever") came out of his house to meet him when he returned home. I'm not really sure what he was /expecting/ to happen. His daughter volunteers to go through with it, but asks for two months to weep about the fact that she'll never have sex. (I promise I'm not making this up! She really did pick a number out of thin air without making it a big one! And pick that one specific thing to weep about. But whatever.) Afterward, he kills her.

It's portrayed as being tragic but necessary. And Jephthah does get mentioned later in God's canonical nonexhausive [[http://biblehub.com/esv/hebrews/11.htm][list]] of Most Faithliest Heroes.

His daughter doesn't.
