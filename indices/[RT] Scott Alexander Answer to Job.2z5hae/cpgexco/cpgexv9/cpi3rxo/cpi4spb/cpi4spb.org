Yes, I believe that a multiverse where 100% of the people are super-super-happy is better than one where 50% are super-super-happy and 50% are only super-happy.

Your example of 10 people leads you astray because it makes your mind think of finite /rooms/, not of the whole multiverse across eternities and infinities. In your example, a room with 10 people (5 of them super-super-happy, and 5 of them only super-happy) would increase the average happiness of the /universe/ more than than a room of 5 super-super-happy people would, and so as a room is preferable.

But when talking multiverses, percentages may be a better way to evaluate whether one possible multiverse is better than another -- indicating how likely a mind is to find its preferences satisfied and to what extent.
