As before, the answer is that I'm averaging across the /whole/ of the universe. This includes both the past and the future.

What you're doing when you're asking me whether the multiverse is improved by such-and-such an event, is asking which of two possible /timelines/ is preferable. Killing an existing person is /not/ morally equivalent to the person not having existed in the first place. (Murder is not equivalent to contraception/celebacy).
