  I think that this dislike of repugnant conclusion is reflected in your utility function. It's reflected in pretty much everyone function, so if you actually did a proper calculation of expected utility CEV-style over existing minds (if that is even possible), you'd find that the actual preferred minimal level of happiness would turn out to be rather higher than the bare survival minimum.

That would be a very weird coincidence, if the two cancelled each other rather than one dominating the other.
