Fair enough. And I think average utilitarianism is closer to being correct. However, it /still/ includes the problem that it authorizes you to allow or create quite a lot of suffering so long as the /mean utility across everyone/ goes up. There are quite a lot of ways to do this that are trivially immoral, such as many "rich get richer" situations in real life (where the immorality arises from the fact that mean utility goes up at the present time, but power dynamics are created that allow some people to directly inflict suffering on others for their own interest).
