I actually wrote the entire thing last night. I just posted [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5c19vs/ffrst_orders_of_magnitude_hpmorsd_prequel/d9t2q2b/][this comment]] talking a bit about the writing process.

Agreed that Hermione was not a perfect analog for Hillary. I seriously debated who to use as the stand-in. Originally I was going to go with Umbridge to reinforce the "lesser of two evils" theme that seems to have pervaded this election. But it just didn't make sense as to 1. why Umbridge would run against Voldemort, and 2. why Harry would feel broken if Umbridge lost.

I admit I hadn't considered Draco, and I think in many ways it works better than Hermione, but it just doesn't quite make sense why Draco would be running against Voldemort rather than sticking to the Malfoy family tradition of being second-in-command to whomever happens to be the ruling party (in which case, the Malfoys would be poised to come out on top regardless of the resutls).
