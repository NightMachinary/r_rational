When did you schedule this little political tie-in?

But I must say that Umbridge or Fudge would be a better analogue for Hillary than Hermione. Malfoy, if it must be one of Harry's peers. Hermione is closer to Bernie, advocating hope and idealism that doesn't pan out in our world.

You insult my mental image of Hermione through that characterization. Though I agree that canon Voldemort is a good analogue for Trump.
