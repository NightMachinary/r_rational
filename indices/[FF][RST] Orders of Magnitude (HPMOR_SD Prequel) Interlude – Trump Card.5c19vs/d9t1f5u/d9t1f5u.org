I've got to know. Is this a deliberate reference to the presidential election results from today?

First you use the word 'Trump' in the chapter title, and then you talk about an election scenario in the chapter.

If you did do this intentionally, would you still have posted this chapter exactly the same if the presidential election had gone the other way?

PS Wonderful chapter by the way!
