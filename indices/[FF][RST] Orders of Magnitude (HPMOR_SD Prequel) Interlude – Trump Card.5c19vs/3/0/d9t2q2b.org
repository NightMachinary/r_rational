It was very much deliberate - I actually wrote the entire thing last night around 1 in the morning once the writing was on the wall. I had already intended for Quirrell to refer to the events at Estremoz in a future interlude, so much of the dialog was already floating around in my head. And of course, I lifted a large portion of the dialog straight from HPMOR.

I would not have posted the chapter if the election had gone the other way. I am not particularly fond of either candidate. But, because almost every prediction had Hillary pegged as the overwhelmingly likely winner, the Trump victory was very shocking, and thus likely to be a lot more divisive.

At first, I wanted to address the point that, regardless of who won, the country was still split roughly 50/50, with both sides pretty vehemently abhorring the other party's candidate. It was going to tie into the whole, "nobody really thinks they're the bad guy, everyone is always picking between the lesser of two evils or the greater of two goods." But then it got pretty preachy so I cut out that dialog.
