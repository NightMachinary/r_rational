In a desperate attempt to promote equality, a mad scientist/alien/wizard/god/whatever has made it so that every day, at 12 pm GMT, all humans on Earth swap bodies randomly.

This swap does not allow people to gain memories/knowledge: for example, if a physicist is put into the body of a biologist, he still retains all of his knowledge of physics, and does not gain any of the biologist's knowledge.

This swap does not change the location of any physical mass: when the physicist wakes up in the biologist's body, that body is still where the biologist left it, not where the physicist's body originally was.

This swap is not instantaneous: all humans lose consciousness for 30 minutes at 12pm GMT, and wake up at 12:30pm in someone else's body. So there is no faster than light signaling.

If a body dies during the swap (before 12:30pm), the current owner dies. Any prospective owners find other bodies to swap with.

What does the resulting world look like? Is there anything that rational agents could do to mitigate negative effects?
