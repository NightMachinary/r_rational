Sorry for the long, rambling, stream of consciousness style post.

This world seems incredibly grimdark as far as I can tell. One day you can be a healthy 20 year old, and then next you could trapped in a 102 year old body that's due to fail while you're inhabiting it. Do infants get rerolled into adult bodies and vice versa? That would be a nightmare to deal with. I have no idea what effect this random swapping would have on childhood development, but the lack of stability seems incredibly bad.

How do you keep relationships when your geographical location switches every day? To see someone during a given day, you'd have to get lucky enough to have a consistent way to communicate and meet up. It's unlikely that you'll end up close enough and have the means, making relationships somewhat impossible.

It just seems like everything would fall apart immediately. Anything you do would have no consequence or promise of reward. It's impossible to hold people accountable for their actions in that situation, and anything they accomplish during a given day is essentially going to be reset. The only thing you can do is try to make each day as pleasant as possible with the resources you have, but good luck doing that after society falls apart. You can no longer get a team of experienced workers in the same physical location. You might be able to design things if the same group teleconferences together, but good luck getting them built. Also good luck keeping the internet maintained when your electrical engineers and such get scattered to the wind. On the other hand, good luck to your electrical engineers when they suddenly find themselves deep in the Amazon without the specialized survival skills that allow people to live there. I think we'd be forced to go back to hunting and gathering, except without the benefit of having stable tribes and social groups. It's also a huge problem that everyone's essentially anonymous now. If you're not tied to your body or physical location, you can do anything and just pretend to be another mind tomorrow. No one would know.

The only real plan I have is "learn to keep myself alive". I'd spend as much time as possible learning emergency medicine, survival skills, self-defense, enough geography and astronomy to locate myself when I wake up at 12:30. The unfortunate thing is that I can no longer keep permanent notes. Considering that I expect the electrical grid and internet to stop working, I wouldn't even be able to keep notes in a Google doc or anything.

Honestly though, the only thing that would keep me going is the idea that this swapping effect might be stopped some day. Otherwise it's just not an enjoyable way to live. Every day is a complete roll of the dice with a very considerable chance of death, and it's not very comforting that you can talk to the strangers around you when you can't build lasting relationships. Also while you probably will find several that speak your language, I'm assuming that the vast majority of everyone you'd meet wouldn't. It would be isolating no matter how many people were around you, and living conditions would degrade for everyone so fast that I can see the population plummeting rapidly.

That's not even delving into nightmare scenarios that I'm sure would happen. If killing the body between 12:00 and 12:30 kills the current occupant, you know there's going to be some asshole that sets their current body up to die at 12:31. Maybe you'll find yourself buried alive, or in any number of other PTSD inducing situations (assuming you manage to survive). Not that mental damage requires malice. I had a nightmare about being fully paralyzed once and that was bad enough, I don't think I'd ever truly get over spending a whole day like that and knowing it could happen again randomly.

So I guess tl;dr: this makes everything truly horrible, and there's nothing to be done except learn to keep yourself alive in the widest variety of situations possible. Once this goes into play, you've basically lost.
