To [[/u/DeterminedThrowaway]] and [[/u/ulyssessword]]: Long-term coordination isn't entirely ruled out, since knowledge isn't gained via swaps. This means you could set up passwords to identify one another... I think?

But hmm... perhaps this scenario is too sudden for anyone to do anything. Let's relax the problem a little: what if you knew, 10 years in advance, that this swapping phenomenon would occur? Is there anything you could do to prepare for it?
