I'm assuming I know the exact date this will start. I would try to set up the following: a well-stocked, well-provisioned refuge area for 200000 people with maximally failproofed automation, greenhouses, etc. I start some sort of organization (probably a cult) and I need to get it to >200000 young, healthy members (order of square root of the global population to make it so that one of the cult members ends up in the area on each of the first several days). All the cult members go to the refuge the day of the transition.

In the area, there is some way for anyone who knows the layout and secret passwords to get to the control center, whence he can make announcements, view people on cameras, and perform selective automated executions to punish defectors. There is also an automatic announcement that plays at 12:30 in the 10 most common global languages with instructions to not panic, follow loudspeaker instructions, warns them they are being watched and can be punished, etc.

This can help guarantee survival of the bodies inside at a much higher rate than outside. After a short time, I expect world population to plummet, meaning that more and more of the people in the refuge have been there before, allowing them to form some sort of society.

Once a significant portion of the world population is in the refuge each day, we set up identifying passwords. We organize people to sleep in such a way that whoever wakes up in a certain bed is in charge, there are standard lines of communication, etc. in order to quickly organize each morning. I'll have the cult members be in on the plan so that there will be somebody who can organize all this.

This way, we can probably get a 100000 person strong surviving population and society, enough to serve as a nucleus for future humanity.

Further edit with new idea: Actually, the faster the world population declines, the faster we get people returning to the refuge regularly and the faster we can organize society inside (and have more people survive inside). Therefore the cult members will be ordered to kill people, damage infrastructure, etc. whenever they wake up outside to whatever extent they can without risk to themselves in order to speed up the process.
