If you had the infrastructure setup, you'd still be able to work and get paychecks. Everyone would have to memorize an ID number and password. When you go to work somewhere, you give them your ID number, letting them know where to deposit your paycheck. When you need to pay for something, you enter your ID number and password, similar to swiping a card and entering a PIN today.

I imagine pretty much all businesses would be chains. You'd have your Walmart, McDonalds, etc. in every city. Then, if you work at Walmart, when you wake up in a new body you check around for the nearest Walmart. You give them your ID number (or plug it into a computer), they/it will have a record of your employment there, and they/it assigns you a role (restocking, cashier, etc.) based on your experience and the experience of who else is working there.

Of course, this system would be extremely ripe for scams and identity theft. Currently, security is based on 3 things: what you know (passwords, security questions), what you have (key, badge, phone), and what you are (fingerprints, face recognition). By constantly switching bodies, you definitely can't base security on what you are, and you probably can't base security on what you have. If someone learns your ID number and password, they'll be able to fake being you for the rest of time.

Hmmm... actually, the right infrastructure could kind of solve the security issue. Have every person be required/heavily encouraged to end the day by a kiosk. When you wake up, you go to the kiosk and enter your ID/Password. It prints you an ID card, which you'll use instead of your ID number for shopping/work/etc and which expires by the next day. You /never/ use your ID number for anything else. If people steal your ID card, they still need your password to buy anything. If they peek over your shoulder at an ATM and steal your password and then mug you for your ID card, then at least they'll only be able to steal your identity for a day, since they won't have your ID number to make the next day's ID card.

There's definitely more issues and improvements to be made. Designing a secure ID system in this type of world is actually really interesting. I'm tempted to work everything out and then write a short story or something about it.
