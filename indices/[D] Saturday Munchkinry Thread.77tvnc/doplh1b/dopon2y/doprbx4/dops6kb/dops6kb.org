  This means you could set up passwords to identify one another... I think?

The problem isn't authentication, since I'm sure you can ask a friend about some shared experience to verify who they are. The problem is getting in touch at all. You wake up in England, your friend wakes up in Madagascar. Infrastructure is down, and you have 24 hours before you're both randomized to other parts of the world again. What do you even do?

  what if you knew, 10 years in advance, that this swapping phenomenon would occur? Is there anything you could do to prepare for it?

Yes, in that case there's a lot humanity could do and things could be slightly less awful. The ideal to strive for is a situation where it doesn't matter what body you wake up in, and while it's not possible in 10 years it leads to some ideas. You'd want people clustered together as tightly as possible (while somehow avoiding the spread of disease that would probably cause), and you'd need to make sure there are enough resources for however many bodies are going to be in your cluster of people. I'm think of something like mega cities with skyscraper sized apartments, which again can't be done in 10 years but it would be the best way to ensure that everyone's geographically close to the things they need.

One of the most important things would be to set up the power grid and internet so that it can still function with infrequent maintenance / oversight. If you want any kind of coordination, that's your single best tool. It gives people a way to communicate things like "Hey I woke up in (mega city) today, is anyone I know here?".

Automation would need to happen very aggressively and without being bogged down by politics. The whole idea of getting a paycheque for labour is obviously out, so it's going to be hard to find skilled workers and incentivize them to do anything. Also, who's going to listen to someone that's in the same position as everyone else when they suddenly decide "I'm the boss now"? The less we have to rely on people getting things done, the better.

The more I think about it, the more it would still be fairly awful though due to the problems I mentioned in my first post. There are a lot of issues that you couldn't solve even with solid planning. The only thing we could do is try our best now to make sure everyone's basic needs are met once the swapping starts, but I'm not very optimistic that it's possible even in principle. There are a million things I know I'm not even considering, important but not urgent medicine is one that just hit me. There will be a lot of bodies that need some sort of medical attention, and far too many people who will go "Meh, if not taking this medicine won't kill me before 12:30 then it's someone else's problem".
