If humanity is not warned in advance then we are seriously screwed. At 12PM in the first day everybody that's driving, flying a plane, participating on a surgery, etc., dies horribly. Maybe 5% to 30% of the people die. We probably lose 50% of working drivers/pilots and that's enough to break down our entire logistics system.

After that we have billions of people suddenly gaining conscience inside bodies they aren't familiar with, doing things they don't understand. We have a decent chance of a catastrophic failure in some system because the operator has no idea how to deal with emergencies. Software starts breaking down because any production system problem that doesn't have 100% automated failure recovery won't be fixed (even if the swapped person happens to have the particular skill set they probably won't be familiar with the system and won't know the passwords). As the systems die we increase the chances of a snowball effect as more and more systems that depend on then fail. After a few hours of downtime in core systems other systems suddenly fail because they're now handling a situation that never happened before and that part of the (never run before) code has some bugs. Not all systems die, but enough of them and many of the key systems die, it's probably sufficient to "shut down the internet".

If the swap is random chances are people can't talk to each other as they speak different languages. Age differences are a big deal too, much bigger than gender differences. Body sizes may be a big problem if you keep your original motor skills.

Maybe after a week most of the survivors adapted to the daily shuffle but now humanity is facing an extinction event. Cities have two weeks of food supplies and nobody is delivering more food.

Arguably selection effects kill everybody that isn't super competent and compassionate, It's very probable that at least one large (> 10k) population group will persist due to randomness, so we may keep a minimum viable population for breeding. From then on it's a survivable situation, human culture and values are changed beyond recognition but the civilization that emerges from our ashes will colonize the solar system in a few centuries, as their coordination skills will be godlike.
