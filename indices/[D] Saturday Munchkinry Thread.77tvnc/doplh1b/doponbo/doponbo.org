  What does the resulting world look like?
#+end_quote

Horrible.

Any mind with major problems (or simply being a baby) would leave a chain of ruined bodies and situations in its wake, and any body with major problems (allergies, any sort of medication, etc.) would die very quickly. Any simply selfish person would leave sleepy, injured, and/or hungry bodies behind.

All farms, specialized infrastructure, and complex systems fail practically instantly, as everyone who runs them ends up on the far side of the world. They can't do their jobs, and nobody else even knows that they should be doing them.

The only possible way of punishing criminal (or civil) acts is to kill someone before the next swap.

Trade becomes almost impossible and useless. You can only use enough to get you through one day, and you can only gather resources that quickly as well. You also can't enter contracts with people that last longer than 23:30, and even if you could, you couldn't enforce them.

Communication is difficult, but not impossible. A unified world language would likely emerge almost instantly to deal with the random mishmash of languages that any group of people would speak.

Jetlag would suck, but it's possible people would synchronize to some consistent offset.

  Is there anything that rational agents could do to mitigate negative effects?
#+end_quote

Not much. They can't coordinate with collaborators for longer than 23 hours, and can't affect defectors other than by killing them. It's like playing a non-iterated version of the prisoner's dilemma: the defect-bot has the winning strategy.
