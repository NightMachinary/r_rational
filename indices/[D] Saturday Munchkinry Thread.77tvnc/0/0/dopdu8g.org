This seems more like a problem of how to find trustworthy people, rather than a problem of how to munchkin a superpower.

That said, there are of course, ways to reduce the number of trustworthy people needed. You said the first power is Flight? That's relatively useless, just get on a damn plane. Discharge that, and all other relatively useless powers, on terminally ill patients and death row convicts that are about to be executed. That way, they can't backstab you, because they are dead. Then, when you get an actually useful power, you can give it to one of the few trustworthy people you have found.

And if you can't find any trustworthy people, there's always the option of kidnapping. You wouldn't be able to give the kidnapped victims any combat-related superpowers of course, since they would be able to use those powers to break free. Instead, give them oracle-like superpowers, superpowers that give them supernatural methods of gaining information, and then make them tell you the information.
