The immediate scenario will very quickly lead to a global collapse in population - mainly due to the fact that food production is going to almost completely vanish.

But with ten years to prepare for it, it becomes a lot more survivable. What needs to happen:

- Global literacy. Everyone needs to be able to read.
- Instructions. Everyone needs to wake up with a notebook, describing how to do basic maintenance tasks on whatever infrastructure that body is responsible for. (Advanced maintenance, or improvements, will have to wait on a mind that actually knows what it's doing).
- Interpersonal relationships will be mostly long-range, over email.
- At best, this will merely slow the decline of humanity. Children will /not/ benefit from the constant swapping, and education will be near impossible. For small (pre-literate) children, even interpersonal relations will be practically impossible. Humanity /will/ be able to adapt, but it will take generations and our social systems will come out completely altered in ways hard to predict.
