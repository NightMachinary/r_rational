Then, I'd see two paths forward. "Organ Donor List" vs "Clone Army."

In the first case, I basically let an institution decide who gets minimally viable grafts, and in which order. It turns into a standard medical ethics problem.

The limit is that, if I make the technology public, I know that some doctor somewhere will take a biopsy. So I have to disclose the fact that you can clone people.

In the second case, I wouldn't share the technology. I'd use it only on myself and create a bunch of clones.

The downside is that a lot of people die of preventable illness. The upside is that (after 7 years) I look like an alien with extremely advanced tech.

And, since I have the sort of personality where I'd cooperate with a clone of myself, I get an exponentially expanding, loyal organization.

That would be really valuable, but would take a few decades to fully kick in.
