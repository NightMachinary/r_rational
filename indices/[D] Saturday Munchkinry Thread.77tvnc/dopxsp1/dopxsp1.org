You gain access to an inert, synthetic, humanoid body. It's made of a kind of metal for all tests humanity knows of, but it has weird properties.

If you chop off a hand from that body and attach to a person with a missing hand it will bond and act as a perfect prosthetic hand. The humanoid body will grow a new hand (say a gram per second out while it can draw carbon from the surrounding air).

The prosthetic will heal itself, a bit over 1g per hour. It also will replace the neighboring body cells in a Theseus' ship fashion, at the same rate, so in roughly seven years a person will be entirely replaced but preserve identity. From them on the person is functionally immortal, full body destruction still is possible and if you lose parts of your brain it'll grow back but the associated memories will be lost forever. The material is roughly as strong as some decent plastic. Besides the durability/health benefits your body/mind functions are unchanged.

Only the original synthetic body can produce attachable parts, once a part is attached to a person it can't be cut and bound to other people (it'll slowly form a clone of the person at the 1g per hourish rate, but the clone will develop as a new human, so it starts as a baby and needs to acquire it's own set of skills/memories and is biologically 21yo after seven years).

What would you do in such scenario?
