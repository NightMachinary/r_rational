I'd worry that the slow transformation would lead to some ironic fate worse than death. So, I probably wouldn't do anything without lots and lots of research.

But, if that's not a concern, and it really is just a novel material, then I'd start looking for the minimum viable graft.

Replace a freckle or something. And then, in 7 years, end up with an immortal body.

Is there a reason (other than ironic fates worse than death) to not go for plastic immortality?
