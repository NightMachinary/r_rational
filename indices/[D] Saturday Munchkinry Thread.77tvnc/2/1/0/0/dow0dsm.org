  Initially I thought about making it a property of the synthetic body's surface area, but I started having headache's about Torricelli's trumpet or Banach-Tarski paradox shenanigans, so I kept it simple.

Because the point of the surface area idea is that it's absorbing carbon from the atmosphere, the relevant surface area should ignore nooks and crannies smaller than a carbon atom. Furthermore, if the synthetic hand is made from atoms, it shouldn't contain any features smaller than atoms. That would prevent shenanigans from using unusual mathematical figures with large surface areas.
