  How do we know it isn't overwriting their personalities or doing some kind of evil possession?

It isn't in this case but could be in other prompts.

  But, assuming that isn't the case, first question: do you need to replace an entire hand? If I replace say, a fingernail or a hair or a patch of skin, can the "prosthetic" still take over the human body and grant functional immortality? If so, you can just start giving out "prosthetics" en masse, turning all of humanity functionally immortal.

Yeah, that's the starter scenario. There's a minimum graft, I would say a few grams, maybe a couple of dozen, in a single piece, and it must replace the part (e.g. not just placing on top of your skin). That gives you a person, maybe two, per day (as the synthetic body rebuilds the parts at the 1g/h rate).

  Second question: the synthetic body heals itself using the carbon in the air. Can this heal rate be accelerated by filling the air with MORE carbon? What if we just dunk the entire thing in a vat of pure carbon?
#+end_quote

Initially I thought about making it a property of the synthetic body's surface area, but I started having headache's about Torricelli's trumpet or Banach-Tarski paradox shenanigans, so I kept it simple. It wouldn't change the ratio if given more concentrated carbon in the fluid it's in but it stops if you cut the supply (e.g. keep it on pure nitrogen).

  Third question: Oh shit oh shit oh shit what have we done? How much needs to be cut off to become a clone? Because we humans are always losing parts of our bodies here and there, hairs, skins, nails, body fluids, etc. If they all become clones, we are going to face the worst overpopulation crisis ever.
#+end_quote

Given that it must come from the synthetic part of the individual and that part is plastic in most ways, it should shed too often (of course if you stick your new synthetic hand in a shredder or something you would end up with many small pieces.

I thought of a few fixes for this scenario:

1. There's a minimum viable piece size, just like the minimum viable graft, so we need a dozen or so grams.
2. As the pieces slowly grow they merge if they are from the same source, that also means they can be reabsorbed. Maybe they have a slow pull towards each other.
3. The clones grow at the usual rate, which is very slow, and they have some biological-like "cognitive rules", so they don't have actual brains until they are large/complex enough, similarly to the process from zygotes to fetuses. Same ethical arguments could be argued here.
4. The clones need the same sort of carbon supply, otherwise they go in stasis.

So if you have a shredder accident you can keep moving your hand near the bits and attract them back, maybe in a couple of days you find some parts you missed initially and either try to reabsorb them, put them in pure water for later use or just burn them up completely (the full body destruction clause).

OTOH you could intentionally try to build a clone army by removing pieces of yourself and keeping them apart, maybe some exponential growth as you try to divide them, but you eventually will be overwhelmed by the amount of space they need in order to not merge back again and they'll end up as baby clones anyway, so there's plenty of natural hurdles to prevent full exponential growth. Still you can end up with thousands of clones in a few years.
