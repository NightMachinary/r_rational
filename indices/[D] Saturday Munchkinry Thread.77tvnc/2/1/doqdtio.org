I would be extremely worried about it, seeing as it literally takes over human bodies. How do we know it isn't overwriting their personalities or doing some kind of evil possession?

But, assuming that isn't the case, first question: do you need to replace an entire hand? If I replace say, a fingernail or a hair or a patch of skin, can the "prosthetic" still take over the human body and grant functional immortality? If so, you can just start giving out "prosthetics" en masse, turning all of humanity functionally immortal.

Second question: the synthetic body heals itself using the carbon in the air. Can this heal rate be accelerated by filling the air with MORE carbon? What if we just dunk the entire thing in a vat of pure carbon?

Third question:

  (it'll slowly form a clone of the person at the 1g per hourish rate, but the clone will develop as a new human, so it starts as a baby and needs to acquire it's own set of skills/memories and is biologically 21yo after seven years).

Oh shit oh shit oh shit what have we done? How much needs to be cut off to become a clone? Because we humans are always losing parts of our bodies here and there, hairs, skins, nails, body fluids, etc. If they all become clones, we are going to face the worst overpopulation crisis ever.
