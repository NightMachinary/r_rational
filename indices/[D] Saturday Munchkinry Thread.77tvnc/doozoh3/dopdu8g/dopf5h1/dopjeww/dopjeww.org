Unless you stumble upon something like "Complete Invulnerability" or "Time Reversal", there usually will be ways to ensure whoever you bestow the power on dies before they can really use it.

For example, you could give the power to them while they are sleeping (humans still have cognitive function while sleeping, unlike brain-dead humans). Feed them an overdose of sleeping pills, which will kill them, and then gift them the power.

Or give them deadly poisons before giving them the power, that way even if they gain super combat powers, that doesn't stop the poison from killing them.

You could also chop off all their arms and legs and just give a superpower to a human brain without its body, that is being kept alive only by blood transfusions. Give it the superpower, and then stop the transfusion. If you do it this way, it won't matter if the superpower bestows super strength or super speed, since they don't have any muscle cells whatsoever.
