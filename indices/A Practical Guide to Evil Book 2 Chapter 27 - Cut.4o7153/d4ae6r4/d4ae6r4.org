I started reading this web novel recently, and I have a question about some older stuff.

Namely, the rules of War College games seem a bit weird. For example, what stops any team from just handing their flag to a good scout and order him to hide and not come back under any circumstances, essentially securing a draw if hey lose the battle itself?
