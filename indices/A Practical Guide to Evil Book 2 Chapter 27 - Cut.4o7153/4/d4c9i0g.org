Edit: Having finished the stream of consciousness, now reading the comments. 'Oh, well' regarding no lasting scorched-earth Squire effect. --Hmm, the Vader comment also got me thinking about the Sith, for Black Knight and Squire. Speaking of which, of the Black and White Knight, can only one have a Squire at a time I wonder? Do you get cases where the Black and White Knights' apprentices are both claimants and one has to be killed before the other can become a proper Squire? (I also find myself thinking about the number of effective adjutants there must have been to wear enough of a groove in Fate to allow an Adjutant, and whether the position of adjutant is more recent than for example chancellor/vizier.)

Second edit: This leads me to reminisce about her reaction to her mind being messed with. The potential redemption arc messed with her mind; the potential redemption arc got started when she saved someone she otherwise should have killed; she saved him as a deliberate act to start a war to further her own goals; her reaction: "I won't forgive him for messing with my mind!". Given that he thought she'd die from what he did to her, I find myself wondering what she thinks he could have done to change that outcome, other than immediately fall on his sword instead of surviving and starting the war she wanted him to.

(Stream of conciousness reactions.)

Painful that, to get a glimpse of such an awesome power and then have it gone forever. Good thing that she's going to get fresh aspects after Name promotion (and would have lost the old ones anyway).

Are all Squires from here on out going to have only two aspects, or is it just for her? Or is it that no Squires will ever have that particular aspect again? (If the first, actually rather badass. --Also, that's hypothetically a way to destroy the Chancellor name, though allowing its inheritance and the destruction are both so laden with risks it probably wouldn't be done.)

Aside, thoughts drifting back to an earlier chapter: A non-Name goblin has shown himself willing to attack a Named person out of hatred, showing a certain level of willingness to put his life on the line. Having failed, this goblin tells you that, since you're underground, you can kill him with impunity. The goblin could in this situation have instead claimed that it was willing to be executed afterwards in order to kill you. Do you

A: Kill the goblin, assuming that it's true that you can kill him with impunity, and that he was stupid enough to tell you that (goblins famed for being intelligent/cunning/sly), or

B: Not kill the goblin, assuming that he was willing to put his life on the line or throw his life away to harm you before, and that this is a trick to harm you by getting you to kill him?

Either way, with that level of interference the matter could probably be covered up fairly easily... however, I find myself curious about whether there's going to be later confirmation of the no-scrying-underground rule, or else an amusing double-take if scrying underground is mentioned as completely normal. (Or even just a comment about the cover up, with a mention of scrying underground possible.)

I find myself wondering how things are going to go, physically, for her. Get weaker and weaker, more battered and broken until she gets out of the game or dies meaningfully? Get/Seize some sort of healing potion/blessing to restore some of her body's damage? Keep her physical problems, but get enough (promotion aspects and/or other, e.g. protheses) power that she's more effective than she was before (the 'Darth Vader' route)? Hmm. A chronic downward spiral would be depressing, so an uptick at some point would be nice. Promotion, some point in the future, is one writing-on-the-wall sign of that already, though not looking forward to the probable prerequisite.

That ends up reminding me of another question: 'If the Squire can also lead into the White Knight, why is the Name connection so damaged by a potential redemption arc?'. Hmm.
