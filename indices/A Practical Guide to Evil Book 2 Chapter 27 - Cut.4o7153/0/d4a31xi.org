Damn, I did not expect things to go that way. I guess I've been thinking of Cat as the hero, and anticipating tropes along those lines. When a hero takes a dangerous chance to increase their power in a desperate situation, I expect them to succeed and boost their power just in time to save the day. But Cat's a villain, and when a villain tries that things usually end poorly for them.

Still, Squire is a transitional name, so hopefully when she becomes a Knight she'll get all three aspects.
