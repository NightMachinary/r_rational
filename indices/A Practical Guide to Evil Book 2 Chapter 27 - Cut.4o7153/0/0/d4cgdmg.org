Cat's battles all seem to revolve around her opponents underestimating her and her jumping in with her powers to win. Eg. Pulling out new powers vs Juniper, controlling her dead body vs the lone swordsman and vs the devil or shooting the Prince leading the silver spears.

It's been working out for her so far, so it was a bit surprising to me that she lost since her battles often seem to end up with relying on her powers to pull her through. Maybe if she had more preparation it would have been better, but I found it a bit odd that she lost here.
