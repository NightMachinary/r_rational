So apparently one attempting to remove the taint of a corruption demon can permanently damage a name. This seems like a poorly thought out plot point to me. We intentionally don't know much about names but if you can permanently damage a name by accident why hasn't the Black Knight been crippling the heroes he kills first so that they come back weaker?
