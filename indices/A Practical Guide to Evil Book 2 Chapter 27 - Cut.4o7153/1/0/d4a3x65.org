That's a good point actually. I don't think Black would fuck around with demonic corruption, but if it's possible to mutilate a Name permanently without first infecting it with a demon it seems like something he might have done. Perhaps heroic Names have more divine protection than villainous ones. Or maybe Black didn't consider it necessary since his plan was to change the culture of Callow enough that they'd stop getting their traditional names and start getting Praesi Names instead, like what's happened with Cat.
