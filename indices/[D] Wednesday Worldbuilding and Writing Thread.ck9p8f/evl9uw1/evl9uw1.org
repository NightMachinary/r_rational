The year is 21XX. Artificial Intelligence and Robotics have advanced tremendously, and almost all menial professions are fully automated. Sometime in the 21st century, the rise of automation caused a worldwide economic collapse as too many blue-collar workers, and those in the service industries, were replaced by machines, and the societies of the developed world became unstable. But the world recovered, not by removing all automation, but by pushing it to its limit -- now, everything is automated, from manufacturing to farming to cooking, all of it overseen by semi-autonomous artificial intelligences that can quickly repair anything that breaks. The developed world has transitioned into a post-scarcity society, with the second and third worlds quickly catching up with the help of automation.

Humanity is now served by machines. The colonization of Venus and Mars is in the early stages, as machines guided by passionate humans and artificial intelligences build early colonies and begin the long processes of terraforming necessary to create an environment for sustainable life. Back on Earth, almost anyone can get a machine to do almost any/thing/ - “build this house”, “cook me this food”, “design this in this way”, etc. But the machines are bereft of any creativity (A true human-like Strong AI is as yet an unsolved problem), leaving humans a niche left to fill.

How is society structured in this new world? How do people find meaning in their lives? What replaced the concept of “work”? How have government structures adapted? Are they still run by humans, and to what extent?

--------------

My idea was that society has broken into a few distinct social classes, based on what people choose to do with their lives:

- The Creator class, people who create art, stories, videos, games, music, etc. that other people can enjoy. Also includes people who ply trades just for the personal fulfillment of doing so, such as cooking or woodworking.

- The Explorer class, people who, assisted by machines, do scientific and cultural research that AI just can't. Of course, machines help where they can, making such research much easier and faster to perform.

- The Consumer class, people who don't contribute actively to society but simply consume the things created by the other classes. There's always more media to consume, after all.

This would then lend itself to a story of class conflict and an exploration of the human psyche and the extent to which humans require stimulation, and how social structure and social interaction have been changed by these new technologies. But I'm having trouble both coming up with ideas, and convincing myself that this is a sufficiently rational exploration of this premise. Would love to get some feedback/thoughts.
