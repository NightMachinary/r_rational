So a perennial problem I have with writing a story is starting them. Specifically, writing a hook to instantly grab a reader and make them want to read more. The problem is, I can't currently tell whether a hook is good or bad without posting the story, and I'm hesitant to post stories if I don't know people will fall for my hooks (because I tend to quickly abandon stories that don't get attention, and then feel like shit for disappointing the few interested readers I did have.)

So can anyone give me advice on hook-writing technique? I've included a few sample hooks I recently wrote. I'm not looking for specific feedback on a hook-by-hook basis, so much as I need more general advice. It would also be useful to know which hooks work and which hooks don't. (And of course, I can do the same approve/disapprove thing for anyone who needs it, so just reply to me with your own story snippets.)
