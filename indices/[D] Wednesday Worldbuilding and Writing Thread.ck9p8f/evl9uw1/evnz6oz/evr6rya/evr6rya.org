From most to least effective: 2 3 4 1 5 (in my opinion). #5's first sentence seemed too long, so splitting it into a few shorter sentences is worth considering.

To be honest, I probably don't worry about hooks as much as I should. Even so: starting to write can be a sticking point, so if I were you I'd just not worry about the hook at all until after you've written the story. I've had luck looking for the first 'interesting' part of my story and cutting or moving everything that I wrote before it.

An example from yesterday:

#+begin_quote
  “Hello, Inquisitor,” she said. “Are you here to grant them permission to burn me?”
#+end_quote

That's much better than my original:

#+begin_quote
  The first thing he had noticed about her was her controlled expression.
#+end_quote
