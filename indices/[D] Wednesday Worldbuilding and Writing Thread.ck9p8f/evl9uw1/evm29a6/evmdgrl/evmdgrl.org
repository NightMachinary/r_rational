Somethings will still be scarce in the world you have created. I would imagine what conflict over those remaining scarce resources might look like. I think the biggest problem might be conflicting usage of the same resources.

For example, someone wants to build a place to live right next to the Yellowstone geysers. They like making rainbow-colored wooden cabins. Many people that visit the Yellowstone geysers do not like seeing this rainbow-colored wooden cabin right next to it. Who gets the resource?

That might feel like an easy one, you think 'well Yellowstone geysers are pretty unique so maybe we just leave that alone'. But what happens when someone wants to enjoy what New York City looked like a few centuries ago and they start ploughing down modern structures and replacing them with old structures just to look nice?

Land and locations will still be scarce and unique. How will they be allocated? Realize that whatever method you pick will likely still create some level of conflict.

Certain people will be more socially gifted than others. Interacting with them will become more valuable. There are already people in Hollywood that are essentially paid to be socialites. Researching them and what their lives are like might give you an insight into the "Socializer class" within the consumer class. New York City also apparently has a class of people like this, the wealthy highly intelligent wives of the rich men in the city.

Time will be scarce.

Effort and work ethic will be scarce. I imagine anyone in your story, even the most dedicated hard workers are going to look lazy in comparison to modern humans. Just as modern humans look pretty lazy compared to people two centuries ago. Farmers typically worked as long as they had daylight, 14 or 15 hour days with one day a week for rest (and only getting that rest day because it was a religious obligation). Nowadays 8 hours a day with two days of rest is the norm.

One reason why work is rarer, is that leisure is cheaper. If you are a worker and you have an option of working 4 extra hours for additional pay, or going home and staring at the clouds, you might choose the extra cash pretty often. If your alternative to working an additional four hours is that you can instead browse the internet (with all the fun shit it has to do) then you might be far less likely to take the additional hours.

As the amount of entertainment expands, and the price of that entertainment goes down, everyone is faced with the same decision of trading off unpleasant work with pleasant leisure activities. Your world is set up in such a way that they don't even how to do /any/ of the unpleasant work bits.

You could theoretically reach a point where almost no one is creating new works of art. Because they can spend their entire lifetime just consuming the art of others. I am currently writing a story in a small subgenre (gamelit). Part of why I am writing is that I run out of new stories to read or run out of good stories to read, and writing kinda scratches that itch. If I was born thirty years later, and there was already a lifetime of content accumulated in this genre, I'm not sure I would have ever bothered to start writing.

I also believe that working hard to get something done is a muscle that people develop. Hard work and a good work ethic is a habit that one has to practice. Playing sports or doing chores as a kid is a good way to develop that habit early. If robots are doing all physical chores then fewer people are going to develop that habit when they are young. They'll be more likely to be consumers when they get older.

The people that work hard will be an aberration. They might even be treated as if they have a mental disorder. If hard workers become a tiny minority (less than 1% of the population) then it is increasingly likely that what separated them from everyone else is an actual mental disorder. Artists in today's world are already comprised of a bunch of mentally heterogeneous people.

I think the challenge of writing a post scarcity story will be to make the conflicts seem interesting and meaningful. If two angels are having a competition in heaven, it doesn't really matter who wins. The worst that happens to the loser is that he is in paradise after losing a meaningless contest.
