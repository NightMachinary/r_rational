  How is society structured in this new world? How do people find meaning in their lives? What replaced the concept of “work”?
#+end_quote

Regarding structure, it sounds like you're probably describing a democratic communist technocracy. The state has seized the means of production, guarantees everyone a minimum standard of living, guarantees universal employment, and pushes heavily for all remaining vestiges of "work" to be automated away.

Regarding how people find meaning, that's easy. Progress. Keep systematically automating the most boring and unpleasant tasks that still face humanity and the remaining work will increasingly become just a form of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs][self-actualization]].

Regarding "work", that would obviously still be around, but it would no longer be a necessary evil that has to be maintained so that workers can avoid becoming homeless and impoverished. Instead, it would be merely a societal nuisance to be eradicated at every opportunity.
