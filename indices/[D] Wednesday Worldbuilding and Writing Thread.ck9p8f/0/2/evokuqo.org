I could see there being conflict over going fully for colonizing other planets and using every possible resource to its fullest vs conservationists/environmentalists who want to preserve resources not because they need to be (because that's probably not an issue now) but because the alternative is humanity eradicating everything that doesn't serve it enough.

Also, AI probably could generate entertaining media at that point, given that AI can write almost coherent text now via GPT-2. It would lack creativity, but it would probably be just as good as like a second rate sitcom.

Maybe think more about the transitionary point to try and develop the culture? Like, if AI was good enough to automate away 90% of work tomorrow, how would the world change? It probably wouldn't be as utopia-like to begin with.
