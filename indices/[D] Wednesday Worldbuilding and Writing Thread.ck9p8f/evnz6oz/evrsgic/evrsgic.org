I don't have anything better than item-by-item reviews. But my ranking: 5, 1, 4, 2, 3.

5 immediately sets up a conflict, teases at a setting, and places the PoV character in that setting's conflict. It's short, to the point, and grabs my attention. (I'd called => I called)

1: "like the final tumbler in a lock" I think is an odd turn of phrase and is a little jarring, but again... setting, conflict, introduction. Short and gets me interested in reading what follows.

4 could work well with some changes; I'm really not a fan of present tense, and overall it seems to indicate a genre I wouldn't have much interest in. Just my personal opinion.

My main gripe on 2 is the technical quality of the writing. The repetition of "the king" and use of "reached up" is ick and turns me off from reading further. Here's my take on improving it (which would put it #1 on my list, but I'm not biased or anything):

“How many men were sacrificed to make these?” The king weighed the cloth pouch in one hand.

Maria sighed. “None, my lord. It is simply a variety of bread mold.”

He clasped her shoulder with his free hand. “Maria. My hands are already covered in blood. You do not need to preserve my conscience, although I appreciate the gesture. How many men were sacrificed?”

3... I look at the wordy paragraphs and already it's a chore to skim the first one. I see some purple sentences, and you've already lost me.
