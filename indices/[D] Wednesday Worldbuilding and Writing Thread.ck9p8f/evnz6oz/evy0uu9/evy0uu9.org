I recommend checking out [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGOodOMBYVk][Brandon Sanderson's lecture on description and viewpoint from Jordancon 2010]], which he specifically describes as being about writing the first page in a way that will get the attention of an editor (or reader).

Some salient points from the first several minutes as he lays out a few general principles:

- "Page 1 is about two things, when it comes to science fiction and fantasy. Number one, being able to describe and worldbuild in a way that does not infodump and bore the reader, and number two, about being able to do viewpoint and voice in a way that is engaging and evocative without boring the reader."
- A good opening sentence isn't just good "in a vacuum," it should lead into whatever the rest of the opening scene is going to be. (Bearing that in mind, it may be hard for people to offer critiques of your work without more context.) A zinger of an opening that doesn't tie into the rest of the opening scene often feels like a non-sequitor and can actually be counter-productive, as it sets up expectations that you're not going to meet: "Creative writing classes talk about the need to hook the reader, and writers have an exaggerated sense of what they have to do to hook the reader. ... I see this in new writers' writing sometimes. They obsess so much about that opening sentence, so much that you end up reading twenty stories by new writers that all have to begin with something like, 'The world exploded that day,' and then the rest of the chapter has nothing to do with that. ... You do want to capture the reader's interest in your first line or first paragraph. But capturing readers' interest is different from saying something that absolutely has to be a zinger. If you've read my book Elantris, I have zingers at the beginning of the first three chapters, and I think they may actually be too much. ... Maybe that zinger is drawing way too much attention to itself." (The opening line of Elantris reads: "Prince Raoden of Arelon awoke early that morning, completely unaware that he had been damned for all eternity.")
- Introduce conflict as quickly as possible: "You do not have to introduce the main conflict of the book in this opening scene, but you do want to introduce /a/ conflict where something is going wrong. A struggle will immediately start to build sympathy for a character. And you want to do this with as little backstory as is necessary."
- "You want to start with motion or conflict. You want to start with something going wrong. Note that when we say 'motion or conflict,' we do not necessarily mean a fight. ... A fight is often a bad hook." Conflicts are only as interesting as the people that they happen to, which is why opening on action can sometimes be a poor hook. Simply describing a series of punches and kicks can be boring if we haven't yet given a reason to care about the characters.

Bearing all of that in mind:

#+begin_quote
  I was king.
#+end_quote

This strikes me as a bad opening sentence. It is a statement describing the state of the world, rather than describing an event. You can tell this, because the verb in this sense is "was." Try to avoid any form of "to be," because it means that you're just stating static facts, rather than describing things in motion.

To comment more on this selection:

#+begin_quote
  The king reached up to clasp her shoulder. “My hands are already covered in blood. You do not need to preserve my conscience, although I appreciate the gesture. How many men were sacrificed?”
#+end_quote

Later in the lecture (I think around the 30 minute mark), Sanderson gets into a discussion of what he describes as "the pyramid of abstraction." In the pyramid of abstraction, abstract items are at the top (least abundant), and concrete items are at the bottom (most abundant, laying the foundation). In fantasy, we get to spend time soliloquizing about honor, and justice, and sacrifice, but we have to /earn/ those moments, largely by laying the foundation with lots of concrete description. This, to me, feels like an un-earned soliloquy, or something resembling it. It's the kind of thing that is only as interesting as the man saying it, and I have no idea who this man is. Rather than hearing his speech about the nature of sacrifice, I might like to read something about how he just learned about the deaths of several men, and how this fact hit him like a punch to the gut. I'd like to follow along as he tries not to let the pain show on his face, even as he feels his stomach clench. Perhaps then you might follow with a bit of context about how this bad news was unexpected (because the mission had gone sideways), or completely expected (because the king had knowingly sent them off to perform a dangerous mission).

I think that you describe a lot of actions that don't really have meaning. For example:

#+begin_quote
  The king reached up to clasp her shoulder.
#+end_quote

This just describes a physical action taking place. This is how an impartial observer who knows nothing about the intent of the characters might describe the scene. The viewpoint is, presumably, /not/ that of an impartial observer; in fact we are getting things from the perspective of a character who /does/ know the intent behind the action (if this is a third-person limited POV from the king's perspective), and so we could get that additional insight. Is he placing a hand on her shoulder to comfort her? I assume that's the case. If he placed a hand on her shoulder to comfort her, the physical placement of hand on shoulder is the /least/ interesting part of the act; as a reader, my attention would be more on the fact that he was trying to offer her comfort, and yet here I'm reading about the physical actions of the characters and not their emotional state.

Even after reading the entire opening, I'm unsure of what the king's emotional state really is. Is he a cold, calculating, pragmatic bastard, plainly stating that he's aware of the blood that's been spilled in his name, and unfazed by the fact that blood continues to be spilled? Or is he saying it with a sense of sorrowful remorse, a man deeply regretting the lives that have been lost, and wondering if he's beyond salvation? The king's feelings are probably the most important part of this scene. If this is a third-person limited POV from the king's perspective, the "narrator" should have perfectly accurate insight into the king's emotional state. It would be nice to see that reflected on the page. Oh, and I'm not even sure if the king is the POV character. If it's actually Maria who is the POV character, I'd like to know about /her/ emotional state. If the king's mood is supposed to be inscrutable to our viewpoint character, how does the viewpoint character feel about that?
