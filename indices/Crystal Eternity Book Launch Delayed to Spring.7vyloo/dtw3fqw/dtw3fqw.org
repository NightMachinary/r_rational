Hey I know a lot of people here have been waiting for the last book in the Crystal Society trilogy and it was meant to be released in December or January. It was February when I remembered about the book and went to look for news. So I'm cross-posting to the announcement about the delay for anyone else who forgot about the wonderful series.
