Don't "you" have to observe it for the wavefunction to collapse ""relative"" to /you/ though? So from the perspective of yourself, doesn't it effectively require your "observation"? (Or rather, the particle interacting with you in some way, which could be very similar to "observation" although actual conscious perception is certainly not required for some not entirely unreasonable definition of which set of interacting particles count as "you")

Which is to say, yes, any two things interacting collapse wavefunctions, but from the perspective of "you", things do have to interact with you to collapse.

(your complaint is quite right, I guess I'm just trying to explain and justify the whole "observer" thing as making a certain sense from an egocentric / observer centric perspective. It's kind of like saying that the sun and the earth and the rest of the galaxy rotate around me in particular...it's technically true from my frame of reference)
