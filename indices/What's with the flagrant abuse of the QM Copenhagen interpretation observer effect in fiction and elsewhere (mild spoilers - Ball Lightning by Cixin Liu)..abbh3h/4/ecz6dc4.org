The concept of the observer is kind of a fuzzy concept in the CI. The closest thing to a rigorous definition of the "observer" is something like "when the +system involves so many particles that the state vector+ state vector is so complex it can't remain coherent", but what's "too +many particles+ complex" is never defined, and some variants really do privilege consciouness. It's really very handwavey.

There's only one work of science fiction I've seen that actually does a decent job of depending on the CI in a way that doesn't break the suspension of disbelief for me, and that's /Quarantine/ by Greg Egan.

Spoiler! In /Quarantine/ the collapse is something that happens in a specific structure in the brains of higher primates, and it gave them a competitive advantage over brains that depended on an extended un-collapsed (multiple-world-interpretation) state. Before this structure evolved, the state vector never actually collapsed.

There's a lot of handwavium involved here, but you can't spell "Copenhagen Interpretation" without waving your hands around a lot, and if you don't try and overanalyse it it's really a great schtick.
