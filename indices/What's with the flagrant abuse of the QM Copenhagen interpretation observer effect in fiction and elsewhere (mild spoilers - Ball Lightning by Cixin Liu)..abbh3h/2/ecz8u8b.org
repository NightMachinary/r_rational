It's not that simple, I believe. When a particle is in a superposition (e.g. an atom is decayed and not decayed as in the Schr√∂dinger's cat set up) and we send another particle there to probe it, then QM first of all says that our test particle is now in a superposition as well: one part of the superposition interacted with the decayed atom and the other with the not-decayed atom.

However, we only ever observe one result. So the question is: at which point does the "wave function" (or the superposition) collapse? The Copenhagen interpretation doesn't give an answer to this. It just says that the collapse happens at some point before the experimenter observes it. People used to think that only atoms and at most molecules can be in superposition, but scientists are managing to get bigger and bigger things into superposition.

So it's not that strange that some people say that it is [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Wigner_interpretation][consciousness that is causing the collapse]]. I guess they're arguing that consciousness always seems to us to be not in superposition but everything else can be, or something like that. The overwhelming majority of physicists doesn't think that though.

(Of course, if you grant that objects of every size can be in a superposition (even humans) then this problem goes away and you have arrived at the many worlds interpretation. In the many worlds interpretation, every possible outcome of the quantum measurement is observed by a "copy" of the experimenter in another "world". Which is to say the experimenter is in a superposition of having observed the decayed atom and not having observed it. The two superpositions then continue to lead their own merry lives.)
