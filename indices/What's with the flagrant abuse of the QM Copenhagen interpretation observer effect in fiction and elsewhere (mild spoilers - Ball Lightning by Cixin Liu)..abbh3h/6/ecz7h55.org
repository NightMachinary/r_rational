People are just... stupid and uncritical. Lot's of people are still running around with the idea that the human mind is somehow privileged and special (if you want a taste of that, discuss some of it with friends of friends, like your parents friends). So they see the science guy use the word "observe" and OH! that's what people do! Or they see other people say that the observer is an actual person, and just go "yeah, that seems right."

I mean, if people aren't fundamentally stupid, how come every thread about technology has people complaining about boomers just absolutely not getting it. Hell, people in our own generations can't follow along with the simple rules for computers. Look at how many don't believe in climate change, or believe in trickle down, or any of a hundred thousand stupid, harmful ideas.
