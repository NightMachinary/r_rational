  An experiment performed in 1987 [39][40] produced results that demonstrated that information could be obtained regarding which path a particle had taken without destroying the interference altogether. This showed the effect of measurements that disturbed the particles in transit to a lesser degree and thereby influenced the interference pattern only to a comparable extent.

There's nothing magic going on here. What happens is simply that measuring disturbs the system. If you disturb it less, it acts closer to the unperturbed version. If you disturb it more, you lose the interference, because it's a delicate effect.
