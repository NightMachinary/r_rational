This may be a more helpful explanation, or it may muddy the whole thing. Oh well:

Imagine you have an automated turret defense system. Every morning you check the grounds in the distance and one day you find bullets everywhere. Based on how your system is set up and where the bullet holes are you can get some information about the intruder.

Your observers are the bullets. Your observed particle is the intruder. Yes, it will change it's behavior in response to being "observed" via machine gun fire. But it's not thinking about how you'll know its movements from the bullet patterns it's thinking about not getting shot (or in quantum mechanics, bouncing around because of the impacts, being pushed around by the various forces/fields being generated around it, and so on).

Incidentally, if your story doesn't have intelligent Gods observing everything all the time but relies on the intelligent observer excuse it's not a rational story. It's not internally consistent because life as we know it would never have a chance to form if stuff teleported around all the time.

If it does have an intelligent God watching everything, and someone has discovered a way to make God look away for a moment to create magic I want to read it.
