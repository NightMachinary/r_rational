In general, we say quantum mechanics tends to approximate to classical mechanics if Planck's constant goes to zero. This is best seen if you cast quantum mechanics in the form of path integrals, in which case a particle will travel across /all/ possible paths it can take, weighed by the exponential of the imaginary unit times the classical action (aka the integral of the Lagrangian along the path) divided by the Planck constant, h. In the limit of h going to zero, all paths except the one of /minimal/ action contribute in ways that wildly oscillate and cancel each other. The minimal action path is the classical path.
