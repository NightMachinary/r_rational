  But particles could collide during anything right?

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-zXT5bIBM0#t=33s][It doesn't have to be a particle]]. It can also be a force. And it doesn't have to be a collision, it could also be an absorption. The core idea is that to observe the quantum system you need to interact with it physically in some fashion, and that interaction causes the collapse.

  The particles don't have to be from observation, do they?

No. But usually when we do things like the single electron double slit experiment, we are placing the system in isolation so the quantum effects don't get drowned out by noise. So there is only /an/ electron going through the slits and nothing else. The observer effect is the observation that, even in such ideal circumstances, you would still change the outcome by observation due to the requirement of physically interacting with the particle to observe it.
