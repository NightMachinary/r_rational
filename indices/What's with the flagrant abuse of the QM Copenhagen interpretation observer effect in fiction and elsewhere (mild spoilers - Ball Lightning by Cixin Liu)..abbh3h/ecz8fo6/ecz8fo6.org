The heisenberg uncertainty principle is totally unrelated to the observer effect. Your explanation here

#+begin_quote
  The reason it's impossible to know the position AND momentum of a quantum scale object is that in order to measure this information it is necessary to bounce a photon or similar particle off the quantum scale object, which will change its position and momentum in unknowable ways. (Rough paraphrase from memory.)

is /wildly/ off base, not just "you misremembered a bit" but on the level of "why do you think gravity is caused by air pressure"; it's a misconception which is corrected by the third paragraph of the wikipedia article on it. The reason the uncertainty principle exists is because momentum and position are [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementarity_(physics)][complementary]], and such uncertainty is simply a property of all wave-like systems, rather than caused by some other quantum mechanical effect.

Sorry if this seems rude, I'm just kinda confused as to why you mentioned the uncertainty principle at all. The rest of the post is mostly correct, yeah, the role of observation in quantum mechanics is misinterpreted /wildly/ and sometimes maliciously. There was even an april fools' joke related to HPMOR to this effect, where someone set up a website with a similar-at-a-glance URL to HPMOR's and added a paragraph to a chapter about how observation is done by conscious beings.
