  The reason it's impossible to know the position AND momentum of a quantum scale object is that in order to measure this information it is necessary to bounce a photon or similar particle off the quantum scale object, which will change its position and momentum in unknowable ways. (Rough paraphrase from memory.)

This is the Heisenberg uncertainty principle not the observer effect. Also it's the layman explanation for the uncertainty principle that isn't technically correct. Even if we had a magical non-interacting measurement stick, and measured the particle with our measurement stick, we still would only be able to find position and momentum to within the exactness specified by the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle is an inherent property of the wave-like nature of matter in our reality - it's not something you can "clever" your way around.

  It is my understanding that the observer in the Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum mechanics is not a human or a camera, it is when a photon or other similar particle (a fast electron, etc.) interacts with whatever we are measuring that its waveform collapses and it is "observed". No conscious minds required.

Yes. This is correct.

  And if my understanding IS right, why do people, apparently even scientists, keep on mentioning completely unrelated things like human consciousness when what's really going on is so simple to explain?

"Seeing things changes the result" is a simple meme people can digest.

"Particles colliding during observation causes wave functions to collapse and thereby changes the result"

"What's a wave function?"

"An equation describing the quantum state of an isolated quantum system"

"What's a quantum state?"

"A vector that encodes all information about the current state of the system such that probability distributions for observables can be extracted"

"What's a vector? What's a probability distribution? What's an observable?"

".....seeing things changes the result!"

"oh ok"
