I finished Wintersteel, book 8 of the Cradle series. It redeems the 7th book in a good way and was really satisfying to read. Not very rational but enjoyable nonetheless.

I'm looking for some enjoyable M/F romances, especially from the male pov. This seems like a subgenre that's both pretty rare and rarely well done. The only stories I've found that have done this well would be Alexander Wales' Worth the Candle and Robin Hobb's Fitz series.

Also question, have any of you guys read LE Modesitt Jr.'s works? He seems pretty prolific and some people from [[/r/fantasy][r/fantasy]] called his works rational, so I'm wondering how you guys see his works.
