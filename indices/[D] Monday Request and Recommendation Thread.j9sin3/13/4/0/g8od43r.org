Aren't their powers not unique though? One of the characters states that it used to be more common for sacred artists below Archlord to manifest the powers of a Sage, Sage badges used to be an additional badge along with denoting their Lord level.

I've seen some discussion on the Cradle sub, and another lore bit mentioned was that paths used to be a lot riskier, but with more opportunity and uniqueness. This is also backed up by how lots of artists follow a set path instead of trailblazing like the MCs, which is much riskier and also more rewarding. This is further backed up in Soulsmith when we see the differences between Lindon's Iron Body and the Iron Body ritual of a “super talented” child of the Sandviper clan. That child only took 1 drop of venom of a Sandviper, and it was still a worry as to whether it was too much, whereas Lindon took 5 whole Sandvipers worth of venom and was seconds away from death. On present day there's a lot less risk and reward in advancing, with Paths set in stone, which explains the lack of Underlord and Overlord Sages.

There's precedent for lower advancement Lord stages to also become Sages, and with Lindon's journey and his willpower, I don't think his Sage advancement was unreasonable or unique.

You're right in that Yerin's power up is unique and unseen on Cradle before, though. I do feel it's not unreasonable though, there are so many cases of unique power ups on Cradle, like Sophara roided up beyond belief and Yan Shoumei's Blood Shadow having conceptual strength like that of a Herald while only being at Underlord. Yerin herself has the precedent of the Sage of Red Faith, with the crucial difference of not being an evil, selfish asshole, allowing her to advance without complications and giving her precedence for her advancement.
