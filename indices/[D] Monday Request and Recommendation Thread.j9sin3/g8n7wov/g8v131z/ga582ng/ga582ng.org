I remember reading a comment by you where you stated that you wouldn't recommend (or not recommend) “The Waves Arisen” because some people may interpret that as a sign you wrote it.

Did you change your mind on that stance or do you make exceptions for works with disclosed authors? If it's the latter, do you have any recommendations I should check out (assume I am reasonably familiar with both the popular works in this sub and your blog)?
