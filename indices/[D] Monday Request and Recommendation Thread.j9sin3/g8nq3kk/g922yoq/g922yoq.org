I tried Just An Average Voice In Your Head (A Jumpchain/Original Quest), and the protag has a weird unreal disposition. And the eldritch horror is rather uncool. There seemed to be some bad element of metafiction as well: The eldritch being was said to be "restricted" (and other such stuff) by a "meddler" which seemed to mean the author. It felt like bad writing to me.
