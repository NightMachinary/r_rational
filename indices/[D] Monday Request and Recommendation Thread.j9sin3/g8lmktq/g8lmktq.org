There's a [[https://blindsight.space/][Blindsight short film]] out now.

It's honestly more like a Blindsight /trailer/, and I was more fascinated by the "making of" portion of the website, but I don't, like, regret the mere five minutes of my life that it took to watch the film, which did have some good bits in it (I guess I was mostly underwhelmed because I never realized, for all the years I was following its development, that the film would be this trailer-like).
