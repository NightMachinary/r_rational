That's the main conceit of xianxia, and its main failing, imo; the exponential gulf of power between advancement realms means that one should /always/ lose when fighting someone a realm above, let alone 2 or more. Fighting against higher cultivation enemies then becomes an easy way for the author to produce narrative tension, but winning then has to be used sparingly, or else it cheapens the foundation of the xianxia genre: power scaling.

In Cradle the author has used the "defeating a higher cultivation enemy" trope so much that it feels contrived. Every single book of his features it in one form or another. Another annoying trope he overuses is having the MC power up mid fight against someone of higher cultivation that they were losing against(happens like 3x in Wintersteel!). Also notice how strong artifacts and treasures are when Lindon uses it to scrape by a narrow victory(books 1, 2, 4, 5, 6) against someone of higher cultivation, but how they are either completely absent from all their enemies fighting styles, or ineffectual.
