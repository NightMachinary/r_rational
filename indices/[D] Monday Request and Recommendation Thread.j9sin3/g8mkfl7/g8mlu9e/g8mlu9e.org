Read some of his books in high school. I'd say they're pretty basic and tropy. Would only recommend a look if you're scraping the barrel for fantasy. Check out Abercrombie, Martin, Butcher, Le Guin, Zelazny, Erikson, and maybe Sanderson and Jordan first if you haven't already. On the other hand, if you're curious, I say go for it---they're not the worst by any means.
