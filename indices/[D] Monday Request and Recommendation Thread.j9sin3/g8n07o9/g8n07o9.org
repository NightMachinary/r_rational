Looking for more competence porn!

A few weeks ago I asked for this and got some SUPER great recommendations: [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/slouching-towards-nirvana-worm-my-hero-academia.863129/page-234#post-70637378][Slouching towards nirvana]], [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/i-just-love-killin-worm-rick-and-morty-crossover.446513/][I just love killing]]. And through these found some more sick ones: [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/my-trans-dimensional-overpowered-protagonist-harem-comedy-is-wrong-as-expected-oregairu-danmachi.367903/][My Trans-Dimensional, Overpowered Protagonist, Harem Comedy is Wrong, as Expected]], [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/hive-daughter-worm-x-40k.49148/][Hive Daughter]], [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/i-woke-up-as-a-dungeon-now-what-dungeon-worm.620521/page-577#post-70189664][I woke up as a dudgeon now what?]]

Note most of these are worm crossovers. I think I had enough crossovers in the worm universe (I start feeling awkward when I read about too many versions of the same character) but don't mind Taylor going other places, Either way, more recs like these please! And I rec them too:

Anything where the MC is COMPETENT and it shows. Note: I've read or tried most things from the first 4 pages of best rated in RR and all the normally recommended rat fiction here unless its new.

Thanks!

edit: More recs are "A young woman's political record", [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/battle-action-harem-highschool-side-character-quest-no-sv-you-are-the-waifu.15335/page-28][Battle Action Harem Highschool comedy]],
