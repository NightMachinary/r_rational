Here's some recs, none of whom are worm crossovers. I'm only familiar with Transdim, AYWPR, and BAHHCSCQ of those listed, so my recommendations here are mostly based off knowing you like those + your description.

The vorkosigan saga is great. I general, I recommend reading it in chronological order, which starts at "Falling Free." However, while the first books are good, the main reason I would label this series as fitting this request is Miles Vorkosigan. As such, you might instead want to start at "The Warrior's Apprentice." This is also a pretty organic starting point for the series.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dungeon-keeper-ami-sailor-moon-dungeon-keeper-story-only-thread.30066/][Dungeon Keeper Ami]] Is an amazing version of this. Very surprised you haven't already been recommended it. Requires little knowledge of canon settings but might benefit from it for some jokes if you have it. I read it completely blind and was fine.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35875/yashima-chronicles][Yashima Chronicles]] Is a similar style of story to political record, by the same author; if that fits your bill, this probably will too.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20721824/chapters/49228244][Santize]] Might also fit here. It's a Warring States! naruto fanfic, but does not require much knowledge of the series. Modern Medical knowledge in a preindustrial society.

A Certain Scientific Accelerator is an anime that does a good version of this, but I'm not sure how well it stands alone if you aren't familiar of the work it's a spinoff from, and A Certain Magical Index does not really fit this trope. You might be able to get by with substituting the AU fanfic [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/864249/chapters/1657513][in memoriam]] for the original series, since it is competent protagonist story with excellent writing (it's been recommended here a few times I believe?) but I was familiar with the series so I can't guarantee it.
