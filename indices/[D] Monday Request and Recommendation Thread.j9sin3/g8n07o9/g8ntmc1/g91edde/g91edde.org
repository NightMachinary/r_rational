  The Rage of Dragons has a shonen protagonist, kinda. The training montages are awesome and the battles are really satisfying.

A completely correct description and it's awesome. Also I found the book to be a genuine page turner. I had something to do the day after but it basically forced me to read it, fully, deep into the night. And I didn't even regret it.
