I would like to second the Cradle recommendation. I /think/ it fits what you're looking for. The characters are as competent as they can be at any given moment and I feel as though the story progresses quickly enough that you'd be satisfied with it.

The protagonist has a tendency to barely scrape by but it is due to his competence rather than luck. This increases a lot at book 4 or 5 I believe. And the great point about it is that there is an increasing number of competent characters. The latest book has some amazing scenes where the characters are all achieving their goals in fun different ways.

I really enjoy the strategizing the characters do. In fact, I enjoy Cradle so much that I'd be willing to buy the first 3 books for you.
