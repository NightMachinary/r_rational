huh, maybe... I assumed at first the definition of Mary Sue was a character who wins everything for no reason: which is definitely not what I am after, but after checking that the definition is "unrealistically lacking in flaws or weaknesses", I would disagree with the unrealistically part, but yes. A competent character would lack flaws and weaknesses in the specific area they are competent in- or figure out/learn ways to mitigate them.

So a realistic Mary Sue I guess ;p
