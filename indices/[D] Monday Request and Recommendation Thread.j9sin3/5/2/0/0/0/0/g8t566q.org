In that case, the only ones that fit your description are Vlad Taltos, Black Company, and King's Dark Tidings. Other than the last one, they all start in media res, so there's no slow build up to power (although there /is/ a slow build up to the conflict).

In Vlad Taltos, Vlad /does/ gain power throughout the series, but it's never something that he's desperately looking for (except for one of his early life books imo). Each book is a different genre, so you get a mixed bag of stuff. Vlad himself is fallible, and he has humane flaws, but he is very competent. You'll have to figure out for yourself if you like that. I'd recommend at least giving the first book a try, since it's pretty short and a fun romp.

In Black Company, the protagonist is Croaker, a historian and medic of the Company itself. There's not much development of most people's powers, just how they use their current power to solve their problems. The Company itself is very competent, but Croaker's narration of it tends more towards romantic than realistic. However, it's not so much a book about people competently solving problems as it is a meditation on a soldier's life in a mercenary company that's mostly evil.
