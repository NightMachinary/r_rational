Interesting, can I add a few more requirements and let me know if any of these fit:

1. Not really interested in the slow build-up. I don't really understand why people enjoy the hero's journey. It was great the first 10 or so times where I actually learnt something and could relate, but only the end-game-content excites me now. Mostly interested in stories where the protagonist is at the end-game already, or is very close. Most of the recommendations I gave start with characters which have completed 95% of their development from the start and are already super competent from the start.
2. Not interested in stories where the MC has contrived unrealistic challenges. E.g. I hate constantly scaling crisis/antagonists. They should be the same from the start, and what changes is just how much influence the MC can have, like IRL.
3. Don't enjoy stories where the MC barely scrapes by (usually) due to luck. This is what I mean by competence porn, the MC is pretty much never stressed because they have an answer (or can come up with one, or are prepared) for whatever they undertake.

Any of those fit these criteria?
