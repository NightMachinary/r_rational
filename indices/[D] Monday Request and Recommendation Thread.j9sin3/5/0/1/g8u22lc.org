KJ Parker is underappreciated.

My favourite work of theirs is The Fencer's first book, where all trials are settled via proxy duels to the death. Cue one grizzled swords-barrister, just a week from retirement, being pressed into service as in charge of defending the city from barbarian siege.

It's probably the closest of their stuff to bog standard fantasy, but personally I appreciate narrative convention in most of my fiction.
