I have checked it out and want to offer some PSA.

This should have some trigger warnings for rather graphic torture (in the latest chapter as of writing [19]). Apart from that, I think what is written for now suffers from a rather bad combination: an at the very least mentally stunted MC and very little agency on his part.

Spoilers ahead:

That he hasn't even tried to experiment with his powers already seemed like a bad sign, but okay, the guy just survived a nuclear bomb so he's probably in shock. But then, he gets out with his new hunter team and in the first outing everyone dies except him. So what does he, a mutant looking being who just arrived in town and just led an entire veteran(ish) team to their deaths, do? Obviously return to the same town and expect that nothing bad will happen to him. I just stopped reading at that point, and from what I skimmed from the next chapter it was just the MC being tortured for his stupidity
