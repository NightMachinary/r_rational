I agree that it's certainly not a decision that would've yielded best results, but as far as I could tell, he didn't have any other options.

Spoiler:

That was the only civilization that he knew about close by, and he doesn't really have any survival skills to speak of. It definitely turned out bad for him, but I think you're vastly underestimated the social aspect to it. Wander around for who knows how long, with who knows what else out there? With, like you said, not a great grasp on his powers. Or, take a reasonable chance and go back to the place with people, information, food, etc. Especially when there was no indication that those events would happen. I will; however, strongly agree he needs to play around with his powers more and have more agency. It's been too long in a world where he needs to get a grasp on these things, and he's just kind of muddling through. He probably would've had an easier time if he did as well. Maybe this will be his motivator for progressing.
