Consider Phlebas is perhaps the least Culture-y Culture book, to the point that people frequently recommend that new readers start with the second book, Player of Games, instead. I personally enjoyed starting with Consider Phlebas as I didn't know any better, because then you have better context for the later novels, but if I were recommending the series to someone, i would be considering if I should say ‘start here, it's different but I enjoyed it this way', or ‘read book 2 and then go back if you like the series later on but are up for something different.'
