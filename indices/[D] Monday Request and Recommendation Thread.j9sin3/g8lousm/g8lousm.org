Well its the season of Halloween here and I was just wondering if anyone had some horror movie or book recommendations where the characters are logical and don't make any stupid decisions. Some of my own to get things started:

The Final Girls (2015 horror comedy) The main character's mother has just died and in an effort to remember she goes to watch a classic horror slasher film that is a thin parody of Friday the 13th where her mother was the final girl. After a strange accident, she and her friends find themselves stuck in the movie. A funny deconstruction and logical chain of events follows as they try to survive the movie.

Eden Green by Fiona van Dahl - a rational horror novel where a character finds her friend has been infected by a strange parasite that has infected his body but made him immortal. Eden, the main character, is a self-styled rationalist, and her thought processes are shown in pain-staking detail. Whereas her friends treat everything as a big adventure or a true chance for ending death, Eden does her best (as an amateur) to apply scientific rationale to the symbiote and monsters. Trying to keep things secret and reacts with horror/disgust when she investigates the symbiotes. There is some body horror but most of the truly scary stuff is how it goes into exhaustive detail on how people's thought processes and consciousness change.

The promised neverland - a manga and later anime that is very rational and logical with a intricate strategies and mental battles. The first season/story arc anyway as the rest of the story never comes close to the first arc in my opinion. A orphanage of love where the children are raised and tested constantly to improve their intelligence. All goes well until a small group discover a horrifying truth about their world that I won't spoil as they tell it to you at the end of the first episode and chapter. But now with the horrible truth revealed, the children must figure out a way to escape the orphanage.
