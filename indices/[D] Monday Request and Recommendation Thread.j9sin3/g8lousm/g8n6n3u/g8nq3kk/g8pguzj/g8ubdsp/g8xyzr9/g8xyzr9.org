I recomended this some months back as well, while it was still being written. Today, while I agree that the story is still worth checking out, I feel like the second jump sadly experienced a marked drop in quality. Its pacing was absolutely terrible, with the first ninety percent mostly nothing happening and then suddenly a hasty finale. You can see the outlines of good ideas, but sadly the execution really wasn't up to par.

Also yes, don't read the author's notes. He is extremely sensitive and doesn't handle criticism. At all.
