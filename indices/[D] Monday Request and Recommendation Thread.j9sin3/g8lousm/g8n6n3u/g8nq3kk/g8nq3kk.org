Pretty much all jumpchain stories are just pure wish-fulfillment with minimal thought to plot. However, there are two stories that I have found to have taken the jumpchain concept and built a compelling narrative out of it. Which just proves the old writing proverb correct, "Good writers follow the rules to writing, great writers break them."

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/companion-chronicles-jumpchain-multicross-si-currently-visiting-breath-of-fire-iii.787978/][Companion Chronicles [Jumpchain/Multicross SI]]] - Instead of the story being from the perspective of a Gary-Sue protagonist, it's from the perspective of a companion who was brought into a Jumper's adventure basically on a whim and all of the realistic issues with come with gaining incredible power, finding out your world is a work of fiction, impossible situations, and being uncomfortably dependent on a near-stranger(s) for it. Reminiscent of Worth the Candle at times when it comes to meditating on the meta-narrative of various fictional worlds.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/just-an-average-voice-in-your-head-a-jumpchain-original-quest.817823/][Just An Average Voice In Your Head (A Jumpchain/Original Quest)]] - Just like the above story, the protagonist isn't the Jumper, but rather the poor, semi-insane girl who has to deal with being possessed by an ancient, eldritch Jumper. She...uh...grows up to be a very cheery person with disturbing beliefs and desires (nothing explicit in story, but she's like a friendly Bonesaw, so make of that what you will), set in a normal world, but then gets isekaied into a fantasy world. Predictably, the generic summoned to fight a Demon Lord goes immediately off tracks even before she is properly summoned with her high-school classmates.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8839309/chapters/20268301][Sleeping with the Girls]] - Not a jumpchain story at all, but the protagonist is stuck hopping through worlds where every time he falls asleep, he wakes up in a new fictional world next to his favorite female characters in anime. He is going to be one abused, sleep-deprived boy at the end of all of this nonsense. Recommended for how everyone reacts like real-life, fleshed out individuals while still retaining their personalities from their originating shows.

While I dislike jumpchains in general, I would love to read more stories that play around with the concept like the ones I recommended.
