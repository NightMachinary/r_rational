For those who prefer less forumy avenues, Onward to Providence is now available [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34353/onward-to-providence][on RoyalRoad]]. In addition to its original existence on [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/onward-to-providence-original-fiction.45926/][Sufficient Velocity]] and [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/onward-to-providence-original-fiction.616857/][Space Battles]].

It's really really good. It follows Pylo a shipmistress and communications expert (Such an expert she is capable of doing things like swearing infohazardously, translating taste-sensations, and flirting with abstract concepts like The Traditions of a people) and her adorable living ship Tunie, who thinks and communicates primarily in velocities and vectors and the like (including puns). Also some humans* I guess. Other excellent examples of the sort of incredibly alien aliens we see include: a micro-polity, a species that largely fills the ecological niche of accountants/clerks, information-based lifeforms, a species that naturally creates warheads and their ilk, and "trees" that are capable of turning into solid rocket boosters in order to proliferate.

Big-picture-wise it's largely concerned with how one deals with unknown unknowns (see: alien aliens, and their comparably alien societies and civilizations), how scale can /really/ fuck with you (there's an entire number system designed to be able to express planck-scale values alongside galactic+-scale values), and how those two things interact (the scale itself is what generates some of the alienness we encounter).
