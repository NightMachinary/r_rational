If you're okay with protagonist that take a while to get to a base level of competence, and then progress from there, you could try some published fiction. Cradle book 8 came out recently, and the whole series is about a cast of super competent characters (although they take a while to get to the level of competence).

Will Wight's House of Blades trilogy also has a really competent protagonist (later on), who works very hard to get to his level of competence.

The Red Rising series by Pierce Brown has a somewhat angsty but competent protagonist. He of course starts off weak, but his competence is shown pretty early on.

Kel Kade's King's Dark Tidings series has the world's best assassin learning to be human. He's very competent but emotionally stunted, and the book is about him slowly learning human emotions and morality. It's not /that/ serious and is mostly a humorous adventure.

The Rage of Dragons has a shonen protagonist, kinda. The training montages are awesome and the battles are really satisfying.

Vlad Taltos is about a human mafia leader and assassin in a world of super elfs, who rises to his position through ruthlessness and competence. Some moments are really funny too.

Glen Cook's Black Company series follows a somewhat evil mercenary band working for the Big Bad. Almost all characters are adults and competent, but not necessarily good (not even close lol). These are great books, highly recommend.

That's all I can think of off the top of my head.
