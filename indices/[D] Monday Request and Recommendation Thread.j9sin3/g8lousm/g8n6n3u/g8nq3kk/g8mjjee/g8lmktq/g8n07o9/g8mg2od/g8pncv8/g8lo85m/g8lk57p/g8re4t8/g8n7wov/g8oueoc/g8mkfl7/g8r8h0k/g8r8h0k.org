Believe I found a good recommendation: [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34623/apocalypse-man?review=822991#review-822991][Apocalypse Man]]. I would say rational, but possibly rational-adjacent.

Typical litRPG, but three things stood out enough for me to recommend people at least giving it a try. One, the System and how things work is different enough from others that I think it's interesting, and has a LOT of potential for future plot points. Two, grammar and style is great, this is was made an author that has a great handle on words and how they want to portray things. Three, the MC is certainly OP or under-powered - they very realistically are struggling through the world, learning their power, and just doing they best they can. No power creep so far and I don't see it happening anytime soon. Not only that, but they are pretty conspicuous, which is/will drive a lot of plot, which I think is different from the "normal-looking-person-but-but-with-hidden-strong-powers" trope.

I realize everybody's taste is subjective, but I think if you're just looking for something to check out or follow for potential, this is a good one. Almost 20 chapter so far, a few pretty long ones.
