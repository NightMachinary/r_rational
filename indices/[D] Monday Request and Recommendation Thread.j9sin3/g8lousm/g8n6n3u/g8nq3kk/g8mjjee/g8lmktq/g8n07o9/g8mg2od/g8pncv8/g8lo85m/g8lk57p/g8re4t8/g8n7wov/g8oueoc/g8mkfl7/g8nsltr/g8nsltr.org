An author that springs to mind is Lois McMaster Bujold. All her books tend to have very tender and genuine emotional connections between characters, but my favourite series of hers is the Vorkosigan Saga, an action-adventure space opera series. For your request I'd recommend two of her books, the first one of which is a kind of prequel with a different (female) protagonist to the rest, [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61900.Cordelia_s_Honor][Cordelia's Honor]], and has a strong romantic subplot. The second, [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61899.A_Civil_Campaign][A Civil Campaign]], is 10 books in and is, contrary to all its predecessors, pretty much a straight up romantic comedy. It has male protagonists. I read ACC many times since I was a teenager and it's still one of the funniest books I've ever read in my life.

Also, have you read any of Guy Gavriel Kay's books? They all tend to have a romantic subplot, and they all tend to range from good to great. All his books are set in analogues of historical nations. My favourites of his are, [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/49173-the-sarantine-mosaic][Sarantine Mosaic duology]], [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/104089.Tigana][Tigana]], [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/49379-the-fionavar-tapestry%20trilogy][Fionavar Tapestry]]. My one quibble is that IMO they all have similar themes and prose which makes them seem repetitive if you read too many, but not a concern unless you binge read his entire bibliography.
