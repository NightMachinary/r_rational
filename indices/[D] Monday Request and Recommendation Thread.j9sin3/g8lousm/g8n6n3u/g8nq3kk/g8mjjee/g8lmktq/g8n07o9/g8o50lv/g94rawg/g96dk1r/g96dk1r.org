Unfortunately read them all but In memoriam which I'll try and the book, which maybe if I run dry of web content.

A note on DK Ami though; its close but hits a few points I mentioned earlier that I just hate; I'm through it quite a bit, and can't remember any of her plans which actually WORKED. All the engagements end up being won because of some trick she thought up of last-minute and luck that they actually do happen to work, most of which could have been planed/scried for before it came up. Also either because the author isn't good enough to or doesn't for narrative reasons, it's not really rational, there are so many more ways she could be exploiting the setting and so many more things she could plan for which she doesn't.

I'd actually de-rec it until your out of all better material.... Just my rant on DKA XD wanted to talk about it I guess.
