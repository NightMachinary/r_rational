Also, when Link /does/ talk, he at no point says "Well excuuuuuuuuuuse me, Princess".

Totally unreadable.

But no it's really heartwarming, and I particularly enjoy just how much of an idealized hero Link is - he only gets stressed out when he thinks he's failing someone, otherwise he's more or less okay saving the same people from the same problems over and over again. Like, it's not /ideal/, it's not what he wants to be doing, but he never shirks his responsibility or decides that a particular loop is trash anyway so he might as well fuck off and do something else (except for one part in the beginning where things get kinda dark and he basically speedruns the game, and even then his thought process is "I can save everyone else after I've saved Zelda")

He even spends some time trying to figure out how to save them /better/, in order to make the final loop as good as it can be.
