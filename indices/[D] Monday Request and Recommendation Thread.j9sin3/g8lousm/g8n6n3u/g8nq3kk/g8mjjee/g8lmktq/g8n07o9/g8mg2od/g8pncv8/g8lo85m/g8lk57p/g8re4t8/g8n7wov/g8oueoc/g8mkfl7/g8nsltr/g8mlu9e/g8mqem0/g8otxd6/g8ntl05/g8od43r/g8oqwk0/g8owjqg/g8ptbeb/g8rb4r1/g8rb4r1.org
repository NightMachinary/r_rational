  even northstrider said that underlords couldn't achieve an icon last book.

I don't think anyone said underlords /can't/ touch on an icon, they were all saying that it's really hard and will probably be unstable.

Like, Yerin literally touched on the Icon of the Sword in Uncrowned, so clearly it's possible.
