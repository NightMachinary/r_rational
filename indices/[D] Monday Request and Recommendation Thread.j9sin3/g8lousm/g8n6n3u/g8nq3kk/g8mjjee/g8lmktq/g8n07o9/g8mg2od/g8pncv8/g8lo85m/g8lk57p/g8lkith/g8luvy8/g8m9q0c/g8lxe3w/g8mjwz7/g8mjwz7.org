The long way to a small angry planet and its sequels are pretty short and sweet reads. It's basically slice of life Firefly, with a focus on slice of life and some romance.

Spice and wolf is a series of light novels (each novel being around 200 pages) about the romance between a traveling merchant and a local wolf goddess. Their banter is great and the novel volumes are pretty light and self contained.
