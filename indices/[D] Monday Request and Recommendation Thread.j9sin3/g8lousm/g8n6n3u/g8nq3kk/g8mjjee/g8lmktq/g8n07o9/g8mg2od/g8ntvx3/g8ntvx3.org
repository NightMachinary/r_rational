Minus is great, though it lacks a continuity and is more like a series of whimsical vignettes, escalating in surrealness. It's a great display of imagination but it works more like a newspaper comic than a story.

My favourite work by this artist will always be [[https://alopex.li/mirrors/www.kiwisbybeat.com/minus/minus/www.kiwisbybeat.com/great1.html][Great]] which is about a guy who, after failing real big and hard decides to become GREAT by sheer force of will. He does this by becoming a ramen cook/neighborhood brawler, and then things get /real weird/. It has that same surrealness escaltion of Minus, but with relatable characters and a more grounded beginning from which to take off into weirdness.
