I tried and didn't like about half of them, the rest I can give a go: Lighting up the Dark I tried but was too similar to the other naruto rational fanfic the waves arisen for my tastes. I suspect the same will be with Marked for Death unless its not following the same plot. (Like Sanitize was great for example).

Optimized WP just felt to... silly for me. Maybe because its source material is kinda silly, but I just couldn't take it seriously.

Kallen I tried, but something just felt off, not sure what exactly, maybe just lower quality, maybe just a bit bland but didn't like it.

I can try the rest thanks.
