I really enjoy base building and resource gathering books, though outside of The Martian, they don't seem to be a thing that I've found outside of LitRPG. Are there any good rational base building stories anyone can recommend? (I'm not sure that The Martian really counts, but he starts out with limited resources, and has to survive and build up, though he doesn't make his base more permanent like most base building books do.)

Anything helps!

On my to read list, in this genre is '16 ways to defend a walled city' and I don't know how close it is to what I'm looking for.
