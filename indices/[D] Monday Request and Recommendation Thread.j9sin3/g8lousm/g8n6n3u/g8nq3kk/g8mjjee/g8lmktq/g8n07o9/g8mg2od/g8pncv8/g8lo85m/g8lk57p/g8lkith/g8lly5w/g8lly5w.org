Can't say that's terribly sweet or warm, but worth reading and relatively short.

Reaching for something not recommended on here too often (or ever?), how about Penric & Desdemona, a series of novellas by Lois McMaster Bujold:

They're pretty bite-sized and mostly not downers. In a similar vein, take a look at the Murderbot Diaries, a series of novellas about a rogue cyborg who mainly wants to be left alone to watch soap operas:
