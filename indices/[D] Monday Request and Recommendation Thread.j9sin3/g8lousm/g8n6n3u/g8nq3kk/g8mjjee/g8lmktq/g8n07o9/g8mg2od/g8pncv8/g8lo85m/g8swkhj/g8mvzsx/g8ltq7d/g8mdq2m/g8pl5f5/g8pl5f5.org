I read that, sort of rational lite, thought is put into situations but there's rarely any reason for much depth. It also talks about magic circuitry which is nice as it gives a system by which one can cludge together useful things but still have definite room for advantages from deeper understanding and higher complexity. Soulhome is so far less rational than Street cultivation, but it's too soon to tell, the main character is emotionally damaged and mostly going off preconceived notions and the world is complex enough that we don't really have enough information to start trying to draw conclusions. I would recommend Street Cultivation first and highly but this is good too.

Shade Touched is nice and cute. It's thoughtful and I like it.
