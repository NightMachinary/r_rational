My issue is more that any foreshadowing for both of those advancements were only done this book. And that the info about the advancements directly contradicts info we got from previous books: even northstrider said that underlords couldn't achieve an icon last book.

If even monarchs can be proven wrong about sacred arts, a lot of things are up in the air about the magic system now.

And to me, MCs having unique advancements is more frustrating because it means the MCs are going to win not by being clever or rational, but because they have special unique powers.
