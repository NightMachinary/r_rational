You have to make allowances for a medium's shortcomings when adapting. In a book you can say that the X sounded the exact same as Y and there will be no confusion because the author will tell you who's speaking, unless he wants you confused. You can't do that with video, any deception of the audience has to be obvious, so to speak.
