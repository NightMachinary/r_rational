*[[https://www.sbnation.com/a/17776-football][17776]].* A wonderful meditation on what it means to be human, viewed through some very inhuman eyes and circumstances. Told in a very quirky, fun, multimedia manner. It's transhuman, but not rational (and sort of a celebration of human irrationality). Ostensibly about American football, but you only need the vaguest sense of what that sport is^{*} to get it. If this is enough of a rec for you I'd dive in without knowing anything else, but if not then I'd like to also know that it's the story of three now-sentient space probes joking around and watching how humans spend their time after they suddenly and unexpectedly all became immortal.

*[[https://www.sbnation.com/secret-base/21410129/20020/chapters-index][20020]]*. The sequel to *17776*. This is a nice return to the universe. I don't think it's as good as the original (so far?) but it does feature an absolutely brilliant disaster of a modified ruleset for college football.

*[[https://mangadex.org/title/48045/sousou-no-frieren][Frieren]]*. Sweet, moderately poignant, meditative look at the life of the prototypical fantasy party's elf wizard after the big quest is over and her impossibly long life drags on. I really liked this at the start, but it's showing worrying signs of turning into a shounen battle manga.

*Consider Phlebas*. I'm finally getting around to reading the Culture novels. So far disappointed with how little of the Culture itself we see, and kind of surprised how much of this is a space adventure blasty action thing (but I'm not done reading yet). Although I don't care for them, I can recognize that the action scenes are very well put together and fans of those would probably like this, so I thought I'd mention that part of a rec even though I'm not finished.

^{*} The sport where two teams try to get the same ball to opposite ends of a field is, in its purest form, awful. Instead of choosing a sensible way to fix it like having to constantly bounce the ball on the ground or never touch it with your hands, American Football tries to fix it by attaching layer upon layer of ritualistic rules to preserve the "everyone violently smashing into each other" character.
