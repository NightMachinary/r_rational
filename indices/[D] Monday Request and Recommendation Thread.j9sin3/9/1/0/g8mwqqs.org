I just finished reading /Again/. I give it a 0/10 since Link talks in this one and never makes a 'hyah' sound. I just think it's too unrealistic, y'know?

I actually really liked the fic. I would highly recommend you read it. The author somehow gets both the 'large-scale epic' and 'chill slice of life' tones in the story, just like BotW did. The worldbuilding makes sense too, and it adds to the flair of the story.
