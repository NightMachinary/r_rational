Seconding Companion Chronicles; the latest arc is a bit weak, but the rest of it is great and the BoF segment looks to be wrapping up.

I'll also add [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/nowhere-land-jumpchain-multicross-horror.831104/][Nowhere Land]] onto the list of good jumchain fics.

I think in specific the Jumpchain RAW is too nice for a real story because there aren't any challenges you don't pick out for yourself and you always have more than enough tools to deal with them; at minimum, you need something like Companion Chronicles "can't keep all powers+Powers weakened outside of theme+can't pick jumps+nonfriendly management" in order for there to be a semblance of actual tension.
