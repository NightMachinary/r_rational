Yeah, though I think that title is equally bad. If not for getting linked from the author's other story, I would have discarded the story as a lazy genre parody that seems to be filling the Litrpg category. I think I've seen at least 20 of the RR 'Trending' fictions contain the word 'generic' referring to the system, setting, or protagonist. Meanwhile, Wake of the Ravager has an actual unique title and cover.
