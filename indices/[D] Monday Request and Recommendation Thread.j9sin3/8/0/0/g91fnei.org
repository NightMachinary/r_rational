That's a failing of that author in general, I feel. He's gotten better about it in Apocalypse, but it's pretty clear in Wake of the Ravager that not only is the protagonist the only one really allowed to be clever, it's far easier than it should be for him.

This is what made me stop reading Wake of the Ravager, but I'm still enjoying Apocalypse a whole lot, just because those issues are more hidden. Yes, if you actually analyze the situation as you did, then it's pretty implausible. But at a quick readthrough, if you don't overthink it, it's pretty satisfying. Of course, the threshold for overthinking will be different for everyone.

Also, the particular magic system the protagonist stumbles upon/chooses a bit later on is right up my alley. And it helps that it's something that's almost unique to him specifically, which means that there's genuine low-hanging fruit that it doesn't feel like everyone should already be using.
