The munchkining is why Apocalypse: Generic System didn't appeal to me. Real munchkining is about intelligently exploiting a system, but this feels more like the system gets pushed aside every time the protagonist does something smart.

Take the pit traps in chapter two. In the first chapter we see kruskers are so tough that it could charge into the pointy end of a spear so tough that a grown human jumping on the shaft while it was unsupported didn't budge it, and snap the spear then keep on fighting. When you compare the damage done by the force of the kruskers charge and a toughness and sharpness of a professionally made metal spear to a short fall and wooden stakes. The first krusker in there should shrug off the steaks, then run around in rage knocking the others over. Eventually it will cause the sides of the pit to collapse, it's built in soft soil, then it can climb out. The idea that he practically clears the forest with one-simple-trick isn't plausible
