I like the magic systems of both Soulhome and A:GS quite a bit - A:GS has a neat "enchantment" system based on physical mana lenses that act more or less like actual lenses, and Soulhome actually makes me think of some ideas I had in the past for a Terraria-like game - you build your bases in those games, but there's no ludic impact to having a fancy base versus a hovel. Why not make a cultivation game where you build a base with gameplay impact in your soul?
