If you are an experienced RPG player, this story looks promising (15 chapters as of this post):

#+begin_quote
  Qube is an NPC in an AI-driven VR-RPG who avoids her scripted death and blithely continues following the Player, trying to make sense of the normalised nonsense of Fantasy RPGs and accidentally glitching out the world in stranger and stranger ways as she seeks to be the very best Childhood Companion ever.

  It's a loving parody of old school RPGs, high fantasy, and every gamer who has ever thought “what happens if I do this...”

There are plenty of subtle jokes.

It is not a litrpg, whatever stats there may be are never mentioned and are not relevant to the plot.

MC is intended as clever and curious, but inexperienced and somewhat lacking free will.
