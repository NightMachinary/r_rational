Started reading [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35669/apocalypse-generic-system]['Apocalypse: Generic System']], and while it's still pretty early on, and the title is atrocious (hopefully a working title?), I'm really enjoying it. It's by the author of [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25878/wake-of-the-ravager][Wake of the Ravager]], who is excellent at creating munchkinable situations. This story seems to be a more engineering/crafting focused story than WotR, but still has competent writing and a true-to-title generic system and setting.

Also enjoying [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35660/the-weirkey-chronicles-reborn-across-nine-worlds][Soulhome]], by Sarah Lin (of Street Cultivation) and [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34473/shade-touched][Shade Touched]]
