What arc of Ward are you on? The chapters before the end are a grind like Gold Morning, but the epilogue is surprisingly optimistic and sweet.

Wildbow's latest webserial, [[https://palewebserial.wordpress.com/about/][Pale]], is a very different beast. The main characters are three 13 year old girls who are let in on the secret that Magic exists by a group of non-human Others who want their help in solving a murder case. Maybe it's Wildbow deliberately trying to write something different, maybe it's a consequence of the main characters being rather young, but it's a lot more /fun/ to read than most things Wildbow has written so far. It's still ongoing, has I think 300-400k words so far, and rather active chapter discussion over on [[/r/parahumans]].
