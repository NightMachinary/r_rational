Thank you for the feedback! I'm sorry for the confusion. I think both of these points were worth minor editions.

1. Yes. I think it's a bit too cheeky, and added a sentence to clarify further: /[Carol] studied the body's mannerisms as it continued typing, but could find no tells that would have indicated that the dragon was being possessed by Will instead of Rose./

2. In chapter 4 I used the words "storms" and "waterfalls", but it was only one paragraph, so I edited the part in chapter 5 to be more clear: /That morning, [Carol] had made a small breakthrough in the use of a metaphor of turbulent fluids --- like storms or waterfalls --- to explain the white noise, but for the rest of the day she had failed to make noticeable progress in discerning the meaning of her newfound sense./
