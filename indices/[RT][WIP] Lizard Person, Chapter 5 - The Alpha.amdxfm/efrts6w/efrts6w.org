Great progress! Finally got around to read the newest chapter. I really like Carols involvement with elements outside the focused group, like her professor or now her parents etc... it actually shows this is not only fun and games but gives a more realistic tone to her actions and background.

Sure the discussions about how this will impact earth are interesting but her interactions with friends/familie outside the college will be even more so ... could see a lot of possible conflict potential , if lets say Will is away and she could replace him for a interview for Rose , but must therefore give up her privacy , and has to think about the impact on her life etc... or if she gets the opportunity to write and publish a unique paper.
