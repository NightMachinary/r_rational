Finally got around to reading the whole thing, great stuff even if it is still early days in the story.

The part when he talked about one bit of communication kind of felt like she gave up trying to explain it too soon, would have been better to explain that to her it feels like a radio but not perfectly tuned, so she can feel or send /a/ signal, but it's like static, and that Rose is sure that this is natural and she'll gradually tune in over time.

When you get another chapter, I would suggest crossposting to a few other places. the story could easily fit in over at [[/r/HFY]] for example.
