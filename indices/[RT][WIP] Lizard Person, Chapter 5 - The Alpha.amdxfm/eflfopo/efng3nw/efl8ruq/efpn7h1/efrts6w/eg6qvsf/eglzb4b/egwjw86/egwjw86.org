Thank you! I'll try posting it there and maybe other places next chapter.

Determining the level of description is an important balancing issue. The story is already progressing pretty slowly, so I need to lean on the 'lean' side and avoid repeating myself whenever possible. That said, the characters are probably all searching for metaphors to describe their experiences, so examples like yours would be great opportunities to show how each one approaches the problem.
