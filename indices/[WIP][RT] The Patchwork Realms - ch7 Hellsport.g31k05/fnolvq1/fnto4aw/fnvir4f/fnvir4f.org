I'm glad you're liking it... Honestly, I wasn't sure people were. Upvotes on the chapters have steadily plummeted and there's very little audience engagement here, or on SV, or on Royal Road. It's a passion project so I don't /need/ to stop if no one is reading, but it is still bothersome. It's especially bothersome since the first chapter was so well received.

Anyway, I'll go back to longer chapters every week-ish.
