The pre-chapter 7 rate and content levels, please.

This most recent update was a single, short scene and it didn't feel like there was much progress made at all.

So far I'm loving this series, and was so excited to see this update, so much so that I thought for a minute it was a late April Fool's that it ended so early.

Please give us more of our favorite Bork Bork, we can wait a little for the big chapters.
