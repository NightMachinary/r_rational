Reposting the A/N from the chapter:

This chapter is significantly shorter than the others; until now I've been averaging one chapter a week but with pretty beefy chapters. Approximate wordcounts thus far:

#+begin_example
  Chapter 1 - 2783
  Chapter 2 - 6405
  Chapter 3 - 6476
  Chapter 4 - 4757
  Chapter 5 - 5790
  Chapter 6 - 5676
  Chapter 7 - 1829
#+end_example

What do you think of the length? Shorter but ~2+ chapters per week or longer but 1 chapter every week-ish? (No preference is also an option.) I'll leave three posts below this; please upvote the one you prefer.
