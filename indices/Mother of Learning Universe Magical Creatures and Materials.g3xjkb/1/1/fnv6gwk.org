It probably fails some kind of munchkinry test. The criteria for an ability being gained through potions is unclear, but from the examples we see in the story it's either full on transformation or limited senses. For example Lukov transforms into a magic beast, and Zorian uses potions of eagle eye and tremor sense from the Grey Hunter. You probably could get better mana regen, you'd just be stuck as the magic beast for the duration making it a lot less practical.

Either that or author oversight. That in mind MoL has earned enough benefit of the doubt for me to assume that it was thought about at some point.
