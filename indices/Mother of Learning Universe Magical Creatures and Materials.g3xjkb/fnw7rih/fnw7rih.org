I'm surprised that Zorian didn't look into simply increasing his mana regeneration rate. From an in-universe perspective, it's something that he could easily take advantage of in Cyoria, and something that is certainly possible. From a meta perspective, it doesn't take away his primary limitation of not having a lot of mana at his disposal, just gives him staying power (though, let's be honest, if he doubled his mana regen he'd just double how many simulacrum he had active).
