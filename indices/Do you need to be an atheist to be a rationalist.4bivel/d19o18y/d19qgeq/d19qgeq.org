In your analogy, the existence of humans is not in doubt. Whether humans care about ants or not, the hypothetical scientist-minded ants would be able to observe humans and directly be affected by their behavior.

As for your underlying point - sure, we can hypothesize that there exist entities that cannot in any way be detected or in any way affect our world. I don't see what that has to do with conventional religion or claims of paranormal/supernatural phenomena such as "spirit speaking" - all of these typically claim to be able to affect reality in a meaningful sense.
