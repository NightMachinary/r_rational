Ants don't have a concept of testing hypotheses. This metaphor only "works" because the audience is supposed to think of the ants as doing things that ants can't do, but still only having the success at them that actual ants have.

Consider why you didn't use rocks instead of ants. The ability of rocks to comprehend us is the same as the ability of ants to comprehend us, after all. Except if you use rocks, the trick you're playing becomes obvious.

Also, nobody who uses this argument should ever claim that God is good.
