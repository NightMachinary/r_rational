We're going in circles here. We both agree the analogy isn't a perfect representation of the more abstract rules of logic and reasoning I'm discussing. You additionally say that it is impossible to improve the analogy because the underlying point it is trying to illustrate is wrong to begin with. Every time I try to ask you what is wrong with the underlying point, you start complaining about the analogy again.

If you refuse to state what you think is wrong with my actual point, then I will conclude that you disagree without fully understanding my point as a result of your disagreement with me on other matters =).
