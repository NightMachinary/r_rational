Yes. First of all, as Krozart pointed out, given how you describe God to us, there really should be evidence. "It's an intelligent being" doesn't automatically mean there is no evidence--I'm pretty sure I could produce evidence that the President exists, for instance.

Second, this is a double standard. If you're going to say that something exists but there is no evidence, that doesn't just mean that God exists--it means that all sorts of things exist, including gods of other religions, space aliens, psychic powers that vanish whenever tested in a laboratory, etc. Evidence is how you tell a real entity from a fake. You're basically postulating "it's real, but it looks exactly like a fake".
