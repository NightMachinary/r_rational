I agree with your point. Let me try to be more clear about what I'm saying. Though God and related matters was the example given in the Less Wrong page, the point I am raising is not some special case or special pleading for God. Neither am I at present trying to make any positive case for God whatsoever. In fact, despite disputing the particular example the Less Wrong page uses, I agree with its main point - we should be seeking to apply techniques of rationality to all aspects of our observed reality, and not compartmentalizing.

So let's backtrack in order for me to better explain my objection. What exactly is the role of the oft-quoted maxim of "absence of evidence is evidence of absence"? Essentially, the idea is to reveal that evidential situations which appear to be neutral at first glance may not be so at all. For example, suppose that someone claims that all politicians are secretly lizard people. Taking into account absence of evidence prior, we should rightly be skeptical of such a claim. After all, even if there were some grand conspiracy of lizard politicians, there are regularly news stories of politicians needing medical attention or even surgery. Are all doctors now lizard people as well? There's a massive complexity penalty to such claims; there seems to be an internal inconsistency in the hypothetical world where that were true. If this were true, we have good reason to expect pre-existing evidence of it. Absence of that evidence should rightly take us out of a neutral starting point, and into one where we say that the claim would require extraordinary evidence to surmount.

The point I was making, much like the Less Wrong article itself brings up, is that we can't simply quote useful heuristics blindly without understanding where they come from or what their boundary cases are. Suppose we try to apply the same "absence of evidence" heuristic to a simulationist matrix. Should we consider that we have a pre-existing insurmountable degree of evidence that we do not live in a matrix? Well, no. We have no evidence one way or another in this case. There's no good cause to suppose that living in a world that is a matrix would give us plentiful evidence of that, like in the case of the lizard people. We should maintain a neutral position regarding life in a matrix until such evidence arises one way or the other. This doesn't mean that we have to take a 50/50 view on the subject, merely that we should acknowledge that we have no existing pool of evidence which could directly counter, for example, a personal experience where you awaken on Morpheus' ship. Either option would have valid internal consistency.

So far as I can tell at a glance, most of the ideas you list fall into this second matrix category, rather than the lizard people category. That doesn't mean that any of them are necessarily true. It merely means that they do not lack internal consistency. This is a gradient obviously - we must evaluate how likely it would be, given that any of those were true, that we would expect to have scientific evidence of that truth. For some, like the matrix or aliens living on the edge of black holes, we would have no such expectation, and should treat them as neutral propositions until evidence arises on the topic. For others, such as the theory of hidden magic, we can assign different expectations depending on the properties proposed. For example, HPMOR-style hidden magic existing in the present day has become rapidly less and less likely within the past ~100 years with the advent of Polaroid cameras, the internet, and camera smartphones. However, if you propose magic that mostly faded away 1,000 years ago, then we should regard that as a neutral (if mostly useless) proposition.

Getting back to the example of God, the "absence of evidence" heuristic can retain some very valuable utility even in cases where it cannot be applied to every possibility within a broad range. For example, I think we can agree on the basis of this heuristic that there does not exist any God who wishes to make its existence known to the maximum possible number of humans as its top priority. That would fail the internal consistency test. So despite that fact that the maxim cannot be applied as broadly as some would like, it can still reveal useful information. If any God does exist, then for some reason it seems not to want to be detected by scientific tests of prayer, for example.

For us to say that such a being does actually exist - this would require evidence, which is a long and separate discussion =).
