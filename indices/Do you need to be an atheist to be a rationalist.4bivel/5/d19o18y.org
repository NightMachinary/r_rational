Though I don't expect this to be popular here, I think there's a point on this topic oft-ignored by atheism. Perhaps the rational community will be more open to considering it. The problem is that of experimental controls.

The linked page discusses "spirit speaking" as a hypothetical event in reality that can be tested like any other. This brings to mind stories of tests involving MRI scans attempting to determine parts of the brain that indicate spiritual or religious perceptions. However, there is a great flaw in the methodology here. The successful application of science requires reducing variables to test one or at least few things at a time. We try our best to use controls in order to only test what we are seeking to answer at present. But this requires humans to have the requisite level of power or control over the thing being tested.

When people talk about it being difficult to impossible to test spiritual or religious matters, it is not because we have applied those labels to them. It is because we are discussing intelligent actors who, hypothetically, have vastly more power and intellect than the tester, and so will only show up reliably on the tests if they desire to. This is not some inert law of nature which we can test in myriad ways at our leisure. We aren't able to establish proper experimental controls because we have no control over the thing we're trying to test.

Imagine that a group of ants decides that they want to runs observations and tests in order to understand human behaviour. While far easier a task than humans trying to test for God, this would still be exceedingly difficult. The ants may try to set up different scenarios - one ant nearby to the human's door, or three ants. 100 ants watching the human's house, or no ants watching. The ants may then observe different results in each of these scenarios! Yet the observed differences in human behaviour truly bore no relation to what the ants were doing. The human had motivations and interests beyond the comprehension of the ants (going to work, or to get groceries, etc). Nothing the ants did prompted the human to return home with groceries. The human likely wasn't even aware of what the ants were doing.

Suppose that the human became aware that the ants were trying to run such tests, and it was a common expected behaviour of ants. The human might choose to play along with the tests for a while, or ignore them, or purposefully confound them for fun. But nothing the ants did would control that human's choice in the matter. It is especially unlikely that the human would, from that point forward, prioritize the ants' goals and motivations above its own and always play along with any tests they wanted to run indefinitely.

Of course, in this example the ants have a far easier time in their testing efforts than we do. The hypothetical ants can easily perceive the existence of the human, and can clearly identify which acts it is responsible for when in close proximity to them. Yet despite these massive advantages compared to our attempted tests of God, it seems their efforts will be doomed to failure, no matter how good their science. The ants will not discover jobs, money, or grocery stores. The ants could not even guess as to these things, which are far beyond their capability to observe. The only realistic chance of the ants getting even a vague understanding of such matters would be for the human to somehow use ant language to try to explain concepts in parables and metaphors. Ant language, of course, would not have the true words or concepts involved, but this way things far beyond the ants' capabilities to observe could be at least partially explained.

I am sure there are flaws in this off-the-cuff analogy, and surely atheists have other arguments on such matters. But I hope this helps to illustrate the difficulty of performing science given the complete lack of ability to establish proper experimental controls.
