I don't think this is quite true for the most general meaning of 'exist'...

- The expansion of the universe could cause a relativistic ship to travel far enough that (assuming the speed of light is the absolute limit) no information from it could ever return. Does this relativistic ship cease to exist?

- There is also EY's favorite of the many worlds interpretation verse collapse interpretation... Intuitively, many worlds seems more complicated and less parsimonious, but it is arguably more parsimonious (people with more physics knowledge occasionally disagree with EY, but for the sake of argument lets just compare many worlds against collapse interpretation that are less parsimonious in this case)

- Do you define information entirely by its physical substrate? This is more a philosophical question in the present, although if mind-uploading or teleportation based an atomic disassembly and reconstruction ever become possible, this could be a major issue. This also might one day be relevant if we had a completely reductionist understanding of the human mind well enough to rigorously define all the concepts humans thinks of in order to put Anslems/Godel ontological style arguments into a more rigorous form.

I do agree with your statement for the most part, particularly in the case of god, but it worth keeping in mind the edge cases.
