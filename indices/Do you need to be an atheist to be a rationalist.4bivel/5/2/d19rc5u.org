If an entity exists but doesn't leave any verifiable evidence that it exists, then it functionally does not exist.

That's how evidence works.

Edit: No, I will not be responding to any incredibly over-elaborate, pseudointellectual justifications for why you're allowed to believe in your dumb magic shit without evidence. Holy fuck why did I get these responses.

Followup edit: No, I will also not be responding to any weird stalker-y personal attacks aimed at me because I say silly things on this reddit account. You people need to stop.
