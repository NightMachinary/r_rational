If I put something in an impenetrable box set to open itself sometime in the next thousand years, do the contents of the box not functionally exist? Do you consider the box empty, and do you consider the existence of the box's contents to be untestable? You saw me put it in the box!

The religious expect to obtain undeniable proof of their beliefs beyond the veil of death; skeptics of religion expect to "find" nothing there, and to simply not exist. Contrast string theory, a belief that truly offers no testable predictions (though every few years one of its proponents claims it does). What a strangely prominent and accepted cult that is.
