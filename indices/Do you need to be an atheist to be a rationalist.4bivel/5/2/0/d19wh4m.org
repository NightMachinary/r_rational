Edit: This post, and the reply to his next comment, were written prior to the addition made by his edit. I'm disappointed that he chose to abandon discussion of rationality in favour of an emotional appeal to incredulity.

I upvoted you for very succinctly expressing the same error that all other replies have made.

I agree with the principle that you're expressing, but I disagree in regards to its limitations. You're expressing this as a universal, philosophical truth. I'm saying that it is an exceptionally useful heuristic which has boundaries we very rarely encounter.

Please understand that I'm not making a positive case for God. I'm not saying God exists because of experimental controls. Rather, I'm saying that attempts to use the heuristic you quote to prove that God cannot possibly exist are misguided. There may be many other arguments or reasons to claim that God does or does not exist. But this one isn't valid due to the issue of experimental controls. This is a very narrow and limited claim I'm making.

We are not able to verifiably measure whether any such evidence exists despite our best efforts. In the case of an unknown powerful intellect we are trying to detect, absence of evidence may not, in fact, be evidence of absence. I'm not saying such an entity doesn't have any effects upon the world - I'm saying that we cannot successfully formulate an experiment or test that will reliably tell us which effects, if any, such an entity would hypothetically be responsible for.
