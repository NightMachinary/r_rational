One of the underlying flaws in your argument is that if the relationship between god and humans is similar to how you portray it, then we would have evidence of gods existence.

Its not a requirement of science that something has to be constant or even easily observable. Sure its easier to understand, thats one of the reasons gravity was better explored before quantum mechanics. But its certainly not a requirement.

The problem for the argument of god is that there just isn't any proof, and contrary to a popular saying, the absence of evidence is evidence of absence.

Currently the only arguments that I see nowadays regarding god that is consistent with the absence of evidence all have the look of the story of the invisible dragon. This includes your analogy of the ants. The ant analogy has all the signs of an hypothesis generated to prove a belief is true, instead of being generated to explain reality.
