I can think of better analogies, but the better analogies I can think of would show that your point is wrong. For instance, a politician tells people "trust me, this policy is for the greater good, you just don't understand it". Many of the population really don't understand it--nevertheless, the fact that the politician brings this up is a good reason to be suspicious of him.
