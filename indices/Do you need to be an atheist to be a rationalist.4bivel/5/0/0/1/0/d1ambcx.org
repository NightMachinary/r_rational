I first explained my point using the more accurate terms of the concepts of science. Then I provided an analogy to illustrate that point for those who found the more precise explanation too abstract to grasp. The analogy was off-the-cuff; I certainly don't claim it to be perfect, and would welcome any improvements or superior replacements.

So far, you've simply insisted that I'm wrong but haven't provided any sort of explanation as to why you think so.
