You seem to be identifying possible flaws in my analogy rather than the underlying point I was attempting to illustrate. If you can think of a better analogy, then great! Please tell me what it is and I'll be happy to use it in the future. If you disagree with my underlying point for some reason, then you'll need to be more specific about why that is =).

Whether or not God is good is not addressed by my analogy, and really has no bearing on the question of experimental controls. That's a completely different discussion from the topic at hand.
