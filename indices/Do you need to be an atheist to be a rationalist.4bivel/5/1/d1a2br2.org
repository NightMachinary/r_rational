The solution space of things that could logically exist but can't be empirically tested is very large... I could be a smartass and bring up the flying spaghetti monster, but to restrict my examples to things to more serious things, some of which I could hypothetically actually believe given bizarre enough personal experience.

- The Simulation Hypothesis (reality is a simulation maintained on some underlying substrate of a much vaster, 'realer universe')

- Boltzman brain. I am just a brief collection of dust that has managed to temporally emulate a mind long enough for it to imagine it is real...

- Magic exists, but can't be tested because of some arbitrary convoluted occult properties it has (i.e. the further it is known and revealed to reality, the more it ceases)

- Some form of extreme post-modernism is actually literally true about 'objective' reality, but science is unable to realize this because its ability to arrive at truth depends on a consensus process in the first place.

- Modal realism is true, as a side effect of this, an even more generalized form of quantum immortality applies. From one's own perspective, instead of dying, improbable events, or outright previously unknown laws of nature (this is the modal realist version), will seem to continuously conspire to keep you alive.

- Combining modal realism and simulation hypothesis results in an even deeper rabbit hole of seemingly paradoxical implications...

- Alien life and civilizations exists/have existed, but the laws of physics make it such that the infinite computing substrate is obtainable collapsing edge of a blackhole, so the solution to the Fermi is that all intelligent life eventually chooses to migrate to simulations on the edges of blackholes

- Future civilization is likely to simulate us to get a chance to resurrect us, to some small margin of probability

- Combining several previous points: all of this has already happened before and will happened again...

*Anyway* my point is that the concept of God is just as untestable as most of these other ideas. Why should it receive any special respect/belief over any of these other possibilities?
