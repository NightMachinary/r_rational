It's hard to explain. We tend to value our family more than strangers, right? Our family doesn't have to be useful. We take care of them because we love them, and empathize with them. Extend that love to strangers, and suddenly people's value depends nothing on their worth to society.

And its about fairness. People who were born less useful to society, don't deserve to be worth less. Every human suffers the same, and loves the same, and laughs the same. Each person's internal experience is just as real, and they want to live and be happy just as much as anyone else. So they deserve that same consideration.

Death is sad no matter what, because every person deserves to live a long happy Life. And when someone takes their own life, it's sad because you know they must have really been suffering. That's why every life is worth the same.
