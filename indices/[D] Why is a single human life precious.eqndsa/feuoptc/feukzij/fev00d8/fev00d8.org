There is no more [[https://www.iep.utm.edu/nihilism/][objective worth]] to a human life than there is to humanity as a whole. And vice versa. Subjectively though, we humans have a tendency to value and find meaning in our existence and the things we observe and experience.

We as individuals might then realize that what we find meaning in does not in fact have any innate meaning, but that it instead originates from our [[https://www.iep.utm.edu/existent/][subjective projecting of meaning.]] What you value, productiveness and rationality, is no more meaningful in a meaningless universe than its most inane piece of rock. But you still value it, because we value subjective meaning.

You might then feel comfortable in your objectively meaningless but subjectively meaningful existence, working towards goals and purposes that you feel gratified pursuing. [[https://www.iep.utm.edu/egoism/][Perhaps that is enough for you.]] But we as a species also evolved the specific tendency to find value in other living beings, what we call empathy or being a good person. Perhaps if you find meaning in your own subjective experience you might find meaning in the subjective experience of others and what they find meaning in. Is there a difference between the two?

And now we come to the question: /Is a human life valuable if it isn't productive?/ Maybe, it depends on if you value a human life. But if you believe anything at all has meaning and that you are not alone in deciding what has meaning, then yes, a human life is precious even if it isn't productive.

Production is a purpose you have ascribed value to, just as another person might ascribe value to for them loftier goals, both equals to the universe's most inane piece of rock. Why do you value production? [[https://www.iep.utm.edu/moral-re/][It is not unique from any other object of meaning.]] If you find meaning in your life then you must realize that another person find different meaning in theirs. And to an impartial third party, what you value has [[https://www.iep.utm.edu/moral-re/#SH3b][no more meaning than anyone else's.]]
