The MLP:FiM community has a higher proportion of older males in in, compared to all the fanfic communities populated largely by 13 year old girls. It's therefore somewhat easier to find fanfic that appeals to the demographics of this sub than many other fandoms of similar or larger size (largely because fewer people are trying to write romances, and more are trying to write adventures and sci-fi).
