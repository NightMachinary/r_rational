My question is about the trouble he had with conveying "what is the word for tree?". He could have drawn a stick figure labeled with marcus' 8-character name, and a tree with no label or a blank or an arrow or something. This is First Contact 101 sort of stuff, in the genre and I expect in the real world as well.
