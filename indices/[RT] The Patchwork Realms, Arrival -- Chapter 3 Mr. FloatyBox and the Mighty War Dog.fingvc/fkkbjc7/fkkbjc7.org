Ahh yet another chapter in my favorite story of dog and his pet human!

Just want to say, I am all on board the point and learn approach language method. It's not very important and lots of stories skip this part via setting or just handwave (am looking at you Rain) but learning in story even if not detailed is way cooler (mega cool YOLO daaabs*) Anywho if this doggy is to be a rational clever protag, may I suggest for him or some of his new friends to give him a spiky collar. It's not full armor, but it has precedent IRL as used against wolves to prevent neck bites, maybe add a little frilly bow to make him seem not as scary.

Oh yeah, good on Marcus for thinking ahead on villagers being afraid, big dogs are terrorific!
