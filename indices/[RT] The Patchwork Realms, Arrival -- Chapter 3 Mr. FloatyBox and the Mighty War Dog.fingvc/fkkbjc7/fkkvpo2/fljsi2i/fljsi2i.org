oh man 10 day late response. Too lazy to log into reddit.

Anyway. Learning new languages is a bit more involved that simply having a better memory/cognition, I could sort of see it if magic keps the brain in toddler/preschool level, where brain plasticity is making learning new things easier, but it would still take effort to learn, speaking and listening conversations and naturally reading the words so the info solidifies. I think I meant handwave as lets keep the story going and focus on plot, and not say on the fact that if you got enhanced cognition you would also very easily learn other stuff, like laws, math (which he uses so props) basic physics and chemistry, possibly alchemy depending on how it goes.

Rain does speak to learned people so maybe its not avoiding the subjects so much as lack of opportunity.
