It's working! While it slows the pace a little for those of us reading it serially, it'll be way more satisfying when it pays off, and binge-readers will fly right past anyway.

Characterization is so important to a good story, and I'm enjoying how Athos, Marcus and Marza are learning to navigate each other's personalities. Plus some unusually opinionated and snooty Interface text.

I'm excited to learn more about this world. What infernal plots await in Hellsport? What's Mr. FloatyBox's problem, anyway? Did Athos crash the funeral of the world's most powerful human? I'll be tuning in next time!
