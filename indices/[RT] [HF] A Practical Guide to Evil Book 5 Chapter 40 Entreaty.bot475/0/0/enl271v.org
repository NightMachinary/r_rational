Ohhh, I like the idea of a Realm which lets you sneak-attack your enemies, but only at the cost of your own right to rule. All the upsides of a nuclear deterrent with none of the downsides. If anyone signing on to the Liesse Accords is getting destroyed by another, all they need to do to win the conflict is sacrifice their reign and gate an army to the enemy sovereign's bedchamber.

This would give good and wise rulers an actual advantage over the mad and ambitious, as it would be a threat only the good could wield.
