I've never been one for speeches, even if I do tend to ramble. I do not care to listen to someone spout paragraphs worth of text at me over the internet or quarter hours worth of speech over words at me, but this speech was good. The quality of the speech however does not discount my dislike for the long winded, And my want for people to get to the point.

We get it, the saint deals with that which no one else wants to or can, but she is old and failing. Her judgement is becoming clouded, corrupted by stubbornness. I do not doubt she was a sight to behold in her prime, but now her story is ending fast. Someone else will take up her job, and the world will move on.

This chapter is another of the sort I grow tired of, an entire chapter dedicated to a single conversation. Sure, it needed to happen. Sure, it is important. But I have grown bored of these sorts of chapters, because the same point could be made in half the words, and we could get back to the plot. Back to dealing with the dead king. Back to actually doing something other than having yet another debate of morality! I get that some people enjoy this sort of chapter, I truly do, but we have more important things to deal with than moral posturing!

Now, to get to the parts that should have taken us only half a chapter to get to, we finally have a concrete answer for the 8th crown. Sure, it may not be guaranteed go be the 8th, but it is at least a willing possibility.

Also curse the tyrants sudden and inevitable betrayal! Honestly if you weren't expecting this you either thought this already all counted as one big betrayal of the dead king or you haven't been paying attention to how kairos does things. As I have said before, he is irritant+traitorous+the spirit of goblin kind+ a smidge of Saturday cartoon villainy, and it is glorious to behold. I only wish we could have witnessed his betrayal first hand, as it surely was glorious
