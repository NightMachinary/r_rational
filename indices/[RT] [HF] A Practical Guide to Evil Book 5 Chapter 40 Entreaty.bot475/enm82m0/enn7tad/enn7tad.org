I think Rule is more abstract then that, he probably wouldn't be able to lead armies or cause political change (Like the legions), and it probably requires someone to actually be Ruling in some regard, otherwise any soldier (And probably one very eager field promoted general) could be made to give up their potential rule. Plus, the right to climb the tower is something available to literally everyone in a way, considering the current Empress was just a good looking serving girl prior to her current position, and she was fully able to take the tower.
