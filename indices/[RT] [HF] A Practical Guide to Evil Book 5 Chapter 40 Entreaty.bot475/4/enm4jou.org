Good Lord am I learning to hate Tariq more and more with each passing chapter.

"Hey Cat, I know Laurence seems to be a rabid dog out to kill any and everything she thinks is a threat, and that might put a friend of yours in her crosshairs. (PS, she and I might be a teensy bit responsible for the Eldritch horror currently pursuing said friend)

Can she get a pass on killing him cause, y'know, who are you to question is when we say someone needs to die?"

I'm starting to hope that in some very real, cosmic way in the Guideverse, this whole era and Cat's story is about the Good guys not realizing they've stepped into the Role of misguided, self righteous props supporting a system that kills innocent people in banal everyday ways that people like the Pilgrim and Saint ignore. Cat had to suffer through the Conquest and rule by Evil because The Good Guys were busy prancing around Procer and Levant patting themselves on the back for snuffing out minor villains. And then they have the audacity to ask Cat to stand aside while they butcher their way to another Win For The Good Guys.

What makes Tariq particularly hateful is that he'll never, ever, ever see that he's the one past redemption because he's already convinced himself that biological warfare is a Merciful way to end a war, so long as it ends it for the ones that claim they're the Good Guys.
