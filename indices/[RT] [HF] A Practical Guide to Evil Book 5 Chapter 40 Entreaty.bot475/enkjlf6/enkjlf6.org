The agreement at the end sounds like a setup for the Pivot. A lot of discussion has been made about what Saint will do in the end, and that kind of choice and its consequences is precisely what a Pivot is. Here, they're just adding more weight to that choice.

Now, the question is whether or not Cat even wants Pilgrim's crown or not. Maybe I'm reading too much into this, but they've just been throwing a bunch of crowns at Cat, namely Pilgrim's, Tyrant's, and the two revenants. The last crown will shape the nature of the realm, so it's important which one is chosen. They've also mentioned that, after kill Larat, there will be a cost to use the realm for fast travel, and it's my guess that what the cost will be will depend on which crown is chosen.

For example, if Tyrant's crown is used, I'd imagine that the resulting cost will be something ironically bad, like all the boots off of the soldiers' feet, or the exit leading straight into an ambush. For Pilgrim, it might be a deep personal sacrifice for the greater good. For Cat, my guess is that the cost will be a Name, as in someone has to give up their Name to use the gates. It fits neatly into what we know of the Liesse Accords, and it fits with Cat's current path. Or alternatively, the cost will be more crowns, hence the realm later being called the Prince's Graveyard, which fits the name more, considering only one royal actually died for those current 7 crowns.
