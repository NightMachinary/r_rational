Lowercase good in particular, since the various nitwits with crowns participating in the crusade are all on the "Good" side. I feel like the purpose of the restriction could be bypassed since it's magical in a sort of way, we know Warlock has access to at least some knowledge and ability with realms outside of creation considering Hierophant grew up in one. It might be something the choirs swing in Good's favor for a name to show up with a magical understanding of how to break into the realm.

Personally I feel blanket effects within the realm is the more likely outcome from the last crown, if I recall correctly all mentions of the effects on the realm haven't included the creation of the gate, just the inside of it. Also consider the gates to various Hells just allow passage for devils, they don't make the area hell-like. They don't even seem to corrupt the people creating them considering it hasn't been mentioned so far, plus an artifact (Akua's Folly) would've been able to make one without even a person to corrupt.

My guesses for the effects if we're betting on this:

Tyrant - Either randomness in the realm e.g. getting lost, arriving much later or earlier than expected, peaceful or hostile areas interspersed wherever; or some mini-madness on people in the realm, e.g. people more inclined to betrayal, people not caring about their loyalties anymore.

Pilgrim - Choir's Providence, the realm. Stories have a much larger effect, a crusading army probably would literally have glistening armor. It might even be similar to what would've happened if that angel actually called for the crusade in the earlier chapters before Cat done Cat'd it.

Dead King's dead minions - Bad idea, never going to happen. Probably would end up like what happened with Maesago, only the dead king would have control over the realm instead of one person.

Cat - Literally the only outcome I can see happening is Cat giving up her crown. The realm would probably be about sacrifice, people lose Names, stories lose weight, rulers lose Crowns, armies arrive exhausted, half of supplies might spoil. Cat's whole career has been the lesser evil, if something saved a thousand lives at the cost of a hundred she'd take the deal and mourn the hundred. Hakram sacrificed a hand for Vienna and he's just acting the same as Cat has been in a narrower sense. Whatever the cost to enter ends up being it's going to be enough that things are going to end up in a MAD sort of way.
