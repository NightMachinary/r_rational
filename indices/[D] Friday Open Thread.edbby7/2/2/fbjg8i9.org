I feel like instrumental rationality is pretty popular too? It's just less emphasized in this subreddit's particular corner of rationalist discussionspace, since we're focused around fiction-reading. But finding and reading enjoyable fiction is a perfectly rational thing to do for many people, so it's not like we need to /trade off/ between instrumental rationality and this subreddit's usual activities; [[/r/rational]] might not be a fully balanced breakfast on its own, but it's still a worthwhile piece to include in a larger breakfast.
