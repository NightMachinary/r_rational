Does anyone here write poetry -- or better yet, teach the writing of poetry? I [[https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/ecxyxh/i_write_quick_little_poems_in_holiday_cards_to_my/][posted]] for the first time yesterday in [[/r/OCPoetry]] requesting suggestions for improvement, if anyone would be willing to give it a glance :]

Alternatively, do there exist any "rational" poems or songs? I've heard some Effective Altruism-y songs, e.g. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32yPWJcq2AI][The Ballad of Smallpox Gone]], and then there's the Dungeons and Discourse [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=UUHxPfaGvrkLs5KvBHBlIu2w][corpus]], which brought us such hits as [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rNkTtJ35Xw&list=UUHxPfaGvrkLs5KvBHBlIu2w][The Devil and Blaise Pascal]] or [[https://soundcloud.com/buckmbs/hobbes-song][Hobbes' Song]], and potentially some "science-y / academic-y" songs could also qualify, e.g. from Monty Python like the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvwH8Qij0JY][Galaxy Song]] or [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9SqQNgDrgg][Bruce's Philosophy Song]] or from elsewhere like [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPbR30pWkqE][The Atom Song]] or the works of [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTev4RNBiu6lqtx8z1e87fQ][acapellascience]] or [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mH7ruIpmCEy8hqbXmrm4XBkd1WU8WjqYo][these Children's Songs]].

Some of these I feel might appeal to the aesthetic sensibilities of this sub, but I haven't seen anything that's more directly targeted.
