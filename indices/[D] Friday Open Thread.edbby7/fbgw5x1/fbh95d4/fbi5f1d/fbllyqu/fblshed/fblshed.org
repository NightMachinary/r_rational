Everything but the last sentence has that vibe, yeah, but

> We privileged few, who won the lottery of birth against all odds, how dare we whine at our inevitable return to that prior state from which the vast majority have never stirred

To slightly rephrase: be grateful you exist, HOW DARE you feel bad about someday not existing, (and, implied to guilt you a bit) how dare you pay those who never even got to exist that disservice?

In context, this is part of an argument for why we should not fear death (quick summary: why fear death when you used to be dead?), and it is by far my least favorite line from Unweaving the Rainbow, which is overall a fairly well-intentioned book.

Besides that, there's a lot of sour-grapes death-gives-meaning-to-life shit going around and I'm sick of it.
