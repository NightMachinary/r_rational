I posted this as a slightly sarcastic click-bait top-level post earlier, but it got removed and I realized I should have just posted about this in the Friday thread instead where it was more appropriate instead. My apologies to everyone.

So, here's a link to [[https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/neorhythm-breakthrough-in-brain-science/x/8914984#/][NeoRhythm]] for anyone who wants to discuss it's merits and how likely it is to be a scam or not.
