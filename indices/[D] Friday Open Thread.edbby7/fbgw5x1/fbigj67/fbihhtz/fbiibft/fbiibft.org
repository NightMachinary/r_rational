I know right!?! It's like the final straw on a camel's back for proving that it's a scam.

If it was at all remotely as effective as it claims to be, then I would assume that it would be way bigger than it really is and not need any crowd-funding to get started.

Anyway, I was just curious to see if people wanted to talk about it and if they knew of any fiction that had a device similar to this.
