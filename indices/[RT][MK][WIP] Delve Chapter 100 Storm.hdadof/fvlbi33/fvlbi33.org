Holy cow, I tried to read this chapter after a long night of drunk gaming with my friends. It was the most surreal Delve experience I had yet. So many characters. So much action. What even was happening lol. (I reread it the day after and it was way more coherent, but the Val reveal at the end just didn't have the same surprise factor)

Loved the way all sorts of characters had a little slice of the limelight. (Ava was so cute trying to square up to a mushroom man with a dagger [batshit insane though]). But I wouldn't do it too often, it is pretty jarring to follow the narrative when we have to see it through so many lenses.

(Fucking slow clap Val? Really? I'm convinced that his brain is actually just a meme machine for rpg's.)
