I disagree. There's a ton of plot happening here, and I suspect it will drive much of the story from now on.

Rank shift means that monsters will be continually spawning in the city. Do the residents stick around and try to find for their homes or do they become refugees, moving hundreds of miles across a monster-filled winter landscape? Where do they go? If there are monsters spawning in, how many of them are blues? Will new heroes be feeling the area? What about the DKE -- how will this impact their conquest attempts? What about the side characters we've seen -- they've had zero large-scale agency since the barrier went up, since that's not a problem they can affect. Monster hunting and protecting others is something that Kettle, Myth, Reason, etc can do. Plus, maybe some of them end up awakened, which will cause its own changes.

Also, as another poster said, it's been foreshadowed for a very long time and needed to be paid off.

Also also, I get where you're coming from about Rain solving things with his brain, but other readers have been hoping for some action for a long time and this chapter /is/ the pace picking up from their POV.
