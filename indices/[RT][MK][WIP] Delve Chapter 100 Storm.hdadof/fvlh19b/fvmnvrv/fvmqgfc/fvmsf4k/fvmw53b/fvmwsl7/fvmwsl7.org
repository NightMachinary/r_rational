Exactly. Right now it's gone from "We're stuck in here for a long time, but as long as I can keep it cool we will be fine" to "we're stuck in here for a long time and everything has gone to hell, but as long as I can keep it cool, we will be fine" to "we might be stuck in here forever and all die and everything has gone to hell" and finally "we might be stuck in here forever, we're getting attacked by random monsters and everything in the city had already gone to hell!".

You can only raise the tension so many times before it starts to fail as a literary device.
