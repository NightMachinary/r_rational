I don't know why, but I don't feel the same way as you. It just seems like things have gone to hell in a relatively plausible way, and the characters are trying to survive the best they can.

It's a black swan event (except not really). They're trying to hold on and prevent everyone from dying, just the same as before. I don't feel annoyed, like the author's raising the stakes and it's not working.
