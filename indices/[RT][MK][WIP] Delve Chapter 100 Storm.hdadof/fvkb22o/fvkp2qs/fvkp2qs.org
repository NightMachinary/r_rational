Ehh, "slow" update speed exaggerates the problem. Once a week is still fast for the raw linguistic quality we get. While it is still relatively slow for purposes of binge reading, rational worldbuilding still requires a lot of justification etc. that massively moderates the pace of story. Overall, it still manages to stay interesting every update, even if it has a high "filler" quotient.
