I think this is the important death knell for Fel Sadanis. With monsters spawning beneath your bed and in your closet it really isn't sustainable to have civilian housing anymore, and the Watch even intends to go around demolishing houses to solve this problem, if I read the chapter right. Fel Sadanis won't be /abandoned/, it's still got the all-important teleport pad and barrier stone, but it would be more a military outpost than anything.

What this does to the story is force Rain to move on. He can't stick around in Fel Sadanis anymore because there /is/ no Fel Sadanis anymore, and there's no point returning here if it's just an encampment around the strategic artifacts. It puts Rain on the road with no looking back, ready for the next leg of his journey.
