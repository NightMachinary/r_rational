Yes but that was a bad training montage. What I wanted was something like: "With the watch back keeping the order, the support of the nobility and commoners, my efforts on the mining to reach the control panel and on the city's cooling progressed swiftly. It's surprising how much progress we were able to make in only 4-7 days..."

That's it, 2-3 lines to improve the pacing and so the story doesn't feel like things are happening back to back non stop. But no Rain can't even get a nights sleep.
