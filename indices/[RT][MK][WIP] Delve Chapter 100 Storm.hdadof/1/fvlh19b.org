I feel this new escalation really wasn't needed. Just increase the pacing, no need to shove in combat and pointless action at this point in this arc. It will slow the pacing even further. Rain being underground 3-4 episodes was bad, the dealing with people and managing was satisfactory.

This combat now will just slow things down imho. Nothing threatens him there. Just him being a hero and showing off, when him saving the city with his brain and hard work would have been more novel and interesting overhaul.
