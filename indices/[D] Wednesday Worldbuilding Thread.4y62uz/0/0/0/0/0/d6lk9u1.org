Oh crap indeed.

  Does Rose honor precommitments to herself?
#+end_quote

Only if both parties get to live and be free in the end, I expect. But that's only my model of a perfect sociopath. Perhaps it can vary. If she is not a sociopath, but a pathological narcissist, maybe? Then she /would/ value all her selves, not only herself, while still considering other people inferior to her.

  Ugh. Mary's only bargaining chip is her identity - Rose doesn't a priori know anything about the future until Mary tells her, including Mary's name and past
#+end_quote

So? M^{2}!Rose sits in ambush near the transtemporal phone apartment, then Mary arrives, she murders her and destroys the phone. Even if she doesn't know who precisely Mary is, she knows enough to identify her.

  then she can no longer take a phone call (because she's dead) so the timeline can't change any more
#+end_quote

No, no, if M^{i}!phone doesn't work, then P!phone still gets some information from the future --- namely, that the M^{i}!phone doesn't work --- so M^{i+} timelines continue to branch out. The only way to break this system is for P!Rose to ensure that Mary can never be born.
