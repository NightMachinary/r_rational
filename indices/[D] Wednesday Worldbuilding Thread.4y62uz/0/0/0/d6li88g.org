  timeline during the period corresponding to the first phone call? Does M^{2} history record that the phone never rang until call 2?
#+end_quote

Yes. The past calls get rewritten by whatever a normal flow of events in this timeline is.

  This prevents her from setting up long-term plans, but it means she can e.g. spend lots of money and resources to acquire a piece of information, in the knowledge that she'll get her money back in the next timeline (but keep the memories).

Hm, I didn't thought about that at all. Interesting idea. The Receiver then can go as far as set herself up to be killed, only to leap into another timeline at the last moment. It can even be done remotely (by agreeing on the time of the Call, then setting up a device to pick up and put down the transtemporal phone while the Receiver is off doing dangerous deeds).

Can Mary /die/? That part is fuzzy, since the means by which the phone determines who the Receiver is are unclear. Is it whoever picked it up first? What if it changed between M^{i} timelines? Or is being the Receiver Mary's inherent transtemporal property now? That seems most simple, and it ensures that Rose can't just murder her and work with her own older self; if so, then Mary can even afford to die.

But it also complicates things: it means Rose can't change history too much, since Mary needs to be /born/, which is quite an unlikely event, all factors considered.

Still. Nothing stops Rose from hunting Mary down, imprisoning her and making calls to Rose's older self... Except Rose's sociopathy.

Once Rose found herself in M^{i} timeline, what's her incentive /not/ to murder Mary and destroy the phone in order to cut off any possibility of the timeline's destruction and her subsequent death?

Can Rose get /anything at all/ done in M^{i} timeline? Once she figured out the rules, if she finds herself in M^{i} timeline, then she knows she is going to be rewritten, so she has no reason to play along with P!Rose's plans; she needs to destroy them.

Alright, it won't work: if a Call goes unanswered/doesn't go at all, the phone returns 'blank', and the corresponding M^{i} timeline gets replaced by M^{i+1}. A few M^{i}!Roses do that anyway, then P!Rose figures out what's going on. M^{i}!Roses after that know that too, so... What do they do? Cutting off the phone doesn't work, so they need to figure out how to escape to P timeline. They research mind uploading, eventually succeed. Then... P!Rose precommits to host them all IF they play along with her long-term plans, arranges the creation of a supercomputer /during a very long Call/. After that, her M^{i}!selves obediently do science, sending P!Rose results and themselves.

Then everything blows up.

Huh. Neat.

Wait, it was supposed to be a story about Mary. Can she even do anything to prevent that?
