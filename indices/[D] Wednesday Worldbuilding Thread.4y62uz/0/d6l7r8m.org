I've watched a horror movie [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCaller][The Caller]] recently.

The story was predictably unnoteworthy: a typical horror movie, a bunch of boring characters, a predictable twist at the end, nobody pays attention the magical elephant in the room, et cetera.

The premise, however, is interesting. To be brief, a telephone in a particular apartment works as a time machine: a person from year 1979 could activate it and talk to the person from 2011 (not vise versa). Mary, the protagonist and the Receiver, is an ordinary woman from 2011.

The Caller is an unstable sadistic murderlady from 1979, Rose. She knows when you live.

Rose proceeds to: [[#s][spoiler, if anyone cares]] And so on. Mary [[#s][spoiler]]

I think it is an interesting premise to build a rational fanfic on. The anomaly is ridiculously exploitable, so two cooperating rational people would be able to science everything out of the universe in no time.

But what if one of them is a homicidal psychopath? Can rational!Mary outmaneuver rational!Rose, despite being in a drastically disadvantageous postition, and use the anomaly to better the world?

Of course, the time travel system is na√Øve and needs refining. The way I see it, it works like this:

1. The Caller intends to make a call 32 years into the future. The timeline splits: in one timeline, timeline M^{1,} the phone lost its anomalous power, the call failed, and no further time travel ever occurred; in the other timeline, timeline P, the phone worked, and connected the Caller to the Receiver of the timeline M^{1.} (I. e., from the perspective of the timeline P, timeline M^{1} was instantly fast-forwarded 32 years into the future.) During the call, the timelines were running in sync, but after the call was over, M^{1} timeline was destroyed and replaced by M^{2} timeline, similarly branched off of the current point in P timeline and fast-forwarded, with the Receiver's mind jumping to the new timeline. After that, P and M^{2} timelines were running in sync. Next call would destroy M^{2} timeline and create M^{3} timeline, and so on.
2. The Receiver has ripple-proof memory. The Receiver's timeline does not changes over the course of the transtemporal call, but changes abruptly after the call is over.

Here's my masterpiece: [[https://i.imgur.com/p3MyWQt.png][paint diagram]].

There is no way anyone can get from M^{i} timeline to the P timeline (except transfer of an uploaded mind through the phone, of course).

Thoughts? Temporal weapons, tricks, defense ideas (especially for the Receiver)? Holes in the model? Interesting ways to use it?

^{Yes, yes, destroying a timeline basically amounts to killing everyone in it sans the Receiver. Let's ignore that issue for the moment.}
