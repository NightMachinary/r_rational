  Yes, yes, destroying a timeline basically amounts to killing everyone in it sans the Receiver

To be fair, the Caller /is/ a homicidal psychopath. I see no reason why this would stop her.

Alright, so the Receiver is 32 years in the Caller's future. The Receiver is the Caller's only source of information about said future; moreover, the Caller is the Receiver's only way to influence the past.

There are a number of ways for Mary to weaponise this. Luring Rose to a location where there will be a disaster is the simplest.

Another way is for Mary to offer Rose a set of winning lottery numbers. Then (say) the name of a few winning horses in races to multiply those winnings. Then to tell her that the real money's in investment, and getting her to fund a number of promising inventions which, back at the time, failed for lack of funding but were solid aside from that. Then you may get a slight improvement in modern technology.

Alternatively, Mary can offer Rose fame as a mathematician, by reading out mathematical proofs that have yet to be invented in Rose's time over the phone. Past Rose can reap the fame, but the rest of the world reaps the benefit of slightly earlier discovery of certain results.
