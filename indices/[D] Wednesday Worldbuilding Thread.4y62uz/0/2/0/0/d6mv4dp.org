Alternatively, Mary could simply set in motion changes that have only a minor expected effect up until the date of Mary's birth.

Thinking about it, this is very much a "boxed AI" problem, with Mary as the AI-in-the-box. She cannot affect Rose's time /at all/ except by her words, which can only be delivered to Rose; and Rose has a number of ways to do nasty things to Mary and absolutely no incentive to be nice to her. At the same time, Mary has (from Rose's perspective) near-perfect predictive powers, at least of things important enough to be written down. If Rose agrees to write down a note tomorrow in a certain place, Mary can tell Rose what it says (unless she decides to lie) - since this note may include information that Rose only discovers tomorrow, Rose can use this to set up a shorter-term information loop for herself.

+Hmmm... and, interestingly, there is a symmetrical element here. Rose's note, tomorrow, can include things that Mary only tells her tomorrow. Mary can tell Rose tomorrow what the winning lottery numbers are, and Rose can (in theory) write those down in her tomorrow, which means that Mary can find the note today. (Since neither Rose nor Mary are trustworthy individuals, however, Mary should start looking into modern cryptography techniques and come up with some encoding of the information that she will be able to confirm that Rose had not altered the message when writing it down).+

No, wait, that won't work. I just realised, that requires transferring information from the M^{i+1} timeline to the M^{i} timeline.
