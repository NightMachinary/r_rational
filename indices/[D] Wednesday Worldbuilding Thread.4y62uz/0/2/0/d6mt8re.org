That particular development may not be optimal or even possible.

You see, in each M^{i} timeline, there's still a Rose around. What stops Rose from precommitting to, if she finds herself in a M-timeline, wait for Mary near that apartment for 32 years, then kill her and take the phone for herself, hijacking the Receiver position? Then she would be able to accomplish her own goals without any obstacles.

The only way to stop that is to make being the Receiver Mary's inherent property: exchange of information between P-timeline and a M-timeline should /only/ be possible if Mary was born and is alive in the M-timeline.

The consequence of it is that Rose can't make vast changes in her time, lest she would ensure that Mary can never be born, and then Time Travel Goes Away.

I was thinking about an isolated research group somewhere on the other side of the world, who would be told to send results of their research to Mary's email address 32 years later. Then Mary would send that information to P-timeline Rose, the research group would use /that/ as their input in the next M-timeline, and so on 'til the Singularity.

The problem is, why won't Rose simply imprison Mary? Mary would exist and be alive in this case, but won't be able to do anything. Is there a way to save Mary's agenda? I can't think of anything sans placing the transtemporal phone in a different location in Mary's time, so that Rose can't find her if Mary doesn't lets her.

...Oh. Of course.

Mary can lead Rose to /believe/ that the transtemporal phone is located somewhere else in M-timelines. Rose can't waste all her M-timeline selves' lives on stalking that apartment, so she'll give up on it sooner or later.
