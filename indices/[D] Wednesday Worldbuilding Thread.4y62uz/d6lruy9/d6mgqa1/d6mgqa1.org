Hmmmm. So, any /active/ effort from her gets prevented. What about any /lack/ of effort?

You say there's a way to find out the problem with her magic, but it requires the cooperation of another wizard. For the purposes of discussion, I shall refer to this as the Detection Spell. Let's say that she knows of another wizard capable of casting said spell. She hires him to cast the Detection Spell on somebody else, completely unrelated. And again somebody else. And again somebody else. Say, everybody in the city that shares her first name - except herself. And when he spots the gap in her pattern and asks if he should cast it on her as well - she says nothing, makes no comment positive or negative.

--------------

Alternatively; she uses a channel of communication that has no guaranteed recipients. For example, she posts a full description of what she knows of the spell - on a fanfiction site. As fanfiction. Including her real name, and address, in the vague hope that someone who knows her will read it. Then she writes the url of the fanfic on hundreds of pieces of paper, and scatters them around the city. Hopefully someone will figure out something, but she will have no idea who or how.

--------------

Alternatively, she works the two ends of the curse against each other. Let us say she has a rival - an enemy of sorts, but an honourable person. They've been competing, perhaps slinging insults at each other, massive competition between them... that sort of thing. Maybe she just strolls over to said rival, and just hands over her wand (or in some other way gives said rival the power to prevent her from using magic). This gives the rival a definite clue that something is wrong, and at the same time prevents whatever the curse has done to her magic from having any further effects (since she's now not using her magic).
