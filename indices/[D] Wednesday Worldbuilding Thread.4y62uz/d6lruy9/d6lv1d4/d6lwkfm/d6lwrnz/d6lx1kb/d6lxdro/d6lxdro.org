Okay, so in direct relation, when the curse does activate, what doesn't it do? The more you answer the better.

Does the curse leave others alone?

Does it affect others?

Do others get placed under something similar? Does it spread?

What's the source of power?

What happens when it runs dry?

What if 10000 people found out about the curse and then the character learned about it?

What if she went around telling everyone she's fine and not under the effects of a geass?

I already know or think i know how to abuse the curse but i need answers to the above.
