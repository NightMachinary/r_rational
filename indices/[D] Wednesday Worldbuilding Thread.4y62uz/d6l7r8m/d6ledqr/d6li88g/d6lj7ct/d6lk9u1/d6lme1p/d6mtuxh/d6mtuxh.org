I came up with an idea of how to bypass the imprisonment problem [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4y62uz/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/d6mt8re][here]], if you're interested.

In short, Mary needs to deceive Rose into believing that the transtemporal phone (and Mary with it) is located somewhere else in M-timelines.

That may be tricky, since Rose would know Mary's voice by then, and would try to check by timing the Call with her M!self being present near the phone, but there's no way she could catch an unsuspecting Past Mary on using time travel, so that's doable. Especially if the difference in time is not exactly 280512 hours.
