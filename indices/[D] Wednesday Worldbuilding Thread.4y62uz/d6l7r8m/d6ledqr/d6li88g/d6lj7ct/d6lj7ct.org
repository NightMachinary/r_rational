Oh crap, I didn't even think about Future Rose.

In the original film, once Rose's death is written into the immutable timeline then she's gone forever. But until then... maybe she's alive in the future, maybe she isn't. Maybe it changes from one timeline to the next. Sometimes she's alive, sometimes she's dead. Sometimes she's wormed her way into the unsuspecting Past Mary's life and become her friend, just to get close to Future Mary when her memories sync.

Does Rose honor precommitments to herself? There's several versions of her running around. If she doesn't consider her copies extensions of herself, then Future Rose should indeed be scared of the end of her timeline. But if rational!Rose has the determination to make plans over 30 years, in the knowledge that this version of her will die before they come to fruition, and still carry them out, then she becomes a lot more dangerous. (See [[/u/alexanderwales]]' story /Branches on the Tree of Time/).

Ugh. Mary's only bargaining chip is her identity - Rose doesn't a priori know anything about the future until Mary tells her, including Mary's name and past. As long as Rose can't track Mary down in 1979, there's limits to the havoc she can wreak.

Well, that and the fact that if Mary dies in any timeline, then she can no longer take a phone call (because she's dead) so the timeline can't change any more. Probably. Depending on how being the Receiver works. So if Rose wants access to her incredibly powerful time machine then she has to keep Mary alive, which means there are some changes she can't risk making. (In any case the time loop will eventually end of its own accord when a version of Mary is hit by a car or something.)
