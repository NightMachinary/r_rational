Question to explore: what happened in the M^{2} timeline during the period corresponding to the first phone call? Does M^{2} history record that the phone never rang until call 2? That seems like the simplest solution to me. If there was a phone call, it's one that didn't happen to the real Caller, and an important part of this model is that anything that happens in timeline P is real and permanent.

But this model is quite exploitable. It means that anything the Receiver does as a result of the phone call will be undone in the next timeline. This prevents her from setting up long-term plans, but it means she can e.g. spend lots of money and resources to acquire a piece of information, in the knowledge that she'll get her money back in the next timeline (but keep the memories).
