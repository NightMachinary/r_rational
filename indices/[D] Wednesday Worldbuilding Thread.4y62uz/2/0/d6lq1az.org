Case study: Mr. Kordana, the villain of a recent arc in /Freefall/.^{1}

If you're writing a rational story, characters are not allowed to act out-of-character to advance the plot. Their actions flow logically from their personality and their goals, and do not bend one inch to serve the needs of the story.

This still holds for stupid/irrational people. Their actions may not bend to serve the story either. They must follow their own internal logic, twisted though it be. And it must be the same internal logic throughout, character development notwithstanding.

Stupidity is not just reversed intelligence. It would be out-of-character for Mr. Kordana to angrily challenge an entire biker gang to a fistfight - stupid, yes, but not his particular brand of stupidity.

^{^{1}} ^{He's an idiot from the word go. His job, whatever it actually is, grants enormous authority with no responsibility or accountability. He's good at delegating problems to people smarter than he is, and he understands plausible deniability. On the occasions when he notices other people, he's incapable of empathy or tact. He speaks with all the poetry and emotion of an electricity bill, albeit one soaked in weapons-grade smugness. He never intentionally insults people, it just sort of happens on its own. He seems blind to the idea that if his actions hurt people, they might treat him differently because of it. Ask him about anything he's ever done and he'll explain why it was perfectly correct and what anyone would do in the same circumstances - and no, you can't convince him otherwise, we've tried. In short, he's modeled off the Pointy-Haired Boss from Dilbert.}
