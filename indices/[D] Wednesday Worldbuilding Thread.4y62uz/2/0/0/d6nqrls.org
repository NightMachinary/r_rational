Thanks I was hoping for an answer similar to that. It seems that when you're describing these characters it's the things like the priority lists that they have which makes the big difference in whether or not a person is an irrational or rational character. I'm thinking if I cracked my character where I sat the priority is and things they care about in a list and then I mix them up I can make it rather irrational character based on that priority list.

It seems to me that most irrational characters are not necessarily completely irrational but rather they have different priorities and ways they care about other people vs someone we would consider mentally stable or fairly rational.
