  an irrational character in a rational/ist world
#+end_quote

Do you really mean /irrational/, or merely /non-rational/? That is, does the character consciously decide to be 'not rational'? In the latter case, just look at most people on Earth!

In either case, I think the important thing is to think about orthogonal components of 'rationality' or 'general intelligence'. People could have the following in basically any combination: knowledge, experience, analytic/synthetic/spatial/relational/mathematic/linguistic intelligence, "willpower" (anti-akrasia), consistency in higher-order preferences, worldview (eg: what's the best route to power?), "moral foundations" (google it), and so on.

Many activists end up denouncing their opponents as evil, because they literally can't comprehend the real motivations involved. Frustrating in the real world, but a great basis for rational conflict in stories!
