Yeah basically what I would go for in an irrational character in a rational world where all of the laws fit together, character actions actually have consequences, etc, is a priority list which basically gives the character a list of attributes and things they care about. Then we jumble it up a bit which should produce the effect I'm looking for. Of course I'll play with the actual character creation stage myself a bit but from the discussion I've gotten what I was looking for.
