  Rephrasing the question: How do you create a believably irrational character in a rational world? What they do has real effects, and you can see that person doing it, but WHY they're choosing to do it may not make any sense.
#+end_quote

If the rest of the world really is rational, there's going to have to be a reason why rationality wasn't or couldn't be taught to them. Whatever cause that made regular use of rational heuristics impractical or undesired may help you inform their motivations (and their character)---whether it's a natural mental impairment, results from depression or other mental illness, physical damage, fetishism, memetic hazard damage, whatever.

Alternately, maybe they're not actually irrational. They could be rational with goals wildly orthogonal to everyone else's---in the worst case, a small-scale version of a paperclip maximizer.
