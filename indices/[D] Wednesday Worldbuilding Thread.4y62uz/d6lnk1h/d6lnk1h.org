This is a bit more abstract, but how do you craft an irrational character in a rational/ist world? Any techniques or things to keep in mind? I was thinking about this a bit the last few days. I want the world's rules and concepts to stay consistent but have a major actor make arbitrary decisions just because that's what they like to do. If asked about why they do, they can come up with reasons, but the truth is that's just the way they want it to be.

Rephrasing the question: How do you create a believably irrational character in a rational world? What they do has real effects, and you can see that person doing it, but WHY they're choosing to do it may not make any sense.
