Does the curse only prevent the victim from communicating about it, or from doing anything that would have a net negative effect on the curse doing whatever it wants to do?

If it's just communication, then since the curse is powered by ambient magic maybe your character could make a magic Faraday cage and cut herself off from the Earth's magic- assuming that's possible in your system. Depower the curse and go from there (though the plan after the curse is depowered probably can't involve communicating with anyone or the curse might trigger).
