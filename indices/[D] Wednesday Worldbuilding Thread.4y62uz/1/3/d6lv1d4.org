That's a gnarly curse to find yourself under. I think you made the curse too powerful and then need to scale is effects

It doesn't seem like there are limits to the curse. In a magical world with those sorts of things available, even if it's one out of 100k affected by it, there would be people actively researching and studying geass' like that and working on defeating them. What are the limits? A rationalist world of magic would limit the power of curses otherwise it's too easy to abuse.
