I'm sorry, I'm not getting all the information i need. I may be asking bad questions. Let's try a different approach. Give your spell at max 4 major effects and then a crystal clear list of where the limits of those effects are. Including any and all exceptions to the rules you can think of.

Any character afflicted with a curse who is mildly rational will explore the limits/boundaries of said curse. It may take weeks, months, or even years, but at some point they need to find a chink in the curses armor in order to bypass it.

Please give the curse some chinks, a weak spot, knowing what it does, you must define what it doesn't, and then define how your character will exploit that.

I say this because you seem to misunderstand me because the answers to two and three are wrong if the spell actually can affect others, no matter how small.

I hope i give you enough to think about, but ultimately you'll have to figure out the kinks in the spell.
