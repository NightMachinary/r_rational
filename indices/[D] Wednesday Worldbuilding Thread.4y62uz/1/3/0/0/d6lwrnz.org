Sure, but for me, the important question when making curses or spells is defining not what they do, but what they WONT do. In order for your character to defeat the curse the must first discover its limits and then exploit that.

So I'll restate my question. Where does the curse' powers end? Otherwise the human race, without similar power, is screwed.
