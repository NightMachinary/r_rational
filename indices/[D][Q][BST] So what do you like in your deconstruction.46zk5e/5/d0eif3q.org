Taking a good hard look at the premise and not looking at the most optimistic view of it, I think. It's the case in one of my fave fanfics, [[http://www.comicfic.net/fic/benway/xmanson01.htm][X-Manson (X-Men)]] (very dark) which explores the fact that Charles Xavier's 'school for the gifted', which takes in children under false pretenses and trains them according to the beliefs of one man, is effectively a cult. It only gets worse from then on.
