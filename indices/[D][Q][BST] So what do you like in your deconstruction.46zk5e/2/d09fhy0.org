I think a key factor you're touching on is how much is added to the story- your first suggestion is the technique of not removing anything from the concept/setting (simply filling in the details, just different ones from what is normal), whereas the second often radically changes things for its purposes (making blatant alterations to the core setting/concept in order to highlight the original's flaws).

To enhance your initial comment, I think it may be better to say "let's take this premise and fill in details that are a. reasonable factors of the premise and b. highlight the errors that more standard interpretations sorely miss." Neon Genesis Evangelion is (not surprisingly) a great example- it has all the important aspects of Super Robot series (teenagers piloting giant robots in a war against an overwhelming enemy), yet where other stories fill in the background with details aimed at legitimizing these teenagers are valid soldiers, NGE tackles how screwed up a setting that can be with different details- ones that emphasize the horrible conditions that can lead to that being deemed 'necessary', and certainly not highlighted as being a 'good' thing.

An example of your latter suggestion is something more akin to HPMOR, wherein Y completely changes the core character concept of Harry, and has him immediately begin flying in the face of whatever Canon!Harry did in the same situation.

All that said, I usually prefer the former, probably because it's more consistent in the works I've found. The latter often tends to be the domain of bad fanfiction (.net and 'official' both). HPMOR is a great example of that approach done well. I think a lot of works fall into that second category even when they think they're in the former.
