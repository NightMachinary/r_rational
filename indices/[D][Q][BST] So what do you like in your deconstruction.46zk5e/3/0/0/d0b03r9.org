  One thing it could be, here, would be a story where Superman establishes a new, Superman-based airline, and donates the proceeds to an effective charity, in lieu of constant direct hero work.

That would dumb. Space services would be much more lucrative and useful -- vehicle launch and recovery, soft landing mineral rich asteroids on Earth, transforming Mars and Venus, carving living quarters on Mars and the Moon, mass transport of colonists and supplies to Mars and the Moon in life support shells.

Has anyone done that well before?
