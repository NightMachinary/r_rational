Back when Usenet was a thing, one of my signatures was "In a superhero story, Superman jumps off buildings and flies. In a realistic story, Superman doesn't jump off buildings and can't fly. Deconstruction is writing a story where Superman can't fly but he still jumps off of buildings."

Characters do things because they work. If you're going to change the genre convention so that they don't work, it's stupid to still have the characters do them anyway.
