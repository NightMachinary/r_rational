Deconstruction doesn't have to completely defy all of the tropes, it can simply take the premise seriously and run it straight into a wall.

"Take this premise seriously" is the important part of deconstruction. What matters is that logic, rather than narrative expediency, rules the day. This makes a lot of standard stories fall apart. Sometimes to the munchkin protagonist's advantage, but generally to everybody's dismay.

My favorite deconstructions find the richer premise that had been hiding underneath the existing rules once the conventional premise has collapsed. That's a lot of the enjoyment in Watchmen and Game of Thrones. The adapted genre is so much more fun than the one it deconstructs that other authors become imitators in order to explore it further.
