(Go go gadget unsolicited advice!)

Serial fiction has more in common with television than it does with novels. Readers tend to like (and expect) little self-contained stories that push along the bigger plot or are all contained by themselves. So I thought this was a good chapter, but it's a good novel chapter; from the episodic perspective, not that much actually happened. We had worldbuilding, background, and a Chekov's Gun (possibly a few), but our over-arching plot didn't advance and we didn't have a mini-plot either.

Assuming that next two chapters occur during the same UU meeting, I think it's probable that if the text of all three had been released at once no one would say that it's slow, even though it's the same amount of plot over the same amount of text. This is probably the case even if it had just been one chapter released at a three-week interval.

(I assume there's something going on in the brain that causes us to process into episode-sized chunks without much regard for how much actual text there was.)

I enjoyed this chapter a lot. It didn't have any problems with pacing and the exposition was exciting, not boring. The only problem for me is that it cuts off right where my brain thinks that there's another two-thirds of an episode left.
