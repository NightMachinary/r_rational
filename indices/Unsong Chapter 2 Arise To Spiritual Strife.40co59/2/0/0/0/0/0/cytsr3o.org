I don't necessarily recommend changing course based on reader feedback; you can get yourself into some awkward positions. This was the number one thing that went wrong with nostalgebraist's /The Northern Caves/ and I think it would have been better off if he'd just bitten the bullet and ignored his audience in order to tell his intended story. (I've personally wavered because of audience feedback, but it's hard to evaluate the results from the inside.)
