Personally, I've always been confused that Kurama doesn't have 25 Charisma. You'd think a Thousand-Year Old Fox would be a bit more... /clever/ at getting what it wants from its host.

(Or just at getting the host to let it out of the box. Maybe the seal uses some of the bijuu's own power to run a communication-result simulator, and block any thought-messages from the guest that would lead to the host releasing the guest?)
