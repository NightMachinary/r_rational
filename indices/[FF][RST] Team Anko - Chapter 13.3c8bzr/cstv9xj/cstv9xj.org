For what it's worth personally at least the kurama scene was breaking my suspension of disbelief\characterization\rationality. its too much effort to break it into which part specifically, but it just seemed awkward to me..

it might not be too important as long as it will be stay consistent in the future, and the chapter generally was still an interesting read, but it felt somewhat forced.. like it sometimes feels when a fanfic wants a character to behave in a certain way and is hurrying there, so the transition between the pure cannon and fiction is not as smooth. anyhow as i mentioned its too much effort to be more introspective then this to point what specifically felt odd to me, hope this helps, or maybe it only felt that way to me so you can ignore it..
