I would agree. It was... trite, for lack of a better word. Kurama totally failed to impress me as the ancient demigod he's supposed to be -- this chapter, the very first time we meet him, makes him sound whiny and insecure. Stuff like word choice and the simple fact that his attitude turns on a dime. Naruto does /one/ nice thing and the creature wants to be buddies?

You came close with the "I'll be trapped for a hundred years; you'll just be dead" line, but every other piece of dialogue was predictable. Your version of Neklos in tTYE was scary, but Kurama is kinda lame.
