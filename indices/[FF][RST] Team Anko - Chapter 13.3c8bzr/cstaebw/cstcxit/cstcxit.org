Thank you.

Writing the Anko scenes was almost physically painful. She hates doing this, and it's hurting her emotionally about as much as it's hurting Hinata. Next chapter, her first scene will be her crying herself to sleep.

Kurama, on the other hand, I loved writing. Big Tough Nasty, but utterly baffled at this little monkey-thing that wants to be friends? That was so much fun. Don't worry, there will definitely be more of him...just like there will be at least a little more of Hashimoto. I'll be a little sorry when Naruto gets out of the hospital and I don't have an excuse to put Hashimoto on stage, but it's time to get Naruto back in the action.
