I really love Anko being a hardass. I like hardass military instructors in general; the introductory scene in Full Metal Jacket is possibly my favorite part of cinema.

That said, I understand the emotional charge behind it, and it makes her a richer character. I just wish I could say I /wanted/ a richer character in this case... >_>
