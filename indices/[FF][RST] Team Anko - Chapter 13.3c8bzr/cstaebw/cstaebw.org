Yay, more Shino x Hinata :)

Great scenes with Anko feigning callous indifference. She finally has the excuse to take the gloves off.

And Naruto/Kyuubi was way better than what I remember from the anime when they first meet -- the Fox is actually an interesting character. Lots of posturing and so on, but they manage to haggle their way down to a position of mutual respect, and I guess Naruto's superpower of getting people to like him is coming in handy.
