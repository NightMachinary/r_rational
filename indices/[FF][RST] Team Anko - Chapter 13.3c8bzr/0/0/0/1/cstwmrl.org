It's a Green vs Blue situation.

Pairings online are like politics or sports teams, and so are /spiders/ in a very significant way. Whole sites will support one or another, argue for thousands of posts that 'X should be with Y because Z', and write enormous counterarguments based on any number of different reasons to support their own position.

And like politics and sports, they snipe each other. They snipe constantly. Anytime anything shows up in the series itself that favors one over another (say before a relationship is resolved) they argue over what it means and attack the worse off side.

The trope term is [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipToShipCombat][*Ship to Ship Combat*]], and it's a real thing.

As such, many supporters of X pairing (usually a portmanteau of the two names of the characters, Naruto and Hinata pairings are colloquially called 'NaruHina' for example) are used to people who write or express a desire for another pairing being direct ideological opponents, who would love to attack them. They therefore preemptively lash out.

It's a *lot* like politics actually. And of course, some of them are insecure, and identify with their position as a major facet of their personality, and so they attack even harder and quicker at any perceived threat.

I feel like there's a sociology study to be had here, but I've yet to secure funding.
