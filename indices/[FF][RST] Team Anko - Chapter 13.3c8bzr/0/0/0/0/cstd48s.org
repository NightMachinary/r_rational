No, that's likely the answer. They have a specific pairing in their head and get grumpy when a fanfic sets the characters up in another manner. Personally, I don't really care about pairings, beyond them being well written. If the relationship is developed naturally and written well, I'll read and enjoy the thing, regardless of the characters being paired.
