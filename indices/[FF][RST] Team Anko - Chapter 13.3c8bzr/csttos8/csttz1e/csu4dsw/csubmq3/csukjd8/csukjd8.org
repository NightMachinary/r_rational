Hopefully when you talk about treewalking from a distance, you don't actually mean being able to hold yourself off of a plane like a superconducting levitator. That strikes me as being much more unstable, without the benefit of your flesh being right there to act as an anchor for the field.

In my own formulation, I imagine treewalking as being attractive only, and the field is applied only partially over the surface of your feet, depending on where you stand in relation to gravity. So if you're facing the sky, your soles are activated, while your heels support your weight (naturally some musculature enhancement has to be present to counteract the massive leverage). If your side is to the ground, the foot nearest the ground is supporting you while the foot above is activated. And if you're standing upside-down, both of your feet are activated.

I'm not sure how much I remember my structural mechanics, but I think that would make standing upside-down cost twice as much as standing sideways?

Anyway, in my formulation, I'm not really sure how putting too much chakra in would result in explosions. Maybe there's a critical density for chakra or something.
