Fair warning, you might want to stop reading. This is a Naru/Hina/Shino/Sasu/Saku/Kiba/Chouji/Neji/Hinabi (aged up)/Lee/TenTen/Shika/Ino/Gaara/Kankuro/OC/OC/OC/OC/OC group marriage fic with a (genderbent)Haku mixing in when she's around and Temari being wangsty because she desperately wants Hinata but has been thoroughly friendzoned...which eventually will turn her into a romance!antagonist who tries to sabotage the marriage.

Don't worry none of the siblings are romantically/sexually involved, they are simply part of the marriage.

There will also be another (adult) group marriage that offers guidance and support to the kids on how to make it work: Hiruzen/Anko/Kakashi/Guy/Madara/Kurenai/Zabuza/OC/OC/OC/OC/OC/OC/OC.

Obviously characters will be genderbent and/or sexuality bent as necessary to make all this work.

Oh, I almost forgot to say: This is /totally/ a troll joke. The above is absolutely NOT going to happen and noone will be aged up (well, aside from the slight adjustments I made on the Team Anko kids), or gender- or sexuality bent.
