Serious question: can someone explain to me what it is that people hate so much about the Shino / Hinata pairing? I have literally lost count of the number of snotty reviews and FFN messages I've gotten since this story started, all of which boil down to "this better not be S/H or I'm not going to read it!"

EDIT: I was bored, so I went back and counted. Something like 3% of the reviews are some version of 'I hate the ShinoHina!!1!1!!' There's a whole bunch more that are polite but address the same issue -- asking if that's what it's going to be, saying that they were hoping for "NaruHina", saying that they aren't fond of "ShinoHina", or whatever. I didn't count the ones in PM, of which there have been a bunch.

And then, of course, there's the guy who wrote to say "I just want to know where you're going with this?" /blink/ That's like saying "hey, can you tell me what the last page will be?"
