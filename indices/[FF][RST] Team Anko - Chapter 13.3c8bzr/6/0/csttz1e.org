I've actually got a mathematical definiton for all the chakra things that I've used so far; it lets me keep track of who can do what and how often.

Yes, the amount of chakra that trick used was /absurd/. The Bijuu are immensely powerful, but there are still limits. When you stray into 10 digits, even the Nine-Tails needs to stop and reconsider his life choices.

EDIT: fixed incorrect counting of digits.
