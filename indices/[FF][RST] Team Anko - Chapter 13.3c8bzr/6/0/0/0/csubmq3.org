Treewalking is normally done at a range of 1/4" and costs almost nothing. It gets more expensive fast as you move away, because the distance in inches is an exponent.

Shadow clones are ridiculously expensive, but most of it is an overhead factor. Creating one shadow clone is very roughly half a million, and an average jonin can create on the order of 5 without falling over. (Again, the vast majority of the cost is the overhead; the individual clones are cheap in comparison which is why Naruto can spam them.)
