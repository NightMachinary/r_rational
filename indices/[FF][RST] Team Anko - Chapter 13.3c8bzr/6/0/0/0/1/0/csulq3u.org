Check chapter 1. That's exactly what I described except that yes, you can both push and pull.

As to "explosions", I don't recall if I've used that exact word but, if so, it was mostly metaphor. Naruto has pulled too hard and crushed big chunks of tree / roof. He's also pushed too hard, in which case he blasts a chunk out of the surface and sends himself flying. In both cases some bits get thrown around, but it's not technically an explosion.
