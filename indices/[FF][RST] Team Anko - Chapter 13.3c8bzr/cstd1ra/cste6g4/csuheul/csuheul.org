Well no, of course not. It all depends on the way stuff is framed, though, and half the time people leap straight into 'friends with the Kyuubi' simply from talking to it politely and asking it's name, or occasionally have the thing female as an excuse for why this version of Naruto can genderbend/is a girl/whatever.

Although I always pictured the fox as male, going by personality and voice, it's likely the creature is genderless. Mass of chakra and all that.
