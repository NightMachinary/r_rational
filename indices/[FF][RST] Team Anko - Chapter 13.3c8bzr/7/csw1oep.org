How come Hinata didn't spot Anko before they arrived back at the cottage? I thought she was keeping the Byakugan on at all times while they were in Sound, or was I mistaken about that? I would have expected either her or Shino to detect Anko's presence first and at least attempt to come up with a plan to get into the cottage without being detected.
