Nice little chat between Kurama and Naruto, and it was interesting to see the prison is shaped differently to canon. Glad you didn't use the 'kit' thing common in fanfic, or make the Biiju female or something.

And we also got the reveal of what 'the plan' finally is, between the two non-hospitalized Genin and Anko. Seems the idea is for the teacher to be so harsh in training the students for them to attempt defection, presumably in a ploy. As a side-effect it's likely going to beat any problematic habits out of Hinata.

...I begin to suspect Hinata and Shino are forming a romantic relationship, actually. A crush, certainly.
