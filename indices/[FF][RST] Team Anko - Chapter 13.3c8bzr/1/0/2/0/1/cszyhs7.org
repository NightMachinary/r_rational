Wasn't Kurama in this. 9 tails was basically a baby Kitsune who somehow won her nine tails status from a God at a poker game and then proceeded to get super excited about how fluffy they were and chased them around...leading to the destruction of Konoha in the manga.

And it came across to me as almost a blatant parody of a harem fic. It was both hilarious and well written.
