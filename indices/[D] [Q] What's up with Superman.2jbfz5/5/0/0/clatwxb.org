Thanks! I try to put a lot of effort into my trolling, to give positive value to readers instead of being a social leech. Chaos is change, after all. I still meant the sentiments and emotional content of the phrasing (at least, when I wrote them I did).

I put the two lines in like that to emphasize how odd it was structuring things in that way. And how different this was from "reality" or the DC universe. Superman wasn't the only X factor you added in, was my real point. Removing magic (which DC regulates rather tightly compared to Marvel) and replacing it with this without further reason just seemed...off? And suggests that faketonite is a magic-analog, as well as a science-based creation.

And it got you to comment on it and at least briefly think about it some more, so it sort of worked in that sense.
