  Superman is still vulnerable to magic, but in this context, he's on our Earth.
#+end_quote

Boring. Why does everyone want a superman-only, no magic, no super-science universe? DC is rich with interesting characters and powers, and most of Supe's threats in the comics are Earth destroying super science, weapons targeted specifically at him, and magic. That rules out 2/3.

#+begin_quote
  For the sake of the argument, magic is energy...
#+end_quote

Why does this matter, if "magic" doesn't exist on our Earth? Are you saying exotic, extra-dimensional stuff exists on "our" Earth, then? What about other super-science?

#+begin_quote
  So different forms of energy possessed by extraterrestrial or extradimensional beings could pose a threat.
#+end_quote

Oh come on. No Green Lantern Corp, but you get your own OC extra-dimensional beings?

  Kryptonite isn't found on Earth, as shards of Krypton wouldn't be able to make it here.
#+end_quote

Then Superman can't be stopped. GG guys.

#+begin_quote
  However, a Kryptonite substitute can be created through nuclear fission experiments.
#+end_quote

Oh. Okay. Well, that's one hell of a good reason to fund "pure" science, then. Good thing we had that one on the back burner.

I hope he doesn't find this out and destroy all nuclear reactors on Earth at the speed of sound. With giant rocks +dropped+ /thrown/ from space. If he can throw them fast enough, they don't even have to be that large. Just solid nickle-iron core.

#+begin_quote
  It goes without saying that the creation of kryptonite would be like the creation of penicillin; a complete and utter accident that results from attempts to do something else.
#+end_quote

Are you /sure/ the DC gods and other magic don't exist on this Earth? Because this seems really, really lucky.

Still, radiation effects follow an inverse square law, where as space-rocks follow a standard kinetic energy model, atmospheric drag, and a sort of Coriolis effect. Right into your stupid head, if you think you can sneak up on EvilSuperman with an expensive, artificially created compound.

RationalEvilSuperman peppers a landing site from orbit before carefully approaching with a Geiger counter.

The endgame here is humans dusting all of Earth's atmosphere with radioactive faketonite dust. And Superman terrorizing the population of Earth with a HAM radio set and a nearly unlimited supply of rocks.
