Well, I wanted to take Superman and put him in our world to postulate his effect on it. I don't need to see Superman's effect on the DC world. It's clear enough throughout the comics. I wanted one variable X (our Man of Steel) dropped into our space, and for the creative subscribers of this thread to give interesting ideas as a result. And why quote my "magic is energy" line and question it when, right after, I then expand on what I meant by it? Also, I like the trolly undertone :)
