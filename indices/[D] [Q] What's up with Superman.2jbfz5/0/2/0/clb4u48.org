It depends - there's a definite trade-off involved. Bringing in the advisory committee before you've secured your position exposes you to betrayal and subterfuge. And testing your invulnerability isn't something you can really enter into lightly either - before you know that you can survive in hard vacuum, you probably shouldn't just go into hard vacuum. And what if your invulnerability doesn't extend to radiation, or biological agents?

Other people still have to be presumed to be a threat to Superman, unless he has some magical way of knowing what can and cannot kill him. That means that securing his position has to be a priority, given the kinds of enemies his mere existence implies.
