Shouldn't the advisory committee come first, possibly even before removing the kryptonite?

I mean, especially if we're talking about a superman of not exceptional intelligence, there are tons of ways of accidentally hurting large amounts of people. Superman accidentally forgetting to restrict his speed to less than around .005c in atmo is an extinction level event. Moving at mach speeds causes massive hearing damage to people too close by, the dust and rocks flung out from a rapidly dug canal or tunnel may kill bystanders, etc. With your mental operations only going at a human level, anything relying on speed to be worth it is dangerous.
