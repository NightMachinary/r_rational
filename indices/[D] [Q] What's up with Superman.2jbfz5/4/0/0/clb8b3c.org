On the contrary, being invulnerable is the only way having super speed can work without super reflexes. It does mean it is more dangerous, and also that you can only use different speeds for the adequate situations, i.e. FTL or 0.999c or whatever only works for interstellar travel and no, you won't find yourself inside of a star by accident because 1) that's extremely unlikely to happen by chance and 2) you can see it and correct course!

Of course then it becomes a bit boring (super speed becomes mostly super travel), but you can also have something intermediate, like a maximum speed of thought that corresponds to physical speeds of much less than c.
