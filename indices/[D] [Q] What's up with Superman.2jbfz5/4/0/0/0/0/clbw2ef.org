No, no, that's where I disagree: you can see a star like, for instance, the sun, coming from several light minutes away, so you can react before you find yourself inside it. In the same vein, an invulnerable character capable of traveling at supersonic speeds but without 'supersonic' reaction times (that cared about people and whatnot), would have to restrict supersonic movement to more or less empty terrain, such as the sky.

Eh, it's not important. I just wanted to make myself understood :)
