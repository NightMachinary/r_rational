In terms of maximizing evil:

- If destruction of the planet is straight out, I can still doom the world in a lot of ways. I could increase volcanic activity by tearing around the mantle at a significant fraction of the speed of light, and thereby choke out sunlight to plunge humanity into another ice age. I could also probably do the same by just chucking large enough rocks at the planet. Then I would be able to keep a small community alive through the cold and treat them as terribly as I wished.
- If evil is maximizing pain and suffering, then I guess instead I would pretend to be nice and friendly, and use the same money-making schemes as above to funnel huge amounts of research into virtual reality and immortality, then start funneling money into making those technologies simple enough that they can be run by a single person (under the guise of decentralizing important utilities). Then at a certain point I would start in on torturing everyone forever. The trouble with torturing everyone forever is that you actually need a lot of technologies to make it happen, and being Superman only really gets you the money to do that - the same scheme could in theory be used by Batman with only a little more difficulty.
