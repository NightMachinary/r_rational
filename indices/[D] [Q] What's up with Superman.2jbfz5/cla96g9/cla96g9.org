In terms of maximizing good:

- I would first remove any potential threats to myself. If I knew that kryptonite hurt me, I would scour it from the planet (either using my laser vision to disintegrate it into plasma or just picking it up in my lead spacesuit and storing it someplace that people can't get it). The vulnerability to magic is a little more serious, though it doesn't exist in all incarnations of Superman. Securing your own existence is a fairly basic first step. Depending on the universe I found myself in, scanning for extraterrestrial threats would probably be smart before trying anything too fancy. And if there are threats that I can't remove, or threats that would prevent me from doing the things that I want to do, I would try to take those into consideration. But assuming that I don't have much standing in my way ...
- I'd start my own space agency. The cost to put a pound of material into orbit is astronomical, and Superman can do it basically for free (okay, so it costs him some time as well). It shouldn't take all that long to get a Mars colony going with a nearly unlimited ability to put stuff on the planet. At peak power levels, it should be possible to restart the core of Mars and give it a magnetic field, as well as to do other geoengineering that might be necessary. A self-sufficient colony on another planet significantly reduces the risk that humanity would be wiped out. I'd also pour huge amounts of money into space travel so that if I were ever killed humanity wouldn't be totally screwed.
- I would complete lots of infrastructure projects - digging canals, digging wells, making tunnels through mountains to reduce travel times, etc. Those projects tend to have high costs and large benefits to society, and given my abilities, I would be able to mitigate those costs to a very large extent. Mostly I'd do that work in the third world, where the returns per time spent would be greater.
- Eventually I'd have to get into the problem of war. If Superman is at his highest levels of power, he can stop any war from happening, but that still leaves the underlying problem that caused the conflict in the first place. It would be easy for Superman to disarm the Middle East, but then what? Do I just force people to solve their territory disputes and religious quarrels without warfare? And if so, how do I do that short of threatening to scour their countries from the face of the planet?
- And I'd get a team of crack scientists together to help advise me on all of those things that I don't know about, and to come up with ideas for maximizing good that I didn't think about, which is mostly just good practice.
