"move FTL" is a bit funny to seriously think about without breaking all the known laws of physics.

And if we ignore that, and treat it like old science fiction treats it (the light speed barrier having as little signifance as the the sound-speed barrier)... then it all becomes dependent on how much faster than light we're talking about -- fast enough to contact alien civilization and bring back technological goodies, or just so slightly faster than light-speed (e.g 1.01) that it's qualitatively no different than if it was 0.99 light-speed?
