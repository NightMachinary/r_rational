Fair point, but I guess making Superman also ridiculously smart may be too much. How about we say he has regular above average level intellect? As in, if your average human with that intellect could probably get into MIT or Harvard, but isn't the next Einstein or Steven Hawking. Ergo: He doesn't have the mental ability to create the necessary technology for the immersive virtual reality you envision.
