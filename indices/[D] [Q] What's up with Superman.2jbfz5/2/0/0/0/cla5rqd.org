Agreed, but super-intellect would just make this issue too easy, in my opinion. It's already easy enough with his infinite strength, speed and sensory perception.

EDIT: Also, is that what you would personally do as the Man of Unobtainium? (A much more fitting name, realistically) It's not enough to say get everyone working together on whatever cause; what cause would you pick gabbalis? What would YOU do to maximize his potential to do good/evil?
