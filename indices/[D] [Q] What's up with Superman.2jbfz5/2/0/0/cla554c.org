Intellect is the strongest resource Superman has to do good or evil.

If we assume he's at a human level of intelligence then this is still true, it's just no longer his own intellect he should be abusing.

He can brute force world peace, vastly influence politics (Speech writers would probably pay to get a job working for supes), get everyone working together on whatever cause takes his fancy, be it immortality for mankind or a vast VR network.

He could do some other things of course, use his powers to to act as a [[http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2305][transitional power source]], or greatly simplify space exploration. Having NASA purchase his time may not be out of the question, and he could donate that money to further research.

Ultimately even if he wants to go evil he should probably do good first, helping people set up the infrastructure he will need to make a perfect self-sustaining distopian hell.
