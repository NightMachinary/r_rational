True, any machinations taken against Superman can't occur on the physical level. They are easily detected and undone. And let's assume he has no time travel capacity, outside of the time dilation afforded to speeds approaching the speed of light. Also, moving at these speeds is rather dangerous, on a physical level. In space, he'd be fine. But moving at these speeds near the ground would cause irreparable damage to Earth. I'm no physicist, but the shockwave from a man sized object moving at the speed of light would be disastrous, as far as I can tell. If shockwaves from aircraft breaking the sound barrier can break windows, imagine the destruction possible. Waves, radiation and particles moving at this speed is negligible. But a mass of around 225 pounds isn't.
