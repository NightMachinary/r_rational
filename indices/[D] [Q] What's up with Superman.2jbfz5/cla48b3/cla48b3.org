Highest power superman is ridiculously OP. He essentially has literal omnipotence short of kryptonite restrictions. He might actually legitimately be fast enough to gather every human and make a personalized virtual hell or heaven for every single one if he really wanted to. I mean this is a guy that when he needs data from an obliterated computer he just opts to take a second or two to rebuild it.
