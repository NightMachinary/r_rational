Assuming Superman doesn't care about the Earth, then yea, that's when it wouldn't matter. And you're correct, the chances of it happening randomly is unlikely. I moreso meant that, if you were limited to human level perception, then you wouldn't be able to react to anything at those speeds so, if you were unlucky enough to be on a direct path to a star, it would go from a dot into the sky to you being in the center of it before you had time to perceive it.
