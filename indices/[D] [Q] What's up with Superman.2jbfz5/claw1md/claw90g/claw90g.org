Super speed has to come with super thought, in my opinion. There's no point being able to move FTL, if you can't think at speeds comparable. You will never be able to utilize even close to your full speed. Esp with Superman, who is indestructible, and therefore has a limited (probably non existent) sense of physical self preservation since he has no need for one.
