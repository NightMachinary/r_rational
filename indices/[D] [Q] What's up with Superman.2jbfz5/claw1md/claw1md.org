With regards to your last point about Kryptonite, I remember reading once upon a time that it was explained as having "hitched a ride" with Superman's FTL drive (not physically on the ship itself, but swept along in the ship's wake). Hence also explaining why so much wound up falling on Earth.

Anyway, this version of Superman has super-speed, does he also have super-reflexes and speed-of-thought to go with it? If so, major feats of highly targeted heroism are possible.

He could literally disarm nations by zinging along and breaking each individual gun within it, finding them via x-ray vision. That's not a total "world peace" solution since humans can be quite dedicated when they really want to kill their fellow man (just look at how awful Rwanda was with mostly machetes) but it would likely be a good start. Lots of current-day wars would sputter out if the combatants didn't have any modern weapons. If a hotspot was /really/ bad he could disable all the vehicles too, slowing the pace of the war down even more. Aid distribution becomes a lot better too. Superman can bring pallets of food anywhere and is not affected by corruption or politics.

Superman can't /force/ us to get along, but he can certainly make it a lot easier.
