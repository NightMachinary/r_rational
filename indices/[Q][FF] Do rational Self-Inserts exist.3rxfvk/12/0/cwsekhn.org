I rate this fic "guilty pleasure"/10. It's got a Mary Sue SI who is sort of fun to read about but not really realistic in any sense. The SI barely seems to have, like, actual goals, so her progress towards her non-goals is erratic at best. There's a lot of filler and repeating stuff that already happened etc. Also, a lot of characters are distorted by the SI's presence. Wildbow wrote the following description of a Mary Sue:

#+begin_quote
  I've said it before, rephrasing: a Mary Sue is a character that bends the rules of the story (narrative, characterization, natural laws of the setting) much as a black hole bends light. Their existence will bend the rules.

  In another sense, the character distorts everything around them.

  The danger in tacking some flaws on is that you'll still be creating that dissonant, weird distortion where someone's reading what's going on and feels like things don't add up.

This description fits the protagonist of Of the River and the Sea to a tee - her presence makes other characters abandon all sense and act erratically and stupidly.

I still enjoy it as a guilty pleasure because it's often amusing.
