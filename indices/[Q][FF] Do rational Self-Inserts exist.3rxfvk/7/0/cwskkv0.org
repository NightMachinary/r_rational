Worth reading IMHO. The author wakes up from being cryonicly frozen, after a bad singularity and is trying to prevent another one as he explores the world of a broken singularity. Much hikinks ensue. There are some Mary Sueish aspects, but they are mitigated by the fact that it is implied seems some super-intelligences are using the main character in their schemes.
