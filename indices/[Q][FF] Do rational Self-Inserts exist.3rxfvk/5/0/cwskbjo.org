Thanks for the rec! I just got into the first chapter, but I can already tell I am going to like it... I've read 5 or 6 Naruto self-inserts (I've lost count... Dreaming of Sunshine, Walk on the Moon, The Forge's Fire, Rotten Rowan, a bunch of snippets of self-inserts, and 1 or two more that I foget), but this is the first self-insert that has the SI immediately being excited about it instead of angsting for their first year as a baby.

And reading further... an interesting reincarnation mechanic.
