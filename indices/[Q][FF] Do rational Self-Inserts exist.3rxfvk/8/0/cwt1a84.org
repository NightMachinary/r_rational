I've heard great things about this one, but I don't recognize most of the animes it's based on, sadly.

EDIT: Nevermind, this is really good and aside from the first universe the main character usually explains the must-know concepts.

EDIT2: Oh god, the second volume fully embraces genre savvyness. I'd never read anything like this, even though the SI really isn't trying to fix the plot, just fix his own fuck-ups.
