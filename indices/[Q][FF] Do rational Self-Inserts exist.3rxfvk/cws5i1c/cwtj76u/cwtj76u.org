Oh cool, people are reading my stuff. That's always nice :)

Just a PSA here, I wouldn't bother reading the last 4 updates: they're destined to end up in bin. I came to the realisation that they were happening because I wanted them to happen and not because of an in-universe reason, so they're getting scrapped. There's the trouble with scrapping canon: I have to figure out what to replace it with.
