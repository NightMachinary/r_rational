Sorry about that, I didn't read the whole post so I didn't see that it was mentioned that explicitly, I just thought it would be better to post here than to post at top level.

I don't mind using the fillers just because they are fillers. Fillers in the actual series can't advance the main plot. Using fillers in a fanfic is not limited by that restriction.
