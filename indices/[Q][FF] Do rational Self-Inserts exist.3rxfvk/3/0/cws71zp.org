I really like DoS but the author has stated that they prefer thinking/writing about administrative details and character interactions over fight scenes. Also the MC is pretty paranoid about not taking action based on future knowledge without hard evidence to point to. So probably not as much munchkinry as OP wants.

Also the author has an impressive dedication to adapting every single filler episode and movie, apparently. Those would be the weaker arcs you're thinking of.
