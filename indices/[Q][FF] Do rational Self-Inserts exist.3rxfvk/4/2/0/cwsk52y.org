The Mary Sue-ness was actually at a tolerable level for me... it was the lack of overall direction to the plot that really detractedd the story. I mean the main character makes all these careful preparations and their is apparently some conspiracy or something manipulating things behind the scenes, but the story goes off in another direction and then it stops just when it looks like it might get back on track.

Also, it was part of a massive collaboration self-insert project called Chess Game of the Gods where different SI and OCs are transported into Equestria into different bodies. Actually, by the standards of the collaboration, the Mary-Sueness of Myou've got to be kidding me wasn't even that bad, compared to some of the other characters: assassin sword smith diamond-wolf that made a sword so sharp it cuts air, a quarter-demigod Griffin that kills dragons with just a sharpened dragon scale... and those aren't even particularly over the top examples. The collaboration also suffered, I think, from never getting to some of the interesting events the had planned out for the future.
