  Also, by the way did the other CGotG authors reach a plan for a finale arc?

IIRC, plans were made for an event set some years in the future, where all the remaining (surviving and non-forfeited) chess-pieces got together in some scheme by which one of the pieces would finally win the Game, get the wish, have that piece's reasonably mortal-friendly deity win the stakes, and generally bring things to a close.

  Oh, did you have a magic system worked out? It sounded like your OC was going to eventually figure out something besides "Latin words are magic", and it looked like you had an interesting unifying mechanic in mind. If you aren't saving it for a future story, do you mind sharing?

At some point in Missy's future, she travels back to Equestria's past, performing various actions that set into motion long-term plots culminating in the present-day of the Chess-Game. One such action was adjusting Equestria's magic field so that it would respond to Latin-style invocations. Or, put another way, the reason spell-style magic works in the CGotG universe at all was... a wizard did it. :)
