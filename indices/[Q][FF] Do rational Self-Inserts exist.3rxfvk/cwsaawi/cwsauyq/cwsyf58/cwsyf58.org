I felt that it went OK through the initial chapters and with Paul getting a lantern, but him staying on with the YJ team, even after taking the oath to obey Wonder Woman and Batman (and using his relations with the team to reduce/channel the sanity-breaking effects of the Ring), seems a little forced.

It /can/ be written off as him wanting to stay in Diana, Alan, and Bruce's good books until the Gaia oath is completed, and also using the opportunity to rapidly build up networks amongst the cape-and-tights set and their allies (the Atlanteans etc) which will be useful when he starts worldbuilding in seriousness. As he notes, generally it's the supervillains who have been associated with attempting rapid leaps forward in commercially-available technology. Having a lot of allies and personal contacts in the Hero biz, plus a bunch of positive PR, could go a long way towards opening doors.

Even so, for a Rationalist story, it feels like there's too much of Paul getting dragged along in the wake of the existing superheroes - /reacting/, particularly strategically, instead of being proactive. He's got access to billions of dollars - why isn't he funding a new Silicon Valley for magitech, creating pro-magitech media, and lobbying for all he's worth to get it supported and promoted? Or researching what socioeconomic conditions produce highly educated, motivated, and well-adjusted people, and attempting to upgrade as many areas as possible to those conditions? Far too many chapters seem to consist of "Paul personally punches the superpowered enemy of the week in the face."
