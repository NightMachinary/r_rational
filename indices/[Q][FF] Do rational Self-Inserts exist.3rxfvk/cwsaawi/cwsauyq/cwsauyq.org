The problem of With This Ring is the setting. There's waaay too much going on for Paul to be able to fix it all because of all the crossovers, so the plot progresses "episodically" fixing one minor problem at a time. I grew bored of it as it refused to widen its scope. I read about 150k words before giving up.
