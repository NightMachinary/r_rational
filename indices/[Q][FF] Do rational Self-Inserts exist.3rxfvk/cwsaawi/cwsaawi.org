I feel like [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.272850/][With This Ring]] sort-of qualifies. The protagonist uses meta knowledge to win a lot of the time - it rarely feels like things break their way super hard because of luck or whatever. The protagonist Paul is inserted into the Young Justice continuity, as themselves without knowledge of Young Justice continuity but /with/ a power ring and very good knowledge of all sorts of associated DC Comics franchises, which knowledge they use to ensure victory an awful lot.
