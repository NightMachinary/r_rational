Harry Potter is perfectly suited for Peggy Sues/SIs because there are only a few balls in the air at any time, so the author can easily keep track of what changes have been made.

But there's still lots of opportunity for things to go wrong. For example where was the diary kept before CoS? If you raid the Malfoys' and it is hidden elsewhere, Lucius may be sent to Azkaban and then you'll never find it.
