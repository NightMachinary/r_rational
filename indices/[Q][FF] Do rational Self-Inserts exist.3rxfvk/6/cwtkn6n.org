[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11122077/3/A-World-Full-of-Monsters][A World Full of Monsters]] is a good Naruto SI and probably exactly what you're after, if likely dead.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/roger-roger-sw-si-ii-still-not-sithy-enough.311702/][Roger, Roger]] is the tale of a SI being put in to a regular b2 battle droid during the Clone Wars with foreknowledge of the animated series. Mostly focuses on military battles and the deceptions and plans the droid has to make use of to avoid being slagged by his sith masters. Gets a little sueish towards the end. Hasn't updated in a while.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/catalyst-exe.3322/][Catalyst.exe]] is the story of a proper AI in mass effect with game foreknowledge. Gets up to many of the ridiculous things you might expect a full power AI to get up to and is a surprisingly faithful rendition of AI in general. However, it also has the problem that the MC is a full power AI. So while that may or may not count as Sue powers as far as you're concerned, she's never going to be weak.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8525251/1/Effloresco-Secundus][Effloresco Secundus]] gets an honourable mention. It's not technically an SI, rather it is Hermione Granger in Sakura's body. I'm reccing it because it has wonderful fight scenes, the main character is decently rational (if not formally rationalist) and the characterisation is extremely well done. If your tastes are anything like mine, you'll love it.

I could have sworn there were more stories like this out there, but I guess I misremembered. Anyway, enjoy.
