Shikaku, you mean? :P

Thank you for the recommendation. ^^

  Sure the ball was dropped, but I can still enjoy the rest.

I can get past it, but it was a severe hit to my enjoyment, and I paused my reading there. I suppose I should get through at least the next chapter so it won't be staring me in the face when I start reading again.

I suppose I should have elaborated a little on my problem with it. It is not just a problem of realism, it is a problem of storytelling. Shikako was exemplary, and I want to see her rewarded for her astounding ability. Not being recognized for it is a shot to my emotions, because it is both something she deserved and something she could have used. It is painful. And the character herself doesn't even recognize that her performance was so good!

I almost wish I thought of her as a Mary Sue, because the level of investment I've given her so far makes my feelings so strong. If the lack of recognition actually made sense in context I would think of this as good writing, but it seems so senseless.
