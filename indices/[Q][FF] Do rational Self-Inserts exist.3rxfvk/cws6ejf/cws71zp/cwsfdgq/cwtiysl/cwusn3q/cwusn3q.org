I've read Dreaming of Sunshine a bit past Tsunade's intro, and I have to say the chuunin promotions were utter bullshit. Shikako's performance as part of the Chuunin Exam was exemplary (including dealing with Orochimaru and the Sound ninja), and her forfeiture was well-calculated. In addition, in the intervening month she aided the surviving participants with their battle strategy brilliantly. And then on top of that she led most of the rookie genin to take out Gaara and his siblings with excellent tactics and no casualties. Her own performance was nothing to overlook either, certainly better than Shino's and even Shikamaru's.

Mary Sue or not (and I'm not inclined to say she is, weirdly enough), this was an extraordinary fulfillment of duties, and it was witnessed by Kakashi, the other jonin, and all of the genin who were aided and commanded by her. She was the participant with the highest demonstration of command capability and greatest overall performance, and she wasn't even mentioned! Meanwhile, Shikamaru (who displayed less prowess in the course of the Exam, though he may be smarter), Shino (who displayed significantly less prowess, and is certainly not as command-worthy as Shikako), and /Naruto/ (who has not performed significantly higher than canon Naruto, only differing by defeating Neji) are promoted to Chuunin! Naruto's performance against Neji may have been sufficient to rank him Chuunin-level in terms of power, and that may be sufficient to promote him. But when the bar is set as low as Shino's performance and prowess, it is literally impossible for Shikako to be overlooked!

The only lip service paid to her in the chapter at all is "Sorry you didn't get through, kid. We recommended you be reconsidered ... but the Hokage put her foot down on anything less than complete agreement."

This is total bullshit. It is utterly unbelievable on the part of a realistic leader. I don't know if this was a decision made to stave off a Mary-Sue-ish feel, but in that regard it is utterly ineffective and unbelievable in the first place. If I was inclined to think of Shikako as a Mary Sue, I would consider the passage written, being unrecognized for your achievements by a higher authority and being recognized by lesser authorities as more deserving, as /more/ indicative of a Mary Sue! This is the largest strike against it, even bigger than the obsessive adherence to canon storyline (less Sasuke's defection), even bigger than obsessive adherence to the filler arcs (though I've only gone through one or two so far).

In a consistent canon, I would consider the Chuunin Exam itself to be completely separate from the actual process of promotion. It is already only loosely tied to promotion, so it is much better to call it a Genin Tournament. Entry into the tournament is, in its official capacity, a mission that genin teams take to represent their strengths to other teams and to the civilian public. I guarantee you that's what the other participating villages regard it as even in canon, and Konoha itself should be no different. During the mission, your performance is evaluated by not only the test proctors, but your peers and confidants. After the tournament (probably periodically, or after each section, actually), each participant provides a full report and debrief of the entire events. These reports are taken into consideration as with other mission reports, and determinations may be made on a group of genin, participating or not, disqualified or not, to be promoted to chuunin, based on their performance and on their ability to fulfill the mission parameters in a manner befitting a chuunin.

It just doesn't make sense any other way. And I feel Dreaming of Sunshine utterly dropped the ball.
