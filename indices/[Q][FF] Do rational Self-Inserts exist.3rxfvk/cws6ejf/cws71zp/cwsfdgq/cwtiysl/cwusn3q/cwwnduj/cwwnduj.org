From what I've read of that so far, it seems that the major problem is that Shikako has no lasting effect on anything. She has managed to change some things in the timeline, but never in such a way that there are any longterm effects. Haku is saved and Naruto is a chuunin and Sasuke is with Konoha... and those things may as well never have happened, since everyone goes on the same missions, Konoha faces the same threats, etc.
