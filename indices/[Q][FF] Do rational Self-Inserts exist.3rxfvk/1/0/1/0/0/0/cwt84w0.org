As someone who was never into comics, I actually quite enjoy that aspect of it. I get to learn who all these bit players are and make references to them now, without slogging through Superman is an idiot shennanigans. Sure, Paul is moving on societal uplift a little slowly, but keep in mind the time scale of this fic. He's been there for what, 8 months total? Even with a power ring, I don't think it's reasonable to assume he should have a dolmen gate space elevator and be mega - Musk already. You need public support and the kinds of resources money /can't/ buy for that.

Remember, this is very much /not/ a rational setting. Schizotech gets made on the regular, then thrown aside and forgotten by the general public. Only Lex Luthor really uses this stuff to its potential, and he has the slight disadvantage of being the sworn enemy of the most broken non-lantern hero in the world. Paul can't just tell people he's going to build bleed - fracture reactors everywhere because people would probably tear them down and then forget the technology exists.
