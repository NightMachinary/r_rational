It's been done, but it's usually pretty boring. Most SI stories rely on the main character not acting optimally, because if he did, well, things would end pretty quickly.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8902388][A Wizard Named Harry]] does this well:

  Dumbledore opened his mouth, but I continued rapidly. "Please wait a moment, sir. I've thought long and hard as to how to convince you, and the best I could come up with was eight words."

  He simply nodded, and I took a deep breath, and blurted "Tom Marvolo Riddle has eight horcruxes."

  That had to have had an effect, but I'll give the old man this much- he had a poker face that would do any card shark proud.

  "That was only six words." he pointed out.

  ....

  I nodded sharply. "Well, first and most important, Voldemort... or some weird ghost-bit of him... is here, stuck to Quirrell's head under that stupid turban. He's here looking for the Sorceror's Stone... er, Philosopher's Stone?.. that you've got hidden in the third-floor hallway behind Fluffy- Hagrid's three-headed dog thing- a logic puzzle with potions, a giant game of wizard chess, and maybe some other crap....

  ....

  ...where, I might add, you are a fictional character, and the boy whose body I've gotten stuffed into is the star of a series of popular childrens' books bearing his name."

  "And yes, I've read the series." I said, ignoring Dumbledore's look of blank surprise. "That's how I know about Fluffy and all that stuff, and fun little trivia like the fact that you're going to die of... Hell's bells, something or other, to do with the horcruxes I think... in five-ish years, that Snape is your double-agent because he still has it bad for Lily Potter and that he's going to hate Harry Potter... well, me, I guess... because I represent him never getting her, or that the teaching position for Defense Against the Dark Arts actually is cursed because of old Moldy, or... well, let's just say that it's going to be an entertaining ride."

  Dumbledore continued to stare at me for a while, then wordlessly handed me a quill and a piece of parchment.

  To this day I don't remember much about that night- just a lot of writing down of absolutely everything I remembered from the series, and then dreamless sleep.
