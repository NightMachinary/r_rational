I'm glad it was a learning experience for you. I did definitely enjoy reading it, it was just annoying gradually realizing that it was a deadfic. On my second read through of it (I liked it enough to read it a second time, I think I did the reread in-between HPMOR updates and before [[/r/rational]] had regular updates of new stuff), I noticed how the plot wasn't really reaching a conclusion or wrapping but instead adding new threads and twists.

Also, by the way did the other CGotG authors reach a plan for a finale arc? It seems like you and the other authors liked dropping hints and foreshadowing of some epic climatic battle against Tirek or the smooze or some other ultimate evil, but they never actually got that far. Plus, even if they had, I don't think it would have been really able to hold my attention because some many of their SIs and OCs were so OP even some ultimate evil from the dawn of the universe would have been smacked down without too much drama beyond the usual mid-fight power-ups.

Oh, did you have a magic system worked out? It sounded like your OC was going to eventually figure out something besides "Latin words are magic", and it looked like you had an interesting unifying mechanic in mind. If you aren't saving it for a future story, do you mind sharing?

  so no matter how low my urge to write becomes, I'll be able to tie up the story, unlike Myou've.

Maybe I'll take another look at your post apocalypse/singularity SI fanfic. I recall reading the first book of it, enjoying it at least moderately, but then realizing you had six books or whatever planned and I decided to hold off reading it after recalling that Myou've never got finished.
