IIRC, I enjoyed the first CGotG story, and after finding out more stories were being written in that 'verse, almost all of which involved high-powered Mary Sue shenanigans, I felt an urge to come up with a story which followed the 'verse's rules but avoided the protagonist being turned into an UberLeet Monster With Cool Powers.

I'll admit that things kind of escalated, especially once time travel shenanigans became merged into the CGotG timeline. And that, after a while, my urge to keep writing went away before I came to any resolution. One benefit of the latter, is that once I started writing my next piece of long-form fiction, I've been keeping in mind how I plan on bringing it to a finish - I haven't always kept the same finish in mind, but I've always had /a/ finish in mind, so no matter how low my urge to write becomes, I'll be able to tie up the story, unlike Myou've.
