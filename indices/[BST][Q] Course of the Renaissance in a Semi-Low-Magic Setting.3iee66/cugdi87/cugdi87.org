You talked about the end technologies, but I'm more interested in the social and scientific technologies. Advancement isn't going to come through magic alone, especially if magic has been around for centuries. It's going to come through new ways of thinking.

So, do they have the scientific method? What mathematics do they have? What institutions exist to promote learning and exploration of new ideas? Are there printing presses yet, or something that approximates them? Newspapers?

It is entirely possible that there are only minor technological advancements in the next hundred years; a slightly better way of plowing fields, a more efficient way to bind elemental spirits, a new type of forge that allows for more production of iron, etc. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_technology][Check out the Wikipedia page on Renaissance technology]] and note how little actual progress is made over roughly two hundred years. (The Renaissance as I understand it was mostly about culture rather than actual science.)
