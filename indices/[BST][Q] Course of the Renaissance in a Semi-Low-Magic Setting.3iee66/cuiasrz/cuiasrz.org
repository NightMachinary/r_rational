I would like more information about your magic. It looks powerful enough that, IMO, it would be widespread. But perhaps I'm misunderstanding something, so to clarify:

1) Do your magic require long chants/rituals? Or is it limited by any sort of Vancian system or slowly replenishing mana?

2) Is your magic efficient in combat? Can Wind mage kill someone by manipulating air inside his lungs? Can fire mage roast person (or at least part of his brain) in several seconds? Do they require relatively slow-moving projectiles? Can they block gunfire with windshields? What about charging soldiers?

Depending on those answers, mages can be far more efficient combat units compared to knights. If so, all medieval leadership would practice combat magic instead of jousting, and guns may be much less effective in reducing their power.

3) Is there any magic (maybe Thaumaturgy) which allows to significantly increase crop production? If it is, it will be used on any farm, and becoming good "farm mage" would be great career choice.

4) Can magic efficiently heal and/or increase lifespan? If it can, magic healers would be widespread among high class (and may be extremely widespread, depending on learning effort required). Renaissance may see mages moving from castles and mansions to public hospitals.

5) Can magic efficiently gather/analyze information (prophets, clarvoiants and such)? Won't be widespread besides royal advisors (and maybe military), but during Renaissance information magic may start to find it's use in police forces.
