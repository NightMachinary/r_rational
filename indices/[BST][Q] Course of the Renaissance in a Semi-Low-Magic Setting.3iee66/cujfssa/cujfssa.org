Important changes tend to affect a lot of people. The easiest way to make that happen is directly.

Can a journeyman magician create an automated manufactory without much difficulty, for instance? Then even if they only account for one person in ten thousand, you'll end up with wealthy producers switching to automated manufacturing and cheap goods all around. This requires a monied class with an interest in increasing their wealth and no more important uses for their money or their mages. If the start of manufacturing rests on automation, you won't see [[http://pdfernhout.net/beyond-a-jobless-recovery-knol.html][job loss]] as a result, but you're reasonably likely to see the same end.

Do mages have health-related spells? Especially if they're available to clerics who deal with the common people on a regular basis, we'll see public hospitals, increased life expectancies, less disease.

How much time does it take to do things magically versus normally? If a half decent magician can produce, say, barrels at a hundred times the rate of a master cooper, then there's an incentive to produce items with magic, even if the magician costs much more than the cooper.

In short, what good are mages? What ways of applying them seem obvious now but might not have previously?
