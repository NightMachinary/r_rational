I believe it worked something like your strength stat is as powerful as your combined score of the strength stat you earned during each level, which each level up 'resetting' your strength score -display-. So, if you went from F -> SSS (or whatever) during level one, you'd go back to F for level two but your actual effective strength would be Level1(SSS) + Level2(F). So, delaying the level up lets you put more into the Level 1 'bucket' before that bucket is permanently closed.
