I'm squatting [[/r/alexanderwales]] (and have been for something like three years, because why wouldn't you take namespace that rightfully belongs to you?). If there's ever a need to, I'll switch over to that, but I need a bit more under my belt first, I think.

(Currently [[/r/alexanderwales]] contains a bunch of posts that I like to refer to, so I'd have to clean it up a bit.)
