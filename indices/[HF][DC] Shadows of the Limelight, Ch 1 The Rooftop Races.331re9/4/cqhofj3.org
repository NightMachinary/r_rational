This is incredibly good.

The idea of fame directly converting to raw power, but practice (and intelligence I assume) being used to 'finesse it' is very intriguing. Obviously as we've seen here, a little finesse and unexpected action can allow someone with no power to finish off someone at the height.

So, of course my next thought just based on the powers seen so far is "If Welexi can create one-shot kill lightsabers that work on the most powerful foes, and those can be wielded by relatively normal people, why doesn't he make 20 and have a set of Ionion Hetaroi style companions to wield them?"

While a famous person with one powerset is certainly strong, a famous /team/ who creatively uses their powers together is potentially unbeatable. Each strength to all, each weakness covered by a friend's strength.

That was what made Weaver so deadly in Worm, she knew how to combine people and powers creatively.

At any rate, I'll certainly be following this. I'm going to give you money as well.
