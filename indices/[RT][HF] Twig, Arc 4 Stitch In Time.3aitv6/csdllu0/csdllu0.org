  There were also meat trees, in the natural-growing-meat sense and the â€˜gibbets and meathook' sense. Not too unusual, except they were ubiquitous.

WTF. Wildbow's prose is so tight and creepy. He is able to describe the picture of the header so nicely in one sentence and then go on and do an incredible amount of world-building in the second sentence. Not to mention that it's all from the casual internal commentary of a character who is embedded in this abominably unethical world of Franken-meat GMO taken to its freakish extreme. If those meat-trees vocalize and scream during thunderstorms, the bio-nightmare is complete.
