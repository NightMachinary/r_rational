I really enjoyed [[https://www.amazon.com/Cast-Under-Alien-Destinys-Crucible-ebook/dp/B01I8DTAKQ][/Cast Under an Alien Sun/]]. It has been since /The Martian/ and /HPMOR/ that I haven't loved a book this much.

The story is about a chemistry PhD student who is catapulted into another planet (no real spoilers there since it happens at the very beginning) where humans have been mysteriously "planted" many thousands of years ago and have developed into a culture akin to the Europeans in the 17th century. While it's a bit west-biased, it's really cool to see the main character using science and rational reasoning to get him out of troubles. There's a lot more to it but I can't recommend it enough.
