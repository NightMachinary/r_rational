I'm a little late to do this, but here's my recommendation:

[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ThisBites][This Bites]] is a self-insert into One Piece and I don't know whether or not to call it rational. The main character is genuinely clever and the authors are very good writers, but there's a lot of stunts that succeed partially due to good planning and for the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool][Rule of Cool]]. However, it's one of the better stories I've read over the past month or two and I was constantly laughing throughout and felt emotions towards the characters which doesn't usually happen to me when I'm reading.
