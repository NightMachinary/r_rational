Well, ish. My first playthrough was maybe seven hours long, though definitely not all in one sitting. It also has lots of replayability what with the different choices you can make, but for a new player who isn't sure it's for them, the fact that it doesn't /require/ very much commitment to play through it once might be a plus.
