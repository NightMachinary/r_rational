I read both of the main stories back when Yudkowsky mentioned them in the author's notes, but I haven't read them since then. I thought they were pretty good (and I should probably read them again soonish), but I tried reading a few of the other fics set in that universe and most of them seemed pretty blah. Maybe I just got unlucky in the ones I decided to try reading.

I can remember one where some pony and/or ponies came out into the real world in robotic bodies, I think, and I can remember reading that one all the way to the end but I don't remember anything about it other than that I found it interesting. There might've been a couple more that I thought were good, but I can't remember.
