I'm not sure what you should do either. However, /it would probably not be a bad idea for the people in this subreddit to be well acquainted with the plot of Caelum est Conterrens/^{if you're reading this and you think you know what this means, you're probably not 100% wrong}, so I'm biased towards you posting every chapter from beginning to end once a day/week/whatever-you-can-get-away-with. Yudkowsky codified the genre of "rationalist fiction," if it's good enough for him then it's good enough for this subreddit, right?
