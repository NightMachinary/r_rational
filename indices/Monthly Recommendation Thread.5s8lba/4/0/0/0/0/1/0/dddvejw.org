I've not finished HPMOR, honestly. I sort of.... got sick of it. So the idea of reading a sequel is not really interesting to me.

I think someone wrote on here that while HPMOR invented the genre of rational fiction, the genre has developed to such an extent that HPMOR might not be considered /top-tier/ rational fiction.

(myself I'm probably scraping the bottom of the proverbial rational barrel as I'm writing vampire yaoi set in a rational universe. Mostly consists of people acting appropriately cautious, communicating effectively, and an interesting transformation mechanic that I'm not sure exists elsewhere)

And now I'm very, very curious about the cryptic hint.
