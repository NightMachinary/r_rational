Thanks, I'll check out Animorphs though you might be right that we might have different tastes.

I have read Worm and thought it was overrated, to me it was tiring in a sense and it was raw enough that it worked on my nerves (I'm imagining some of the scenes in there might literally trigger some people) but I wanted to know how it ended so plowed through it. Can't say I'll ever read it a second time though.

Did like FiO and Caelum Est Conterrens, they were thought provoking though imo nowhere near as fun as HPMOR.
