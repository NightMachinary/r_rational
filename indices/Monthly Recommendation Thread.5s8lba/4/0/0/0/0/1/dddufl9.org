Oh lord. I have no idea what that is. Is there a decoder-ring for that?

EDIT:

Also: I'm not particularly fond of the ponies, I have a friend who's a brony and he has all kinds of Fluttershy nonsense everywhere and he tried to get me to like the show but I can't, but I still get a lot of enjoyment out of derivative works. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NL8h7Q8i4yA][Pony.mov]], for example. It's crude and vulgar and profane, don't click that link if you have a sensitive constitution. But no, Yudkowsky Himself recommended this particular pony-fic, reminding people of that fact should significantly dampen any possible hate.

EDIT EDIT:

I just found a handy Rot13 translator, and no, what I said has nothing to do with the contents of the story. It's meant to be cryptic.
