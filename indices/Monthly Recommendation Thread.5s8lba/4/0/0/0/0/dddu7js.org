I agree it's definitely suitable for the subreddit but my concerns were more along the lines of... would people hate ponies? And how many thousand words would people be willing to read per thread? (e.g. my personal number might be 2-5k words but I'm sure other people have different numbers).

I'm not sure what you're referring to about the plot of Caelum est Conterrens and /I read it two weeks ago/ so I'm feeling a little stupid.
