That's the problem, 90% of them are crap but the other 10% are excellent. I went through a phase a year or two ago where I was home sick for a week or so and I just read through a bunch of them, so I could probably curate at least half a dozen stories.

Stuff like /Caelem est Conterrens/ is quite long so might benefit being reposted in parts, so I could probably even spend the better part of this year posting something every couple of weeks (or more often if people would rather read one chapter at a time. I'm not really sure what the go is for completed stories...).
