I just re-read /Friendship is Optimal/ and /Caelem Est Conterrens/, My Little Pony fanfic that is really about friendly AI and the nature of consciousness (the latter story boasts the tagline, "As Horrified Eliezer Yudkowsky!"). It's an amazing universe and I got into it far too late (it's, like, 5 years old now which is eternity in Internet years). I'm considering reposting fics from the universe every couple of weeks to invite discussion on the ideas contained within. Is anyone else a fan of the universe and would be interested in it, or would find motivation to look into it if I helped curate material? (Since some stories from the universe are excellent, and some are pretty blah).
