I think the Narnia books are pretty anvilicious, and I wholeheartedly disagree with the anvils being dropped in most of the books, but I still enjoy the stories. I read all seven books the summer after kindergarten when I'd just turned 6 and I read them many times over the course of my childhood, I'm not gonna unceremoniously drop them just because I lost my religion when I got older.

As a transhumanist/rationalist/science-aficionado, I don't particularly enjoy Michael Crichton's "technology is evil and scientific progress is equivalent to 'playing god' (which is supposed to be a bad thing, apparently)" anvils that pepper just about every single book he wrote, but I still enjoy reading the Jurassic Park books.

The /His Dark Materials/ trilogy is often described as "Narnia for atheists." It's not. It's simultaneously /much/ more heavy-handed about its message and much more subtle about it; that's contradictory but I don't know how to explain it. It /is/, however, a fantastic epic fantasy.
