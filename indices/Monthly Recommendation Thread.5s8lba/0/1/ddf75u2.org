The thing that's kept me from checking out this series is that I've heard it's Anvilicious in its message about religion. As a spiritualist, I really don't think I'd enjoy listening to an atheist explain to me why I'm wrong, again. Is it actually as bad as I'm presuming it to be based upon /incredibly/ limited information and my personal biases, or is this more like Narnia where you can still enjoy the story without agreeing with the author's belief system?
