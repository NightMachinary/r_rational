I'm trying to remember what all transpires in the first 100 pages. I can't say too much specifically without spoiling things, but I can say the seemingly too-many plotlines coalesce into two by the end of book 1.

I guess I don't necessarily agree with the "nothing had been explained" label. I felt like the book very satisfyingly explained the events that were going on /as they would seem to an observer who didn't have the whole picture/, and then proceeded to reveal that picture.
