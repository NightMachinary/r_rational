I tried to read The Fifth Season a month ago and abandonded it. I got 100 pages or so in and the story still had not progressed anywhere, nothing had been explained, and lots of characters introduced. I struggled to care about anything, including reading the book. So I didn't.

Any reason I should pick it up? I should preface and say I read Jesmin's The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms and enjoyed that much more.
