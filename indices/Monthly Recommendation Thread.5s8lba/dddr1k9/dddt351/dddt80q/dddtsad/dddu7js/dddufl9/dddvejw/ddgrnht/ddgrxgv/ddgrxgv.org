I think Animorphs: The Reckoning is very good, and that's the one I've read, so we'll go with that for now. The Friendship is Optimal universe's stand-alone story Caelem Est Conterrens is also better than HPMOR, IMHO. (And it's good enough to horrify Yudkowsky himself, so you know...).

I've also heard good things about Worm, Metropolitan Man, Unsong and certainly others.

Then again, you are talking so someone who got bored of HPMOR and stopped reading, so we're probably not going to like the same things; there's no accounting for personal taste.

The article I read on this subject that I found really convincing was stating that one of HPMOR's faults is that it tended to include lots of lessons (i.e. it tried to teach you science/rationality). The article argued - and I agree - that rational fiction should /be/ rational, rather than /teach/ rationality. Teaching rationality is obviously a worthy goal but it's not the most entertaining premise for a genre of fiction... Obviously HPMOR may have expanded beyond that, but the early chapters were full of lessons about science, tracts about death itself being the ultimate evil, and so on.
