  or is this more like Narnia where you can still enjoy the story without agreeing with the author's belief system?

Much more like this. Both series move more toward their respective views as they approach the end. But honestly, I found /The Last Battle/ more anvilicious than /The Amber Spyglass./ I didn't get the feeling His Dark Materials was especially atheistic when I read it as a devout Catholic teenager; I just felt it was highly critical of religion as it was portrayed within the series. But considering the main religion of the series was like an extreme alternate universe version of Calvinism, I didn't feel my own faith attacked.

On the other hand, I felt annoyed by the end of Narnia because, ugh, he basically just plagiarized Revelation. And threw Susan under the bus. Still angry about it now, haha.
