I must strongly recommend Neil Cicierga's Mouth Trilogy (AKA what I've been looping for the past couple of weeks) to anyone who loves music. The first two albums, [[http://www.neilcic.com/mouthsilence/][Mouth Silence]] and [[http://www.neilcic.com/mouthsounds/][Mouth Sounds]], came out in 2014. (Mouth Sounds came out first, but it's been stated that Mouth Silence is intended as the first in listening order). The third and thus far final album, [[http://www.neilcic.com/mouthmoods/][Mouth Moods]], came out just this year.

They are expertly-crafted mashup albums that create a wonderfully surreal feeling that only barely relies on familiarity with the original song, if at all - indeed, I loathe a good number of the songs used, but am still continually fascinated with what Cicierga manages to make of them. The use of others' intellectual property means that they cannot be sold, but the work Cicierga put into the albums is very real, and actually greater than what many professional musicians put into their work. Cicierga's mashups are always a different experience from any of their composite elements, and on occasion what he's created is essentially an original song that merely uses a sample as its instrument. ("300 MB", a track early in Mouth Moods that plays Moore's Law for cosmic horror, comes to mind.) I can only hope that Cicierga will continue this in the future; these three albums are enough, but if he continues to put the effort in that he's put in thus far, I don't think the potential is ever going to run out.
