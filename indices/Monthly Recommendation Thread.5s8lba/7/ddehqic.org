In an effort to try and find some other good series while [[https://tiraas.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][The Gods are Bastards]] and [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][A Practical Guide to Evil]] update, I started working my way through some of the other [[http://topwebfiction.com/][Top Web Fiction]] suggestions. Thus, I've recently read Savage Divinity, The Zombie Knight, and am working on Super Powereds.

Problem is, I can't tell if they are rational or not. Well, I have other issues with them too, but specifically for this forum I can't tell. I still enjoyed them (some more than others), but I don't know if it's proper to recommend them. Just in case, though, I'll give a brief overview and my thoughts...

[[http://www.fictiongrill.com/savage-divinity/sd-chapter-1/][Savage Divinity]] is a reincarnation story of a man who finds himself in the body of a young slave boy in a fantasy world.

I wasn't a huge fan of it at first but the story grew on me. Unfortunately the most recent arc felt like a complete side story, which slowed down the main plot's action; and I got to the most recent updates just as the story got back to the main plot. The main non-rational aspect is that many things do seem to happen "for the plot," and a lot of the minor characters just seem unrealistically one-dimensional (assholes just for the sake of being assholes). The world building is fairly interesting, but it feels like a lot of reading is needed to get really invested.

[[http://thezombieknight.blogspot.com/2013/04/page-1.html][The Zombie Knight]] is about a teenager who dies and is resurrected by a Reaper in order to save people who are close to death. Now an undead Servant, he works as a sort of superhero to protect people in a world that is similar-to-but-not-quite-Earth.

Basic description aside, this is a different twist on the trope in that the teenager has a lot of issues not commonly seen in the genre. Hector deals with crippling shyness, depression, racism, and extremely negligent parents. It's unique to have a protagonist going through such "common" problems, which I appreciate. The writing, especially between Hector and his Reaper, is often extremely witty; however the story suffers at the beginning from being dialogue-heavy and description-light. This changes over the years (the series began in 2013 and is still going, though it went on hiatus for a while) and smooths out a bit, but it takes time. There's also trouble where a lot of things do seem to be done "for the plot," and often the rules of the world are pretty bent. "You can only control one element" when it comes to powers... oh, except for those who can control multiples. "You can only use one type of ability"... oh, unless you go into "hyper mode" and get access to others. I think the largest suspension of disbelief is that there are hundreds or thousands of these Servants, but the story begins as if no one knows they exist. It seems fairly obvious the world revolves around their actions.

I've seen this recommended in other places before, and it's highly rated on the top web fiction site, but honestly I don't think it's that amazing. It is a quick read compared to some other series though, as each update is often only a single page at a time. And the technical manipulation of some abilities (especially ones based on control of elements) is pretty neat.

[[http://www.drewhayesnovels.com/superpowereds/][Super Powereds]] is the one I'm currently working through and have really enjoyed. In this world there are people with superhuman abilities; those who can control them are called Supers and often rise as heroes, while those who cannot are called Powereds and looked down upon as social pariahs at best or walking catastrophes at worst. A group of five Powereds undergo a procedure that allows them to gain control over their abilities, and attempt to integrate in a hero certification college program for Supers.

I am currently on the second book (the third is current, four are planned) and am really enjoying it. Unlike the previous two series, this one feels the most rational. There is a big focus on solving problems through creative use of powers (or through tactics); the rules generally seem sane and consistent; and many of characters are driven by their own values... though there are a few notable exceptions to this.

Overall I think it's worth checking out; I am only about a third through the second book, but so far it's been really enjoyable.
