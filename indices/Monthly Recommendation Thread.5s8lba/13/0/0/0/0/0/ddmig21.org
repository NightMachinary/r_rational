I do! It significantly increases the average trashiness level of what I read, but I don't really mind that.

A problem I have in general is that due to a high reading speed and reading being my main leisure activity, I read an absurd amount of fiction and frequently run out of stuff to read. As a result, I often find myself trawling the long tail of stuff on Amazon.

There's enough which is on Kindle unlimited and good enough to be an enjoyable read that I easily get through 4 or 5 kindle unlimited books a month, which is plenty to clear it being worth the cost of the subscription.
