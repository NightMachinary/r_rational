I'm reading the touchstone series by Andrea HÃ¶st at the moment and rather enjoying it.

It's fairly straightforward young adult portal fantasy, but more Sci Fi than fantasy, with a reasonably interesting exploration of a society with ubiquitous neural interfacing.

Certainly not rationalist, but arguably rational. The protagonist is fairly intelligent, the setting is interesting and consistent, and nobody is holding the idiot ball.
