Gaiman's Graveyard Book would probably fit into the upper end of the range suggested (more for a 9 or 10 year old). It's not like super rational or anything, but it's an amazing book anyways.

When I was a kid, my favourite kid's novels were various Gordon Korman stuff - the Bruno and Boots books, I Want To Go Home, and other kid's stuff. They are pretty funny and enjoyable, and I read my copies of them so much that the rather cheap paperback bindings on most of them fell apart from wear. These are, again, more for 9-10 age bracket. These are very typical children's fare and not especially rational in any way.
