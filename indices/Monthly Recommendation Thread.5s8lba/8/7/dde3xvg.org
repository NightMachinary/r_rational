One For The Morning Glory is good past 7 or so. The Westing Game, and Ellen Raskin's other kids' books, are good. The Face In The Frost, by John Bellairs. The Way Things Work (with the mammoths). Oh man, haven't thought of this one in a while - Expedition, by Wayne Barlowe. Except it's probably a collector's item now.
