I also recommend [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nome_Trilogy][The Nome trilogy]], by Terry Pratchett.

"The main theme in the trilogy is the struggle of challenging society's accepted beliefs in the face of new information. This theme is recurring through the books and includes changes in the scientific establishment, political establishment, religious beliefs, accepted history and family values of the nomes." -Wikipedia

I remember liking the series myself and Sir Terry Pratchett was a phenomenal writer.
