Been awhile since I read them, (probably just about 10 years aka since I was that age), but I think the The Princess Tales books by Gail Carson Levine are great. They're short mostly humerus takes on classic fairy tales. I'd say they are probably a bit more deconstructionist as well though. Dragon Slippers was also one of my favorites at around that age, but I think it's meant for a slightly older audience.
