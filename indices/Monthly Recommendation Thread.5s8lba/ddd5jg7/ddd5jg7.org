Steven Universe has gotten so good lately that it actually physically hurts to watch it. "Last One Out of Beach City" might just be my favorite episode of television ever, along with "Same Old World" which is amazing and might be a great introduction to the show even though it's spoilery as hell and in season 3.

Plus, a reasonable interpretation of recent episodes is that the inciting event for the whole show is an AI took its given utility function more literally than its creators intended and then started encouraging other AI to self-modify their utility functions in the pursuit of the "rogue" AI's preprogrammed goal, so there's that.
