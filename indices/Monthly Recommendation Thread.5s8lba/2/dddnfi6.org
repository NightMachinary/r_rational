I've been reading [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33962948-perilous-waif][Perilous Waif]], the first book in a new SF space opera series by the same author as the oft-mentioned Time Braid. So far it's much better than all his other stuff, I'm impressed. It's set like 500 years in the future where much of the galaxy has been colonized by humans, and where body augments and 3D printers and human-level AIs are common as dirt. The worldbuilding has been stellar(heh), he's setting up an interesting universe to explore.
