If you start calling kilometres kloms, then what are the poor electrical engineers going to use for kiloohms? And if you start using cems, you'll just confuse poor typographers with their ems. Seriously though, those prefixes aren't there just to sound fancy, they have a precise technical meaning. Butchering them isn't a good idea. If you seriously need a shorter word for kilometre, just make up some slang like US army did. They use "klick" and it seems to work fine.
