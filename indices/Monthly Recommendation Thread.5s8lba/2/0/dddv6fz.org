The person in question wrote some interesting worldbuilding stuff for this book - the book itself, I haven't read yet. About [[http://wiliamscorner.blogspot.ca/2016/05/sf-setting-hyperspace.html][hyperspace]], [[http://wiliamscorner.blogspot.ca/2016/07/sf-setting-momentum-exchange-devices.html][momentum exchange devices]], [[http://wiliamscorner.blogspot.ca/2016/07/artificial-intelligence.html][artificial intelligence]], and [[http://wiliamscorner.blogspot.ca/2016/10/sf-setting-nanotechnology.html][nanotech]]. These articles are about trying to set up a physics that naturally creates the sort of stories he wishes to tell while avoiding problems that would destroy the plausibility of his stories, reconciled with our current ideas about these technologies, and overall they left me cautiously optimistic about the book. I'll probably get around to trying it soon, after I finish reading my current novel - his non-Time-Braid stuff hasn't impressed me but the worldbuilding looks interesting and well done.
