See, that doesn't surprise me at all. He doesn't over do it with the exposition, but it's still clear there's a lot of depth behind those concepts.

As cool as all that high concept stuff is, my favourite part of worldbuilding so far is pretty simple, his abbreviation for kilometres (kloms) and centimetres (cems). This makes it different and futuristic enough to not offend touchy americans, but familiar enough to be instantly recognizable. Tbh it's kind of mind boggling that those words aren't abbreviated in common speech already. Perhaps a big factor people resist transitioning is how unwieldy the words are in metric.
