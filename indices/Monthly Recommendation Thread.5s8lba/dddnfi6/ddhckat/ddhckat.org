I enjoyed it. Still a power fantasy but I felt the powers were far better integrated into the plot than some of the author's other work - like his Daniel Black series. Also, the author seems to have captured a real sense of scale in this work. Things feel big, which is often a problem in SciFi. My go to example for this is Elizabeth Moon's Vatta's War series, which ends up feeling tiny despite the author's best efforts.

I particularly liked the bot battles and the use of fabbers.
