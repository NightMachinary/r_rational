Oh hey, forgot this is coming up. Reposting my [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5rudyo/d_friday_offtopic_thread/ddczuse/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=rational][offtopic thread comment]]:

  I went to see "Kimi No Na Wa." this week. It's really good, and incredibly beautiful. Alas, not particularly rational, so if you get easily stuck on a out of nowhere 'mechanics' change, well, that happens once around the middle of the movie. (though you can kinda post-rationalize it once you know what was actually going on).

  It wasn't that important though, and I got back into it very quickly. So, strongly recommended unless one plot hole can destroy your enjoyment instantly :P (in which case, can you ever enjoy a movie anyway?)
