The Phantom Tollbooth is one I've seen recommended and which I remember liking when I read it. (Don't remember the details beyond that it had some math concepts explained in a fun way, since I read it like 20 years ago, so take this rec with a grain of salt. I remember it had some stuff about infinity, fractions, procrastination, etc... presented as part of story events.)

I definitely agree on the enchanted forest novels. Lots of fun.
