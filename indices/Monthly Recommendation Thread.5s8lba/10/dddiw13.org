If you enjoyed Harry Potter [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][the Alexandra Quick series]] is an excellent fanfiction that is even more coherent and darker, while following an entire cast of original characters in an original US setting.

Among the strong points are the well written, age appropriate children, credible factions that are morally ambiguous, competent adults, mysteries that need solving like in the original books, some amazing plot twists that actually make sense in the light of the information provided earlier in the story and a flawed heroine that is actually more of an anti-hero.

Cons: there are 4 books available, but the series is not finished and may be on hiatus.

Still worth the read though.
