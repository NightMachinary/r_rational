I am writing a fanfiction about a desperate zorian who returns to the start of the loop with most of his powers and has to quickly advance to solve problems.

Given the power to mind control people but not give them or you new skills, much combat might, and the ability to make spell items and new spells and such which offer moderate advancement, along with a time loop, what's the best way to ensure rapid singularity advancement?

Tech is Victorian level, and its a hard rule of the universe that you can't mind magic skills. Zorian has limited mana, and can't easily solve this problem, but can do a lot with mass mind control. Mass soul manipulation is risky because of an ethical goddess with him, although manipulation of necromancers is allowed.
