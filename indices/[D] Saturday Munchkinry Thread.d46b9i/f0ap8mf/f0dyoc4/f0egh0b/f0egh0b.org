Does the singularity have to happen within the time loop?

If not, one of the first things that comes to mind is using mind magic to implant suggestions to make mages (especially professors) more interested in mind magic, as well as looking into what causes someone to be an empath/natural mind mage and seeing if it can be reverse engineered. The eventual goal would be for there to be some critical mass of mind mages such that city or world size hiveminds could be (voluntarily) formed, which may or may not directly result in a singularity like event, but certainly provides a good foundation for one. This could easily take a century after exiting the time loop though.

If it needs to happen within the time loop, it depends on the mechanics of magical animation. Most of them seem like they work on a simple scripting-type system, where it's just “if this happens, do that”, and that doesn't necessarily mean animation codes are basically magical computers. If they are though, or other constructs are close, Zorian could just study and experiment the same way he always has.

Part of the problem with this is that there's no lasting infrastructure or objects between loops, besides souls.
