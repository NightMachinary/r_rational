Yes, while he could try to singularity outside of the time loop, angelic and interference makes it harder. They have some immensely powerful individuals with powerful scrying powers and connections with major church and royal powers if he hasn't singularity'd up before so he can escalate quickly.

Making people more interested in mind magic does sound good. States have immense powers of research when desperate and could do a lot of work for him designing more powerful mind magic so he could then control even more powerful people, identify the top mind mages and annex them.

I do intend for him to upgrade his memory later with access to divine magic, so making super computers sounds good.
