This is the important part. Forget evolving to their current situation, that just streamlines them a bit; they'll follow my orders without question.

I've got a personal army.

An army of what? Well, dogs (wolves?), spiders, ants, locusts... anything I want, really. I can easily make money as a lion tamer if I want (I just need to evolve the lion first) or other animal-taming entertainer; I can create and sell spider-silk clothing; I can protect myself with an army of ants (and use them for pest control, too, if I want); I can have an army of super-moles plough fields.
