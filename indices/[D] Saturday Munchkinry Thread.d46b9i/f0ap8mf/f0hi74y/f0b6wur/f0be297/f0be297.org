I'm imagining immediate Lamarckian changes, somewhat similar to that of an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_(2001_film)][implausible science fiction comedy]].

I'd probably visit factory farms. Elephant-sized spherical cows without appreciable brains that grow as fast as you feed them would be a boon, reducing animal suffering immensely. If cows are more advanced than pigs, then I'll jumpstart the mutton industry.

Actually, maybe I'd just start with an ant farm. If the situation is 'being harvested for food' it should work on them just as well, right?

I could also become pest control. Although the pests would get better at being pests, since they follow my orders without question I can order them to uninhabited areas where they become better at not interacting with humans. I'd have to be careful that I don't turn them into some sort of deadly super organism, but alas.

Have you read Worm? Imagine making spider-silk armor, but instead of spiders you've got eight-foot monstrosities extruding cable an inch thick. If I had to make conditions to trigger that evolution, I'd try something like putting my spider farm on a plate by a fan where the wind blows small spiders away. I'd feed them my ants.
