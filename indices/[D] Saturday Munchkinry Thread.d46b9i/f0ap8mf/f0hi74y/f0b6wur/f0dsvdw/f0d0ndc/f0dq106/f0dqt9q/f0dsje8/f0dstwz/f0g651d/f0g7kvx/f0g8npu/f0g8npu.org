Wait, they did? Must've missed that. Anyway, since even I'm losing track here, here's a quick rundown.

Animal is fine - Animal gets shot unless it cures Alzheimer's - animal is not being shot, has insufficient grasp of cause and effect to understand why - animal is shot for not producing cure for Alzheimer's.

Animal 2 sees animal 1 get shot - Animal 2 is not being shot - animal 2 continues as normal - Animal 2 is shot for not producing cure for Alzheimer's.

See? You can't threaten the concept of evolution. Shooting one animal because it didn't do what you want is the same as if you shot an animal in the other hemisphere.
