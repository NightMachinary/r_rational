I don't see how the animal's comprehension of cause and effect is relevant. Animals in the real world don't evolve because they understand what's killing some of them. They evolve because their environment is such that some characteristics make them more or less likely to reproduce, so the population gradually shifts toward more individuals having the "useful" characteristics, or toward those characteristics becoming more pronounced. If I take a huge population of grey moths and start killing all the ones that are too light-colored, I'm going to end up with a population of dark grey or black moths. The moths who die don't know that it's because they were too light in color, the moths who live don't know that's why the /other/ moths died, and evolution will occur even if I myself have absolutely no idea what has to happen biologically to produce a dark-colored moth. Extrapolating that to the idea of "rapidly evolving" an animal, I should be able to choose a moth out of this population and turn it dark, because the "current situation" is that there's evolutionary pressure on this population of moths that favors dark coloring.

I suppose you could argue that there's no conceivable series of intermediate steps between "doesn't secrete the cure for alzheimer's" and "secretes the cure for alzheimer's" that would make it possible for the animals to adapt to this pressure instead of just going extinct. But then again, real organisms have ultimately evolved amazingly complex structures and we can't always figure out what the intermediate steps were. Evolution is a blind idiot, but on long enough timescales it produces pretty elaborate stuff.
