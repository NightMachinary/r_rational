I think it depends on whether the power is capable of "filling in the blanks," as it were. We don't always know what series of intermediate steps led to a complex structure, but it exists all the same. So if this supernatural power can extrapolate, like, "a creature that can pass the test of its sweat curing Alzheimer's would be best adapted to this environment," then theoretically it could work even if I can't reward partial success. If it can't, then I'm restricted to traits that are on some kind of gradient.

Someone previously pointed out that the animals would more likely just become bulletproof, which I think is the best argument against this strategy. I mean, I could vary the execution method, but then they'll just get really good at escaping, or really good at killing me before I can kill them.
