I'm not following. The situation is that there's selective pressure on this population of animals to secrete the cure for Alzheimer's, since the ones that don't will be killed and never reproduce. Selective pressure applied by humans, or even applied by me specifically, is still selective pressure; I saw at least one other person proposed using the power on factory farm animals, which are selectively bred for growth rate, etc and are therefore under evolutionary pressure to develop those characteristics. I mean, if you want you /could/ add a caveat to the power that it doesn't work on situations that I personally arranged, although that takes some of the fun out of it.

I'm especially not following the distinction you're drawing between "speed up evolution" and "rapidly evolve an animal according to the current situation." If we're talking evolution, then what's relevant about "the current situation" is what kinds of selective pressure are being applied. It doesn't make sense to say, like, "you haven't shot this specific animal yet, even though you intend to shoot it if it fails to pass your test and have been shooting other members of its population that failed to pass your test, so it's fine and won't evolve"--because in that case literally nothing would count as selective pressure as long as the animal hasn't actually died yet, so the power would never be able to do anything at all. Natural selection works on populations, not individuals. I don't see how what you're describing could work in any other way than "evolving" the individual animal according to the selective pressures currently being applied to its population.

Another person suggested that the animals would be more likely to just evolve resistances against whatever methods I used to kill them, as long as doing so was easier than actually secreting the Alzheimer's cure or whatever, which I think is a very sensible argument against the idea I originally proposed.
