Evolution extrapolates by following a gradient, such that each and every single step on that path makes the creature more likely to survive in the environment. Hence, I assume that this power extrapolates in the same manner; that is to say, it must follow a path, and it cannot simply jump from A to B without passing through the intervening spaces.

If the power /is/ capable of filling in the blanks, as you suggest, then it is /significantly/ more powerful than I had anticipated.
