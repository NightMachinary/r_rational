...you shoot all of the animals. Now you have a pile of dead animals and nothing left to breed a new generation. Now what?

If there was some way that you could measure /how close/ an animal's sweat is to an Alzheiner's cure, and you leave the animals that are /closest/ to sweating an Alzheimer's cure alive, then I could see it working... but how do you measure how close the animal's sweat is to a cure if you don't know how to identify that cure?
