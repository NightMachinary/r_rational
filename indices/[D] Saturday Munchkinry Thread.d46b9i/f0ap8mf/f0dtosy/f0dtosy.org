Initially, do things to adapt animals to being farmed better. Factory farmed chickens, cows, etc, which can efficiently produce meat and eggs and such and be bred based off their potential.

Once you have start up cash, build a center where intelligence helps them get fed and gives them advantages, and uplift an animal to superintelligence. Through a series of rapid advancements and harder and harder puzzles you should be able to develop very intelligent beings. Initially, how well they can use language to communicate so they can develop better language. Later, how well they can use tools to solve problems. Other ones to improve memory and understanding.

For example, I might imagine a place where to get food and water and such an animal needs to solve programming puzzles, including building safe AI. You'd have lesser challenges initially.

Intelligence did evolve once.
