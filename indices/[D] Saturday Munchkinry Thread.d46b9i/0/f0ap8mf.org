You can evolve any animal according to its current situation extremely quickly, and the result will follow your orders without question. This does not work on people or anything more advanced than pigs, or less advanced than Moths.

You can also adapt slightly to the current climate, (I.e. gills underwater, body resistant to vacuum, etc)
