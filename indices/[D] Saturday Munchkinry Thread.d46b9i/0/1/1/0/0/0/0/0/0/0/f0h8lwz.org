There are two animals, A and B. They have a symbiotic relationship. animal A relies on animal B to remember things, because remembering things helps it survive better. Animal B gets alzheimers somehow. Animal A has absolute shit for brains and memory, so it's not likely to take over the role of animal B. Instead, it's subjected to the super evolution power and eventually produces a cure for alzheimers in animal B.

This doesn't seem all that implausible to me, at least in the context of the super power.
