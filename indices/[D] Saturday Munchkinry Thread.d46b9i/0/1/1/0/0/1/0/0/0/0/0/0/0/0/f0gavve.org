In a scenario where all animals who don't secrete the cure for Alzheimer's get murdered, secreting the cure for Alzheimer's will be the more effective solution? (Well, really it would probably be "become immune to the murder method," like the other person said, but you see where I'm going with this?)

Actually, I think the bloodline thing might actually make it impossible for the power to work at all. The whole point of natural selection is that not every bloodline actually continues. If we're taking it /as a given/ that this specific animal's bloodline persists for millions of years, then that kind of throws a wrench in the whole concept. I mean, if the animal as it currently is is well adapted enough to its environment to successfully reproduce generation after generation, and it's a given that /every/ generation of this lineage will succeed no matter what, then this animal's bloodline is basically exempt from selective pressure and it won't change in any way.
