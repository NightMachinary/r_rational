The thing is, what you're doing here is generating near-instant [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_computation][evolutionary computation]] - that is to say, it's quite possible to get very similar results in only slightly slower time-scales with properly designed software and suitably beefy hardware. If it were /that/ simple to use this power to create a cure, then you'd be able to define a similar methodology as a computer program and evolve /that/ into a cure - taking maybe in the order of weeks instead of in the order of minutes (and depending on the beefiness of your hardware that might be even further reduced).

The problem there, though, is that in order for evolutionary computing to work, you need a function that tells you how close to the desired solution your current options are, so that you can kill of the ones furthest from a solution and breed with the closest ones, repeating until you're actually close enough. Without that function, though - without some way to tell which creatures are secreting something closer to the cure than others - all you're going to do is kill all the ones not resistant to bullets.

Evolution's not magic. It'll only move towards secreting the cure if a /partial/ step along that path improves its odds of survival. It's kind of like a ball on a surface - it won't seek out the lowest point. It'll only roll down the slope it's on, even if that slope only takes it to a local minima far away from your desired target.
