Well...no, it doesn't make sense to me, because evolution doesn't mean getting bigger, or getting "better" in any sense a human would think about it; it means adapting to the environment, whatever that entails. If my rat lives in, I don't know, a network of tiny tunnels, and rats that grow too big get stuck and die, then "evolving" doesn't mean "getting bigger" for that rat. Or if whatever advantage increased size gives in fights doesn't offset the increased energy cost of maintaining a bigger body (plus any other disadvantages it entails), then evolving again doesn't mean getting bigger. Similarly, if having waterproof fur or not doesn't substantially affect a rat's chance of reproducing, then that population of rats probably isn't going to evolve waterproof fur. Maybe some individual rats might have mutations that make their fur a little more waterproof, but since they're no more likely to reproduce than any other rat, the waterproof-fur trait is unlikely to end up predominating in the population.

I think maybe you meant something other than evolving? Like maybe we're using different definitions of the term and that's why we're not on the same page? Did you mean like, Pokemon evolution?
