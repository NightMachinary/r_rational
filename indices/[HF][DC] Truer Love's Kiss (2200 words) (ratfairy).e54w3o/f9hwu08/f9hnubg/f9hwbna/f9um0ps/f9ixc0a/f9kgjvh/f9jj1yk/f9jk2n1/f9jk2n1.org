Hmmm.

If necromancy exists in this world, and the ghost of a particular person can be summoned, then one form of testing whether a ghost is still the underlying person or not is to attempt to summon up the ghost of a person still living. If the summoning succeeds, and the person is unaware that it even took place, then that suggests that the ghost has nothing to do with the person. If the summoning fails, or kills the person, then that implies that the ghost is the person, shorn of their flesh.

If the summoning works, is noticed by the person but does not kill them, then this implies a number of things; most of all, that further investigation and experimentation is required...
