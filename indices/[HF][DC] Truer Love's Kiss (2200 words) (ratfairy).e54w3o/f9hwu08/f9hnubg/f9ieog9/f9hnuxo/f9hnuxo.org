"Such as?" said the Oldest.

"For one thing, I still think we should have everybody in the village kiss him," I said. "Forget about guessing. Just try every possible match. Some young maiden might be too shy to come forward, or some old man -"

"You know we can't do that," said the Oldest.

"It would only take half an hour," I said. "We're talking about literally three minutes of any single person's time -"

"What other ideas do you have?"

"Travel to the city and find someone more versed in the lore of fairy godmothers," I said.

The Oldest clacked her tongue. "Is the wisdom of your own elders not enough for you, child?"

"Wolfer still sleeps," I said.

"Then wisdom is not the solution, for that we have tried."

The sheer folly of the statement floored me so, I could not respond in time for what was said next.

"We will build Wolfer a place to sleep until he wakes," the Oldest declared. "His house and business will be given to another. A memorial service will be held for him at the morrow, to say us all our farewells, for it may be that we will not see him wake in our own times."

I said nay, but I was not heard.

At the wake-without-a-funeral, Wolfer's mother and father wept over his living body. As though, for him to be declared dead in the eyes of society, made him dead; as though the possibility of his return meant nothing to them, if others did not name him living? If this was what they called family, then small wonder that their own kisses hadn't sufficed. I watched with stony eyes and kept my silence. To say what I was thinking out loud would only have hurt Wolfer's own bonds and ties, come the hour of his return.

At the last Wolfer's sister cried over his body, and brought before him the young hound he had been raising to say its own farewell.

The little creature had no idea that Wolfer was supposed to be dead, of course, only that it hadn't seen Wolfer in a while.

So the puppy licked his face.

...

"I am told," Wolfer said to me afterwards, "that you went before many women of the village, guessing who might love me. And that you asked them - indeed begged them - to kiss my sleeping lips."

I sat with my hands folded in my lap. "Yes," I said in a controlled voice.

"Some people seem to think this means you must not love me very much," Wolfer said, in cautious tones.

"I am not sure that I understand their way of thinking," I confessed.

"Me neither," said Wolfer. "To me it seems like, fairy godmothers and their definitions of love aside, and the other people in this village and their definitions of love aside, you have demonstrated a great deal of love for me."

My heart began to beat again. I went to where Wolfer still sat recovering on his bed, to sit beside him and lay my own head against his. "And the fact that you appreciate that is why I would take you as a husband before all other men," I said, trying to put all the real affection I had into my words. "Maybe the lesson the fairy godmother was trying to teach was that, while human beings may love, asking for any human being to love 'purely' is asking the impossible."

"Should we even care?" Wolfer said. "In the end, fairy godmother lessons may make sense only to the fairy godmothers themselves. Even if sometimes the story has a moral that makes sense to us humans, we don't know if that's the moral they had in mind."

It was a very sensible remark, and it affirmed to me again that this man of all men was one I might sleep beside without strangling him.

And we lived ever after, sometimes happily and sometimes not, for such is the fate of beings as complicated as humans. In time our children were all grown and my own breath grew harder each winter, so that I thought the end of my own life might be drawing near. Then Wolfer and I journeyed together (as strangely few folk do) to the great crypt where Queen Elsa sits self-frozen, kept undying by her own power for the sake of what her power preserves; and we threw ourselves together, hands bound by ribbons, down the icy slide before her throne. In time to come, we would be brought forth from that crypt, by beings more straightforward than fairy godmothers. Their aid meant nothing and taught nothing, except that somebody had wished us well. And as one who had tried it both ways, I found it a more pleasant lesson to learn.

This came out of asking for help with short story ideas at a Gratitude Day party. As I then had to expand upon, for a short story plot, you need (1) a *conflict* and (2) a *resolution* to that conflict which (3) can be depicted using only a *small* amount of development.

Lacking item 1, you don't have a story idea, you have a story setting or a story element or one event inside a story. 'Premises' like "What if Naruto was on fire?" can be generated without end, but aren't yet even the seed of a story; it's not a difficult or very valuable part of story-generation.

Lacking item 2, you have only a question - one whose answer, if it is answerable, might be a story idea.

Lacking item 3, you don't have a *short* story seed, you have a novel seed. That's why finding a fascinating conflict (item 1) doesn't yet do most of the work when searching for a *short* story idea. Most possible resolutions to a conflict won't have the rare, valuable property of only requiring a small amount of development beforehand. The hard work is finding a conflict with a possible resolution that can be a *short* story.

In this case, as Erica Anneke Edelman retells it, Jonathan Wolverton had poked himself on one of Erica's needles. Erica then threatened to break up with Jonathan if her kiss didn't wake him up, but said that, if so, she'd take up the quest to find some other lady or lad to do the job. This was presented to me as the story idea "What if your kiss wasn't true love enough to waken him?" I said that this was an interesting idea to use for requirement 1, a conflict, but this conflict needed a resolution that could be depicted after only a small amount of development. After which Erica thought a moment and said, "His puppy licks him." Whereupon I clapped my hands together and shouted to the whole room "Yes! That works! That's a resolution that only takes a small amount of development!" and I wrote the story that same night.

You may perhaps think that the actual story written contains theme and emotion that isn't explicit in the conflict "Her kiss didn't waken him" and the resolution "A puppy's lick does". But that part feels much more reliably doable than 1-3, which is why I don't list "4 - potential for depth" as a necessary requirement. The subtask "find a bunch of depth to put in" doesn't have a completion-probability so low as to call the supertask into question if not addressed in advance. In this case, for example, I initially thought the fairytale's moral was going to be about polyamory; after the first draft I went back and edited those parts out. In retrospect, of course, if you are hunting for emotional depth, the more interesting part of the premise "What if her kiss didn't waken him and she had to look for somebody else?" isn't the part where she's looking for somebody else, it's how she feels about her own kiss not having wakened him. And of this you must find something to say that is not the first cliche that comes to mind. But that sort of thing, I can figure out on my own, often by leaving it up in the air to figure out after I've begun writing - so long as I've gotten the *much more difficult* requisite of a conflict resolution that only requires a small amount of development.
