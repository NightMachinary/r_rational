The commentary on the relative uncommonness of cryopreservation here doesn't reflect reality very well, I'm afraid. In this fairytale setting, the cost of cryopreservation is near zero. Presumably they need someone to stack the patients efficiently in the crypt, but that would be the work of a few minutes for about four people. After that, no human effort would need to be expended on maintaining the preservation, as Elsa's power presumably maintains the structure of the crypt as well as the preservation of herself and her subjects.

In real life, cryopreservation has significant costs. Yes, the monetary costs are paid by taking out a life insurance policy on yourself, but not everyone can realistically afford even that. The costs in human time are also many times larger. You need a team of around six people on-site to begin the preservation, then you need people to maintain the facility and the dewars, all for an arbitrarily long time. I'm not sure I believe that, if human effort were almost entirely removed from the equation, cryopreservation would be nearly as uncommon as it is.
