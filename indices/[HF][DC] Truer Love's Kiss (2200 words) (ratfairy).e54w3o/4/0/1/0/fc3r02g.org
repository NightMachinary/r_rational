Obiously you have to kill everyone as babies which most likely go directly to heaven whithout needing to risk them not being converted.

And yeah also kill everyone converted and try to convert and kill everyone else. You are probably going to hell for it because Christianity seemingly runs in the kind of deontology that makes murder wrong regardless of the fact you are literally just sending them to a better place , but it would still be the most heroic act anyone has ever done . Somebody has to and nobody will and all that.

Fortunately almost no cristian actually thinks like that, humans have mechanisms to prevent us from taking our beliefs too seriously because our abstract beliefs are usually wrong.

Problem is now that we have science which alows us to actually get correct beliefs it's difficult to get people to actually take their consecuences seriously for stuff like xrisk, climate change or whatever.
