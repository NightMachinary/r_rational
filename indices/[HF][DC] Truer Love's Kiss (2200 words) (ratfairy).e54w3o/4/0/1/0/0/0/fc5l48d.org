Yeah, that makes sense I guess. I was thinking what my own vague position on morality says about killing people in a world were killing people just sends them to the afterlife, in cases where sending them to the afterlife is preferable to the alternative (a possible hell or whatever).

And I don't see killing in that hypothetical world as very bad. Death doesn't seem to be that big of a deal if the afterlife is better than here. It would be still a bit bad since you kind of temporarily separate them from their families(although you could also convert and kill their families) And they might not consent to be killed which makes it more dubious. But if hell Is really bad it might be justified to do so anyway, especially if convincing them to let you kill them might cause them to not go to heaven because of the suicide prohibition.

And I could totally see parents wanting to send their children to heaven after baptism if there was obious evidence of heaven, and obious evidence of the possibility of either hell or ceasing to exist for adult sinners. Even if that risked their own souls.

I imagine in the hypothetical world where evidence of the afterlife is obious and there's a prohibition against suicide a lot of people would kind of want you to kill them or at least allow you to. In wich case I don't see any problem whith doing so(unless God also counts that as suicide).

If it would be good to kill them if they don't want to be killed is a more complex situation that kind of depends on the details of why. Babies don't know enough to care about that kind of thing so the morality of killing them becomes more about what the parents think.

But of course I don't want to convince you you should go arround killing babies :b I didn't think you were Christian and was just assuming you subscribed to the usual consecuentialism arround here. So I was mostly memeing.

The whole morality based in God thing is really weird to me because I don't see any reason to care about the standards for morality of some entity outside myself, unless I know the entity shares mine. And entities that don't just send everyone to heaven don't seem likely to share my morality but that's a diferent discussion.
