I prefer functional descriptors to labels. In the case of this thought experiment, I fall back on "the ends do not justify the means." As a Christian, I see a choice as moral only if both the means and the end are not sinful by God's standards. (And since I believe that God is omniscient, I take it as a solved problem that His categoricals are accurate to our universe, planet, and species.)
