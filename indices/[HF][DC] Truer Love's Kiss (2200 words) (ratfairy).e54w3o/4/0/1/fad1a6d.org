  If it was that obious that there's a nice afterlife they might have already killed themselves.

Unless specific to that particular afterlife is a prohibition against killing one's self, or some other goal that requires one to actively avoid death.

I remember once playing out a thought experiment. How would one create a Christian evangelism-themed video game? Instead of fighting enemies, one would convert them. Ah, but they might backslide and lose their faith. Well then, we just kill them after they're saved. There they go, straight to Heaven. But that's murder, and it puts the main character's soul in danger! Ah, but if they're saved and in the best place possible, doesn't that make such a murder a /good/ act? And that's where the train derails.
