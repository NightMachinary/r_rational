There is a cruelty to the fairy godmothers, though they don't mean it that way; there is a cruelty to their love of lessons and surprise twists. If a man falls ill of a deadly sickness, his fairy godmother cannot just heal him. Oh, she has the power to just heal him, to be certain. She has the power to transform mice to coachmen, if she pleases. And if you are a human you have the power to thrust your own hand into a fire and leave it there to burn. But it is not in the nature of a human to do that. And it is not in a fairy godmother's nature to just heal a man's sickness and be done.

So I knew, I knew that moment when we were all gathered in the town square. That very moment a fairy godmother pronounced before us all that Wolfer had been put into a healing sleep from which he would waken with a kiss of love that was pure, I knew. I knew my own kiss wouldn't work.

Right as the fairy godmother finished speaking, everyone turned to look expectantly at me, the one who Wolfer had promised to marry. If I'd had the power myself I might have cursed them, for humiliating me so. Did they understand nothing of fairy godmothers? If it had been that simple, the fairy godmother would have imposed some other condition instead.

It still hurt. It's one thing to laugh to yourself about how your own passions don't resemble the fancies of a silly little maiden, and another to be told that the fairy godmothers also find your heart's warmth lacking.

But I tried it. Of course I tried it. I knelt before the fine white cotton bed on which Wolfer had been laid to rest, hands clasped in repose like the guest of honor at a funeral, and I tried it. The lesson might be that I did love him that much after all, and shouldn't have let a fairy godmother trick me into doubting. It might be -

It wasn't.

I straightened up from the fine cotton bed, looking away from where Wolfer still lay unmoving. I did love him. I did. I just didn't love him enough, or my love was insufficiently pure. I'd been angry at Wolfer sometimes. There were aspects of him I did not love. Anyone who'd damn me for that had no love themselves for human beings. With thoughts like that I held back my tears.

I think it must be that fairy godmothers don't care as human beings do, or maybe can't help themselves from acting in this way; for if they enjoyed the hurts they deal us, they'd have the power to hurt us more.

Wolfer's mother and his father and his sister, at the least, didn't curse me for failing. They had their own inevitable failures to bear. One by one they knelt before Wolfer's bed and laid their own kisses each to his forehead.

But Wolfer did not waken.

"Don't be ashamed," Wolfer's mother told me, after it was done. "If you love Wolfer as much as his own mother does, that's nothing to be ashamed of."

"What do we do now?" said the sister, looking from one of us to another.

"I'm thinking," I said.

"In a practical sense," the father said in a thick voice, "we must set up a sign by Wolfer's tannery that there is no business to be done there for now. Someone must see to the hides he has in process. His garden must be kept, his hound fed, and precious things taken from his home where they would be unguarded."

"But who is to kiss him?" said the sister. "If none of us, then who?"

"I'm thinking," I repeated.

On the first day I made guesses. Who in the village could have laid their eyes on Wolfer, or had his eyes lay on them? What was it that Wolfer liked in a woman, if that woman wasn't me? Of such truths about themselves, fiances are little inclined to tell their fiancees. In truth I had been curious, but I had not asked; I regretted that now. But if Wolfer was awakenable at all, there must be someone who loved him, or someone who he loved, with the love of a maiden's fancy and a passion out of stories. I had to stay upon that hope if I wanted to continue.

Wolfer had praised my hair for being golden like the sun, and Shileia's hair burned a brighter gold than mine. So to Shileia I went, saying that although I had no idea who, there must be somebody in the world who loved Wolfer more than I, and so I was going to everybody that might possibly be, with no specific ideas and no offense meant, to say that if so they should please just kiss him - yes, I did love him myself, but I wanted him back - if I'd been trying to stop other women from kissing him, in this situation, it would have made me the worst manner of - no, I wasn't accusing Shileia of trying to steal him, we couldn't help who we loved -

By the third day I'd given up on having horrifically awkward conversations with people who insisted on taking offense like the utter idiots that they were. Instead I asked the Oldest Elder to pronounce before the entire village that if any woman thought they might love Wolfer, they were to try kissing him, and nobody would be held to blame. There was an hour of the night set aside for it when the act might be done in privacy.

Still on the fourth dawn Wolfer lay still. Ten times at least that I knew of, his lips had been taken, and I owed favors for it.

On the fifth day I announced before the whole village that if, perhaps, the person who loved Wolfer was not a woman, he should please kiss Wolfer anyways. There was a scandal at that, and one person clutched at her necklace and pretended to faint. I think I will never deep down understand how the people of scandal think; I cannot imagine what it feels like from the inside to be one of them.

On the sixth day I asked my elders after the lore of fairy godmothers. I asked after kisses, and pure loves, and enchanted sleeps.

"Have you considered that maybe the kiss isn't supposed to be on his lips?" said Old Grandma Ogg, but she was shouted down by several others that at least our village's fairy godmother wasn't one of those fairy godmothers, for which we could all be grateful.

"The thing that worries me about the enchanted sleep is that it implies a delay is necessary," I said. "It implies a story with a lesson that can't be learned today, for some reason. What if Wolfer's true-enough love won't be born for seven hundred years?" What if the only way to love Wolfer 'purely' was to know almost nothing about him, as of a maiden coming across his sleeping form a thousand years hence when his name had been forgotten?

"Aye, many of the most famous stories are like that," said Old Grandma Katarina. "Queen Elsa froze her sister and her sister's husband both, until the alchemists came up with a cure for his Necrotic Wilting. Took half a decade, that did -"

"Queen Elsa wasn't a fairy godmother!" Old Man Tanly interrupted. "No fairy godmother ever puts somebody to sleep for five years exactly. When fairy godmothers put somebody to sleep it's either done the same season, or a century after. Or at least after everybody they know is dead."

My hands clenched, where they lay upon my dress, but I said no word.

"I wonder why the fairy godmother added the requirement that the true love be pure," said Old Maid Melenna. "Well. I suppose I'm not wondering, really. We can all guess what Anneke and Wolfer have been doing." She gave a disapproving cluck of her tongue with deep satisfaction.

I went on sitting and listening. Perhaps, at some point, one of them would say something important.

On the seventh day, I was asked by the Oldest, in solemn tones and in the presence of witnesses, whether I had any more ideas to try for waking Wolfer.

My heart froze in my chest. "Of course I do," I said at once.
