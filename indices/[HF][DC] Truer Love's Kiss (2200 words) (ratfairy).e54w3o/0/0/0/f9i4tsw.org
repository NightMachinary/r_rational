Most trips are cheaper when you know they are one-way. It's true that peasants who aren't in the immediate vicinity of the capital might have difficulty, but anyone with any kind of property or business to sell could make one trip if they sold everything. People in the real world don't do that sort of thing because there's almost nothing in the real world (aside from arguably cryopreservation) worth throwing away literally everything for. In a world with objective examples of successful resurrection from cryopreservation, however, it should be well known that this is a real, worthwhile thing.

That's not the world we live in. The total cost of getting cryopreserved is a significant fraction of the lifetime earnings of most middle-class Americans. We also have no examples of successful resurrection. Yes, I agree with the argument that the likelihood of resurrection from cryopreservation is unknown, while the likelihood from any other method is zero under current understandings of physics, but there is no proof of tangible benefit. Rather than asking people to go to a specific location for a procedure with known efficacy, current cryopreservationists are asking people to pay large sums (over long periods) for a procedure with unknown efficacy.

I am personally convinced that cryopreservation is a good idea. The only reason I am not signed up is because, like so many other members of my generation, I cannot afford it. I also happen to be young enough that de Grey's most pessimistic estimates of life expectancy escape velocity would be sufficient to save me, but that's beside the point. The world presented in this story is different enough from ours that I do not think the arguments presented in it apply to ours.
