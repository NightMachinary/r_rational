If it was that obious that there's a nice afterlife they might have already killed themselves. And death wouldn't be considered a bad thing, that causes people to cry(although I guess it might still be in a world whith an fterlife because human emotions are adapted to a world we're death is bad) And killing wolfer would have been an option to be considered since it would be preferable to eternal sleep. And if the afterlife isn't nice it still makes sense to freeze yourself.

But there might be an afterlife anyway, just not obious. It's certainly worth investigating.
