For me it's pretty obvious that this stories resolves around Giovanni building the ultimate weapon against the birds, wich is mewtwo.

Even red psych powers are probably in the story so he can connect to whatever happens in the final battle.

And since that is true, the title must mean something about mew. It makes sense with the rest of the plot. Whatever the rationalization of the origin of species be, it will be about mew/rocket cloning him/mewtwo.
