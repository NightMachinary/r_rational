Generally speaking, there's a hierarchy of the controls: subtle manipulation may be harder to detect and longer-lasting, but is overridden and slower than more blatant effects. So if a victim is slowly being conditioned via a Pavlovian-esque manipulation, then someone overwrites their personality entirely, the overwriting will probably override the conditioning. Likewise, someone who is compelled to go kill the mayor, if possessed, would do the bidding of the possessor. And even then, if someone controlled the body, the possessor would be just as helpless as anyone else to stop it.

Does that make sense?

This is a long and convoluted way of saying, "sort of, but it would be cutting off your nose to spite your face." Also, there is a (justifiable) suspicion of anyone who has these powers, and therefore using them in this way would be a last resort, if at all.
