While you have no powers yourself, you know that in this world there are those with the ability to manipulate minds. The exact nature of these abilities varies, and it can range from possession to rewriting hierarchies of desire; from puppetting bodies to issuing specific compulsions or mandates. There will always be some 'tell' to the mind control, however.

You are in charge of a paramilitary security organisation. What security measures do you put in place? What kinds of checks do you implement to tell whether individuals have been compromised?

At this point, my ideas are regular psych evaluations and surveillance analysis of gait and mannerisms (to catch if someone suddenly walks or talks differently). If someone is suspected to be influenced, implement protocols where everyone is to be observed by at least two others (either physically or through camera surveillance, randomly assigned each time), and specific individuals thought to be compromised put through an fMRI scan and analysis of micro-saccades.

Feel free to come up with ideas for 'tells' in your responses.
