What happens when an object reaches the edge of my range travelling c-fractional? For that matter, how does the atmosphere behave relative to my 'held' object while inside the wibble-bubble?

Because depending on that answer, I'm either Skybreaker the Destroyer or dead without significant secondary powers focused on things like radiation hardness, superstrength to withstand major organ damage, and fireproofing.

If atmosphere is problem, just go live in Luna and throw rocks like Mike.
