You have telekinesis. You can move any object at any velocity with your mind, at limited range (say, 10m), one object at a time. Except you can only affect "things" on a human-scale (can't affect individual particles, or any "part" of a thing), like chairs, desks, humans, forks, etc.

Your goal is to help as many people as possible.

Other than becoming a human battery, what are some plausible ways to leverage this ability to maximize do-gooding?
