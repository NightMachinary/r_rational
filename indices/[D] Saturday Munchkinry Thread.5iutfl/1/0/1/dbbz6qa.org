You know, it's never said that you can't affect yourself with your power. And if you can move at arbitrarily fast speeds, as long as there's a distinct path it's effectively teleportation. So your space launches could have you pick up the target with your mind, take it with you up to space at the speed of whatever-you-like, then give it the right orbital velocity and let it go on its merry way before coming back down.

We might not even be limited by FTL here, so that's an easy way to potentially get to the nearest solar system before lunch with a 10m radius sphere of telescopes and life support to document everything. The only major limit would be ensuring your trajectory and making sure you have a way back (wouldn't that be embarrassing).

If there are aliens, you're the best chance at finding them we'll have for a long long time, and who knows what else you'll discover along the way.
