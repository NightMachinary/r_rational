Space launches are the easy and simple answer.

Depending on the specifics, I could act like a giant cannon and launch items at >=12 km/s from a standing start. They wouldn't experience any acceleration because it is a magical change in velocity, instead of a rocket-induced one.

Alternatively, I could lift myself up by the bootstraps and get to space that way.
