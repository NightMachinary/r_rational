  You control all the giraffes, how do you conquer the world?
#+end_quote

I'm assuming this to mean that you can give fairly straightforward instructions on the level of "tolerate a rider", "go here", "pick this thing up" --- basically enough to make you qualify as the most epic giraffe-tamer ever. However, you can take the Giraffe-Skitter option, as though Our Lady of Escalation triggered in a wildlife preserve instead of a bug-infested locker full of toxic waste. This means you get additional multitasking and finer-grained instruction capabilities.

So, what's your plan?
