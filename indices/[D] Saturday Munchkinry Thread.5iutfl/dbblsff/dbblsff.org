You can teleport yourself and any objects or parts of objects that you are lifting against gravity. This means you take all of your clothes and whatever you are carrying with you, but you leave behind the soles of your shoes and socks. If you are carrying something which drags on the ground the part on the ground is left behind. You can not teleport into or out of water, or while suspended or in mid air.

You can teleport about as far as the horizon, and can go through locked doors into any space with room for you. Conservation of momentum applies, so best avoid jumping on and off of moving trains.

You are on the run from Secret Government Project and just learning to use your powers. What interesting exploits might you discover?
