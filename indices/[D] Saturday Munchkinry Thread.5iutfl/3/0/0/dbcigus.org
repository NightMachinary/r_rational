Sorry I don't understand the first one. You can break things which are partly touching the floor, but only very near the floor. The amount that's left is whatever would have staying upright by itself, so only a small part of the bottom of a pole, for instance. If you lift an object that is chained up you can teleport and break the chain. I hadn't thought about pole vaulting, but that would probably work assuming you could select a safe place to land.
