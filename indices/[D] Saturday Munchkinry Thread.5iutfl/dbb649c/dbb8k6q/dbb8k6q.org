I can't remember where I read this, but there is an entire field of mathematics (in Japan I think?) devoted to origami and someone proved a theorem that any three dimensional shape can be constructed from a piece of paper. The catch is that it will likely take an exorbitant number of precisely made folds. They even came up with an algorithm to figure out how to make a snake as an example and made one /including the scales!!/
