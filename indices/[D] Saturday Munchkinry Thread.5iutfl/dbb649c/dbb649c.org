You have the power to cause paper to spontaneously take itself through the series of folds to make an origami figure. You can do this at will to any paper that's in a six foot radius centered on you. You can also "charge" a piece of paper to become origami at a later time, but time delays of more than a month don't work - the charge dissipates after that point, so the folds are unstable. The difficulty of folding scales linearly with the volume of the paper - so thicker paper is more difficult. After practicing this for a while, you can affect a 3ft by 3ft square of normal thickness paper, and your ability seems to have plateau-ed there. Your goal is to become a world-famous assassin.

Alternatively: a world-famous assassin with this ability is coming after you -you've been tipped off somehow. How do you defend yourself?
