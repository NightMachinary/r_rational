Are there other possible triggers, or only constant time delays? Is there a cooldown or can I tell a whole stack of 3x3ft normal paper to each fold itself? Can I make a bird flap? Can I make a circular saw spin? How long would it take to tell a miniature golem to repeat a motion for a month? Has the printing press been invented? Does it count to have enough money to hire assassins that don't mind pretending to be me, or targets that don't mind pretending to have been killed by me?
