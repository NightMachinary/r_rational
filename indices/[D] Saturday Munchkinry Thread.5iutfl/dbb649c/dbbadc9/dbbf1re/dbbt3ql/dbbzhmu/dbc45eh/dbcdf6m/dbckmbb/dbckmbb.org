After some golfing, emulation of [[http://www.indiastudychannel.com/pictures/gallery/cypercop007__download.jpg][this keyboard]] and execution of its output should fit within 140 characters, and then I can use a literal printer (or screen, for light-based keyboards) to replace that keyboard with one that interfaces better with printers, and then I can code at a computer under reasonable speeds and ease of duplication.

Still, that's only mass-production of a one-month-magic-laptop per hour. Can I also detect what direction light comes from, so that I could throw face-recognition software at the input, instead of merely fingerprint and voice recognition software and folding pin-hole cameras when I'm sure no one's looking?

How does output work: Do I manually provide one/multiple API calls to specific fold patterns that can be used one/multiple times, or can the code specify them? Can rapid activation produce audio output through vibration?

...let me get this straight. Ripping a laptop in two produces /two/ laptops!?
