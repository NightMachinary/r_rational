In material aspects, there's nothing special about the paper while it's folding (i.e. it's not supernaturally strengthened and can only exert as much force as you would be able to exert by pushing paper against an object). If it's impeded, it folds as much as it can until the obstacle is removed, at which time it completes its path. However, this is subject to the same time delay rules as before.
