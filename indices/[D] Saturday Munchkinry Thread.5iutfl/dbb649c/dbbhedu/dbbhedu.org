The first things first, is to study making custom paper and researching machinical concepts( I used to make paper springs at school, so motion is possible). Poisoned paper and "self" launching papers should do the trick, although it should only work the first few times and should be saved.

Can I make a long range weapon of some kind? Paper folding into a gun perhaphs

Can I fly a tiny paper airplane into someone's pocket and have it suddenly unfold? If so I just need to find a way to kill someone with a tiny piece of paper

How strict is the definition of paper, printable electronics do exist, worth a try, may be able to make a trigger for a bomb this way
