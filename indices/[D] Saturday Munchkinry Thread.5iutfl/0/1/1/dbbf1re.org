Yes to the printing press - I was imagining this taking place in our present world. You are delayed only by your ability to focus on each piece of paper you want to affect. You can affect multiple pieces at the same time, as long as the total volume doesn't exceed what I mention above. There isn't a significant cool down, but similar to using a muscle if you consistently lift things at the upper end of your range you get tired after 30 min or so. I'll say that more complicated triggers are possible, but must be very precisely worded and require you to meditate for one hour for every 140 characters of code.

You don't have telekinetic control of the paper - you can just make it fold/unfold. So you can't spin a circular saw made of paper ([[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rYfkhdKcEiE]]) but you could cause a bird to flap its wings.
