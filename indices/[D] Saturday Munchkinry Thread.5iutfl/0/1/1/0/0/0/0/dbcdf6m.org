After some experimenting, you find that there's an API of sorts that lets you detect whether light is falling on a particular location in the paper (and the intensity of the light) and the same for sound, temperature, and physical pressure. You can also set up active 'circuits', defined as two locations in the paper which triggers if the paper is ripped in such a way as to separate them from each other.
