Step 1 would be to find a way to attach a tiny metal blade to the edge of the paper, in a way that will let the folding function properly while still retaining sharpness (maybe attach a series of not very wide blade-edges to emulate flexibility), and now the motions of the origami can cut things as it folds. This assumes, of course, that the folding takes place with enough force to move the attached metal and use it to cut things like throats.

With 'origami' as arbitrary as it is, I take it that I can use my power to specifically induce folds in the paper towards a desired end form without tearing the paper or specifically moving it. Which means that if I know how to fold paper cleverly enough, I can make it assume an arbitrary folded form.

Given enough power behind it, I could take a long, thin piece of paper with metal razor edge and fold it in such a way that a large part of it is turned ninety degrees from the flat part resting on the ground. Then, another fold from the flat part will send the turned half scything through the air, and from there the only limits on what it can cut through are how much force is exerted by the folding process. This can be used to put a piece of paper beneath someone's bed and, if the folding is powerful enough, cut through the mattress and a person sleeping in it.

If the power can be exerted to unfold as well as fold, you can fold many long thin pieces of razor-paper into small paper balls in an unassuming package and have them unfold with great force at the right time. I'm not entirely sure, but I think you could make a bomb that, once it activates, cuts through everything in the house violently at random. This would be helped by somehow making the paper look like packaging material and putting an object and note in the box to ease suspicion. If the method works, as long as the paper's in the house when the timer goes off, you've got a kill.

/However/, when I think about the average target, the power's basically redundant. Why slice through the bed when you can remote detonate a bomb, since you evidently got to the bed to put the paper under it? Why send an elaborate sword-paper trap in the mail to destroy the house and occupants when you can just put a bomb in the mail? At the end of the day, I think this power is still outclassed by regular technology in direct applications.
