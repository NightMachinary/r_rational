It's implied a few times that he's very good, yes, and claims that he himself is 'world class' in chapter 3. He hasn't proven an unreliable narrator yet, so I'm inclined to take that one at his word.

On the software side, I don't think he's actually done anything very impressive - though I think he mentioned writing all his programs, so purely custom software, I guess? Timesink if you're not good. On the hardware side, he's apparently cracked hardware issues that major corporate players haven't yet, and thinks he has the single best rig in the world.
