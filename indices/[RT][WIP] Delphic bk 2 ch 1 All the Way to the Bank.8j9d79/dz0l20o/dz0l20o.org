I wouldn't mind some more explanation eventually on just /how/ Hector became so good with computers. Yeah, he studied in university. And yes, with his power he can basically ignore user safety. But apparently he's cracked an awful lot of hardware problems major companies are having, and uses his obscenely overpowered hardware to, uh, what? He's not performing dictionary attacks or anything. He's just running a static face that emits noises. Passing for an AI is a really clever idea, I'll give him that.

I mean, the most interesting thing about it so far that wasn't 'plot relevant', call it rational if you want, was that he sold a cheap program for job scheduling and used it to both cover for himself and keep an eye on his neighborhood with a script so he could take all the jobs there, as well as drop surveillance devices. Maybe I've missed something?
