I thought "gear queer" implies he buys the new stuff and doesn't know how to use it. I think "gear head" (obsessed with optimizing his machine and increasing its performance) is closer to what I intend to convey.

I do intend to include more remarkable hacking stuff going forward; I just don't want to overdo it. The big idea for Hector's abilities is that he's really more of an engineer than a hacker, even on the software side: he's at his best when he can prepare something robust.

Bonnie Lam is introduced to be the opposite: she can code brilliantly at ridiculous speed but she seldom has her own ideas about creative application of her talents. She also tends to kludge problems rather than frameworking solutions.

I don't know how deeply I'll dive into a lot of this. Maybe a bonus chapter where Hector tries to modify Bonnie's code and vice versa.
