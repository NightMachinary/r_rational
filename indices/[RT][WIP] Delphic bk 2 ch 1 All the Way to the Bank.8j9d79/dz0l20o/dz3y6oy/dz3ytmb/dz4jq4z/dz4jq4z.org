It seems to me that there is a very fine line between "world class programmer / hacker" and "unrealistic hacking that defies suspension of disbelief." In trying to stay firmly on the "realistic" side of that line, I have been pretty conservative with the stuff I've described Hector as doing. Most of it can be explained away by having full system access through his powers. His ability to manipulate sophisticated networks (telecommunications, government security, utilities) /without detection/ is probably the most extraordinary thing he's done so far, and that's not something very visible to the reader.

I plan to push the envelope more coming up. I very much hope that my more CS-savvy readers will keep me honest.
