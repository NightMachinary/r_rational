No, I get that, the reason I included references to physics and stuff is so that they can actually talk about time and space. It can be hard to talk about stuff like time and associated units without some kind of reference like that (or it could be defined in relation to the carrier signal, but the point remains)

As for hypothesis testing, that's basically what I'm trying to build into one object. Take everything you're going to teach them and just cram it into one dense binary string. Kinda like this

1;2;3;5;7;11; 0=0; 1=1; 2=2; 3=3; 4=4; 1+1=2; 1+2=3; 5x5=5+5+5+5+5=25;

and so on, until you define how to send audio and video to each other. It's like giving them a textbook. And it also works if you only have one shot at communicating, like if they live 100 light years away
