- Someone who's is convinced they're in a hyperrealistic MMO
- Someone who thinks they're from an entirely different milieu yet somehow manages to be actually effective (e.g, a cyberpunk decker who's convinced she's "hacking the mainframe" (casting spells) with her "deck" (a grimoire))
- Someone who's from the actual future, except they're /really bad/ at history so now they're useless ("Oh I think we ended up calling this the "war of the roses" in my time!" "You idiot, the war of the roses ended a hundred years ago!")
- Someone with the power to save and reload, except it's restricted purely to their own internal timeline, and it's literally the only thing they're good at. They just keep on fumbling through everything getting more and more mentally scarred as time goes on. (this might be literally Subaru from Re: Zero)
- Someone who has a time traveler looking out for them (or in other words, a Doctor Who companion from the other side)
