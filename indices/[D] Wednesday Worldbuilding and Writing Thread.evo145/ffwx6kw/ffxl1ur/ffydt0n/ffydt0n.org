the point of beginning with primes isn't that the prime numbers are world-shattering information, but that it lets aliens understand how we communicate with a nearly unmistakeable pattern that isn't often found in nature. That is, it proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that our communication is intelligent, aimed towards them, and /communication/. Once primes are sent, we hopefully begin mirroring. They recognize that we're trying to open communications, and try to mirror our communications to get a grasp at how we respond. So if they send some sequence back at us, we'd send that same sequence, but extended. e.g., they send us, 2,4,8,10, we send 2,4,8,10,12. If we've properly guessed at what they were sending us, we're capable of copying what they did, and adding a little bit more. If we've made a bad guess, then when we send back (what seems to be) gibberish, the aliens likely act different (in a predictable way) to how they'd act if we sent back the 'right' communication.

From there, it becomes a game of hypothesis testing-- if given input X, what do we expect the aliens to do with it? What do they actually do? Meanwhile, the aliens are doing the same to us, establishing the basic reciprocity that we can expect, from a game-theoretical perspective, to be present in any life form both intelligent enough for spacefaring and benevolent enough not to kill us and take our resources on sight.
