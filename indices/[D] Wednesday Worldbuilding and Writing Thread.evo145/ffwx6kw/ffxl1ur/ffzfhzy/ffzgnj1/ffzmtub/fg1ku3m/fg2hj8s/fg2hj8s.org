  you can't move iron or anything containing iron (except non-magnetic iron compounds)

  the method of transport here is a Stepper box

Wait, this is a Long Earth fanfic, with multiple inhabited Earths? Neat.

...this immediately suggests a few points of consideration. Assuming that, as with the novels, the alternate worlds are arranged in a /line/, it's possible (indeed, inevitable) for them to have different levels of access to the Uninhabited Earths. For example, if world B lies between worlds A and C, then B only has access to the Uninhabited Earths /between/ A and C, unless their mining operations pass through A or C.

That will have political and social implications.

  I don't know much about bitcoin or crypto, so my question would be is it possible to update ledgers if anything containing iron can't be transported? how important is timing for crypto mining? or maybe each universe would have its own crypto making that irrelevant?

You'd need to transport data, not iron. Transporting data is not hard, if both universes are willing to share their data encoding standards (whatever their variant of USB is) and to agree on a file format for cross-universe transfer. (None of these are big secrets, so it should be straightforward).

I don't know for sure how important timing is, but I suspect that as long as there's a steady (say, once an hour) flow of information between two universes, then it should work fine. (Now I'm imagining three people taking shifts walking back and forth with a hard drive.)

But I am starting to wonder if you even /need/ in inter-universe exchange medium. After all, America trades with Britain just fine, despite the fact that one country works in pounds while the other works in kilograms.
