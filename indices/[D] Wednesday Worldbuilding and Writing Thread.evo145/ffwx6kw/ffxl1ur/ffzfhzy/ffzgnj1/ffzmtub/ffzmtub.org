The uninhabited worlds will have any amount of raw matter (like gold), pretty much free for the taking. Similarly for energy, if the parallel worlds have stars. This means that there will be only two things that can reasonably be traded between the universes; manufactured goods, and information.

"Information" is a broad category that includes various forms of entertainment (films, VR holonovels, etc.) and many other high-value items (such as a design for a more efficient CPU). However, one cannot easily make a currency out of it; a film may be anything from 'abysmal' to 'amazing' and the buyer won't know until he has the whole thing.

So, let's consider manufactured goods. Processors might be a useful medium of exchange; every world can manufacture their own CPU chips, they can be rated with different values depending on the number of onboard transistors, they can't be harvested from uninhabited worlds, and they're small enough that a huge pile of them can be carried to another world at once.

The other option, of course, is something like Bitcoin...
