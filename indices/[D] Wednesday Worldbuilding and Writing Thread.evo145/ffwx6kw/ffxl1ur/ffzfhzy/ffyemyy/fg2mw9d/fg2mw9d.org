Currently have a royalroad story, don't think it is really a rationalfic though but some ideas may be interesting. Start has generic isekai trappings but it diverges in that there is no demon lord or any one being that can be killed and the world will be saved. The enemy that must be defeated is a massive three way cold war with regular skirmishes, the elves, dwarves, and humans all HATE eachother due to an oversight in how the system works. Cha increases your ability to convince people of things, children have low stats in all categories, human king tells young son that elves are evil, son takes it as gospel, grows up and now has high cha and cycle repeats. Gods are planetary admins, one in charge of this world has been trying to unscrew it for a thousand years before deciding he needs an outsider to fix it from the inside. God's power is limited due to prayer giving energy but altering a God's personality to be in line with worshipper's expectations so he had to unplug when the war started getting out of control and praying for your enemies to die became more common.

The Mc does not get any super duper special power from god, he only has average stats and is spawned near enough to a town that he can see the it without anyone noticing someone appear from thin air. After some explorations of the town he finds out there is a fourth race since they are attacking an incomplete section of the wall. He can't get any objective information anywhere since everyone hates the other races. Eventually he joins a caravan to go to a bigger city since he also doesn't have a class so a class altar is needed. While with the caravan it is attacked by the fourth race, ant people.

He and two others are captured (he surrendered since he never got in a serious fight) and they are taken back to the colony. He plays nice and they play nice back, other two are jerks and anta still attempt to be nice, finds out they have been attempting to capture people for weeks because they have a princess and she needed a husband. He agrees because not only does he think she is beautiful but because ants need men they literally can't be hateful to the other races or they would kill themselves so they are actually nice. They leave and start a new colony and he gains the consort class. reverse chess style, the queen is the most important but the king/consort is the one that can move in any direction, as in he gains powers based on what subtypes of ant daughters she can make. Gains weak earthbending that can only work on dirt (for now) because of first type of daughter is worker. Next gains a power field generating skill based on the soldiers, so he can hit harder or defend better. Third ant type unlocked is a sort of combination healer, light source, and air scrubber that have backlash of permanent sleep due to the extreme power demands of an always on light generator.

His true power shows up as he tries things until something happens or breaks, because he hasn't had a thousand years of tradition telling him what is or isn't possible in the system. Eventually he figures out anyone can gain any skill but if it isn't a class skill it just doesn't appear anywhere on any menu so you have to just guess if you gained a level in it based on changes to input and output. So now he is in a cycle of building a civiliation composed of his own children, attempting to find the edges of the system, and power leveling any skills he feels he has.

Working at the system edges is the main reason I feel this can fit in here at all. Not sure if I should ask for anything specific, so just give me any general ideas what I have presented give you.
