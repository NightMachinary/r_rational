What does he have for ghosts that can motivate them? The only one I can think of is making them happier by experiences, or helping out humans the ghost cares about (surviving relatives?).

If they just want to enjoy the afterlife (assuming 'tortured souls' ghost type), he could set them up in an art college that bridges the gap between human and ghost. He could invent asymmetrical sports of human vs ghost. There could be art installations that are designed to be destroyed by ghosts in interesting ways.

Ghosts presumably after-live forever, so they can remember things from long ago. History could be reconstructed very accurately.
