[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8337607/chapters/19098982][Yesterday Upon The Stairs]] is an My Hero Academia fanfic in which Izuku(the main character) doesn't start out quirkless but instead has the ability to see and interact with ghosts. The power is used as a plot device but is woefully underutilized by Izuku. I think it could be fun to throw at [[/r/rational][r/rational]] and see what you could make of it. The parameters of the power is that

- Izuku can talk to ghost but doesn't not have any power to make them do things they wouldn't otherwise do.
- Ghosts can only in very limited form interact with the real world. They can't physically influence people or do sustained effect on inanimate objects. They can to some extend manipulate the feelings of the living- Ghost can hurt and kill other ghosts. They can perform weak bursts of effect on inanimate objects(scatter glass, tip an object over). Due to his power ghosts can interact with him as a human could with another human.

My initial thoughts was gathering a big group of ghosts and using them to searching for victims for search and rescue, cheat in poker, have ghosts carry him and thus levitate, have ghost actively pull him or be used to shift momentum suddenly in fight, befriend a ghost doctor and have that doctor instruct him in what to do in emergencies, have ghosts spy on living people including having them follow the big baddies.
