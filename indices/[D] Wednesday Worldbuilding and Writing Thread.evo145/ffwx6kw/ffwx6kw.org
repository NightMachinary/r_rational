I'm toying with the idea of a fantasy setting where one or more characters are genre-savvy. The sidekicks and romantic interests are constantly in danger or killed, other narrative forces are clearly at play.

A benevolent being of great power decides to break the world by making it a satire of itself. It has now been 34 years since our last apocalypse. Keep up the good work!

I'm looking for ideas for heroic archetypes to play with. What I've come up with so far:

- Serial Isekai protagonist. He shows up in the world from Earth, shakes his head, and says "Not this again!"

- Half human, quarter angel, quarter demon magical girl who decides instead to just practice law.

- Seventh son of a seventh son with world-breaking arcane might who won't touch that power. He'd rather just run errands for a living and buy blacksmith puzzles with his spare change.

- A noble knight who rides a giant peafowl.
