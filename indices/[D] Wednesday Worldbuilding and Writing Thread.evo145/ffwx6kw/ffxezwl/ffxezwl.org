- A character whose power's theme just absolutely drips evil and corruption, who is an utterly idealistic and committed crusader for all that is right and good.
- Incedibly competent and forward thinking Damsel trying to set up contingencies and systems for the kingdom to handle its stuff the next time she is kidnapped.
- Dragon who is a recovering hoard-aholic, desperately trying to stay clean and do a little good.
- Character who is obviously the Maoh in disguise, but the disguise is garbage and everyone can tell, they play along because the harm he can wreak as a spy utterly pails before the harm he would do leading the Forces of Evil.
