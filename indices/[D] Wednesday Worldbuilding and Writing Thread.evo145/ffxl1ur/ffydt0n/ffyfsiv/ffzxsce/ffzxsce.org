Sam Hughes's Fine Structure and John C. Wright's Count to a Trillion have something like that. A self-decrypting encyclopedia galactica. Robert J. Sawyer's Starplex (I think it was starplex) where we go from arithmetic to language. E.g. 1+1=2 means "yes" and 1+1=3 means "no" or something like that. I don't remember the details, but I'd like to see someone go farther with that.
