Given that this is a fiction discussion board, I assumed "first contact" meant substantially close to real-time communications, as that's easier and more engaging to write about. Long-distance transmissions of course have different associated strategies, though I'd suspect that it would still be important to make sure transmissions are easily distinguishable as being produced by an advanced society, rather than some natural process.
