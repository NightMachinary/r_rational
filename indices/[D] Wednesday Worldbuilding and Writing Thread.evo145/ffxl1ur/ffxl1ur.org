I've been researching how first contact would go, and one of the big questions I want answered is what research on first contact messages there is out there.

By "first contact message" I mean a string of bits that encodes some kind of obvious structure. One extremely common suggestion is the primes. But messages in Sci fi tend to be more complex than that, encoding advanced math and information about the world. Are there any resources for research, examples, or ideas related to that?
