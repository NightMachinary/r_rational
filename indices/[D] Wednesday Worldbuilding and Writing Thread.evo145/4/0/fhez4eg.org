He should compile a list of all known skills from every class, then try to extrapolate potential classes or skills that would fill in gaps (maybe they were lost to time etc.). Then any time there is a chance at a new power/skill he can systematically try out everything on the list and document what cause what. Then he can keep his own physical "character sheet" with what he actually knows/can do. Sometimes we forget things in stressful situations. This being in code could prevent others from realizing what it is, or he could be dumb about this and have his ability exposed. What is the name of this work?\\
Edit: As he figures this out, maybe his INT stat goes up, thereby making it easier to extrapolate missing pieces or coming up with how to test if he has abilities. Not sure if this universe operates where stats reflect life or life reflects stats. If the latter, get some INT boosting item (if applicable) and try to brainstorm through the problem while smarter. Slight assumption of D&D style stats here based on given description.
