the big constraint I forgot to mention is that you can't move iron or anything containing iron (except non-magnetic iron compounds) between universes, but these are all good thoughts. I guess it depends on the degree of divergence between universes

- shared history pre-1980s/90s means shared high-density storage formats & videotape - otherwise encoding and reading data would be nightmarish given how arbitrary most of it is, different outcomes to format wars like vhs vs betamax, etc.. books would be easy, films would be harder (unless you're using something analog as a medium), software would probably be very hard (arcane copyright restrictions, incompatible OS, incompatible hardware, divergent GUI philosophies would keep alt-world software from being easily used by consumers). I would think that most of the trade volume in IP would be simple-to-manufacture patents, but as you say none of this seems to be a good foundation for a universal currency...

- and further back in time, we might be looking at cultures without modern IP law, or very different attitudes towards IP - or even law itself - which would make negotiating a common cross-universal legal framework much harder

- manufactured goods - this is perfect solution but CPU chips specifically would be a no-go. I'm thinking that the main criteria 1. what you said with not being able to harvest it from uninhabitable worlds, requires an extensive manufacturing process 2. some kind of continuous property like no. of onboard transistors, weight/volume/length, etc. 3. is useful to any society at any level of development 4. transport constraints - iron content, weight. 5. unlikely for different universes to have independently invented them so there's a clear demand, in our timeline they would have been discovered by accident

  - my first thought here is maybe synthetic materials, particularly lightweight plastics and synthetic fibres? vulcanised rubber, teflon would be as useful to a feudal society as an industrialised market-capitalist one. the main constraint would be it'd have to be easy to melt down and use, tough enough to resist constant handling, easy to mold into chips/coins with identification markers saying what they are and how much they weigh, and hard to manufacture except with a very long chemical process known only to Universe X. not a materials engineer so I don't know what synthetic material would fit the bill here.
  - 2nd thought is vaccines - would be especially in demand since cross-universe merchants would also be disease-carriers. the chances are good that some universes haven't discovered penicillin yet. would only be valuable to governments / anyone with an interest & the capacity to vaccinate a population

- I don't know much about bitcoin or crypto, so my question would be is it possible to update ledgers if anything containing iron can't be transported? how important is timing for crypto mining? or maybe each universe would have its own crypto making that irrelevant?

or maybe I'm thinking about it wrong? the method of transport here is a Stepper box which is cheap and simple to make, so most of the initial inter-universal trade volume would be people peddling their wares in exchange for local currency. in that case maybe I can just assume that governments will figure out currency pegs for official transactions + some market-determined exchange-rate, but that feels like a cop-out since I want to explore the political and social implications more
