  ideas for heroic archetypes
#+end_quote

A few, off the top of my head, twisted similarly to the ones you have above:

- Long-lost heir to the Kingdom, raised on a farm. A nice person, and quite good with knowing where and when to plant turnips, but completely unsuited to any kind of leadership or diplomacy.
- Someone with a birthmark matching the prophecy of the Chosen One, who, other than that birthmark, matches nothing else about the prophecy.
- A homebody who claims they don't want adventure and will just be a detriment to the mission but is dragged along anyway... and actually /is/ a detriment to the mission.
- Someone who lied about their identity (gender, age, experience, etc.) in order to join the mission to save the country... who turns out to just be a compulsive liar.
