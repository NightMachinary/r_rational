One thing that really bugs me about people who go "that character is genre savy oh look how clever" is that in most cases it's unrealistic. Some things on the genre savvy list are things that a reasonable person who do that fictional characters don't because the writer is lazy or because it would make for a bad story. But a lot of things on the list are /things that only make sense in a story/.

In real life, if you shoot someone and throw them into a volcano, they're dead. You don't have to find the body to be sure. In real life, the underdogs almost never win. That's why they're the underdogs. In most cases, /being genre savvy means acting irrationally for no good in-universe reason/.
