Take a look at [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28601/arrogant-young-master-template-a-variation-4][Arrogant Young Master]] which does what you are saying but for cultivation stories specifically. Other than that:

Twins that are separated at birth with one twin ending up being good and the other being bad.

The bad guy is in fact the hero's father.

Peasant boy has his family killed and gets revenge after a long series of training and adventures.

The bad guys will send level appropriate mobs at the heros, allowing the heroes to barely survive and gain combat experience.

A villain is doomed to be stopped by a prophesy and the only reason that it ends up happening is due to the actions he takes to stop the prophesy. Especially by creating the hero in some way.

The white knight that comes to rescue in a dire situation after a long combat will always win.

A street urchin has a secret talent but never received training until discovered by the wise mentor.
