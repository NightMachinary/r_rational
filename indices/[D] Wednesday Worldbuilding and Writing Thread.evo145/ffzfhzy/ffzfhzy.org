question: how might parallel universes conduct trade with one another /without/ bartering?

suppose you have maybe ten or so parallel universes that became connected to one another in the late 2010s -- they're all different, with some having points of historical divergence going back to the 1400s. in case it's important, in this verse you can't transport anything heavier than twenty kilos cross-universe, it takes ten minutes to travel from one universe to another, and a conscious human needs to do it. constraint number two: they're surrounded by an infinite number of uninhabited parallel universes, so using a natural mineral deposit like gold as a shared medium of exchange isn't an option.
