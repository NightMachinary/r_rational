oh right, sorry, there's some additional background context that I forgot to include. the cross-universe transport method is [[https://thelongearth.fandom.com/wiki/Stepper_Boxes][a Stepper box]] from the Long Earth series - it's a small box, uses basic electronic components, powered by a potato or any starchy root vegetable, and it doesn't generate a portal so much as instantly transport the user to the adjacent universe in either direction. someone made a list of all the components [[http://web.archive.org/web/20160319152607/http://kurtnalty.com/LongEarth/Willis_Linsay_Stepper.pdf][here]] (pdf warning). the plot-relevant transport restriction in the Long Earth series is that anything containing iron stays behind unless it's in a non-magnetic compound like haemoglobin.

your line of thought about price of transport opens up some interesting questions about how alternate worlds would be able to produce tunnel diodes, capacitors, rocker switches, etc. (I'm guessing for industrialised societies this would be a temporary barrier, but I don't know what the technological infrastructure needed to produce these electronic components is like). it seems to me that this is an interesting area to explore but I'm not sure whether it would be able to form a basis for a stable currency?
