you'd be surprised how many rationalists or rationalist adjacent people claim that rationality didn't improve their thinking /that/ drastically. (Or at least on some of the discord channels that's what people seem to have said sometimes.) My impression is that they think that those who benefit from it are those who were already above average sanity/intelligence to start with.
