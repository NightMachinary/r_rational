If it's all right to plug my own work, I've been writing a fanfic called [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/7742563/chapters/17651086][The Incompetent Witcher]] taking place in the universe of the Witcher books/games (think medieval Europe with a mix of Eastern European folklore). The young protagonist is supposed to be intelligent but headstrong, naive, and therefore quite insensible -- but he will become progressively more rational (and, unfortunately, more cynical) as he learns the ways of the world.
