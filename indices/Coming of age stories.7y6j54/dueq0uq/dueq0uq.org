I loved the Prydain books as a kid!

Hmm... unfortunately, thats a bit of a rare combo. Motherof learning is probably the best existing work like that off the top of my head.

Not rational, but I'm a fan of the manga Omani Master Kurosawa (NSFW, but basically starts off as a parody of Death Note. Somehow turns into a coming of age story, and makes it work!) and Molester Man.
