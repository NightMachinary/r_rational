This is the story of my life. Problem is, when I first started learning rationality I had some EXTREMELY embarrassing moments in the valley of bad rationality, many of which are not worth sharing because they involve miscommunications which would paint me in a rather inaccurate negative light, and I wasn't coherent enough to really be accomplishing anything, and I was already so psychologically messed up and maladjusted from before that that I wasn't really all that likable at the time either. It wasn't until I finally left the valley of bad rationality that I gradually started becoming more coherent and less ridiculous, and even now I still struggle at times.

The one thing I can say is that, somehow, around the time I was first learning rationality techniques, I used them to assist in solving a crime which a private investigator was having trouble with, despite my not having any experience in detective work. I swear this was a lot less interesting than it sounds.

I think that might have actually been shortly before I had a happy death spiral about rationality, actually.
