Thanks man. I'll definitely be taking your advice about thinking of possible questions beforehand. I actually completely forgot about the "magnet" question in writing the rest of the response. I would have said something about "testing that in a few days" if I had noticed.

  BTW were you [[/u/iwillmakeyouthink2]]? This felt a bit like the Grimoire experiments we did before.

I can neither confirm nor deny that. (Okay, I can totally deny that, because I have no clue who that is.)

  Also I demand a meaningless Internet cookie for coming up with the magnetism and the sunrise/sunset thing!

Don't worry, when I inevitably take over the world with the unhypotherical hypothetical unhypothetical hypothetical magic, I'll make sure to assimilate you before your loved ones.

In all serious, how would you like to be the "first corroborator" if/when I ever get around to implementing the real version of this? The suggestion to have other people corroborate that magic works seems like a good one.
