This was a lot of fun and I was partly convinced by the end that this was a scientific thing that was actually happening. It was due to how matter-of-fact you were about your responses when a lot of people role-playing tend to get a little...hammy. Of course, that failed when you realized an error and had to break character to correct it (next time just incorporate it into your act, mistakes happen in scientific testing as well).

Looking back, I would suggest thinking of possible questions and preparing answers ahead of time so you can have a more self-consistent story. I also noticed that you focused on parts of my question which lead to the correct answer and sort of ignored false trails. I didn't notice this at the time, so props to you for some subtle rail-roading, but when you ignored my suggestion for your friend to play around with magnets (not even a 'nothing unusual there'?) I could tell that you really wanted me to focus on the timing of the events more.

I'll definitely participate in any 'experiments' you conduct in the future! ;)

BTW were you [[/u/iwillmakeyouthink2]]? This felt a bit like the Grimoire experiments we did before.

Also I demand a meaningless Internet cookie for coming up with the magnetism and the sunrise/sunset thing!
