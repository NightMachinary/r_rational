This is actually a microcosm of what the whole science vs magic dichotomy actually is.

We strive to find all the rules, all the munchkinisms, all the ways to break the rules, all the rules that are the real rules.

We strive and strive and break and break and break until we can explain.

This is why I think any world with actual 'magic' will ultimately utilize it if science is at all feasible.

In counter to this I started working on worlds that have anti-science measures for my fantasy settings.
