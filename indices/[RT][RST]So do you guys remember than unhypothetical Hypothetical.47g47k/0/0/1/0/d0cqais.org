Well, yes. There is no such thing as the supernatural, because all that exists lies within Nature's busty green grasp. A lot of 'real fantasy' settings have a component of The Masquerade that directly acts against Science/technology/modernity, but most of those have a poor understanding of what science actually /is,/ and are typically handwaved as Anti-Muggle Fields. I'd be interested to see what actual anti-science fantasy would look like. A Nature intent on clothing herself from mere epistemology should be fairly novel.
