Alright, out of character, this was a what I'm calling a "trial run" for an interactive event I plan to run, wherein "I" (that is to say, a throwaway account run by me) discover some form of "magic" and provide "evidence" (read: meh quality photoshops) and reach out to the community for help figuring it out, while also relaying a hopefully compelling story about trying to test out magic without letting other people onto the secret.

A lot of the details would be changing, notably that I would be posting as myself, and that magic actually /would/ be discovered, as well as various other major or minor details, but the general idea of reaching out to an internet community for help with discerning the supernatural will stay the same.

I've already identified some issues with this trial run-- a lack of evidence, being unnecessarily cagey, not deciding what evidence I'd have on hand in advance, and having an underwhelming (and under-explained) "magic," and I hope to correct those if and when I get the real thing going.

Some fun facts about this trial:

- I had initially intended for the magic to be real. I decided to switch for a variety of reasons, most notably that people made good arguments that it was really unlikely this was magic.
- The location of the unnamed experimenter was initially significant-- there used to be a big, open-pit iron mine near his town (Negaunee, MI) but I decided to drop that element when I decided to switch to it not being a magical phenomena after all, leaving it something of a red herring.
- The whole "only affects iron" thing is a relic of that.
- I had intended for it to only work during sunrise and sunset from the beginning, however.
- Initially, I wasn't going to characterize the experimenter at all. It was pretty fun making him into a paranoid optimist, though.

If you have any advice, please post it in response to this post, rather than directly on the thread, so I can keep track of what to reply to in and out of character.
