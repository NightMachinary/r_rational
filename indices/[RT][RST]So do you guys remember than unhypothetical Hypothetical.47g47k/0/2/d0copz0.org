Ooh cool that actually sounds pretty fun. Keep in mind however that even if you hadn't warned us ahead of time, it would be very difficult to convince most of us if we didn't actually see the evidence you were making up first hand. If you want our characters to be as rational as we are, then you'll encounter the same issue of people just not believing your character.

Of course, maybe the only reason you're making this activity is because you actually did discover magic and you want to get our advice even if we don't believe you, and making it into a roleplaying activity would make your attempts to get advice more believable...LOL.

Try getting some other people into it. Like, if you can convince some of the well-respected rational fic writers to be your confederates and at the right times, you might have been able to actually make some people (or at least their characters) wonder just a little. But you would have to make it believable, otherwise everyone else's characters would know it was obviously a prank.
