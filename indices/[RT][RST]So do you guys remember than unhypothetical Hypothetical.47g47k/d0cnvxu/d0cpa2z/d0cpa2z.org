Your post reads like fiction. You're trying too hard to sound casual, and it ends up reading like a poorly written monologue breaking the fourth wall.

Of particular note was the repetition of "... because, hey, ..." as well as:

#+begin_quote
  Not a hypothetical. Or at least, not exactly.
#+end_quote

Building suspense - a story telling technique, not something used when you're laying out facts for assistance brainstorming.

#+begin_quote
  The long and short of it is that I got in contact with someone who has what I'd hesitantly characterize as "magic." (At least until we study it some more.) I won't get into /why/ I believe them, but I do.
#+end_quote

The italics are unnecessary, and reads to me like you're trying to emulate authors who also overuse italicized emphasis of dialog. Also, the purpose of this sentence is to purportedly sum up all the information someone would need to advise you; you don't do that. You keep teasing. As a reader I get the feeling you're desperate for me to keep reading. Your organization is too contrived for me to consider you simply don't know how to start the story, and even if that were true, you'd have probably deleted the first few drafts anyway.

On a separate note, the initial concept strains belief. Why would you openly expose magic to the internet? If your true purpose is to get ideas, it'd be so much easier to convince - or let people believe - that you're playing around, not actually serious.

In fact, I think that would even make for a nice climax. If the story is told through a series of forum posts, then, some time after the thread dies or the original poster has been reliably engaging with the forum, show a post where a person mentions a bizarre event profiled on the evening news, and how reminiscent it is of the thread topic. As to where to go from there, options abound.

Hopefully this was helpful.
