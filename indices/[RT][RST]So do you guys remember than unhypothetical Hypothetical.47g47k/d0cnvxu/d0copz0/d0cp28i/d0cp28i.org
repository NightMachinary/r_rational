  Of course, maybe the only reason you're making this activity is because you actually did discover magic and you want to get our advice even if we don't believe you, and making it into a roleplaying activity would make your attempts to get advice more believable...LOL.

See, I first created a hypothetical thread about magic, then said it wasn't hypothetical, then said it was really all the setup for a story (which will result in me referring to this event as potentially real after all) but that I'll also claim is hypothetical.

At this point, I'm in so deep I could give anime supervillains conniptions :)
