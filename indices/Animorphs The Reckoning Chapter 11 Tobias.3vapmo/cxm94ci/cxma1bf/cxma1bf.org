Well, while what you suggest is commendably prudent, it's not that obvious. I mean, they were looking for an alien pod, they found something that looks a lot like an alien pod in the area they know it was in, and it's not like shipping companies spend their time dropping alien-looking ovoids in the ocean to trick foolish teenagers with attitude.

Though it could have been a decoy pod set to explode in case it was found by the yeerks, with no way do differentiate it from a real one without andalite telepathy.
