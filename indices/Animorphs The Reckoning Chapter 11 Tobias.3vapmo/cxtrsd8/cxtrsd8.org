Heyo [[/u/TK17Studios][u/TK17Studios]],

Just wanted to check in and say I'm really diggin' your fic, here. It's just as good as published stuff out there; I just finished reading Brandon Sanderson's fairly popular Mistborn trilogy, and r!Animorphs: The Reckoning is stronger imo.

Also, in case it's of interest to you, I haven't actually read any Animorphs books, despite having had a handful on my shelf growing up. I get the sense that most of your readers have read the original series. I'm clearly not getting any of the references to the original series, but I have a perspective on whether or not the fic makes sense for someone who is unfamiliar with it. It has all been clear so far!

Keep up the awesome work. I really appreciate your contribution to the rapidly growing body of quality rational fiction.

Cheers,
