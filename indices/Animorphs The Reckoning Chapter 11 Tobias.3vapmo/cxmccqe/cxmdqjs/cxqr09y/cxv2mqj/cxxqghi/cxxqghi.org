I am very happy to get this offer and compliment, thanks so much! I really do love your work in this fic. You rock!

I would be willing to do so, but I don't want to "steal" your story at all since I love seeing you work with it, and also I don't think I have nearly enough skill as a writer. I will be happy to continue spitballing ideas your way, however. If I ever get the urge to write down a few paragraphs that might actually be usable, I will send them to you. Also, I am willing to be a full-fledged beta reader for you, if you want. I almost do this anyway, seems like, so might as well make it official.

I might not have reliable computer access in the next couple weeks, however, since the casing on the dumb Toshiba laptop I've been using broke yesterday and needs to be repaired. I'll try to send you a PM soon on some ideas I was playing with last night, regardless.
