Good Earth-evening,

I am known by my people as War Prince Elfangor-Sirinial-Shamtul, and I come to you with the gravest of news. Beggars are despised in the eyes of the Elimist (praise be upon him), but I do not write for my own sake and tonite the fate of the very galaxy may be at stake. Due to an attack by vicious Yeerk slavers, my ship has take damage and crashes landed on a planet. In my possession is a secret artifact vitally important to the war against Yeerkish tyranny. This artifact has ancient powers beyond your imagination so I dare not describe more here. It must not be allowed to fall into their grasp, lest all be lost. I require a mere 100,000,000,000,000 barrels supply of your Earth petroleum in order to refuel and repair my ship, as well as may be a few tons of assorted metals for electronic. I shall refine all necessary plastics myself, in order to minimize the burdens I must place upon you and the time of repair.

Please hurry, as even now Yeerk fighters are searching for my position. The price is very low, compared to the costs of freedom. Generosity finds its own rewards in the universe's time. Delay not, or we are all doomed.

Your hopeful freind,

Prince Elfangor-Sirinial-Shamtul, son of Noorlin-Sirinial-Cooraf and Forlay-Esgarrouth-Maheen, belovid war hero, defender of the Andalite homeworld and freedoms throughout the universe, etc.
