Awe yes! You're using the art I made!

The ending was surprising. Why did the pod blast off into space after sending a distress signal? It could apparently handle rapid atmospheric movement but not operate in water? It seems odd that a escape pod couldn't handle a water landing. Something's not quite right here; this pod is not behaving like I expect an escape pod to behave.
