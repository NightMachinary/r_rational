Typo thread !

- There should be a separator between <Then we find a deserted island> and "Okay, let's go over it one more time"

- In chapter 5 (the first Tobias chapter), Cassie makes a list of dogs they could use to sniff out controllers. Then "Guys," Rachel called out, interrupting Marco mid-rant. "We could use a German sheperd to sniff them out." -> I think a line from Marco has been omitted here.
