I'm mostly just shocked because based on what I thought I understood, "checking" should have happened automatically, whether they did it on purpose or not. The Andilite form they use to open it is also the one they use to detect it, after all. I didn't actually think it didn't occur to them to check it. ...Although in retrospect that would be a valid interpretation of what I remember reading, huh.
