Even though I glanced at other comments before reading the chapter, I did NOT see this ending coming. And now Tobias doomed all the humans to death by quantum virus. Yeaaaaah !!! (okay, probably not)

Otherwise, I wonder who the two next updates are going to feature. I hope we get to see someone new. The best parts of Animorphs were the host/yeerk POVs, and I really want to know about yeerk culture and how they deviate from canon.

And finally, a question for the author : are the animorphs going to meet the governor soon ? A major theme of the 'fic is how pressed for time the kids are, so they should try to coordinate with the military as soon as possible.
