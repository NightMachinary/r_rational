Sad face.

As far as governments handling secret aliens invasions go, I thought Parasyte had a very fresh take on the subject. The government figure out that aliens are invading pretty early (makes sense, they're not exactly subtle about it) and decide to cover it up as long as they can. In the meanwhile, they study the parasytes, learn their weaknesses, figure out methods to detect them, and by the time they confront them, it's a (somewhat two-sided) slaugther, and the military wins quickly.
