My take on it:

You're an Andalite. You know you're on a planet with a Yeerk presence, and the presence of humans, who you probably know lack the technology to find you.

When a couple of humans with Andalite morphing technology find you, what's more likely? Some Andalite gave humans morphing technology, AND they managed to somehow find you when their only hint could have been advanced alien sensors or a message keyed only to Elfangor?

Or that the Yeerks have found the pod (whether by infesting Elfangor or with Alloran's tech), and sent Controllers to grab you and turn you into one of them?

Why would you stick around to find out?

So, naturally, you head into space. The Yeerks may still be able to hunt you down, but at least then they're much more likely to have to kill you to stop you in space, and we know the canon Andalites are willing to kill themselves in order to avoid infestation.
