DBZ fanfiction actually has this weird tendency towards... smartness, or at least self-consistency. Honor Trip and Bringer of Death are a couple of the most popular ones and spend a /lot/ of time on that, though they're /completely/ in disagreement as to whatever the hell "2x as strong" means (Honor Trip thinks 2x is way too low to be a significant difference, Bringer of Death thinks that /1.1x/ is enough to make a fight require significant amounts of cunning and strategy to win), they're mostly self-consistent intentionally. Honor Trip notably contains /pages/ of discussions of moral relativism and free will due to its subject matter, almost to obnoxious levels.
