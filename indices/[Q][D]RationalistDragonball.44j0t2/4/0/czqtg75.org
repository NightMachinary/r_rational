I think Saiyans have Lamarckian evolution. Acquired characteristics are transmitted to their offspring.

For example, Goten and Trunks could easily transform because by the time they were conceived their fathers could easily transform too.

This also justifies the fact that the Saiyans are ruled by the strongest /and/ that title is inherited. If the King is strong the Prince will be strong too.
