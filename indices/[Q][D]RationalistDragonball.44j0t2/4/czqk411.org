I personally think a rational Dragonball story would be a lot of work. It's also fairly illogical at the best of times. Like how an untrained 4(5?) year old Gohan gets a higher power level than his father (who's been fighting and training for over a decade) when he gets angry, ostensibly due to his half breed composition. Or like how the dragon balls are never utilized to their full potential and/or have stupidly inconsistent rules. I don't think the universe lends itself towards being rational without a LOT of legwork on the author's part.

That being said, it's still possible. And potentially amazing. Just hard. And I don't think those with the required skillset to produce such a thing are big enough fans to do it. Who knows though?
