Indeed is TV more popular than comics... But the usual reasons, ease of access and an effortless passive access to the material dont really apply here. A TV series infamous for its lenghty fillers and screaming duels should be more than enough to cancel the animes appeal. (apparently not so my model of other peoples boredom treshold must be very wrong.) Also the Manga is illegally but freely available on a number of different sites.
