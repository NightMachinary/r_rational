"Android" is just the translation from Japanese. The Japanese is "jinzo ningen" which means "artificial human", but may not carry exactly the same connotation that "Android" means in English.

The Dragonball wiki gives a reference to them being cyborgs as a Dragonball Q&A section in the manga. I don't think any character actually said it. However, one android is Dr. Gero's brain in an android body, which proves that "androids" include cyborgs.

It does seem like 17 and 18 are treated as robots in some ways. The story never treats them as people who have lost their parents and they have no other relatives. They don't need to eat and they don't emit any ki, and when you see in their body nothing organic is obvious.
