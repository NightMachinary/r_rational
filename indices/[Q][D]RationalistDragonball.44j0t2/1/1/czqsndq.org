  Plus, in DBZ-land, souls clearly exist, and the afterlife is a physical location. That's the kind of thing that practically begs for rationalist writing.

This is another thing that seems munchkinnable on the surface, but IMO if you have a verifiable, reliable afterlife, the aforementioned short and boring rational path may simply be the inverse of what I implied earlier.

/Don't/ save the planet, and everyone awesome lives happily ever after in Heaven while everyone terrible plays nuke tag happily ever after in Hfil.

I mean, King Yemma won't be happy, so I guess there's a plot token there, but it still doesn't lend itself naturally to a particularly nuanced story that I can see.
