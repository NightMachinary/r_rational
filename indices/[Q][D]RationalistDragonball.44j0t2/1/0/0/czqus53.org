It seems like Toriyama was aware of this as far back as the arrival of Piccolo, since that's when the DB-gathering starts happening off panel. Namek almost feels like an attempt to make the search challenging and relevant again, but the next two arcs go back to being too easy for the original premise. (The Buu arc did at least make a big deal out of how important the dragon radar is, to the point of forcing Goku out of play for a little while.)

The chokepoint is Bulma. Until the most recent movies, she was the only one capable of building a radar precise enough to make things ridiculously easy. Considering that she's the heiress of the biggest tech giant in the world, this probably involves more than the radar itself--maybe it uses satellites or cell towers or something to help with the search?

Find some way to remove any of those important links from the chain, and the Dragon Radar gets nerfed until they're replaced.
