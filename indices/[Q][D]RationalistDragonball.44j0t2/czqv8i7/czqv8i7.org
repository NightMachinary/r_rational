Coming up with enough ideas to write about has proven surprisingly challenging. (Slowly getting there, but still haven't written anything based on said notes.)

In the mean time, there's [[http://teamfourstar.com][DBZ Abridged]], if being an Adult Swim-esque parody is a tolerable condition; [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRZamDg_Dw4][Mistare Fusion's Dragonball Dissections]] are more literary and personal opinion in nature, and he doesn't fight the gag elements of the series, but he occasionally points out something of interest in the "gaping loophole" or "How are the rules supposed to actually work?" sense. And [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1704174/1/Eclipse][Eclipse]], while still full of random mysticist stuff, does try to take seriously the implications of certain events.

There was a fanfic in which Trunks wound up missing his original target and got stuck with Nappa and Vegeta for a while before they went to Earth. I forget what it's called and I'm not sure if I can easily find it again, but I remember it being relatively rational by DBZ standards. (Warning: contains a scene of someone balancing a bus on one finger. The bus-balancing isn't especially relevant. The implications of the Saiyan's sex lives might be.)
