[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2509092/1/AU-A-Boy-s-Training][This story]] is probably the closest I've read to a more rational DBZ. It's more a focus on Goku going against Chichi and actually training Gohan. It follows a bit close to cannon for most rationalizations but its a step in the right direction.
