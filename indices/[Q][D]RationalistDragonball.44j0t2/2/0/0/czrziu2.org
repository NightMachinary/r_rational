Dim familiarity is enough, I'd say. Heck, Honor Trip cites the first Funimation dub /way/ too often, so dim familiarity is probably /better/, since intimate familiarity sorta clashes with a lot of the dubisms (E.G. Bulma Briefs).

Bringer of Death starts off pretty badly. It's excessively wordy early on, and the prose tends to be purpler than Freeza's head. It gets better, later, even as it introduces HK-47 and an Asari as characters. Challenges towards the characters tend towards the interesting and unique.

Break Through the Limit is also good, but doesn't care much for consistency. It's very DBZ in nature. I enjoy it, but I'm on [[/r/rational]], so I'm not going to recommend it by that standard.
