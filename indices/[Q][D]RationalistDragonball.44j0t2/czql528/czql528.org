I feel like it could work, given a couple major themes added into the story. Nuclear deterrence and proportional macguffin difficulty.

Nuclear deterrence: As mentioned, one problem DBZ has is an abundance of individuals with enough power to easily destroy planets. If one were to write these characters as rationally self-interested, the fights could largely be replaced with careful negotiations based around a mutual desire to not die, or kill billions of people.

Macguffin difficulty: The dragonballs are a problem because they're too powerful and too easy to get. They can be made interesting with the addition of either clear power limits, a massively harder time finding them (like, say, make it so there's only one set active in the galaxy at a time), or both.

Plus, in DBZ-land, souls clearly exist, and the afterlife is a physical location. That's the kind of thing that practically begs for rationalist writing.
