I think the counter to that is the clearly sub-optimal nature of the afterlife. There's a Hell, and reincarnation results in people effectively 'dying' for real, since they lose their memories.

That could be the basis for an interesting arc in which the party has to conquer the whole system and fix it.

Just a possibility though.
