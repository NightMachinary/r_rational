The radar can be kept, I think, if it's qualified a bit better. Like only being able to narrow things down to a still-large search area, or the balls dispersing in a much wider area, into inherently difficult/complex situations.

One thing GT had that was actually interesting was the evil dragons. Perhaps making the balls guarded by their dragons, or something like that, would make the balls tougher to acquire.
