I get the impression that TV is more popular than comics in general, so there's that. (In my case it's just because I physically can't read the manga. So I especially appreciate stuff like [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRZamDg_Dw4][Dragonball Dissections]] and [[http://www.kanzenshuu.com/podcast/][Kanzenshuu / DaizEX's Manga Review of Awesomeness]], and heck, DBZ Abridged, for making the second half of Namek tolerable.)
