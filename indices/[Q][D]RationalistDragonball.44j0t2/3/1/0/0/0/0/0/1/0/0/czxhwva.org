I expect a lot of the anime's popularity happened during the faster parts. It seems like everyone I know got into it around the Saiyan arc, when things were considerably faster paced than the temporal abomination that is the Freeza fight. (I got bored enough during the Freeza fight that I stopped watching and missed the SSJ transformation episode, because I wasn't expecting anything more interesting than "Goku wins somehow" to happen after the previous 10 episodes.)

(The manga being available online doesn't help me. Even when I could see well enough to get something out of the visuals in the anime, it wasn't enough for comics, never mind something in black and white where most of the detail is in the line-art. For reference, I could tell that Krillin was bald and wore a red/orange dougi, but had to be told that he lacks a nose, even after paying particular attention to a close-up from early Namek. I did notice Dende's enormous eyes? I didn't know Namekians had antennae until the Lord Slug movie.)
