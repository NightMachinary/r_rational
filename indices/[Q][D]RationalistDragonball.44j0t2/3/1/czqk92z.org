  I'm still not clear on whether the so-called Androids were actually cyborgs, or what

Depends on which ones you're talking about. Andorids 17 and 18 were originally humans, a set of twins that were kidnapped and converted into the androids we know now. So was Dr. Gero (Android 20). Androids 16 and 19 were entirely mechanical, as were most of the preceding androids in the series.

Also it is total bullshit that Dr. Gero can build planet busting capable robots (considering they're canonically much stronger than Freeza, who was a planet buster) Whatever he discovered that made that possible could've been put to SO much better use.
