While munchkinning the mechanics of a setting with an extensive albeit poorly defined magic system (like Harry Potter) and especially one with Serial Escalation as a major theme (like Naruto) is immensely satisfying in a rational fic, it works as fanfic because it's a relatively* simple thing for an intelligent author to fill the blanks in canon, rank the ultimate techniques as they like, and generally have stuff interact in new and interesting ways.

The problem with Dragon Ball is that it runs on /so much/ *bullshit* that there's just no good way to translate what's shown into something that makes sense on an intellectual level, and whole swathes of the internet have been lost to exactly that sort of discussion already. With the sheer amount of mechanical worldbuilding you'd have to inject into the 'verse, you might as well just write an original story and cite Dragon Ball as inspiration.

I mean, I'm /still/ not clear on whether the so-called Androids were actually cyborgs, or what.

Essentially, if a rational agent has motive and power enough to blow up the earth with a wave of their hand, and can only be stopped by an handwave of equal or greater power, there's just no good way to focus on the /rationality aspect of the story/, since the rational path in-universe is, by default, pretty dang short and boring (unless you're animating it, of course)
