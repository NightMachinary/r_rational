I'd argue Saiyans don't respond well to training anyway.

Compare Goku after three years training with Kami, versus Yamcha after training with Kami for a single year.

Saiyans grow stronger through the slow accumulation of hereditary badassitude or by getting their asses kicked against a real enemy and then recovering.
