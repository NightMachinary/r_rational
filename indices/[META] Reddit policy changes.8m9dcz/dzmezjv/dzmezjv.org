Obligatory IANAL, but I think this applies to the content that reddit actually hosts. So if you write a fic in a self post or in a comment (i.e. [[/r/writingprompts][r/writingprompts]]) you are subject to section 4.

If someone links your work hosted by another website, you're subject to section 5 and it doesn't grant reddit any rights.
