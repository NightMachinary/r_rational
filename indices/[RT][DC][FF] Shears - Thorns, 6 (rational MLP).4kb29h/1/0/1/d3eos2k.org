I understood the text as well. It's rare to find hard magic systems that have this much detail, so it would be unfortunate if this affects how much info on magic you include in future chapters.

That being said, the average reader probably doesn't know much about physics, if at all, so I doubt they'd understand the science. It all depends on your target audience. STEM students should have no trouble understanding this (except maybe the math, and in that case marginal research should bring them up to speed).
