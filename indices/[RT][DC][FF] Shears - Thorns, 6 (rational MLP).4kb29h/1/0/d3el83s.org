Do you think it's a problem, or are you just stating an observation? I'm a bit concerned.

I'm wondering whether I should try / should have tried to disclaim that complete comprehension of background physics isn't required to enjoy the story, just enough scientific literacy to pick out key points (like "gems can be used to focus magical attacks on a certain target if you know their spectrum"). I'm honestly extremely happy with the background physics in this chapter (I think it makes perfect sense and is a pretty damn nifty system), but I definitely care what readers think too. The goal with these sections is really to give a given reader however much they want to get out of it; if they want to pore over the details, the details are there, but if they just want to skim it and concentrate their attention on the narrative, that's perfectly okay too. Do you have any thoughts on how to make this option more obvious? A literal disclaimer seems a bit tacky and like it would probably have the opposite of the intended effect.

Maybe I could put more effort into exhibiting Twilight summarizing the key points in her head afterwards. Or I could display her written notes.

I also would appreciate feedback (from any reader) on a couple other related things, if anyone is so inclined. Is the balance between background science and narrative strong enough? I try to generously space out info-dumps like this.

Readers who either don't pay especially close attention to the science, or readers who don't claim to understand it: does it seem like it /does/ make sense intrinsically, and you personally didn't form a comprehension? Or does it feel like contentless technobabble? I'm much more okay with the former, since I strive to write a system that makes sense internally.

The vivification system is actually pretty much exactly the same mechanically as the system of photon emission/absorption in our world. The only difference is that you allow complex-frequency "photons", and that's what a pure magic beam is. "Thauma" is a general term for electromagnetic radiation (EMR) and magic radiation (MR) together. Readers who claim a working understanding of this chapter's physics, did any of what I just said fail to come through in the text?

I'm writing a lot more about this than I maybe intuit is wise for an author to do because it's something I want to totally nail. I want a universe with awesome, believable physics as a high priority. Maybe you don't understand all of it, but maybe you don't understand real-life physics completely either (I know I don't). I don't think you need to be a physics student to get enough content from these sections for then to be worth the time. However, I am a physics student, and I've never been especially skilled at emulating minds without my own level of understanding. If I'm not achieving what I'm aiming for, I want to be told. I don't want the level of detail to become an entry barrier. So, I'm taking a lot of care in asking for input and trying to make educated decisions about what's best for the story and my vision for it. Apologies if anything I said here comes across as elitist; I just want to be exceedingly careful. If I drastically fucked up this section, I'd prefer to edit it straight away. But if two similar comments are just a coincidence and the majority of readers have no issue with it, I'd strongly prefer not to do any unnecessary editing. Any feedback at all is sincerely appreciated.
