  Do you think it's a problem, or are you just stating an observation? I'm a bit concerned.
#+end_quote

It's not a problem for me personally, if anything it's interesting for the novelty of it: a magic system so hard it involves actual /math!/ I'm just stating a general wisdom that math alienates readers.

  Do you have any thoughts on how to make this option more obvious? A literal disclaimer seems a bit tacky and like it would probably have the opposite of the intended effect.

Maybe make Spike into a bit of an Audience Surrogate and have Twilight summarize the gist of it to him? Maybe make use of Pinkie's Fourth Wall Leaning tendencies to make a comment that math is an optional bonus? Make it into a joke instead of tacky disclaimer.

  Readers who claim a working understanding of this chapter's physics, did any of what I just said fail to come through in the text?
#+end_quote

I think it came through, I got the analogy with our mundane absorption/emission. I understood that MR is like EMR, only with complex numbers. I missed that "Thauma" is a catch all term for radiation, I was under the assumptions that "thaumic" (and variants) is a fancy synonym for "magical" as per usual convention. Now looking at it I see that "thaumic wave" is right in the first sentense.
