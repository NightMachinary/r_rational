  Did you mean to say Ψ there without defining it?

But it is defined at the first occurrence: "This is a spectrum (i.e. a function from the positive complex numbers to [0,1], *typically denoted as Ψ*)".

  If identical Γ but wildly different Ψ means identical abilities, then measuring Γ gives you all information about abilities.
#+end_quote

I think because Γ is defined as an integral, you can't measure it directly, you need to measure Ψ, and then integrate to get Γ. Alternatively, you can compute Γ from Π and Ξ, but presumably you can't measure Π and Ξ from traces, and Ψ you can.

  How are single frequency attacks more useful for assassination than colorful ones?
#+end_quote

I think it's about concentration all the energy in the vulnerable spot instead of spreading it all around the spectrum (and thus letting most of it being absorbed).
