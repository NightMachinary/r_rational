I think Thief's actions here have more weight than what Hakram perceives. Hakram talks about a rivalry with Thief, but he's not considering the Rivalry that could be developing, or that Thief could be playing a longer game. Thief's origin story and actions thus far suggest someone who backs down to a stronger opponent. But that only works as long as Hakram isn't vulnerable.
