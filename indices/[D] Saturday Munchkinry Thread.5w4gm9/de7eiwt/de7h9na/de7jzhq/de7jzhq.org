You come into existence with the memory of your original really wishing they could be someone like you, so you assume magic rather than scientific cloning. Because you have been imagined into existence with extra skills (all the stuff your original wishes they had basically) you are quite a different person to them. You are clothed, sitting on a bench on a street, with a notebook and pen and the beginnings of a sketch of the building opposite. You tried to check into your email but the original gets an alert and changed the password. You mail them but get no response. They have been scammed in the past and will be very inclined to dismiss contact as a prank or a scam. No significant time has passed since the wish, but you and the original are in different cities.
