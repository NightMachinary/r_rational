This sounds like I took over another persons body. Am I sure I'm a clone, not just someone who looks like me? Birthmarks, say. If it's another person, since I am not carrying my ID, I should be near home or someone else I'm comfortable - someone might recognize me on the street if I wander around the place I spawned and ask. An approach that should keep me from starving is to walk into a hospital and claim amnesia, although I hear that in America that would land me in deep debt?
