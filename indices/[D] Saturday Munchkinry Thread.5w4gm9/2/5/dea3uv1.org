Why should we get exhausted? We're part of the universe that is restored when the player returns to the save point; we should therefore be functionally immortal and inexhaustible so long as we beat the player.

Put the player in a high-gravity zone capable of crushing the player into paste, which is theoretically possible to quantum-tunnel the entire player out of within a few uncountable eons and therefore isn't entirely physically impossible to dodge - the player will presumably get bored long before dying a few trillion times.
