If I have the ability to do fast computations in my head then I can just apply a pseudorandom function to the complete description of my opponent's actions so far and make it essentially impossible for my opponent to make useful their memories of previous iterations. That sentence was confusing so here's a sort of example / timeline:

1. Player loads save, attempts to fight me.
2. I fight them using strategy 54-b because my PRF told me so.
3. Player reloads save, attempts to fight me.
4. I fight them using strategy 93-m because my PRF told me so.

I decide how I fight in a chaotic way that is determined by the actions of Player but in a way that every tiniest muscle twitch can completely change my behavior, so they can't just reload after losing and use their memories of what I did last time. This negates the advantage of experience Player has after resetting: they can never get back to a situation where that knowledge is useful.
