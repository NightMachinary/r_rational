Can you think of any ways to beat a character (hereafter known as the "Player") who uses "Save" mechanics from video games, with you yourself having specific powers and limitations? To be specific:

- At specific locations in space ("Save points") this character can "save their game".

- When the "game" is "saved", the state of the universe at that time is recorded. The player can then go back to this point at any time, or automatically if they die.

- Only one save can exist at a given time; if they save again they overwrite it.

- At any time they can also "reset", going back to a very early point, the point at which they entered the area in which this conflict takes place (more on that later).

The player also gains EXP from killing and gets stronger as such, but this is no longer relevant at the time of this challenge as they have killed everyone they can but you.

The player, you, and everyone you know are trapped in an enclosed area underground which you cannot escape. This area is about the size of a large modern city. The player is an omnicidal maniac, and has killed everyone in this (normally overpopulated) area except you and a few people who managed to evacuate to safety.

If you allow the player to get beyond a certain point, a hallway before a throne room, they will destroy the world entirely, forever unless they choose to bring it back.

You yourself have a few powers and limitations to munchkin. To be specific:

- You can teleport anywhere within the area of conflict at any time. You need to walk (or run) a small distance to do so, so doing so uses some energy.
- You have extremely competent combat abilities, normally completely overpowering the player. But they have as many tries as they want to get it right. Your specific combat abilities include gravity manipulation, projectiles (made of calcium, of any proportion) which can fly through the air and or emerge out of any surface, and huge floating blasters (These do not produce heat or thrust, and are only capable of hurting people). But you are not capable, for some reason, of any attack which is physically impossible to dodge unless the player first agrees to stop fighting.
- You always know how many times you have killed the player.
- You will die instantly from any hit that successfully lands, though you can dodge them using teleportation or ordinary means. You are susceptible to exhaustion, though your physical state (and with a few exceptions, like the number of times you've killed the player, your mental state) is loaded along with the state of the rest of the universe. This includes how exhausted you are.

This is a pretty tough power to stop. Any ideas?

This is obvious to anyone who's played the game, but this scenario comes from a popular video game. I don't want to say the title of the video game outright, because this post contained massive spoilers for the game. If you don't know the game and don't care about spoilers, put "Haqregnyr" through rot13.
