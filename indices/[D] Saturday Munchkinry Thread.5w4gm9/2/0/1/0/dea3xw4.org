  How can we force the player to save in a bad situation? Can we even know if the player saved?

Have you ever read worm? (If not, SPOILERS AHEAD)

The same tactic used against coil could work here. Players will save after pulling off something difficult they don't want to have to do again. Give them some sort of difficult challenge, act as if they player overcame it, then set off the trap.
