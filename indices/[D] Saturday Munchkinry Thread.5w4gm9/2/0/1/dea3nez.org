How can we force the player to save in a bad situation? Can we even know if the player saved?

I'd suggest drug the player quickly and carefully enough that s/he becomes unconscious without realizing it and therefore unable to save or load; then put the player in a situation with sufficient complexity that s/he will want to save before beginning to address it but pleasant enough that s/he would rather see the current situation to completion rather than simply reload to an earlier point, especially if the player is still a bit "out of it"; then murder-kill as often as possible - the player will still reset to before the conflict, but if we use this strategy whenever the player proves to be trouble we can eventually force the player to adopt a non-troublesome strategy.
