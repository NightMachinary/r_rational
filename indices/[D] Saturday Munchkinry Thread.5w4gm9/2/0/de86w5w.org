So the general idea is to get the player to "save" in some position where they die pretty much immediately after no matter what they do, so they get frustrated and reset. Then you immediately gank them every time they try to increase their power, forcing them to reset constantly.

If their value system is even somewhat malleable, the negative reinforcement should eventually change their personality in ways that you can use.

In game terms, you're basically making the game too unfun to play in any mode except "pascifist."
