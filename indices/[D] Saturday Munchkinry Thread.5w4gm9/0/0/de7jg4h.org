Become a professional gamer, which I would probably have a knack for (and if I'm streaming or something, then I might imbue a bit of personality in my videos by adopting a persona as a displaced RPG hero character who has strong opinions about these others RPGs that he's playing and relevant anecdotes to tell, a combination of Let's Play and serial fiction).
