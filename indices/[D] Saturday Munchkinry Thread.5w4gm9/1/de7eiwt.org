Don't know if this is munchinry as there are no special powers to exploit as such. You come into existence as the younger clone of someone else. You have their memories, but you also have a lot of talents they didn't have, such as singing, art, speaking Portugese and general athletic prowess. You are healthy and attractive and apparently around 20 years old. But. You have no money, no ID or legal existence and no way for now to contact the original you're based on. As far as you know no-one else has been cloned like you but you could easily be wrong. How do you go about making money, creating a life and ultimately finding your originator?
