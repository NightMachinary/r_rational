How do we know this, as opposed to thinking we teleported, were made younger and implanted with additional skills?

How did the scenario start out - a bang of displaced air, a sphere of deleted matter like in Terminator, waking up in our bed? Are we clothed? Are we within a day's travel of our home?

Depending on local customs, visit a library or other place with public internet. We could send ourselves an email (how exactly would we be unable to contact someone whose entire memories we know?), but we should check whether time has passed, and whether our memories say we'd cooperate with ourselves.

Any technology that can do this at nonastronomical cost is [[http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=366414&type=card][a gamechanger and an express route to Singularity]]. Our independent existence indicates an accident, a moron or magic.
