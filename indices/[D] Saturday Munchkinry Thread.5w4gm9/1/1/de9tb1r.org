Hmmm. No support system. Troubling.

If I have their memories, I might have memories of someone they can call on in an emergency - enough to get somewhere to sleep the first night or two. Once I have a basic support system in place, I can try to find employment - I have all the original's skills, plus more, so I should be able to find someone willing to pay me to work for them - and move on from there.

My lack of official documentation will be a problem. I /could/ always go to the relevant government department, claim all my documentation had been lost in a fire, and ask for it to be re-issued - since I'm a clone of someone who /is/ on the system (and thus, presumably, has a recognisable thumbprint and other biometric identification).

Sure, original-me can cause a storm of controversy at some point - and probably /will/ - but then it's a great big /public/ storm of controversy, and there will be DNA checks and stuff like that. Either I /am/ a clone, in which case Original-me and I can work together to figure out what to do and I won't end up starving at least, or I'm not, in which case I want to know what's going on too...
