Hmmm. A similar situation happened in a webcomic... /City Of Reality/, I think it was. Well, not the same - /extremely/ different in the details - but the villain had an artifact that allowed him to rewind time a few hours as often as he needed or wanted to.

But the same principle that applied there applies here. The Player can just keep going as long as he wants to. You need to persuade him to /stop wanting to/. You can't defeat him by force - the defeat needs to be psychological.

Maybe you can persuade him that killing you is not worth the effort. Maybe you can persuade them that it's no /challenge/ to abuse their save game to kill you, that if they can't do it in a single run they don't /deserve/ a victory.

Maybe you can take advantage of the fact that the Player is forced to experience all these loops, while you only experience one - and simply ensure that it takes such an incredibly /long/ time to get past you that mental fatigue eventually stops the Player.

(Either way, it makes sense to collapse that hallway).
