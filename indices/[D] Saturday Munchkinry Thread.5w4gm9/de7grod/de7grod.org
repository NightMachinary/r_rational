Inversion of The Gamer:

You are an RPG hero character. "Normal" life for you consists of grinding for skills and stats, killing monsters for XP, magic, and munchkinry in general. You expect to save the world. Suddenly, you are transported to a mundane 'real world' setting. Instead of bright blue status windows and time stopping menus, you have a mental skill for imagining such windows.

Your new identity is that of a weakling kid who spends most of their time gaming. You can't be sure the stats you see in your mind's eye are even real, since they seem to fluctuate based on hidden variables. Combat no longer yields (much) experience, and there doesn't seem to be such thing as magic any more. You no longer automatically know if people like you or not, even though the reputation system here seems to be more important than ever. Also, you have hardly any willpower, no college level skills, and barely enough knowledge to pass high school.

What do you do?
