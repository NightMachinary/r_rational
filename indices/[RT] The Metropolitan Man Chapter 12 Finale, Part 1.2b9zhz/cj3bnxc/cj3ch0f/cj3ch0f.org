No kidding. I'm so trained by popular media's trope of dramatic-yet-ridiculous revealing of characters' true feelings/beliefs only after some extreme event has come to pass that an actual /conversation/ involving /trust/ between two people in order to come to a better understanding of each other actually caught me off guard.
