Superman's comment about moving the spaceship seems odd. If he isn't lying, he presumably put a decoy spaceship in, but I can't see for what motive. Why would a decoy spaceship be better than none at all? Especially since it contains kryptonite. Perhaps he just couldn't move the kryptonite? Or it could be a fake? But if it were a fake then Lex has no ability to harm him next chapter, which would be an extremely disappointing finale.

Him lying doesn't seem to make much sense either. He clearly acknowledges the need to move it, so why wouldn't he have? It is surely within his ability, even with the kryptonite inside it. And for what purpose did he lie?

This line will hopefully make sense next chapter, because I am currently at a loss
