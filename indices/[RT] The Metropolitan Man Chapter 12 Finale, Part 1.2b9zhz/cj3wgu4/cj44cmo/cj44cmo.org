The problem is that talking to him is a high risk / unknown reward strategy. If you talk to him about something important and he doesn't like what you say he could lash out. If he doesn't like what you say and it's the last straw, then he snaps and you've created what you were trying to avert.

On the other hand, talking to him might help ground him...but what if it isn't enough, and he goes bad anyway? Then he knows who you are and might well target you first.
