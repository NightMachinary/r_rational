Up until this Chapter, I was definitely willing to respect Lex/Lois' tactics- Supes was an unknown on the most important of factors, mentality. Sure he acted nice in the interviews and played a good Smallville, but those could be ploys. Now that they've had an honest conversation about who he is, Lois has the responsibility of re-evaluating the risks as she sees them.

Her old info: unknown mindset, clearly lying about who he is, extinction-level powerhouse. High-risk to talk to directly.

Her new info: known mindset (lonely Smallville kid with superpowers but potentially limited rationality skills), lying to protect his own sanity, still extinction-level powerhouse. Low-risk to talk to directly.

I know which one of those I'd bet my life on, if I knew I was one of the few people who could make a difference.
