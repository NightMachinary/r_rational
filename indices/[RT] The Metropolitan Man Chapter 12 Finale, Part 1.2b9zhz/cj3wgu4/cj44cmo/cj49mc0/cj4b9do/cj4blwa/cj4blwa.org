This sort of logic is very holey.

Would I bet my life on it? Yes. Why? Because their whole thing is that they are already betting their lives and are willing to do so. They are trying to poison him, attack him, kill him, be aggressive to him. They are clearly willing to risk their lives.

Based on their models of human emotions and his behavior talking to him is likely to have a much higher reward/ risk ratio than trying to kill him, or murdering his mother. Any course of action could lead to risk/ benefit, but they should base their actions on what is likely to happen. They shouldn't purposely only pursue what they know is a high risk/ medium reward strategy when there is an alternative low risk/ high reward strategy that carries little additional risk.

They should also be considering other scenarios. What if other super beings come? What if the Superman thing is an elaborate test by some godlike entity? What if the USA is invaded? Those scenarios should carry some weight, Superman could reduce the risk of a mass extinction.
