Someone stole his spaceship, so he knows that there's at least someone out there who knows his secret identity and is plotting against him. He might not know who, but if I had to guess, I'd say half the reason he's taking a break is to figure out who it is. Plus Floyd Lawton is sitting in a cell somewhere up north, and he certainly didn't come from nowhere.
