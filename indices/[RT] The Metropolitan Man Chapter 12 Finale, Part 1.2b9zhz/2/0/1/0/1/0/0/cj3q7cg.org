Lead blocks kryptonite radiation. Lex established that with a Geiger counter.

Lex described Superman's explanation of x-ray vision as sounding like it was thought up by someone who didn't know how x-rays work. Lex also said that if Superman could see through several feet of concrete, he should be able to see through an inch of lead. Thus it's plausible that Superman pretends his x-ray vision works like how he imagines real x-rays to work.
