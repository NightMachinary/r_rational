The bit about the stolen ship might well be misinformation, we only have his word and he's good at deception (and as for as we know, not good at building advanced pieces of technology like the stolen ship). If he only came recently to his better senses, he indeed did not take proper measures before to ensure the ship's safety nor his mother's, and lying then might serve further, undisclosed purposes. That said, I cant think of any really good purpose right now.

+1 for superman being a "level 1.5 (at least)" player rather than the plain brained hero he appeared to be at first.

PS: I dont see much reason for spoiler tags here as we're obviously discussing the latest chapter.
