Superman is actually hiding a lot of the truth from Lois. He knows that someone out there knows his secret identity, and that there's a shadowy figure or figures pulling the strings. And he's also got to realize that Lois's life is in danger, just like his mother's was. He doesn't seem to tell Lois any of that, though it seems like she should have a right to know. He also doesn't tell her that he's got a prisoner in the Arctic. That whole conversation was sort of funny, because both Lois and Superman were dropping layers of their deceptions while pretending that they're dropping all of them.

It could be misinformation in order to see how she'd react to the lie? Or misinformation to see how/whether she's leaking information to someone? Tell Lois that the ship is in the Arctic, see what happens?
