How about he bloody listened? The early chapters note the existence of many different people and organisations with ideas to do much greater good in the same amount of time as what he is getting. Psychologists exist, so if he fears going insane he can get help rather than trying to self-medicate by having a job on the side as a reporter.

The man has super-hearing, and has an institute of brilliant scientific and philosophical minds created specifically to intelligently deal with the predicament of his existence. This isn't some understandable farmboy level ignorance, this is arrogant, deliberate, and insistent.
