I meant ignorance more among the lines of not being convinced than not being aware. I agree he /should/ be more efficient so I cannot say he's right in his position, but I do think it's entirely understandable that he's reluctant, in many ways. The ideas suggested tend to be about money and economical good while Superman is all about saving the individual people. It reminds me very much of the identifiable victim effect - he does not intuitively feel the sheer amount of good he could do by being more efficient compared to saving people individually.

Well, perhaps. We do not get to see his actual reasoning besides him wanting to remain impartial. But I absolutely do not think that most people with his personality parameters (non-violent, resents money, wants to do the most good possible, etc) and background would choose very differently, not immediately.
