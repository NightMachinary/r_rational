Superman has made it very clear repeatedly that he has extremely strong morals, and is very adverse to lashing out. It took a guy repeatedly aggravating him, confessing his crimes, sending people to rape children and lots of other things to get him to kill. It took killing his mother.

Lois likely could say a lot of things without him lashing out given his personality. He clearly isn't going to lash out at relatively minor things like "Maybe you should give criminals jobs, not just beat them up."
