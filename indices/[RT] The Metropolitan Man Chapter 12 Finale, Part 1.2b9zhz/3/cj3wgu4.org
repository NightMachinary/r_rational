It seems odd to me that Lois hasn't made the conclusion that "Clark Kent" is Superman's way of staying connected to the human world. That is who he is first, then Superman. If he dedicates himself wholly to the latter, he's concerned he'll lose touch with his human side; ironically, fulfilling the exact fears Lois and Lex have about a Superman living amongst mortals.

I agree that Supes is wasting time working at the Daily Planet instead of stopping disasters; however, it's abundantly clear that he has the same mental stress limits as other humans. If he is terrified of what he'll become if he totally gives into the Superman persona, that should be STRONG evidence in support of his actions, instead of a weapon to be used against him by Lex and Lois.

As smart as they both are, they are making the critical mistake of assuming they can figure everything out without actually /talking to him about it/. Granted, he hasn't been open about his true heritage with anyone til now, which is why I've let it slide thus far.

Lex was on the right track with the concern about a human connection/empathy; however, tricking and lying to him (on both Lex and Lois' part) is a weak battle-plan compared to just talking to the man and working out with him what he needs to do to stay Superman and sane.
