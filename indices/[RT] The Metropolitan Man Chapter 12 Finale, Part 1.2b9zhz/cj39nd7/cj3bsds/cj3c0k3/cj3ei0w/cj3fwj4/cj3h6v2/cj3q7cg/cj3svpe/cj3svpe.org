  If lead blocked Superman's vision in the same way it blocked x-rays, Superman wouldn't have been able to see through a solid foot of steel or three feet of concrete.

That is quite different from what you're saying.

Furthermore, the Smallville operation was assumed to be secret because of lead in the earth's crust, and the death of Martha Kent is strong evidence that he indeed didn't know. It would be pretty contrived (narratively unlikely, rather than physically unlikely) if he couldn't see through the crust for a completely unrelated and unmentioned reason.
