My extra-short try of a definition:

Rational fiction: The author tries hard to keep everything consistent.

Rationalist fiction: Rationality teaching through rational fiction.

Currently, rationalist fiction solely consists of HPMOR (+branches?) and Luminosity (+sequel?). [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/search?q=%5BRST%5D&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all][proof]].
