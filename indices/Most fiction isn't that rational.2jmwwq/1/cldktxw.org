  The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.

80% of fiction plots gone, right there: lucking into victory, new powers they "never knew they had" coming through in a clutch, chekhov's guns dropping in that make no sense, actual bare deus ex machina without reason or foreshadowing, heroes winning because they "did they right thing" and that was rewarded by the universe, even after it looked like they'd lost. Most disagreements about "rational" fic on this sub are this issue to various degrees.

That is why the Dresden Files books aren't held up as strongly rational fiction. They aggressively go against solving problems with brains. Characters solve problems with super-powered "ignore the man behind the curtain" plotting that is revealed at the eleventh hour and bare-knuckled brawling. Several times, Harry even says he should be doing something smarter, but he's not because he's too mad to be smart.

  The rules of the fictional world are sane and consistent.

Many fantasy and soft sci-fi fiction stories involve things that /just are/, and are not explained or rationalized in any significant way. This accounts for most of the rest. Maybe 19.9%+.

Dresden 'verse, for example, is moderately consistent (if possessed of a DBZ like power curve), but actually has a zone of the universe where you definitionally need to be insane (as humans know it) to interact meaningfully with the environment.
