  The Characteristics of Rational Fiction it lists are characteristics of good fiction generally.

Well, maybe. I don't agree. They're some characteristics of one kind of good fiction, which we label 'rational' fiction. For example [[http://www.george-orwell.org/1984/0.html][1984]] is certainly good fiction, but it breaks or skirts all of the rules of rational fiction. At the same time, even a story that follows all the rules of rational fiction isn't forced to be good.

I don't agree that the genre 'rational' should be re-defined to mean 'rationalist'. I find that some elements of rationalist fiction (pontificating on rational techniques, having grand reality-defying goals like global optimization or ending death) are very intrusive and don't lend themselves to an enjoyable story. I find the distinction between rational and rationalist useful.

I also don't think we'd gain anything by re-gearing the community (i.e. by changing definitions) towards purely rationalist fiction.

If you wanted to expand the definition of rational fiction, I think it'd be safe to put something like "The wider world evolves/has evolved logically based on its rules" which would capture fan fictions like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7406866/1/To-the-Stars][To The Stars]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7736264/1/Emperor-of-Zero][Emperor of Zero]].

It might be safe to include something like "The protagonist must behave rationally" if you were happy with losing HPMOR. Or maybe "There must be a main character who behaves rationally". But I don't think that's needed on top of all the other criteria.
