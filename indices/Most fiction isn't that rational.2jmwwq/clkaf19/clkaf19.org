I wrote the original version of the definition in the sidebar by a process similar to what you suggest. I was listing traits that most of the stories being shared on (at that time) [[/r/hpmor][r/hpmor]] had in common. That original version (for comparison: [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1rkkam/in_light_of_the_recent_slew_of_recommendations/]]) is quite similar to the definition you suggest above.

The main changes since then are removing the points about transhumanism and the consequences of technology, since they are really more of Things LessWrongers Like than Rational Things. Also the point about characters not being stupid was changed, likely since the general opinion now is that HPMOR!Harry is "stupid in ways that are justified" rather than "not stupid".

I think part of the goal of the broader definition is to find more things many people here would enjoy to read, rather than delimiting a precise but very small genre. Possibly the best definition would be an extensive definition, like, "Stuff you'd recommend to someone who liked Worm and HPMOR", but it's fun trying to nail down what one likes about things....
