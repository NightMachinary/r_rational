On mergers: Eh, that's fair enough. Though the idea of a merger that only passes along /some/ things and not others raises all sorts of possibilities; if someone merges with a housecat, for example, they may gain any combination of the following:

- Ability to see in the dark
- Enhanced reflexes, especially when it comes to catching things
- Enhanced ability to move silently
- A habit of washing themselves in their own saliva
- A tendency to let other people think that they've got away with something - and then slam down the punishment for their transgression while they're already breathing a sigh of relief
- A compulsion to kill and eat birds, fish, and rodents if he sees any

And, of course, some of these are what he wants and some are not. But the question of what the tamer wants and what he does not might be /different/ for different people, or in different cultures; one culture, for instance, may frown /heavily/ on non-human appearance, while in another culture, non-human ears may be considered a sign of superior genetics and thus an attractive feature. Similarly, the cat-tamer's ability to move silently might be praised in one society (he can sneak up on our enemies!) and denigrated in another (you never know if that guy's sneaking up on you...)

  For the first point: that is a good point, its something I thought off but dismissed because I wanted to add the rule that "complex systems deteriorate" so even soul-bound items "age" mentally. But this may not have as big an effect as I thought and some ancient evils could add some easy interesting plot points.

Here's a thought: maybe they don't age in the same way as people do (because of not having a human body anymore) but, rather, they accumulate trauma as time goes on. An ancient sage, reborn in the form of a book, may once have had great wisdom and insights to share, until a great-grandson left him stuck in a drawer for a decade - when he was rediscovered, he'd undergone the equivalent of ten years' worth of sensory deprivation and was no longer quite sane. What makes this even /worse/ is that, for obvious reasons, all such possessed objects are not in human bodies; and the feeling of not being in the right body is the cause of all /sorts/ of possible traumas.

It's certainly possible that, in order to survive as a soul-bound item, the bound soul needs some sort of /dream/ to work towards; some powerful, all-consuming /AMBITION/ that allows them to ignore the fact that they are locked in the wrong body and have been for the last dozen decades or so and will be forevermore. The all-conquering despot has an ambition built in - he wants to Rule The World and nothing as trivial as mere mortality is going to stop him - but presumably other ambitions can also work (like the sword who used to be a famous fencer, and just lives to Fight Everything, or the sage-become-a-book whose ambition is to Learn Everything). But this also suggests that the ambition /itself/ might begin to warp the item - the sword, for example, might grow more and more bloodthirsty over time, encouraging its wielder away from peaceful paths simply because it prefers the rush of battle; and the sage-become-a-book may drift into less and less ethical means of experimentation and manipulation to find out new things (and maybe that's why he was locked in a drawer...)
