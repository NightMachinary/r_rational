System 1: The first thing to come to my mind is that there will be some /deeply/ unpleasant people seeking immortality for themselves. Think 'an eternal Hitler, forever leading the rise of Germany' to get the sort of idea I'm considering... though of course Hitler /in person/ has no place in a medieval story, I can imagine a similar person having a similar idea.

System 2: One way to counter the intelligence-amplification effect is simply to have both Beast and Tamer tilt themselves somewhat towards each other... so that while the Beast gains in intelligence, the Tamer /loses/. And that gets passed down in the genetics as well (so the more 'furry' traits someone has, the less intelligent they are, on average). On top of that, for non-Tamers, their intelligence /is/ amplified due to the Spirit, which works out to the average person having somewhere around average human-level intelligence (with some incredible geniuses and incredible dullards both around the place). How's that for a suitable excuse?
