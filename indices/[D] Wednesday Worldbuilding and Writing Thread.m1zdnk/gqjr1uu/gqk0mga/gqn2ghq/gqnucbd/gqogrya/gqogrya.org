It's not that eyewitnesses are better, it's that with them no one would have bothered to write things down in the first place. Thucydides would have never written about the peloponnesian war, as a letter to the future, if he knew all the eye witnesses would exist as ghosts. There might be history if ghosts are really rare or it's a newer invention though...
