For system one.

History would be completely different because there would be eye witnesses to events thousands of years ago. Maybe history /archeology is nonexistent.

Ghosts of experts would be like living libraries.

Language would evolve differently, or at least have some church latin separate from the vulgar tongue. Gotta learn to talk to old ghosts.

Without bodies, ghosts might lose human emotions or evolve new ones.

People might purposefully alter the ghost imprint they leave behind. To purify the parts of themselves they don't like, change memories so their ghosts tell an edited version of history, etc.
