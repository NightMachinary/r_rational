Hmm, im not sure I like much narratively having "tamers" be dumb, to reduce the average intelligence with that excuse they would have to be really dumb. I think probably something along the lines of intelligence just being too complex for the soul to amplify effectively (or does with diminishing returns) would work better narratively. It is a good point though and can give some more world-building: Bad joins and good joins, some spirit merging goes wrong, and both partners loose as much as they gain, while a good merger aims to only pass the beneficial traits.

For the first point: that is a good point, its something I thought off but dismissed because I wanted to add the rule that "complex systems deteriorate" so even soul-bound items "age" mentally. But this may not have as big an effect as I thought and some ancient evils could add some easy interesting plot points.
