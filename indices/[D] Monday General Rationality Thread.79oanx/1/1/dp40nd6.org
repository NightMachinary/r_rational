1) Scam would actually be for you to hold on to passport/smartphone when said passport/smartphone is criminal evidence or would otherwise get you in trouble.

2) and 3) During high school I made a huge effort to change my resting face from kind-of-bitchy to a smile. I felt like I was happier and more friendly and people around me were more friendly to me. Anecdotal evidence, but maybe changing your defaults might help you even in stressful situations.
