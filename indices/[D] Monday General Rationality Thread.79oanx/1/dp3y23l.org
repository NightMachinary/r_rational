1) Someone approaches you on a street, explains their [predicament] and asks you to give them $5 for 24 hours. They are even ready to leave their passport\smartphone with you for that time period if that's what's gonna convince you that they're actually truthful about returning the money.

And how to be able to accurately distinguish between such false positives and actual hostile intentions from others?
