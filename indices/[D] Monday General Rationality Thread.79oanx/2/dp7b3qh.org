You've been tricked by someone. (Excuse the sort of vague nature of this question; I'm doing research for some fiction.) This left you in a situation which was embarrassing but not actually harmful. You're angry, and you want to know why they did it. How do you persuade them to tell you why?

You don't have any leverage over them -- you know them vaguely, but not very well. Importantly for this question, you're you, yourself, not in a fictional world. So your answer can be "I'd get a gun and shoot them in the kneecaps" or "I'd offer them $10,000 to tell me" or "I'd chain them to a wall and punch them until they confessed" if you actually have access to a gun or ten grand and you'd actually be prepared to do that in real life. (I wouldn't personally do the gun or chains one, and I don't have access to either guns or big money anyway.) You can't magically create persuasive arguments. Assume they have no big reason to want to tell you why they did it, and probably they do not want to tell you because you're already angry and their reason might make you angrier.
