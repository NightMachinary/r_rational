1) All kinds of ways.

- As [[/u/CopperZirconium]] pointed out, their passport/smartphone could be criminal evidence. Evidence that you now have your fingerprints on.
- When you return their passport/smartphone, you may leave fingerprints on them. Fingerprints which they can replicate and plant on crime scenes to frame you for crimes that they commit. Similar methods may also be used if you leave behind pieces of DNA like skin and hair.
- Their smartphone could be used to track your location. As long as you are holding on to it, the scammer can track you wherever you go. Even if you turn off the smartphone, you can't be sure that they haven't opened up the smartphone itself and put a tracking device inside it.
- Similarly, the smartphone could contain a listening device, sending information about you back to the scammers. Any secrets you speak in private, they could be eavesdropping on through the smartphone you are holding onto.
- How will they be returning the $5? Are they asking you for an address? An email address? A phone number? A bank account? All of these are potentially dangerous, since they reveal personal information about yourself and/or your financial holdings. Similar methods may be used if they ask you to give them $5 to a certain bank account or address.
- Or worse, are they asking you to meet somewhere after 24hours so they can return your $5? That's a potential trap, where they can ambush you with superior numbers/forces and kidnap/threaten you.
- How are they giving you their passport/smartphone? Presumably, this would allow them to get within very close proximity. Close enough to say, pick your pocket.
- Or plant evidence in your pocket.
- Or nick a tiny amount of your body's DNA.
- Have you considered counterfeit/stolen money? And I'm not just referring to them returning a fake/stolen $5 bill to you. In many countries, money has IDs. IDs that the police may use to track down bits of money, who owned them, who they gave them to, etc. etc., for all kinds of money-related crimes. When you give them your money, you are also giving them IDs that they could potentially use to mislead criminal investigations onto you.
- Ever heard of remote bomb detonation? Bombs can be made such that they explode upon receiving certain wireless signals. Wireless signals, such as those you can make using a smartphone call. If say, they ask you to call them later, or their phone is somehow rigged to automatically call some number later, it could effectively become the detonator for a bomb. Whose detonation signal came from you. Potentially causing the police and counter terrorism forces to crack down on you instead of the true culprits.
- What about biological weapons? If any evil terrorist organization wants to design and spread a deadly non-airborne virus, they would need agents of the organization to go around physically contacting lots of people to spread the virus. Getting physical contact via ways such as, say, walking around city streets, talking to random strangers, and asking to borrow a small amount of money...
