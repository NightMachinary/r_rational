Is it acceptable to cross-post on threads like this? I've recently been wanting to post the same thing here and on LessWrong and perhaps in a few other places, since all of these communities are small enough that I don't always expect to get much response, and while there's a lot of overlap, it's far from complete.

Also, actually writing up what I want to say sometimes presents a large barrier; if I re-use what is for me the hardest part, namely starting a conversation, I'd be more likely to start actively participating.
