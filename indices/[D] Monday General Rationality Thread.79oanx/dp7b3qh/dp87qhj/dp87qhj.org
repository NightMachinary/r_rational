Threaten to sue them for defamation/slander/mental assault/etc. unless they explain themselves? It kinda depends on what you mean by "embarrassing but not actually harmful". Even if it doesn't harm you physically, it could still hurt you in all kinds of mental/emotional/sociological ways. I mean, the mere act of being tricked is already a form of harm, it could very well lead to you developing various trust issues and set you on the path to being a jaded cynic, who then has trouble getting married since your can't trust your spouse, has trouble getting jobs since you can't trust your employer, has trouble with family since you can't trust them, has trouble interacting with anyone since you can't trust them, and eventually you die old and bitter, alone and broken.

Trickery is bad.
