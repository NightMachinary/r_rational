The chance of having two stars in a given volume of space independently evolve life all the way from abiogenesis to sentience is exponentially lower than the chance of one star for that given volume.

Sure, there is /some/ volume of space within which life is inevitable, but if it's anything like as small as a 1500 light year radius, it would be puzzling why we don't see this happening already to lots of distant galaxies. It seems more likely to me that the volume exceeds that of the observable universe, and our own evolution was unlikely to begin with.

On the other hand, if early life migrated to different solar systems via meteoric activity, we might find other civilizations nearby for that reason. The common ancestral life form would be some type of extremophillic microbe, which could have traveled over millions of years in spore form via meteoric activity.

There should be quite a few large cometary bodies with liquid water oceans below the icy surface, so if there's life that can survive the trip, these might be where most of it actually lives (there are lots and lots of these bodies compared to goldilocks-zone inner planets like ours).

The panspermia hypothesis has the added explanatory feature that it doesn't predict life in distant galaxies (since that would take so long that life wouldn't have evolved yet at the beginning of the journey). So the absence of observable dyson galaxies is somewhat explicable.

However, even if panspermia is enough to explain the origin of nearby ETI in the absence of distant ETI, it's hard to see why they would have stopped at a single Dyson sphere, why it would take so long to build (it was observed dimming starting in 1890), and why it would happen to evolve around a star with a short evolutionary history.

I would guess that it's more likely to be the result of nonsentient life doing something weird (trees maximize their use of solar energy in a jungle, so perhaps it's not too much of a stretch to imagine there's a giant network of trees that can disassemble small planetoids to similar effect) than the work of a sentient civilization. Panspermia also predicts lots of nonsentient life, and nonsentient life spreads slowly at best, so that explains the lack of nearby dyson spheres.
