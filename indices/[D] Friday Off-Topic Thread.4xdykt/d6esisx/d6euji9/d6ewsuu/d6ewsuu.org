In my view there are plenty of areas and goals someone could dedicate their time/life to that are worth pursuing. Education, environmentalism, effective altruism, and so on.

The problem is, work in those fields tend to be difficult or not particularly well-paying. And I think that's the true source of malaise for a lot of people: a life of continual challenge and sacrifice is hard. Hell, just making money and donating it to those causes is useful, but it doesn't feel satisfying.

Personally I'm enjoying my work as a therapist quite a bit. I feel like I make a difference, I see the positive changes in people and communities I work with. But the pay is terrible. And with an eye toward starting a family in the not-too-distant future, I've felt myself thinking hard about the idea of a better paying, but less "useful" job that, as you say, just pads the pockets of suits in order to catch a few more in my own.
