I agree, if I had to vote between subsidies for therapists working in underprivileged communities and subsidies for, say, green energy development, I'd choose the latter, because I think sooner advances in that field would have a bigger impact and do more good overall. I'd say the same for something like Friendly GAI development too, though personally I'm not quite convinced that it's a bigger issue than global warming at this point in time. Point is, there are a lot of areas that need more economic redirection.

Unfortunately right now there are far too many destructive or valueless areas that our society is subsidizing, and that's the first thing that needs to be corrected before we decide between all the "good" areas to spend money in. Our values as a culture have to change so that what we accomplish does.
