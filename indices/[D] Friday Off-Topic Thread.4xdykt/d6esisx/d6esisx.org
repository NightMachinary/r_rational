I wonder if there is any "rational" way to decide what your motivation/goals are or if such things are more or less predetermined by circumstance.

I've been having a hard time in my life mostly because I have no idea what I really want to do. I've got a few skills that I can more or less rely on, but very little motivation to use them fully. Part of that is probably a fear of failure, but another part of it is also from having experienced small sucesses that ultimately aren't that fulfilling in the end.

I guess my real question is what I should be doing with my time. And why is it worth it? Or should I just continue floundering about trying to distract myself with entertaining things so I don't think about that?
