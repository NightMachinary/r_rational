What's everyone's take on [[/r/KIC8462852]]?

For those unaware, we've found a really weird star. There were 2 periods in 4 years where it dipped in brightness ~20% for a few days. Additionally, over the 4 years the Kepler telescope was watching it, it's brightness dimmed by 2-3%. Additionally, over the past 100 years it has dimmed ~20%.

So there's lots of speculation flying around, and the only theory that seems to be consistent with all of this is an extra terrestrial intelligence building a dyson swarm. On September 14th, we'll get some parallax data that will tell us exactly how far away this star is, which will help winnow theories down.
