I'd be very surprised if it was a dyson swarm, because if it were I'd expect to see a lot of other stars undergoing a similar transformation in the vicinity. This is probably some very rare and interesting natural phenomenon.

There's a good [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVCpBr3fxdE][Isaac Arthur video]] on this that raises further objections; e.g. the star has a short evolutionary lifespan so it's not as likely to be the home of a civilization as our sun.
