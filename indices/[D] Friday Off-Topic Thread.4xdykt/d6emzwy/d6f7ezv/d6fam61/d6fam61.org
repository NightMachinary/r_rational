Yeah, I'll need to do plenty of revision to actually be comfortable posting it anywhere, and I need to make sure the first chapter (primarily background) flows well with the rest of it.

It's pretty exciting to actually be creating something, for as much as I consume. I don't expect it to be fantastic or anything, but it's nice to have an actively productive hobby, hahah!
