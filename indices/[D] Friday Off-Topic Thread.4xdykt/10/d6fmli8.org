The Golden Record is one of the most deeply emotional things for me. Every so often, I listen to it, and it almost never fails to make me cry. Does anyone know of some SF that has related themes. Ideas about humanity reaching out into space to try and preserve it's history. Honestly any hard sci-fi would do, but that in particular effects me.
