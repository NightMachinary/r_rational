I finally found a chrome extension that presents a challenge/splash (rather than simply blocking you) when viewing certain sites on certain days. I've found it to be helpful in increasing my productivity.

Chrome extension Crackbook [[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/crackbook/nbgjmohekjolcgemlolblankocjlgalf?hl=en][(link)]] provides a splash page to websites of your choosing. No "are you sure" challenge, but waiting 3 seconds to open a page provides a similar experience. It's also open source: [[http://github.com/gintas/crackbook]]
