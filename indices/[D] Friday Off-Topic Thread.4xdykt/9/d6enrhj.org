Cognitive science problems:

- My new learning rule underperforms Naive Bayes in small dimensionalities

- But it also systematically overperforms human classification in small dimensionalities.

- But it keeps gaining performance as you add dimensionality (at least on this classification), at least up to somewhere around 20-50 features depending on how "structured" the category is, while Naive Bayes loses performance as dimensionality increases even at d in (0, 15).

So it's incredibly interesting from the point of view of dealing with dimensionality, but still just not that good a model of the human subjects from the other paper.

Welp, time to bullshit and make sure to submit to a more theory-focused venue.
