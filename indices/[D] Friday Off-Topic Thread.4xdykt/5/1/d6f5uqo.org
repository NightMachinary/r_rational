I think the main thing is encouraging questioning. I grew up under Christian parents, but they were always pretty questioning. Examples: Not taking politics, either side, at face value. Researching health advice before jumping on food fads. And most important, changing their minds. I knew of positions in which good arguments changed their minds.

Oh, and for me personally learning history was big. History begs the question, "If they screwed up so bad, how do I know I won't too".
