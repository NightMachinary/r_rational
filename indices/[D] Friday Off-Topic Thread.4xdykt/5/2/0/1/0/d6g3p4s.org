Heh, didn't mean to downplay the importance of teaching the use of dangerous tools, I just don't have any experience myself to pass down! Don't have any firearms, never used a solder, nothing more dangerous than a car, really. If I /do/ pick up anything that fits that description, I'll be sure to give my son a jump-start.
