I understand, though I should clarify that you can have youngish children learn to be careful and responsible with dangerous tools by providing supervision and by making sure they understand what can happen with them if they are not used properly.

Demonstrations like walking through a forest used for a shooting backstop (and seeing multiple ricochets in pinetrees), or dropping water on a soldering iron help, but at the same time I never worked a soldering Iron or even a CO2 pellet gun without supervision (as a minor).
