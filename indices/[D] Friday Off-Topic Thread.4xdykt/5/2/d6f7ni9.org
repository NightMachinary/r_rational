[[/u/Alexanderwales]] has already hit the most important points. On the material level:

- A love of reading from parents reading to me and having age appropriate books available, both encyclopedia and a bookshelf of increasing level readers.

- Building toys: blocks, constructs, Legos, erector-sets (mine-craft?)

- I learned to solder before I was 12 and by application Boolean logic, care with dangerous tools (soldering iron burns hurt) and some early introduction to concepts usually taught in 300 level EE courses.
