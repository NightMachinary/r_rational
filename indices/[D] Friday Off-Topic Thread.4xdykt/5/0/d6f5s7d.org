- Whenever you tell them not to do something, explain why so that they can understand motivation rather than just listening to dogma (avoid "Because I said so")
- Answer questions as fully and honestly as possible (I greatly prefer asking "long answer or short answer" so that I can gauge actual interest)
- Provide them with the tools to answer questions themselves; you don't want a child to just come to you for answers every time, because the learning process is more important than what's actually learned
- Bias them towards media that's as thought heavy as possible
- Take them places and do things with them as much as possible
