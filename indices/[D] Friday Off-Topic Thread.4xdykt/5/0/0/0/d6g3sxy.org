  To be honest, I'm looking forward to the days where I /can/ do things like explain and educate; for now it's definitely just going to be maintenance of a complicated machine that turns mush into worse mush.

You /can/ start that very early; young children usually understand much more of language than they can produce. (I tried to reflect that in my example conversations, actually.) Starting only once they start talking might only be more confusing. And by keeping the language you use towards them a few steps ahead of what they can produce, you also help them learn those steps. (The sooner they learn words like "angry", "sad", "why" and "not sure", or for that matter "hungry", "cold", "diaper", and "tired", the happier you'll both be!)
