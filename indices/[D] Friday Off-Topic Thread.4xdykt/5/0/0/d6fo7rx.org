Excellent advice. To be honest, I'm looking forward to the days where I /can/ do things like explain and educate; for now it's definitely just going to be maintenance of a complicated machine that turns mush into worse mush. Still. I'll try to keep your advice (and that of everyone else in this thread) in mind over the next few years. Thanks!
