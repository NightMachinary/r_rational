Actually, in retrospect, much of what I wrote was pretending to be wise, but hey, if it's helpful, hurrah.

  This is one we're already determined to stamp out. I can't imagine why everyone considers telling your kid that Santa et al are a thing is a good idea. For anyone, really, but it seems even more ludicrous for those of a religious bent: why lie about one magical being and then expect to be taken seriously for another? Regardless, it sets you up to be mistrusted in the preteen years, as you point out.

There's those, yeah. But I was also thinking of the lies we tell children about the human world we're raising them to enter. But that's going to get real personal/opinionated real quickly, so we might as well stick to stating the general principle.
