On a more practical level for younger kids/babies, I'd recommend learning [[http://www.babysignlanguage.com/chart/][baby sign language]] and teaching it to your child. We taught it to our son, and being able to communicate, even just basic ideas, is super helpful. Just eat, drink, sleep, and all done were extremely useful.
