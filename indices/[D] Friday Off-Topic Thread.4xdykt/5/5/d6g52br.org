The only thing I can think of is, teach them how to argue. A lot of the troubles my siblings and I had when growing up could be attributed to the fact that when we had reasonable complaints or issues, we couldn't effectively communicate it without sounding whiny (which encourages the parent to ignore the child's whining).

Teach your child to calmly explain the problem, explain why they think something is a bad idea instead of saying "I dont wanna!", and always */listen/* to their arguments.

In many fights, the goal is to *dominate* your opponents, but when arguing with a child, the goal is totally different. You want the child to /understand/ why they should or shouldn't do something rather than just being a perfectly obedient minion. However, be warned! If you teach your child to reason and argue effectively, be prepared to lose some arguments and be happy when it occurs. Many parents believe that as a child, children can never be right, which can result in teenagers rebelling for some independence and the ability to decide matters on their own if the parents are being too controlling.

Although, if your child is a brat when s/he argues, you are not required to argue with someone who is being mocking or insulting in real life either and is a terrible thing to teach.
