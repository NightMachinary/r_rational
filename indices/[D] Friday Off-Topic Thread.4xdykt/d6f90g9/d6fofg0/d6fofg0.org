Seems to me that that might be difficult to pin down. After all, games can often be used as one's venting grounds, so any negativity might be localized (more or less) to the activities within the game client. Add in the stress and the fleeting team relationship due to the playerbase size and it seems like you'd be more likely to get bursts of negativity in-game than out. I'd like to think of myself as a fairly mild-mannered and well-adjusted member of society, but boy, you queue me up with four other feeders in Dota and you better believe the verbal outbursts will manifest.
