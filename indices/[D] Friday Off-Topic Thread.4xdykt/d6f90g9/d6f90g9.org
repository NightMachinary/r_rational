Normally I try not to post to threads long after they've been put up, but the day is still young and I know a few of you read long after the thread's been up for a while.

I wrote a semi-scientific paper discussing Entity Resolution and overall user negativity on Twitter of League of Legends players, based on number of games played.

My partner and I took all the known english speaking followers of the main League of Legends account and analyzed their negativity using nltk in Python.

Then, we filtered out all users whom we could NOT easily resolve to a League of legends name. This amounted to a search of their Twitter bios for forms of "find me in lol: %summonername%" This reduced the number of users to about a thousand people mentioning their league names on Twitter.

After running some gnarly queries on the users, we could not find a statistically significant negativity difference between those who play League fairly often (verified via Riot's api) and those who play less.

I'm not a math guy, I'm a software guy, but according to the math guy, he organized the data such that the p-value < .05 in order to be considered a significant. P-value was .066 - almost significant, and kept dropping as we increased the size of the data. Thus, I hypothesize that those who play more games on league could end up being statistically significantly more negative than those who play less.

That said, Vader's definitions may not be adequate for League's lexicons, and it may be worth adding some phrases and terms to Vader's lexicon.
