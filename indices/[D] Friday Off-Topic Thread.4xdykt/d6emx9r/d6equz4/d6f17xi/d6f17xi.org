I recall the first moment in the film when Truman saw through the illusion, I couldn't relate to what he felt because I drew a blank. If I were in that situation I would've thought "does not compute" and sought help from the people I've always relied on when I encounter something I don't understand.

Due to my austism, I've always been dependent upon others in order to question my perception of reality. Even the way people act has always been alien to me, so I would never question anyone's behavior as weird. I'm a very trusting person who's lived a very sheltered life, and I kind of have to.

I can't really relate to Truman, even if I had figured out the same things he did I would've just had a nervous breakdown. This story is about living in a bubble that's actually a prison designed to control you, and that's something I can't even imaging about my own bubble because I need it to survive.

Maybe the movie is meant to appeal to your desire to run away, to leave a bad situation behind because you know there's something better out there. I, however, am terrified of what's out there and have only dared venture forth when I know exactly what to do. I probably need to work on this.
