To be fair, the situation is really, truly unordinary. I agree with you, if I started seeing the things Truman did I'd be more likely to see a therapist than think it was real. Partly because I work in mental health and partly because I have a life of normalcy to draw on, rather than a hundred minor coincidences and discrepancies to make me suspicious.

But from the privileged position of the movie viewer, I can admire his resolve, since I know the conspiracy is actually real. "Be more adventurous" isn't always a positive, especially if someone is happy with their life.
