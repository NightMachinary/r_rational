I love the movie, it's one of my all-time favorites. I love the concepts of anti-conformity and questioning authority/suburbia. It's not a rational story like we like here, it's more of a fable. But it has great concepts in it, loyalty and friendship, truth and reality, family and trust. I also probably get a perspective that's more unique than most, as I was a former christian and the movie is very metaphorical about losing your faith in god.

I find it fun and philosophically rich.
