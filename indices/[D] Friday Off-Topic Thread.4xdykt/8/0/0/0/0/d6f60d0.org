And I think you would be right to go to a therapist first. It's one of the reasons I liked Shutter Island. I think we need more stories about the untrustworthiness of human cognition and less about how if everyone seems out to get you or impossible things seem to be happening, you should assume you are in a giant conspiracy. Not to say that all movies need to be tools for social advancement, I just think the scale is too far one way, and Shutter Island showed that you can do it well.
