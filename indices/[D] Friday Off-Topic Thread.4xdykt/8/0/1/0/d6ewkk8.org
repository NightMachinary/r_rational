Original trigger warnings were meant to protect people from things like having a panic attack or flashback to a traumatic experience without warning. I believe they're still used to that effect by "SJWs", but it's been broadened and diluted somewhat by overuse, kind of like the "gluten free" craze. Helpful to those with actual Celiac disease/PTSD, but socially they now have a harder time justifying themselves to people who perceive it as a "fad."
