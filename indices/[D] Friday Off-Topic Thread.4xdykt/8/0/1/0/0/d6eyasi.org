Yeah, I don't think trigger warnings / content notes are a bad thing. They're a tool, and like all tools, they can be used for good or for evil. In most of my works I include content notes similar to the America's TV Parental Guidelines [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Parental_Guidelines][(link)]]. For example, in my quest [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/national-spirit-an-empire-quest.29956/][National Spirit]], I have the following:

*Content Note*

This work of fiction complies with forum rules, but also contains elements that may be unsuitable for children or adults. If you are concerned, please peruse these content notes. These notes by definition contain minor spoilers, so read at your own risk. If you feel that there should be something added to this content note, please reach out to me.

[Spoiler=Content Notes]- Depictions of violence and death, including the death of PoV characters.

- Depictions of religious intolerance

- Suggestive dialogue and descriptions

- Coarse and crude language

- Sexual situations[/spoiler]

This requires no effort, follows a generally accepted standard, and doesn't ruin anyone's time. Also, it has the normal trigger warning bonus of protecting speech. If you begin an article about, say, gun rights and self-defense, with "Trigger warning: this article is about shooting people with guns," then people can't try to silence you by saying "I feel uncomfortable reading this sort of article" any more. So, for example, I have some great stuff in there about heresy and religion, and nobody can claim to be offended by it /by surprise/ or anything like that. If you don't want to read about religious intolerance, that's entirely on you.
