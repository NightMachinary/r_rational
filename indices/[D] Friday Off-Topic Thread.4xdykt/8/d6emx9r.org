I didn't see The Truman Show until recently, and I didn't like it. My biggest problem wasn't that I didn't find it funny, didn't get invested in the characters, or even the numerous plot holes. No, the single thing that ruined the entire film for me was the fact that the premise is "What if a man's paranoid schizophrenia was true?" Truman discovers that everything he does is monitored and every person he knows is a secret agent.

From Truman's perspective, the whole world really is a conspiracy against him with the goal of manipulating his life and keeping him ignorant of the truth about reality. What am I supposed to take away from this kind of story? Even the Matrix was just about free thought and rebelling against the establishment, Truman finds out that his wife, family, friends, and the whole town were just actors pretending to love him all his life.
