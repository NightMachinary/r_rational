The part about experiencing some success and it not feeling fulfilling is something that I have struggled with too. I'm not sure if we are in a perpetual circle of disappointment, or if we are driven to keep achieving greater things. I really hope it is the latter.

The only way we can know for sure is to keep achieving and keep moving toward larger and larger accomplishments.
