You know, normally I'm the first one calling comrades to come rally and the last fight let us face, but I really hope you did /not/ mean that about needing a /leader/. What humanity needs is to grow past the idea of defining ourselves by our oppressors and exploiters. We need to grow past understanding ourselves as means and learn to see ourselves as ends, important beyond mere use and of fundamental value.
