Money is exactly the problem. Money is votes for what we want our economy to collectively do. And politics is rearranging the money such that votes are more equal (hopefully), so that the economy reflects what more people want.

Teachers, childcare workers, researchers, charities, etc, are all amazing uses of time. But the economy doesn't value them as highly as bankers, and as such it encourages the most capable people into banking and other rackets. I think the task is to make the economy reflect our societal values again. The problem is that our politics has been coopted by for-profit forces, and because of this the priorities of the economy no longer reflect the priorities of the humans who make up that economy.

A good leader would need to organize the people to take resources back from multinationals that are enriching themselves at the expense of everyone else. I don't think volunteering at a soup kitchen is going to be able to address our big problems like global warming. (No knock on your profession, it's more honorable than mine, I'm just speaking really abstractly.)
