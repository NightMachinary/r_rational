  The problem is that our politics has been coopted by for-profit forces, and because of this the priorities of the economy no longer reflect the priorities of the humans who make up that economy.

...are you being serious?

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complaint_tablet_to_Ea-nasir][Old things]] If you follow the link it is a recovered tablet written more than 3000 years ago that has a guy complaining about a bad shipment of copper ore. His supply chain was put under stress and he didn't like it. Someone making iron in the 1030 likely had a similar complaint as to the quality of Iron ore. Someone in 2003 had a complaint about the quality of Ytterium for the production of LEDs.

Humans haven't ever been out of a for profit system.
