  I'm curious in particular to see if Minecraft is accessible before reading is a thing for him.

This depends /hard/ on mode of play and relative development of other skills. Regardless of mode, a player needs to be able to distinguish blocks (visual acuity and object recognition) and move around and interact with blocks (fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination) at least moderately well, or it won't serve as much of a game. As for particular modes:

- Creative: can be treated as a near-infinite blocks set without reading, but better with reading (to find the desired materials by name using the search function) because the set of possible materials is so large. Caveat: monsters can be spawned in Creative, but don't attack; this may be confusing upon transition to Survival.
- Survival, "peaceful" difficulty: the big thing to be able to read for basic play is /numbers/, because resources are limited but stack. (Some resources are unavailable because they only drop from monsters.) Crafting recipes can be learned / intuited visually in most cases, but you may want to be around to help them guess (and understand things like durability and item tiers). Encourages planning more strongly than Creative because of resource limits. Character deaths are still possible (from lava / long falls / drowning); this can be mitigated by choices at world generation.
- Survival, not "peaceful" difficulty: you'd better have a plan or your character will die. Repeatedly. Reading strongly recommended even for basic play, but this may be avoidable with a family server (where you do all the complex planning in the early game) if the child can do the trip planning to run day trips (go out in the light, deal with any monsters on the way to desired location, enjoy desired location, be back to house before sun sets) before they can read. Family servers can transition to having the child as a fully capable participant over time (let them build new houses, etc.), but there are good arguments that this deprives them of the experience of figuring out good strategies given a world and set of rules on their own.
- Adventure: depends on the map. Many maps use written signs to deliver vital information.

All modes are /more/ accessible with reading, because that enables access to the wikis with detailed rules and interaction (recipes and otherwise) description.

Side note: Minecraft version 1.9 made combat substantially more difficult without offering an option to use the earlier (easier) system; if no such option is available in a few years, that may be the limiting factor in combat-required gameplay modes.
