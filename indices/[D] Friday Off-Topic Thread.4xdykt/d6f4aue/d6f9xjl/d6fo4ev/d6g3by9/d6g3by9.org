  Whoa, quite the novel! Now I'm definitely going to /have/ to bookmark this thread, there's quite a few well-articulated strategies here that will pay to keep in mind.

Oh good, my specific suggestions and examples got through. :)

  You sum it up well in one of your points:

  #+begin_quote
    Always take your child seriously
  #+end_quote

  And I feel this is the crux of many issues. They are merely scale-model humans, after all, and ought to be treated as such. The American whimsical dream of what it means to be a child or have a childhood have twisted our treatment of children to some extent, and for whatever faults I may be found guilty of, my aim is to ensure that lack of proper /attention/ is not one of them.

I wouldn't call that a summary of the whole, but it is definitely a very important point. Just because society doesn't call them adults (justified by differences in development and experience or not) doesn't mean they aren't /people/, and people /separate from their parents/ at that.

And taking your child seriously gives you a much better window into how they're doing and reasoning than relying on chronological age and school reports does, which lets you introduce things at a pace best suited to them. In particular, "natural" rationalist children (rare but possible) can advance /very/ fast in some areas, and have this very understandable tendency to be frustrated if not allowed to.

Also, what you do while your child is young sets up the later relationship dynamics, including /your/ habits regarding the relationship and regarding children. I have personally witnessed the same parents who fail to take the smart-but-not-very-articulate 6-year-old seriously /still/ refusing to take the even-smarter-and-now-very-articulate twenty-something seriously. It should go without saying that that is a major parenting failure.

  Thanks again for the response; I didn't imagine I would get quite so much good advice when I posted!

You're welcome!
