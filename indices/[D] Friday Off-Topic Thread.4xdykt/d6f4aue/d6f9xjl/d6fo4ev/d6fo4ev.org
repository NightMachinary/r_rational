Whoa, quite the novel! Now I'm definitely going to /have/ to bookmark this thread, there's quite a few well-articulated strategies here that will pay to keep in mind. You sum it up well in one of your points:

#+begin_quote
  Always take your child seriously
#+end_quote

And I feel this is the crux of many issues. They are merely scale-model humans, after all, and ought to be treated as such. The American whimsical dream of what it means to be a child or have a childhood have twisted our treatment of children to some extent, and for whatever faults I may be found guilty of, my aim is to ensure that lack of proper /attention/ is not one of them.

Thanks again for the response; I didn't imagine I would get quite so much good advice when I posted!
