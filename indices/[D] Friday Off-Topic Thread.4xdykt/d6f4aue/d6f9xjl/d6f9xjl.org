  So we've received word that if my son is not delivered this Saturday on schedule, my wife will be induced in Monday. Somehow this turned the waiting jitters up to 11, even though the time scale is practically the same.

Congratulations on your impending parenthood!

  What actions would you take to raise a child to be rational? What pitfalls should be avoided, and what positive actions should be taken?
#+end_quote

So much of this will depend on judgement and the particulars of your family and circumstances. Recall the [[http://www.yudkowsky.net/rational/virtues][Twelfth Virtue of Rationality]]: named virtues and techniques are subordinate to actually achieving the goal! That said, technique suggestions from someone who grew up with nonrationalist parents:

- Cultivate the Virtues, along with the self-reflection required for your child to take up their own self-improvement. Trying to do this for your child will probably result in doing more of it for yourself. In particular, /reward/ and /model/ what you want to see. As corollaries:

  - Whenever you lay down a rule or ask your child to do something, explain why. (Scholarship and keeping sight of the goal.) If you can't do so right then, explain later. This applies even before they start talking!
  - If your child asks why, /answer them/. (Curiosity, scholarship, and often also keeping sight of the goal.) "I'll explain later" should be reserved for time-sensitive situations and followed up on. "I don't know; let's go find out" is generally an excellent answer when true.
  - Ask yourself what the other people and the media that you expose your child to are rewarding and modelling. (Valuing people as people, or sticking them in boxes and decreeing worth to be based on how well they fit? Discovering one's own utility function, or following the expectations of others? Curiosity, or unquestioning obedience? Lightness, evenness, and empiricism, or sticking to a belief regardless of truth? Perfectionism, or mediocrity? Self-reflection, or impulse? Humility, or daring? Precision and scholarship, or accepting the first rough answer?) Not exposing your child to anything against your values is both unfeasible and a bad idea; instead, discuss various viewpoints with them. (Lightness, evenness, argument, perfectionism.) Having more rational children's stories would be nice, but maybe you can start showing them some of the lighter rational!fics? (Read/watch/playing something yourself before showing it to your child will help, and is the general advice I give to parents regardless.)
  - Look for places where you can start introducing techniques as tools.
  - Sometimes it's easier to demonstrate using an example from your life or someone else's rather than your child's.
  - If you do all of these well, your child will probably eventually start pointing out areas where you can improve. Don't flinch.

- Always take your child seriously. In doing so, you teach them that they are important and affect the world around them. (Remember, physics doesn't care if your child is a child, and society will eventually treat them as an adult!) It also pays off tremendously because they are way more likely to be open with you and ask you for advice later if you have a history of taking them seriously.

  - Before doing something affecting your child, ask yourself the questions below. "Yes" answers should be big warning flags.

    - If I were in my child's place, would I be unhappy with this parental decision?
    - If young HJPEV were in my child's place, would he be unhappy with this parental decision?

- Offer your child 'safe' ways to influence their own life (allowances, clothing choices, free time, input on family matters) as soon as it is appropriate and as much as possible; don't bother with their age in that regard just because of the number. Be available for advice. They will be better prepared to make big decisions if they have had lots of practice on smaller ones.

  - Special note for pre-verbal children: if a child repeatedly refuses / cries about / etc. a particular type of food, they may be allergic and unable to tell you. Giving food choices (texture, temperature, clade of underlying foodstuffs, etc.) within reason can help to narrow this down.

Examples of good conversations:

#+begin_quote
  "I want to wear the green shirt!"

  "Why?"

  "Because it's green!"

  "Well, right now the green shirt is dirty, so you can't wear it. Do you think you'll want to wear it tomorrow?"

  "Yeah!"

  "Okay, I'll do laundry today so that tomorrow the green shirt will be clean and you can wear it. Please pick another shirt to wear today."
#+end_quote

(If that keeps up over weeks, consider buying them more green shirts. Observe that this works best when you already know what properties your child cares about.)

#+begin_quote
  "Can we play together, please?"

  "I'm tired and angry from a stressful day at work. I don't think I'll be very much fun to play with today. How about you play by yourself or ask [spouse] today, and we'll set a time on the weekend to play together?"
#+end_quote

(A visible schedule may help.)

#+begin_quote
  "No. No more of this vegetable."

  "What don't you like about it?"

  "Tastes bad."

  "Tastes bad how?"

  "Bitter." [Note: young children are more taste-sensitive in a variety of ways; between that and genetic differences in taste, what is bitter to them may not be to you.]

  "Okay. You should eat some vegetables, because they provide important nutrients for your body, but maybe we can cook them differently or try different vegetables to find some that you like. What would you like to try?"
#+end_quote

(General rule for food: it's reasonable, barring allergies or similar, to insist that your child try a food /only if they've never tried it before/, and then only in small quantities. Overruling them if they refuse only annoys them, gives incentives to sneak behind your back, and creates aversions to the food in question. Even for acquired tastes, let them choose if they want to acquire it.)
