Ok, so I'm not a parent and can't offer real advice from the parent's perspective. All I can really say is: please try not to fuck up your child as I was fucked-up.

General good things I guess:

- Please remember that your child is running self-bootstrapping software on hardware that is still growing and not necessarily perfectly tuned yet.

- Please don't hit, throw, or beat your child.

- Introduce your child to reading and maths early. They don't have to get obsessed, but letting them progress as fast as they want and are capable will instill a good attitude. Show how to think through things and exemplify the use and value of precision.

- As others have said, reason with your child. Do /not/ rule your house as a tyrant. When you know better, explain at least some of how, enough to show you really do, and when you can, let yourself show uncertainty.

- You are a mortal (in the sense of: limited, not always perfect) human being. As far as I know, there isn't actually harm in your child knowing this.

- Compassion and understanding are the hardest and most important lessons to learn in life, so exemplifying them early can't hurt.

- You can introduce your child to heroes and role-models who use their minds effectively. Tiffany Aching, Young Wizards, Harry Potter (the originals), etc.

- You can give your child toys and games that use their minds /and/ their bodies: neither should be neglected.

- You shouldn't bother with lies-to-children. They just plant the seeds of edgy teenage phases.

But overall, just try to raise what you would consider a healthy, normal, decent human being. If you succeed, it'll be a miracle, but the closer you can hit that target, the better.
