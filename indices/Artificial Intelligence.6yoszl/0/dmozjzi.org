You might want to read Accelerando, for a dystopian future in which Earth becomes dominated by stock-trading AIs looking to maximize profit. (Needless to say, at that point, it's not really inhabitable anymore.)

That's not the real reason to read Accelerando, though. The real reason to read Accelerando is because you've already read transhumanist/singularity works like Schismatrix and wonder why, in those books, technology causes only one radical upheaval of society as we know it. In Accelerando, the pace of progress really does accelerate, and just when you get used to the new world, everything shifts again. The dizzying pace at which Charles Stross throws new ideas at your face is a wonder to behold.

EDIT: I just realized that you specified you want to read something where the AI does not try to kill humanity, which is why I thought I should emphasize that in Accelerando, the AIs truly do not want to kill humans. They only want to generate profit; human deaths are a neglectable side-effect.

EDIT2: I thought a bit more on the matter and wanted to share. (This is a bit of a bloated edit; I'm sorry.)

It seems to me that you describe two standard AI plots: in the first, sufficiently advanced AI is extremely human-like in motivations and actions (let's call this the Jarvis AI, after Ironman's robot butler); in the second, the AI is an omnicidal maniac, which is usually still very human-like (I'd call this one the Skynet AI). Interestingly enough, this interpretation of your statements misses a rather well-represented plot, which tends to be called the Paperclipping scenario around these parts. Basically, a Paperclipper is an AI that maximizes its utility function. While that AI is technically working correctly, its utility function is malformed so that it completely disregards human life. For example, if the AI had been created to make paperclips, it would see no problem with making paperclips out of human bodies. I've been thinking about stories featuring AI for about half an hour, and I can recall a number of stories of the Paperclipping variety^{1.}

Now, let's go beyond. Do you want fully benevolent, yet not human-like AIs? Read /Player of Games/ by Iain Banks, in which a space-faring civilization is directed by spaceships housing almost AIs of almost godlike intelligence. (It's the second book of the Culture series, but many fans agree that it can (or should) be read first. If you're picky about your AI, stay away from the other books, because in those books, the frequently featured communication logs between AIs humanize them quite a bit.)

Or do you want AIs which are deceptively human-like until they malfunction? Try the short stories by Isaac Asimov, especially those collected in /I, Robot/. Asimov is well-known for his Three Laws of robotics which are an early guideline for human-friendly AI. Most of the short stories are about breaches of the intention of the Three Laws which follow them to the letter, like an insane robot who believes nothing outside his space station exists and doesn't allow the mechanics to "fix" him because he is utterly convinced.

/Worm/ offers an interesting twist on a human-like AI. The AI is human-like by necessity, to allow empathy, yet its internal structure is governed by hard restrictions which a human being would never have to face. As this is no focal point of Worm, don't read it for this reason alone.

Another only superficially human-like AI is featured in /Crystal Society/, which features an AI composed of multiple consciousness threads who negotiate fulfillment of their respective utility functions via a betting market. The AI creates a thread focused on communication and empathy; soon enough, the AI is externally human-like.

1: To offer a short and incomplete list: 2001: Space Odyssey, Accelerando, Friendship is Optimal (see also the current Book Club post) and, last but not least, approximately a fifth^{2} of all stories posted to the biweekly challenges on this subreddit. I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream is almost like an interesting subversion of paperclipping, as an AI built to wage war turns itself into a malevolent god which maximizes the suffering of the few humans left alive. (I think it's a subversion because the AI is a soulless maximizer, yet is inherently dependant on humans to fulfill its utility function; suffering ensues.)

2: [[/u/Noumero][u/Noumero]], if you have better statistics on that last point, feel free to correct me. And hey, would you look at this, I pinged you in a footnote inside a footnote. (While I'm recommending books: anyone who likes that concept should read House of Leaves.)
