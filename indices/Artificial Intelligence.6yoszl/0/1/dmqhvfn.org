  [[/u/Noumero][u/Noumero]], if you have better statistics on that last point, feel free to correct me

Getting this kind of statistics is rather hard: there isn't really an easy way to identify whether a story is about a paperclipper or not at first glance, nor did I have any particular reason to look for that specifically, previously. To have this sort of information at the ready, you'd need to categorize/tag each story posted, analyse it as TV Tropes would... which is actually a nifty idea, as it could be used to identify what are [[/r/rational][r/rational]]'s other recurring topics.

In any case, cursory analysis suggests you're pretty (about 50%) wrong. I looked through 42 threads (which is exactly two thirds of them, by the way), and stories about paperclippers take up about 12.6% of all works (14/111), or 10.4% of the overall wordcount (27313/261667). Also, 35.7% of them were submitted to the Paperclipper challenge specifically, so even this data is somewhat biased.
