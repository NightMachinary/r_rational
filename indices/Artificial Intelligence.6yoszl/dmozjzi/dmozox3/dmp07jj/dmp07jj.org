Well, Charles Stross is welcome to that sentiment. I know /I/ feel like that about ideas I had a few years ago, and Accelerando is rather old by now. But similarly to Neal Stephenson's relationship to The Big U (which I maintain is absolutely brilliant), an author's distaste for his book might not be proportional to the audience's distaste; ideas the author knows intimately enough to think them boring are new to the audience, and awkward prose is something most readers are able to accept.

At the same time, I do like other books by Charles Stross, if not as much as Accelerando: The Rapture of the Nerds (written in collaboration with Cory Doctorow) is a strikingly Kafkaesque rendition of the Singularity (and, thinking about it, also satisfies OP's criteria). Meanwhile, The Laundry Files is what I imagine would have happened if Neal Stephenson and H. P. Lovecraft had gotten absolutely hammered together, and had, in their intoxicated state, decided to write Spy Fiction Ã  la Ian Fleming.
