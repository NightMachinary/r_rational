Does the AI have to be a large portion of the book?

I wrote a book where the AI's are simply an elaborate plot device setup for a portal fiction of litRPG fantasy/political intrigue story. The AI's goals in my story is to have more digital minds of vary types since the only thing in the multiverse that they lack is AI diversity (only a few trillion types!).
