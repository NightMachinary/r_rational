Well, other people already mentioned all best examples. I'm supporting the /Accelerando/ and /Crystal Society/ recommendations especially. I can recommend a few other things.

[[https://qntm.org/ra][/Ra/, a novel]]. Frankly, [[#s][conceptual spoiler]] Still, it features a pretty inhuman AI as an important plot point.

Short stories:

- [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/21/repost-the-demiurges-older-brother/][/The Demiurge's Older Brother/]] poses an interesting possibly-universal example of interactions between rational beings with different fundamental values; but expends only minimal effort to model AIs' psychology.

- [[https://pastebin.com/Tdh8AXC1][/Worlds Without End/]]. Features a hard-takeoff scenario, and what is shown of the AI's personality is either cold logical thinking, or an act for the humans it interacts with.

Additionally, it is also possible you're interested not just in AIs having inhuman psychology, but in beings with inhuman psychology in general. If so, read [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6xkf9a/stories_with_alien_aliens/][this thread]].
