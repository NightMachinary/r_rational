Hmmm... Asimov is the first name that came to mind. He was an author who noticed that the Frankenstein-type stories (someone builds a robot, the robot goes on a killing spree) were rather prevalent, and invented the Three Laws of Robotics in response (someone builds a robot, intending to use it as a tool to complete some task; the robot has safety features to ensure a lack of deaths, and the safety features /work/). He then spent a whole load of short stories looking at putting these robots in various situations and seeing how these safeguards reacted.

/The Caves of Steel/ is probably a good novel to start out with; or try /I, Robot/ if you're looking for short stories. (Not the film, the book. They are /NOT/ the same).
