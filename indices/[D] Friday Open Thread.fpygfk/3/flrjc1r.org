Can someone tell me why Worm by Wildbow isn't published/available for purchase anywhere yet? I get that it takes time to edit and publish a novel but it's been more than 6 years since Worm ended and you generally want to publish as soon as possible to take advantage of the momentum and fanbase you've built up all those years.

Maybe it's not as popular as I think yet to make a crude comparison: [[/r/Stormlight_Archive]] has 4.3 times as many readers as [[/r/parahumans]] and it's been on the New York Times Best Sellers list and Sanderson is the most successful fantasy author. I think being 'just' 4.3 less popular than the market leader would make publishers rush to put Worm to market. And with the success of 50 Shades Of Grey as I would assume publishers wouldn't just write off a webnovel just because it's a webnovel. What gives?
