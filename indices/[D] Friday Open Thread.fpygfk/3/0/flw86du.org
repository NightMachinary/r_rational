I think this is mostly just Wildbow failing to capitalize. An e-book of Worm, even one that was /just/ the "unedited" text that's up now, would be a continual source of income for relatively little investment on his part, especially if the minor work involved was done by someone else. Yes, traditional publishing and traditional editing would be a better way to go, but it's been six years, and if he's not putting in the time and effort for traditional publishing, it would be better to have put it up himself. As it stands now, people keep reading Worm on his website and sharing e-books that they've scraped themselves: some fraction of these people would have bought an e-book, just for the convenience of it. More than that, since he started writing a sequel, it would have allowed a pipeline from e-book readers to serial readers, which means more in terms of patronage.

It's possible that he just doesn't care about money, but that's probably not it, because he regularly posts on personal finance and financial independence subreddits. I think it's mostly just a case of perfect being the enemy of good, and holding patterns being easy to maintain.
