If you could decide not to cross your arms, the machine would never have shown you crossing your arms in the first place.

There would always be a reason/way to think about it. You would only ever look into the machine when it was showing things you couldn't control, or your knowledge from the machine is factored into the machine's predictions already, or the entire universe “conspires” to make it happen (like a chain of events already in motion before you even look at the machine, like since the start of the universe, leads to a guy with a gun forcing you to cross your arms showing up just in time).

Determinism is really hard to think about when people are involved, and when the events are the result of macro/social/human scale systems. It tends to make humans think that the only way it could happen is with some kind of intelligence pulling the strings, but that's just a weakness in human cognition. There is no reason to believe causality just buggers off at a certain scale. Superdeterminism ftw
