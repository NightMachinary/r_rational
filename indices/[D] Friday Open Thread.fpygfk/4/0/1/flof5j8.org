Yeah, this was my thought as well. If the machine essentially just computes the universe for N time to see the future, that means it has to compute itself computing the universe, and itself computing itself computing itself, and so on.

A alternative would be a machine that functions off of stable time loops, a-la HPMOR time-turners. No computation of the universe, it doesn't even necessarily have to be deterministic, it's just that the order of cause and effect can be reversed.

Of course, this also can be used to solve the halting problem like a oracle (though i can't remember or find the exact term) by creating a loop with two possible outcomes:

A: a solution to a difficult problem appears

B: a paradox occurs, which, by definition, cannot occur.

But in reality, there's a third option

C: the system breaks in a way that sends a false positive or otherwise creates a loop without a solution.

I do not know enough about time travel to state with confidence how the universe would 'decide' between the two options. I would /guess/ that it's probabilistic, based on the likelyhood of the current system evolving to contain and transmit that information in the future/casual past.

So, *if* this is the case, then a future-seeing machine would be... exceedingly unlikely, depending on how much information it gives you. In the extreme case, it would be equivalent to selecting a single worldline out of /all/ (infinite) possible worldlines. Sending a physical object like a human would also be unlikely, seeing as a human is rather complicated.

Simple information would be much less complicated; you could very well say that you cross your arms in the future, and then you decide not to. The only thing actually set in stone is that you send the message back stating that you cross your arms. If you are particularly determined to not send any message back if you get a message, then chances are that you just /don't/ create a loop in the first place.
