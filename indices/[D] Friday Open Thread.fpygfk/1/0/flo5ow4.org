IMO there are two different kinds of flaws:

1. Flaws that really are flaws, the kinds of things that interfere with a character being able to achieve their stated objectives. If your character has a temper, and acts in ways that he later regrets, or he struggles with fear and running away from fights, which he later wishes that he had fought, then that's a fixable flaw, one that the character wants to change because of the way that it impacts their life. Alcoholism or addiction belong in this camp as well.
2. Flaws that are just a part of the character, ways in which /other people/ might want them to be different. Someone might be arrogant, but internally, they don't see that as a flaw, they see it as them actually being superior to other people, and they do nothing to change their attitude, because they think that's the right attitude to have. Other people would change them, sure, but they wouldn't change themselves. These are sometimes small flaws: a character might talk at length about certain subjects no one else cares about, or have an obsessive interest that no one shares, or be overly gregarious, or naturally distrustful, or something else that's not necessarily the focus of the story.

Generally speaking, the first type of flaw is resolved through grit and determination in stories, while the second type of flaw, if it's resolved at all, gets resolved through a character having some moment of introspection and realization that really, this thing that everyone else has a problem with is something that /they/ have a problem with too, or unexpected costs that they're not willing to pay. But some of these "flaws" are just quirks of the characters that are unendearing to most people.
