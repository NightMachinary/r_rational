I do enjoy writing in reverse (when I do get the time to do so). I have a very systematic method based on the old World of Darkness storytelling books. On it, there are lists of potential flaws and attributes. I usually do the following:

1. Do as the Venture Bros writer recommended, and think of what scene I want to play out.

2. Think of the character as a blob of features and make a rough sketch of what traits and reaction I would want it to have.

3. Use the WoD rulebook (the one closest to the character I want, for example the vampire rulebook for goth/classic villains, the changeling book for the trickster archetypes or mage: the ascension when I don't find anything that fits).

4. Decide what threat level I want it to be, even if its a socialite type. I decide the level and use the XP points assigned to select traits that resemble what I want the character to be able to do.

5. Go to the flaw list and select the ones closes to the character I want.

6. After that's done, I adapt the flaws and attributes to better resemble my concept of a character. This way I make it more fleshed out rather than simply having a roleplaying character.

7. Then simply write the backstory based on those attributes and finally to make it more rational, think of a realistic way it would lead to that scene.

I think authors like the ones from Venture Bros and Kinoko Nasu of Fate/Stay Night enjoy using that roleplaying based method to craft the characters. Now I do prefer using the World of Darkness rulebooks over say D&D because in my opinion the attributes are more balanced.

Like I have no idea what is the wisdom attribute, but I can make it a specialty in the character sheet with a high intelligence attribute focused towards it. And if the character is a plotter type rather than a trickster, choosing a low Wits attribute. If he's good at fighting but slow to act, then add high Dextery or high Resolve and so on.
