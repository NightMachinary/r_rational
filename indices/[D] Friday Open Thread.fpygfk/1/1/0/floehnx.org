That's the problem! Most of my characters would take a widely different approach to the same problem, and it's occasionally showcased in the stories proper. Some of them make wrong decisions, some of them try hard-core to find the optimal solution, some often just act on their emotions, etc. Still, the most common criticism I hear by far is that my characters lack meaningful flaws.

So I don't think this is the case, honestly.
