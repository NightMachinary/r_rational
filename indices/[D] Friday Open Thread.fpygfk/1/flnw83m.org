How do you write flawed characters? When I write, I have a character's whole personality in my head, which I use to model their reactions---but there are no flaws and virtues, only one large, interconnected system driven towards a certain goal.

I guess, my question is, what /is/ a flaw? How do I know if my characters are flawed?
