Yeah it takes quite a bit of time to craft them that way. But I enjoy it because it helps structure the character and maintain consistency (I will make a low Physical attributes and skills character lose a battle for example because I already know how it'd fare against other character whose attributes I know) along with providing lots of ideas I may not think about if I'm writing directly.

For example I may have an idea for a character and it'd be a cool detail to make it ambidiextrous or have a retainer, but not think of it thoroughly or forget but if I have a character sheet with me I can remember and use that in the story.
