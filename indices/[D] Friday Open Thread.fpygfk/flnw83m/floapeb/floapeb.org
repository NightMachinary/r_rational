I think as long as you have their personality in your head, you've got all the 'good parts' of making your characters flawed. Giving someone the 'make your characters flawed' advice is usually shorthand for 'they are all the same optimal-path-seeking-robot-person. They all do the same things given the same information. Write different characters!'

If your characters have different personalities, I think you are doing fine. Whether their flaws or virtues predominate is less important than making sure that they aren't all just masks worn by the same reasoning process.
