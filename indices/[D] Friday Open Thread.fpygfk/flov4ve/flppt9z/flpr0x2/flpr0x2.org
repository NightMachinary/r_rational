And god, at least it worked out. Throughout the whole thing we were wondering what would happen if he was stranded - would the embassy expect him to spend 2-3 months pay on a flight or would they repatriate him? What if he got sick and needed a hospital, would they triage him after citizens? What if he lost his job, would he be able to get chomage without presenting at the office? Would there be a problem with his apartment?

Ugh. He's landed in Qatar now and should be home within 12 hours, at which point I can hopefully calm down and just worry about him being in one of the European covid hotspots like a normal long distance girlfriend :)
