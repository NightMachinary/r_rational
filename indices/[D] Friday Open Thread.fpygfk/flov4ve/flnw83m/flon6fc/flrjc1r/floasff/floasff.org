So I was watching Devs the other day and an interesting question got asked and I'd like to see what your answers to it might be. It's not really a spoiler, but I'll put it in spoiler tags just in case:\\
I'm paraphrasing here but it was basically this, "If we live in a deterministic universe, and we have a device that can look into The future, what's to stop us from setting it to 2 minutes into the future, seeing ourselves cross our arms, and then refusing to cross our arms for the next 2 minutes?" This really stumped me because throughout the first 3 episodes of the show it was made fairly clear that the people with the computer that can look forward and backward in time were convinced that the universe is deterministic and my understanding was that in a deterministic universe whatever future you saw was one which presupposed you saw it, so your actions as a result of seeing it wouldn't change that future. The only way I can rationalize this is if seeing the future would necessarily result in peoples' actions aligning with what they saw, so they would feel like they didn't have to cross their arms but they would inevitably "decide" to do it anyway...which still doesn't feel very compelling to me.\\
It's a pretty good show so far, I think it would probably appeal to most people here.
