One self-consistent possibility I can think of is that in deterministic universes the only people who gain access to devices that can see the future are those that are incapable of thinking of falsifiable tests that would show them defying what they know has to come to pass. So, if you can consider this question, then you'll never be a position where you could actually defy the predetermined arc of the universe.
