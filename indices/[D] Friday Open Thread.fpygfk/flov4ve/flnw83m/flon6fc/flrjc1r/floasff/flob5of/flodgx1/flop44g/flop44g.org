I did like that question, it's an interesting thought. However, I'm curious what other people's opinions of Devs is so far. I know it's still kinda early, but the show gives me a vibe of trying way too hard to /seem/ deep and important through music and cinematography without actually having any depth (yet). I'll continue watching, but I'd say that overall, I haven't been that impressed so far.
