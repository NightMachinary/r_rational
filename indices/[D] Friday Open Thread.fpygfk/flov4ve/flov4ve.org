My boyfriend finally flew back to France today ("finally", I say, though it's two days earlier than originally planned back in December when he was coming to visit on a holiday...). It's very strange how much things changed in the month since he got here, apocalypse-wise.

Here's what happened with his flights:

- His first flight has the second leg cancelled after Europe closed its borders, but his flight to the hub remained

- He phones the French embassy about what his options are going to be with Europe closing down and everything and they basically tell him to buy a commercial flight, but if that all falls through they'll repatriate him

- He bought a second flight, transiting via Bangkok, last Sunday (as originally planned: we didn't want him to buy another flight straight away and have that cancelled, too).

- When he bought the flight the airline had a vague note about needing doctor's clearance to fly (even for transiting passengers). 24 hours later, "doctor's clearance" (which I assumed was a letter saying "this person has no symptoms and is not at high risk for contracting COVID-19") became a doctor stating that the patient has "no chance" of being infected */AND/* a negative test result.

- My province tests, but they're limited in number, and to qualify you need to, at the very least, be sick. They're not going to test a foreign national with no symptoms and no exposure.

- He phones the airline to get things straight, but they have a policy of hanging up on you if you hold more than 15 minutes (wtf) and the robo voice estimated he had 140 minutes to wait.

- He emails the airline, basically saying "can you tell me how I can possibly get on your flight or refund me thanks". No reply.

- He phones the Thai embassy and they say "yeah we have no idea why Thai airways is requiring a test result, we just require a doctor's note"

- There's almost no more flights back to Europe for less than two month's wage, except for ones that use four different budget carriers and so are high risk of being cancelled since if one leg is fucked you're shit out of luck

- His embassy sends out a form for people interested in repatriation, he fills it out, joking that maybe he can save the price of the return flight if they have to repatriate him

- Did I mention that he's still on probation at his job, so if he doesn't make it back within ~a week, he stands a very good chance of getting fired?

- His flight to Bangkok is cancelled, but the flight from Bangkok to Europe isn't (will he get a refund? who knows!)

- He's considering an Emirates flight but it has two stops instead of one, and one of the stops is going in the opposite direction and then doubling back, which for a journey that's 21 hours at the best of times is kind of depressing.

- Emirates cancels all their flights before he buys it, rendering this moot

- He buys a ticket transiting via Qatar for an elevated but not extortionate price (the one way ticket is the price of a two way ticket when there's no plague). This flight hadn't been visible for the past week he'd been searching.

- I'm terrified this flight is going to be cancelled to but hopeful after checking out Qatar Air's twitter they basically are saying that they are committed to staying open to repatriate people (Qatar, the country, will let just anyone transit through the airport, it's only entry that is strict) and have put larger planes on some of their routes to open more seats (which is why the flight suddenly appeared in the search again!)

- Anyway, last night I dropped him off at the airport. A normally somewhat busy (one flight every 15-30 minutes) international airport was virtually deserted. The departures board had every flight but his listed in big red "CANCELLED". It was very post-apocalyptic with social distancing enforced. Everyone boarding the flight seemed to be Europeans, no doubt repatriating themselves

- He's currently in the air and hopefully everything will work out, but at least at this point he's far enough from me that wherever in the world he ends up, he's officially his embassy's problem rather than mine ;)

- I was originally planning to go back to see him in July but now I'm hoping that things will be normal enough by December.

Anyway, I hope you enjoy that saga. It was horrible and extremely stressful to live it.
