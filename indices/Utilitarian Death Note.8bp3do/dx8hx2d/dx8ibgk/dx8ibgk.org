I mean, it's a completely different story, doesn't mean it's not potentially good. I don't take it as "fixing" Death Note, which is mighty good as is (nor do I take HPMOR as "fixing" Harry Potter, for that matter, for all the poking fun it does at its worst plot holes here and there). It's just using the same plot device to tell a story that goes into a different direction.

In fact, here's an interesting thought - Ryuk is in a way a proxy for the audience, as he's in it for the fun, basically. So whoever the user is might be fought between not wanting to do anything too evil and keeping Ryuk entertained - knowing full well that he'd just kill him and give the Note to a potentially much less restrained human if he left him bored.

Personally I think it's at least an interesting thought. And it's not like anyone acting like I described would /not/ have a lot of moral conflicts ahead of them. Even without acting as recklessly as Kira did, using the Death Note still isn't a morally clean affair. It would be much more interesting to see what a person with genuine moral concerns would do with it (and what it would do to them) than the kind of hyper-efficient but somehow sociopathic type you're portraying.
