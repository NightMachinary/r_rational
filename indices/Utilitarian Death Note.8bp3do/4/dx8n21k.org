The one fic I've seen that comes the closest to being what you're describing is [[https://fanfiction.net/s/12431989/1/If-It-s-Not-Me-It-s-You][If it's not me, it's you]]. During the arc where Light volunteers to be imprisoned, he comes to the conclusion that the only two people who could possibly be Kira are himself or L, and the author goes to great lengths to both show his entire chain of logic as well as expand the characterization of everyone else on the investigation team.
