  he focused a lot on petty crimes without ever looking at the bigger picture, and purposefully made himself known
#+end_quote

that was the point of his usage, he wanted people to know that certain crimes are going to be punished, so they stop committing them. He literally lowers the crime rate by 70% for 6 years and stops all wars.

Light saved millions of people with his usage of the death note and only killed a few hundred thousands to do it(with around 10.000 innocents) You cant really get a much better result if you are utilitarian. Light also had long time goals to influence human behavior and encourage Humans to use their full potential(when one of his followers trys to do this, Light mentions that its to early)

In the end Lights mistake was his arrogance and god complex, but his actual goal of creating a better world was happening.

  Not to mention how quick he was to begin killing innocent people as soon as they opposed him
#+end_quote

Its also debatable if those he killed who tried to stop him count as innocent victims, considering their goals would have caused millions of truly innocent people to die.

Most of the really innocents he killed, were those he thought were guilty of a crime, but were wrongly convicted or entered plea deals.
