  There's a lot to say there. First, while it was mentioned that wars did stop, it was never really clarified how did it happen, since it looked mostly like Light focused on killing random muggers and rapists, not war criminals and tyrants
#+end_quote

my assumption was that he was using the same channels over which he has contacts with the public. Its just a theory, but it seems likely that at that point he would start use his reputation like in season 2.(though we have no proof either way)

  Second, Light's stated objective might have been that, but by making his presence obvious he also opened up the floodgates to what happened: investigations, and his own defeat
#+end_quote

his defeat happened because Light was too arrogant and decided to kill the FBI agents that were investigating Kira as a warning to others. Until that point all that was known about Kira was that he was that he was operating in the Kant≈ç region and had acces to the data of the Kira investigation. By killing the FBI Agents he basically narrowed it down to a few dozen suspects, including himself a known genius. By killing Rey Penbers wife he also gave away his triumph card of people not knowing that Kira can kill through other methods.

If he had been able to ignore People opposing him, he would never really have been suspected.

  Third, his approach leaves a lot to be desired in other respects. Only if you count good in raw numbers of lives saved, and you count the value of individual freedom as literally zero, you can argue he caused a net good.
#+end_quote

Those are usually him taking the lives of people who are mostly either unrepentant people convicted of murder or wanted for murder. Both kinds generally dont benefit Humanity outside of special circumstances. And him saving the lives of would be murder victims and people who would have died in wars. He didn't really take away Individual freedom, he mostly imposed two laws, dont murder and dont oppose me and he carried out the punishment himself. Any government does the same(he doesn't take away freedom if it doesn't really exist).

  He also plunged the world in an era of superstitious dread, by making everyone as scared as they'd ever been in the Dark Ages of drawing on themselves punishment from above, except this time the punishing wrathful God was really there.
#+end_quote

Its mentioned that the general population actually feels better, by knowing that they have a god looking out for them and handing out just punishments.

#+begin_quote
  How many people were killed for judicial mistakes, or because someone slandered them and Kira fell for it? With hundreds of kills a day he couldn't certainly check his sources too well
#+end_quote

Fans estimated it around 10.000 after calculating how many names are written down per day and how people are generally falsely convicted.

#+begin_quote
  (not to mention all the time he left the killings to the less-than-bright and possibly mentally unstable Misa Amane)
#+end_quote

he actually calls Misa out for committing unjust muders, but it can be assumed that afterwards she was using the same restriction he placed on himself(she really wanted to please him)

#+begin_quote
  How may suicides, how much paranoia and depression in people who committed minor offences and dreaded for their own life? How much creativity and free speech repressed by fear of supernatural punishment?
#+end_quote

thats really on them. we dont see Light killing people for minor offenses(the closest thing was the suspected rapist he used to scare Rey Penber) He also doesn't stop people from speaking against him, he only took actions against those who actually tried to stop him. we know his followers participate in public discussions and argue with others about him.

#+begin_quote
  Here's another fanfiction idea: Light wins, and then the world ends up in a state of stagnation as it regresses to a mindset of fear, self-imposed censorship, and superstition.
#+end_quote

thats probably why Lights long term plans involve punishing people for not using their full potential. there cant really be stagnation if people would be forced to advance.

#+begin_quote
  Fourth, and possibly worst of all: Light never made any real succession plans. He never gave a fuck about what would happen when he died.
#+end_quote

thats not really true, Light had a cult Following him, he even had people like Teru Mikami and Kiyomi Takada who were competent and actually believed in his cause. They also both had access to pages of the death note. He even notes that Mikami was able to act like he wanted to without any actual orders. If Light had died devoted followers of his like Mikami would have continued his work in his name, Its not like Light didn't entrust very loyal people his secret.
