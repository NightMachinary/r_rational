Never said /I/ am an utilitarian. The only thing that would keep me from burning the Death Note immediately is the off chance that it could one day be the only way I have to try averting an existential risk like nuclear war or such, when it's literally do or die anyway. I wouldn't want to use it even to meddle with, say, the Syrian war, not because I don't think ending it wouldn't be worth the lives of a few despicable men, but because I'm smarter than presuming I can just predict all the outcomes of throwing a spanner in the works of a highly complex socio-political situation spanning from a culture I don't know or understand.

Gandalf said it best in the Fellowship of the Rings: “Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgement.”.
