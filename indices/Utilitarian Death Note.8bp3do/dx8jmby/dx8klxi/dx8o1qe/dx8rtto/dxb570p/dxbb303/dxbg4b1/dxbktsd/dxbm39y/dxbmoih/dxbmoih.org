  You're asking for a utilitarian Light, that's not gonna be someone who uses the notebook less.

I was thinking of someone who uses it less but in a more focused manner. Most importantly, someone who doesn't do the stupidest thing Light did: let other people find out something weird was happening at all.

  Ok don't move the goalposts. Killed Hitler would have immediately halted the war between Germany and the Allies saving millions.
#+end_quote

I'm just saying I'm not 100% sure of that. But even if I gave you that, not every war works that way. Who would you have needed to kill to stop the Vietnam War, for example?

  I mean this is ridiculous you'd literally be arguing that our universe is the best universe and at no point can anyone's death ever have made an improvement.
#+end_quote

I'm not, it's more that I don't think it's easy to /predict/ whose death would. Which is the biggest problem with utilitarianism: a lot of very important decisions often taken on other people's skins based on limited information and our very limited predictive abilities. With a very high danger of just doing whatever the fuck you feel like doing and rationalising it away.

  Indeed having the Allies move into the USSR would be bad how exactly? You happy with the USSR 70 years of suffering and lower living standards?
#+end_quote

Uhhh, you /do/ know how things went for Germans on that front, yeah? How pretty much most of the victims of WW2 died there? Any idea of how many dead soldiers and civilians are "enough" for you to decide perhaps it's time to calm the fuck down a bit?
