  Actually considering how after the push to compete with the USSR faded out suddenly the USA seemed to start slacking off and cutting funding to NASA and such - whereas the power of dick-measuring competitions with the Soviets had brought them to the Moon less than 20 years earlier - I'm not so sure that would be how it worked.

I mean I'm not saying that it would require no management (it might not to be better) but the last twenty years after the USSR fell the world living standards have improved way more than they did from 1945 to 1990 so...

This is literally an odds game. What is the probability a war with the USSR (before nukes) would have resulted in a net gain for mankind? Except that you're in a position where you can nip a lot of problems in the bud (North Korea etc).

  About the Soviet Union, suffering and poverty happen in a lot of places for a lot of reasons. Russia's relationship with democracy stays kinda flimsy, they keep voting in horrible autocrats - after the fall of USSR we already had Yeltsin, who was pretty shady, and now Putin's firmly in power. So one has to wonder if forcefully removing communism would have done much. Without considering the risks to life on Earth had that war become a nuclear one...

Yeah, I think forcibly removing communism would have been much better. I mean we have one example of a communist country that made its own way to democracy and then we have an example of a country forced to take on democracy. Who would you say has better living standards Russia or Germany?

  Look, no point in going into alternative histories too much. All I mean is, that sort of "I'm sure if only I kill X everything will be better" attitude is exactly what I would expect from the character I mentioned - and exactly the one that I'd expect to blow in his face. To put it simply, I think a Death Note is too blunt a tool. Having the ability to just kill people makes it very limited, in fact, and likely often much better at making stuff worse than improving it.

By sure I mean I have a high confidence interval. If I came across as meaning sure as in 100% then I did not intend that. Since that's all anyone can hope for that's what I'm going to operate on.

It doesn't just have the ability to kill people. It has a global telecommunication feature built in and mind control and a dozen other things. Even if it had the ability to just kill people by your own admission it is a tool. The use of a tool is better than random chance.
