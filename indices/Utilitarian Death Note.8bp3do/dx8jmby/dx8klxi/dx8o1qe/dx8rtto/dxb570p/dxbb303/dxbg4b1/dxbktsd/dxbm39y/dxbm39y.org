  I enjoyed Death Note a great deal. But I didn't root for Light. You can enjoy without agreeing with its protagonist (which in this case is also very much a villain protagonist).

You're asking for a utilitarian Light, that's not gonna be someone who uses the notebook less.

  About Hitler: possibly, though it's not like he was the only force behind it. Mussolini was pretty much a joke but Japan kept fighting fiercely even after Germany's defeat. Doing in Hitler would have worked only after the tide of war turned enough that anyone who was half sane in the Nazi leadership could have seen that they would lose, and then again, they would need some guarantee that they would not be executed afterwards for war crimes.

Ok don't move the goalposts. Killed Hitler would have immediately halted the war between Germany and the Allies saving millions.

Having the Japanese Emperor commit seppuku while ordering Japan to lay down arms would probably have negated the need for the millions dead there.

  Also, after the war, Churchill wanted to continue the war, against the Soviet Union. Who knows what would have happened if the war had ended in 1943, with the Allies still not quite as worn out.

  Also, if nuclear weapons had not been used in 1945, they could have been used later on, when the other side already had them too. Leading potentially to a nuclear war instead of the stall we got in the cold war.

I mean this is ridiculous you'd literally be arguing that our universe is the best universe and at no point can anyone's death ever have made an improvement.

If you want a nuclear demonstration to scare the world you can arrange that. Bob dies by nuclear explosion. Indeed having the Allies move into the USSR would be bad how exactly? You happy with the USSR 70 years of suffering and lower living standards?
