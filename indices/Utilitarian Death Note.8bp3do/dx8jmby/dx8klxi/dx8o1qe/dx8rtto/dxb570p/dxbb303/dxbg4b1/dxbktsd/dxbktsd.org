I enjoyed Death Note a great deal. But I didn't /root for Light/. You can enjoy without agreeing with its protagonist (which in this case is also very much a villain protagonist).

I'm actually saying I think it's interesting to argue with this proposition in a narrative, I can see a lot of situations in which one could actually make a point against me that it'd be better to use the DN than not. But certainly not the way Light used it.

About Hitler: possibly, though it's not like he was the only force behind it. Mussolini was pretty much a joke but Japan kept fighting fiercely even after Germany's defeat. Doing in Hitler would have worked only after the tide of war turned enough that anyone who was half sane in the Nazi leadership could have seen that they would lose, and then again, they would need some guarantee that they would not be executed afterwards for war crimes.

Also, after the war, Churchill wanted to continue the war, against the Soviet Union. Who knows what would have happened if the war had ended in 1943, with the Allies still not quite as worn out.

Also, if nuclear weapons had not been used in 1945, they could have been used later on, when the other side already had them too. Leading potentially to a nuclear war instead of the stall we got in the cold war.
