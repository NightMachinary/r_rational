Ah that's surely a huge proportion of the population...

  A religion sounds like the kind of social engineering tool that's highly likely to end up backfiring or producing weird unintended consequences...

  That's... uhhh. Suppose something seemingly supernatural begins happening, what's your prior for it being aliens or gods rather than a human with ESP powers? Especially considering that the target seems an oddly human thing on which to take out your wrath on. Why would aliens care about killing our criminals?

Because of magic and advanced technology one is actually reasonable. "Something acting in a way that doesn't make sense versus something that is physically impossible". For all we know aliens or our simulation operators do this on every world.

I can imagine nanotechnology being capable of doing what Kira does. I can also imagine magic doing it. One of those things fits with my model of the universe.
