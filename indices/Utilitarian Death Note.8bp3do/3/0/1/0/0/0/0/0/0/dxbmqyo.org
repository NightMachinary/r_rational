  I don't know how aliens would feel

  Aliens wouldn't feel strongly about Earth crime
#+end_quote

Well send me mixed messages why don't you?

#+begin_quote
  If you have two possible culprits for a crime, and one has a motive, why would you suspect more the other?
#+end_quote

Because one is impossible. I mean sure after aliens or something but I just can't see why anyone would give L the budget.

#+begin_quote
  In addition, as you said, Kira planned to eventually start killing even "slackers", so no, it wouldn't be avoidable just by not committing crimes.
#+end_quote

I don't think I said that

#+begin_quote
  I'm not saying billions, of course, that would be idiotic. I'm saying that a non insignificant side effect of 'Kira' would be an increase in stress and fear in people who may feel guilty either over nothing or over minor infractions
#+end_quote

I am saying that it would be insignificant. I can certainly agree that there might be a fear factor from false accusations but I've been to the Philippines, people fucking love Duerete. I can imagine Kira getting an identical reaction.

  Everyone who's got an illness or handicap that prevents them from working at the full of their potential; everyone who's got mental problems; everyone who suffers from imposter syndrome.
#+end_quote

Maybe if such a killing people for not giving a 100% ever got implemented but I don't see that ever happening.
