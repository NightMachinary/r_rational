  Stop saying you know how aliens would feel. We literally don't have a single piece of information. For all we know aliens are obsessed with every single bit of human culture and consume everyone of our shows.

I don't know how aliens would feel, but it's unlikely to think they would feel in such a specific way. If you have two possible culprits for a crime, and one has a motive, why would you suspect more the other?

  Yeah just look at the millions of people who committed suicide because of the fear of dying in an UNAVOIDABLE nuclear holocaust. Of course many more billions probably would die from an entirely AVOIDABLE death by committing crimes.

I'm not saying billions, of course, that would be idiotic. I'm saying that a non insignificant side effect of 'Kira' would be an increase in stress and fear in people who may feel guilty either over nothing or over minor infractions. In addition, /as you said/, Kira planned to eventually start killing even "slackers", so no, it wouldn't be avoidable /just/ by not committing crimes. Do you know who may feel like a "slacker"? Everyone who's got an illness or handicap that prevents them from working at the full of their potential; everyone who's got mental problems; everyone who suffers from imposter syndrome. That's a lot of people who now also have to deal with the fear of supernatural punishment.
