Well I don't defend that plan. Seems like a nightmare to implement. How would he know if someone isn't putting in 100%? Only the person who is doing it knows that. And as soon as you survive one day doing 90% then you know you're safe and no longer have any threat. And since humans can't/won't maintain 100% forever they'll realise fast and it'll undermine your religious authority.
