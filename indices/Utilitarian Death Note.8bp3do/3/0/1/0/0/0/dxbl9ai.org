  Ah that's surely a huge proportion of the population...

Depression works in weird ways. Depression affects a sizeable percentage of the population, even in normal times.

  I can imagine nanotechnology being capable of doing what Kira does. I can also imagine magic doing it. One of those things fits with my model of the universe.

At the beginning of DN, no one thinks Kira is magic. They think they're some kind of organisation carrying out homicides normally. When L pulls off the Lind L. Taylor stunt they see that he can kill at will and at a distance, instantaneously. That's still not proof enough to claim magic. But if it's sufficiently advanced technology, well, could be aliens, or could be some human individual/organisation who managed to invent it. Equally unlikely. But the choice of targets is remarkably /human/. Aliens wouldn't feel strongly about Earth crime. Which would make me more inclined to believe it's one or more humans who are responsible.
