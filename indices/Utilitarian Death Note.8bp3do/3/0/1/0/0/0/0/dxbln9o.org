  Depression works in weird ways. Depression affects a sizeable percentage of the population, even in normal times.

Yeah just look at the millions of people who committed suicide because of the fear of dying in an UNAVOIDABLE nuclear holocaust. Of course many more billions probably would die from an entirely AVOIDABLE death by committing crimes.

  At the beginning of DN, no one thinks Kira is magic. They think they're some kind of organisation carrying out homicides normally. When L pulls off the Lind L. Taylor stunt they see that he can kill at will and at a distance, instantaneously. That's still not proof enough to claim magic. But if it's sufficiently advanced technology, well, could be aliens, or could be some human individual/organisation who managed to invent it. Equally unlikely. But the choice of targets is remarkably human. Aliens wouldn't feel strongly about Earth crime. Which would make me more inclined to believe it's one or more humans who are responsible.

Stop saying you know how aliens would feel. We literally don't have a single piece of information. For all we know aliens are obsessed with every single bit of human culture and consume everyone of our shows.

Anyway I think it's nonsense that they assume its human, because they are assuming a group is able to kill people in isolation at any time at any point across the globe and unlike aliens who can have any technology level a human being can only have the next step in technology (which would mean if one person has it someone else is going to invent it shortly too). So if it is an organisation who has access to drug the food of all these prisoners or something actually logical then such an organisation is so powerful that they could halt any funding for an investigation anyway.
