  Who's going to commit suicide out of fear of death?

Someone who'd rather end the suffering that is the fear itself.

  Light is in an unique position in that he can basically have prophets everywhere. Starting a single global religion is the best way to maximise utility.

A religion sounds like the kind of social engineering tool that's highly likely to end up backfiring or producing weird unintended consequences...

  (and if anyone even bothers looking cause why would someone assume that its a human as opposed to aliens or gods or state sponsored superweapon)
#+end_quote

That's... uhhh. Suppose something seemingly supernatural begins happening, what's your prior for it being aliens or gods rather than a human with ESP powers? Especially considering that the /target/ seems an oddly human thing on which to take out your wrath on. Why would aliens care about killing our criminals?
