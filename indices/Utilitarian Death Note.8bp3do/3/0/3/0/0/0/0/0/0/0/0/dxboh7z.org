  I was thinking of someone who uses it less but in a more focused manner. Most importantly, someone who doesn't do the stupidest thing Light did: let other people find out something weird was happening at all.

I mean that's an argument about the utility of universal religion versus not. I can't help but think that any replacement religion I could come up with would be better than female genital mutilation for example.

  I'm just saying I'm not 100% sure of that. But even if I gave you that, not every war works that way. Who would you have needed to kill to stop the Vietnam War, for example?
#+end_quote

Sure, not every war. But it's not even just killing people. It's having leaders die to specific deaths and say specific things before they die. You can have far right groups assassinate the President to move the country leftward. You can have the President be talking about a very specific thing as he dies.

  I'm not, it's more that I don't think it's easy to predict whose death would. Which is the biggest problem with utilitarianism: a lot of very important decisions often taken on other people's skins based on limited information and our very limited predictive abilities. With a very high danger of just doing whatever the fuck you feel like doing and rationalising it away.

Well yes I agree. A utilitarian is literally saying that every decision they make they believe that it's the best for universal maximum utility. There have been bad acts caused by utilitarianism paired with ignorance, murdering all them starlings for example.

  Uhhh, you do know how things went for Germans on that front, yeah? How pretty much most of the victims of WW2 died there? Any idea of how many dead soldiers and civilians are "enough" for you to decide perhaps it's time to calm the fuck down a bit?

Considering I can assassinate all of USSR high command I think I would be pretty happy with three or four million dead to avoid SEVENTY YEARS OF 300 MILLION PEOPLE SUFFERING. Besides which even ignoring my magic superpowers the soviets would be fucked with allies and germany on them and it would be a much easier war.

I can only think of the potential heights that could have been reached in human standards of living by democracy running free around the entire Northern Hemisphere.
