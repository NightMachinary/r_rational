  I can only think of the potential heights that could have been reached in human standards of living by democracy running free around the entire Northern Hemisphere.

Actually considering how after the push to compete with the USSR faded out suddenly the USA seemed to start slacking off and cutting funding to NASA and such - whereas the power of dick-measuring competitions with the Soviets had brought them to the Moon less than 20 years earlier - I'm not so sure that would be how it worked.

About the Soviet Union, suffering and poverty happen in a lot of places for a lot of reasons. Russia's relationship with democracy stays kinda flimsy, they keep voting in horrible autocrats - after the fall of USSR we already had Yeltsin, who was pretty shady, and now Putin's firmly in power. So one has to wonder if forcefully removing communism would have done much. Without considering the risks to life on Earth had /that/ war become a nuclear one...

Look, no point in going into alternative histories too much. All I mean is, that sort of "I'm sure if only I kill X everything will be better" attitude is exactly what I would expect from the character I mentioned - and exactly the one that I'd expect to blow in his face. To put it simply, I think a Death Note is too blunt a tool. Having the ability to just /kill/ people makes it very limited, in fact, and likely often much better at making stuff worse than improving it.
