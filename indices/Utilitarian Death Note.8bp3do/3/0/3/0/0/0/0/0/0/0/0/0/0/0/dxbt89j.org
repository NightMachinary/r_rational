  Yeah, I think forcibly removing communism would have been much better. I mean we have one example of a communist country that made its own way to democracy and then we have an example of a country forced to take on democracy. Who would you say has better living standards Russia or Germany?

That kind of discounts the fact that Russia and Germany are completely different countries with different natural resources, geographical positioning, culture, history, etc.

Germany was already an industrial power before WW2. That was how it managed to be so dangerous, in fact. Russia by comparison was traditionalist, backwards, and only counting on sheer force of numbers and territory. Let's take a look now, and more than 100 years after the communist revolution... yup, they're basically both back there. So maybe there's more in play than just one or another government.

  It doesn't just have the ability to kill people. It has a global telecommunication feature built in and mind control and a dozen other things. Even if it had the ability to just kill people by your own admission it is a tool. The use of a tool is better than random chance.

Yes but none of that can be used without /killing people/. So either you start sacrificing random people to use the DN for other purposes, or you use it mostly to kill people. Sure, you can kill a dictator after having him give a speech to the country or nominate a successor (as long as you can explain that without writing their name directly), but without inner knowledge of how their government works, that's not very likely to succeed.
