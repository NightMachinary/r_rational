  Until that point all that was known about Kira was that he was that he was operating in the Kant≈ç region and had acces to the data of the Kira investigation.
#+end_quote

Which was already a great deal more than what would have been known if he just kept a low profile and didn't try killing L when he was first challenged, aka "fuck all". In fact, just fighting opposition at all basically gave away that he was a human, fearful of punishment, and not a God. A justice-loving God would not have cared, and would have waited for these well-intentioned but misguided humans to come around to see things from his point of view.

  Those are usually him taking the lives of people who are mostly either unrepentant people convicted of murder or wanted for murder. Both kinds generally dont benefit Humanity outside of special circumstances.

Still doesn't give a single individual the right to be jury, judge and executioner.

  He didn't really take away Individual freedom, he mostly imposed two laws, dont murder and dont oppose me and he carried out the punishment himself. Any government does the same(he doesn't take away freedom if it doesn't really exist).
#+end_quote

Absolutely false, he punished for far more than that. Plus "don't oppose me" is already not a fair law, but a tyrant's whim. And you already said it afterwards, he planned to even punish people whom he felt were lazy or not contributing enough to society. That seems quite a far cry from fairness or justice to me, especially since the /only/ punishment he's able to dole out is death. It would definitely restrict society! Think living in there. You'll be super-careful to not only steer clear from any kind of criminal activity, but from any situation where you could be suspected, or wrongly accused, of said activity. One false accusation and you risk your life. Now let's say Kira has already started his "punish people who slack off" campaign. He said he'd do that with means other than heart attacks, but someone could catch on anyway (plus, if he didn't make it obvious, it wouldn't serve much purpose, he can't kill off all slackers, it only works if he can deter the behaviour, so he needs it to be known). First, that's already a horribly trivial reason to kill someone. Second, people will be immediately pressed into doing whatever they realise or imagine Kira thinks is a worthy contribution. Kira thinks being an amateur artist or a musician is a pointless waste of talent? Entire sectors of popular culture shrivel. Death is such a huge threat, people would stay completely the fuck away from a lot of activities or lifestyles, even if they would not have much to fear. Society altogether would be influenced. If to you having to change the way one lives for fear that some unknown person will judge you and kill you isn't losing freedom, I don't know what is.

  Fans estimated it around 10.000 after calculating how many names are written down per day and how people are generally falsely convicted.
#+end_quote

Oh, well, just 10,000 innocents killed, that's nothing /sarcasm.

#+begin_quote
  he actually calls Misa out for committing unjust muders, but it can be assumed that afterwards she was using the same restriction he placed on himself(she really wanted to please him)
#+end_quote

By his logic, if he had any integrity, he should have killed Misa as soon as Rem was dead, as punishment for her murder. Except suddenly he was very forgiving with the one woman who could be of use to him (and that arguably he /may/ have developed some kind of distorted sense of attachment to).

#+begin_quote
  thats really on them. we dont see Light killing people for minor offenses(the closest thing was the suspected rapist he used to scare Rey Penber) He also doesn't stop people from speaking against him, he only took actions against those who actually tried to stop him. we know his followers participate in public discussions and argue with others about him.
#+end_quote

Misa killed TV anchormen. She killed cops. Kira killed the FBI agents. Mikami killed Demegawa and his "dirigents". Who knows what the fuck Higuchi did. People don't know what the fuck is going on behind the scenes, they see people dropping dead on live TV, they're scared, they're paranoid, they make assumptions. You can't really say "that's on them". Without knowing who Light is, it's perfectly legitimate to fear him acting irrationally. This isn't even a thing like Lex Luthor fearing Superman will one day become dangerous just because he's so powerful, even though Superman is basically a saint. Light has absolute power but he's also clearly pretty unhinged. "Kira", as a composite character, as seen from the public who only gets a glimpse of the real picture, is a schizophrenic, inconsistent madman.

#+begin_quote
  thats probably why Lights long term plans involve punishing people for not using their full potential. there cant really be stagnation if people would be forced to advance.
#+end_quote

You know what would really make research labs work faster? Someone with a gun pointed to the head of scientists at all times! That'll make 'em churn out those results.

Yeah, no. I really hope you get no leadership roles ever if this is your way of thinking because this theory of leadership was debunked at some point after the time when whip masters would work slaves to death. In fact, extreme competition is often detrimental to productivity already; if people feel like it's not just their success or pride to be on the line, but their very livelihood, they become more likely to cheat and do whatever it takes to come out on top. Which is obviously not desired.

#+begin_quote
  thats not really true, Light had a cult Following him, he even had people like Teru Mikami and Kiyomi Takada who were competent and actually believed in his cause. They also both had access to pages of the death note. He even notes that Mikami was able to act like he wanted to without any actual orders. If Light had died devoted followers of his like Mikami would have continued his work in his name, Its not like Light didn't entrust very loyal people his secret.
#+end_quote

The manga is already pretty unrealistic on that point because it needs those people mostly as plot devices, tools in Light's master plan. Even so, let's stick to canon.

Light loses because he trusted Mikami. He loses because Mikami takes a personal initiative and ruins his plan. But granted, that was just a personal initiative in terms of what to do, Mikami's ideals matched pretty much Lights. However earlier on Light remarks that he needs to get in touch with Mikami because he's already starting to drift away from him. And that's /Mikami/: a fanatic who sees Light as a God. When Light loses, that's all it takes for Mikami to cry that he's no God, that he's a fraud. His faith is shattered. How much do you think it would have taken to the zealot Mikami to decide that Light was after all disappointing, and that he could be a better God than him? How would he have reacted had he learned some of Light's less known exploits (including that he let Misa live at all)?

People have different ideals. They fight over those views of justice all the time. Imagine what would happen if they fought using Death Notes as their weapons. And Light only involved Mikami in the first place because he was under surveillance. What if he died in an accident, without properly planning or laying out a succession plan? What if his successor went off the rails? What if he entrusted multiple successors and they ended up disagreeing? What, what what. The entire affair relies on an incredibly concentrated and poorly resilient power structure. A modern government doesn't crumble if a leader dies because there's a chain of command, it'd take a cataclysm to obliterate enough people to throw it into chaos. Old monarchies could fall into civil war if enough successors were taken out of the picture. Kira's god-king position would be even more unstable than that, relying on secrecy, informal pacts, and the fear of mutual annihilation to stay afloat.
