  Light saved millions of people with his usage of the death note and only killed a few hundred thousands to do it(with around 10.000 innocents) You cant really get a much better result if you are utilitarian. Light also had long time goals to influence human behavior and encourage Humans to use their full potential(when one of his followers trys to do this, Light mentions that its to early)

There's a lot to say there. First, while it was mentioned that wars did stop, it was never really clarified how did it happen, since it looked mostly like Light focused on killing random muggers and rapists, not war criminals and tyrants (that might have been because the manga author didn't want to get too political, though; albeit someone might say that the act of painting street or organised crime as the biggest threat to society's welfare /is/, in itself, political).

Second, Light's stated objective might have been that, but by making his presence obvious he also opened up the floodgates to what happened: investigations, and his own defeat. It would not have taken much to assume any investigation would have required him to either fight with both arms tied behind his back or start killing innocent, justice-loving people just because of his own utilitarian calculations (which always involved his /own/ view of justice and ethics being front and centre, and fuck the rest of mankind and their opinions). He could know so, and did it nevertheless.

Third, his approach leaves a lot to be desired in other respects. Only if you count good in raw numbers of lives saved, and you count the value of individual freedom as literally zero, you can argue he caused a net good. Yes, he may have reduced crime. He also plunged the world in an era of superstitious dread, by making everyone as scared as they'd ever been in the Dark Ages of drawing on themselves punishment from above, except this time the punishing wrathful God was really there. How many people were killed for judicial mistakes, or because someone slandered them and Kira fell for it? With hundreds of kills a day he couldn't certainly check his sources too well (not to mention all the time he left the killings to the less-than-bright and possibly mentally unstable Misa Amane). How may suicides, how much paranoia and depression in people who committed minor offences and dreaded for their own life? How much creativity and free speech repressed by fear of supernatural punishment? Will nothing of this truly affect society in the long run? Here's another fanfiction idea: Light wins, and then the world ends up in a state of stagnation as it regresses to a mindset of fear, self-imposed censorship, and superstition.

Fourth, and possibly worst of all: Light never made any real succession plans. He never gave a fuck about what would happen when he died. All he wanted to do was see his ideal world become real, and live to rule it. The end. Like Alexander the Great, once his empire had fallen, and the more entrenched had it become, it would have been torn to shreds by the need to readjust itself to the new status quo. He died without having won entirely yet, and all that happened was that the world went back to square 1 in a couple years. Imagine if he had died 75, after 50 years of absolute rule. Entire new generations born and grown under the rule of Kira suddenly would find themselves alone to fend for themselves. That is basically a surefire way to get the most devastating religious wars the planet has ever seen to break out. When a God dies, that's a /big/ power vacuum to fill.
