But, well, isn't L basically already a rationalist? Yeah, he occasionally follows his gut instinct more, but if anything, those lead him to Kira /faster/ in the story.

As for this:

  A rationalist version of him rejects his street level terrorism, takes over the world via holding its leaders hostage, and implements whatever he wants.

Not sure why "rationalist" in this case seems to imply also "even more psychopathic than he already is". Light doesn't do that not because he doesn't realise he could, but because he /does/ have a moral code. It's shitty and he cares less and less about it as time goes on, but it's there. He believes in law and order. My idea here was more about "what would someone who's both more ethical and has less delusions of godhood than Light do". Of course, if the DN went to someone as smart as Light but with even /less/ moral quandaries, well, the world would be fucked.
