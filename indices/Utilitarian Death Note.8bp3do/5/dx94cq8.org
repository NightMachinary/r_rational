I kicked an idea like this around a while back (I like thinking up stories that I'm never going to write).

It's tricky because, as you say, a good version of Light would probably just burn the death note or only keep it around for emergencies. I settled on giving the death note to someone who used it to become a highly effective eco-terrorist because he believed it was the only way to keep the earth habitable for the future. Not a good guy by any stretch of the imagination, but at least someone who had a noble goal and a reasonable plan to achieve it (while at the same time taking better care to hide his identity). There is an interesting puzzle in how to use a death note in a optimal manner given that you don't mind murdering a whole bunch of people, but do care about keeping your identity a secret.
