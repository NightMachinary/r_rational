I think the interesting character to make a rationalist in Death Note is L. Like, Kira has the cheat codes. A rationalist version of him rejects his street level terrorism, takes over the world via holding its leaders hostage, and implements whatever he wants.

A rationalist playing L's hand (you are anonymous, trusted by some law enforcement personnel, your opponent is magic bullshit) is much more interesting.
