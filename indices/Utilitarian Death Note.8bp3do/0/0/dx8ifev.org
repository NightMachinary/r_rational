Not really, I haven't touched fanfiction in a long time and am just now getting back into it. I wrote some Death Note fanfic myself years ago, but it's all in Italian and now I can't go back to translate it without it feeling a bit cringey to me. One story was about what Naomi Misora did in the time she had to decide how to kill herself, and how she struggled with her Death Note-mandated suicidal impulse. Another was basically a parody ([[#s][that ended with]] ).
