Ideally we'd have some actual data to back that up, like, say, going back through the last three months and profiling the users who are making those requests (e.g. account age, comment/post history on this subreddit, involvement subsequent to request post, etc.). I will point out that those users are quite often pointed to either the search function or the general threads anyway, just not very often by the mods.
