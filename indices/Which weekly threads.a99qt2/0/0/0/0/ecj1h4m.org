Two stickies shouldn't be considered a limiting factor here. You just make a sticky thread that then links to the other threads. Let automod edit the thread each week to keep it current and the problem is solved with less (or equal) maintenance overhead than the default.

Besides, one of our current sticky threads is a three week old "biweekly" challenge that has had 3 participants between the last 3 challenges. Even offering gold to the winner isn't bringing people in to write for those.
