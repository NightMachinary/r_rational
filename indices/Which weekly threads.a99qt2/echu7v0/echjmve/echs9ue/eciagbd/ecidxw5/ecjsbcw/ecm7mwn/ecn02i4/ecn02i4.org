Hrm. One thing that might be nice is to see the number of commentators on each thread, or possibly across threads, though I don't actually know what that query would look like. It's not a huge problem if any one of these threads exists to give a relatively small number of the same people a place to talk to each other, but it /would/ be a good data point to have.

Other than that, the spreadsheet is great and provides a lot of useful data.
