Requests/Recommendations should be in the same thread, IMO. (Most) people aren't going to be making new requests each week-- they'll have a general idea of what they want, post once, and get their itches scratched (hopefully). Plus, having dedicated weekly threads will mean that people will be more likely to see other requests, and if those requests match what they'd request, then they won't make their own requests, driving down the overall volume of requests.

Meanwhile, the request threads, as collections of recommendations tailored to specifications, will already be serving as a de-facto recommendation thread anyways, especially since people recommend stuff that is merely tangentially related. So it serves both purposes to have a single thread.

The other thing I'd suggest is to make the Wednesday thread a tuesday thread instead, but also make it a general "OC writing/worldbuilding critique/discussion" thread (snappier title pending). Currently, I typically use friday off-topic if I want a specific bit of writing critiqued, and have gotten some excellent feedback. But with the monday thread content moved to the friday thread, it doesn't need that additional function of writing review to keep it active. Meanwhile, giving it three full days of time where it's the main thread increases the chance that people will pop in and interact with people spitballing stories. To make sure that thread isn't just spamming chapters and begging for review, though, I'd propose a requirement that the OP of any subthread must also provide review for at least one other poster on the thread. Moderator enforcement wouldn't be necessary; if someone made a habit of leeching, the community at large could simply refuse to interact with the leech.

I do essentially agree with your points, though.
