I was born on the last Thursday. It was Christmas. Christmas day, December 25th, 1969, (Capricorn) to be exact. A lot of smart, well-informed people insist that the last Thursday was the zero time, January 1st 1970. But zero time was technically always off. Programmers hate complicated maths problems. And well, we hate complicated physics problems even more. Only last year did the TAI finally stopped dragging their feet and finally ammend zero time to be Wednesday, December 31st, 1969 23:59 and 58 seconds, due to previous leap second errors. January 1st 1970 was a Friday, we just didn't know it back then. A lot of unpleasantness was addressed about that during the previous TAI conference and I don't intend to dig any further and pick open old wounds.

Anyway, I'm looking forward to the next Thursday! The TAI made up for their previous error and so the next zero time is February 7th, 2036 and it's going to be great! Already though, I can tell a lot of busy bodies will be trying to explain that no, zero time is somehow two years later, in 2038. Clearly, they've been in a cacoon for the last five decades, and have missed this little thing. You might have heard of it. It's called the Internet. Ya, Hello? Call me, maybe, when you've hatched. It's a big deal, Capital I and everything, just like mother. And At 6:28 and 14 seconds on February 7th, 2036 we can all feast our many eyes and experience the transition from Friday, back to a proper Thursday. I'm really looking forward, even though it's not my birthday, not exactly. Although, I hear Harlan Stenn is a big fan and plans on making future Thursdays possible as well.
