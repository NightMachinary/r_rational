  Why Empty?
#+end_quote

I'm interpreting "Empty" as there is no thread for that day. As opposed to on Thursdays, where there is no day for that thread. If you think there's a thread worth having on Tuesday, go ahead and propose it but, in general, I don't think we need to have a thread on all six days of the week just for the sake of it.
