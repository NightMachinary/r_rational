FWIW, we did have a weekly "Writing Skills" thread ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/search?q=writing+skills&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all][see here]]), but it was posted independently by [[/u/xamueljones]] and then never canonized/automated in the same way that the monthly recommendation thread was.

I don't object to bringing it back. The big risk is that there are a bunch of automated threads that don't get much discussion ... ideally we'd have automation for the automation that would generate an overview of discussion activity and flag things for review.
