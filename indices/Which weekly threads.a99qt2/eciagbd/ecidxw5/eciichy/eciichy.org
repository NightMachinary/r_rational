Hmm. Now that it's brought up, requests and recommendations really do seem to be two sides of the same coin. One is requesting a specialized, personalized recommendation while the other is broadcasting an unrequested general rec.

(most posts in both threads are parts of key/value pairs: a subset of recommendation criteria and fics that fulfill that criteria. General recommendations are simply responding to the request of "what things do you think [[/r/rational]] would like". )
