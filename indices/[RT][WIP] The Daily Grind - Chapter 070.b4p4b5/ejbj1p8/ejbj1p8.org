So orbwise, I think it works like this,

There are four types of use for an Orb.

1. Imbue. This seems to come with some aspect of vitality or vital energy alongside it. The orb is absorbed into something to transform it into something alive or similar to life in line with it's element.

2. Absorb. This merges the orb into your body, giving you an internal reservoir of that orb's element. Greater control and versatility then cracking.

3. Crack. This gives you a randomised, theoretical benefit you could have gained from the element, focused on yourself. More powerful but less control over the outcome then absorbing.

4. Totem. These broadcast the element.

Yellow is Time. Comes from native fauna of the Office. Imbuing Time into something creates life. Absorbing it gives a reservoir of Time that sustains you as it ticks down. Cracking a Yellow gives a skill you could have theoretically learned by spending enough time. Totem unknown.

Blue is Tool. Comes from magic items. Imbuing Tool is unknown, might create magic items. Absorbing it gives you a limited number of uses for a unique superpower. Cracking it solves one problem, semi-randomly. Totem for Tool supposedly creates magical objects within it's broadcast range.

The following is more hypothetical on my part.

Red is possibly Awareness. Comes from disarming traps. Imbuing unknown, might create traps. Absorption unknown, might grant some form of enhanced perceptions. Cracking grants the benefits you could have theoretically gained from self-awareness, a greater understanding and harmony with your own emotions and sense of self. Totem grants a particular awareness to those in it's range.

Green is (possibly) Work. Comes from a bunch of bigger creatures and Employees/Puppets. Imbue unknown, may create Employees/Puppets (Workers). Absorption unknown. Cracking grants theoretical benefits from extra Work in a local area, like reduced crime, later open hours, partial rent covered, renovations, etc. Totem unknown.

Orange is weird. Comes from space-distorting creatures and totems. Imbuing unknown. Absorption unknown. Cracking grants things like licences and ownership. Totem warps space and time in it's reach. My person theory right now is that orange is Authority. Or I guess just Space, to balance the yellows with Time.

Finally, there's purple. Traded for with the monitor lizards that live in idea trees. Imbue to create infomorphs. Absorption unknown. Cracking grants Shell Upgrades in the form of personal, permanent enhancements. Totem is unknown. I have vague ideas the Element could be "Conceptualisation", or something similar that would result in upgrades, like "Design" or "Refinement".

Anyway that's my understanding plus ideas.
