Blues aren't healing, they're tools. All their effects are geared towards being used or being useful.

Reds, I'm pretty sure, are sensation/perception. When crushed, they give emotional resonance, when warded they give off information about the general area, and when imbued they create traps (the key piece there being that a trap must be able to determine if it's been triggered)

Greens I'm less certain of, but my current best guess is that they are ownership.

Purples I think are are about reality. When imbued into an idea they create infomorphs (making the idea "more real") and when crushed they amplify the users body (more real as a physical object)

Oranges are structure. When crushed they give access to bureaucracy, and when warded they warp the physical structure of the world.

Edit: I forgot oranges. Silly me. Also aside from yellow/blue these are all guesses.
