So these are what they do when you break them and where they come from:

- Yellow are the random skill levels, and drop from most mobs\\
- Blue are 'problem solvers', and drop from breaking magic items\\
- Red give 'emotional resonance' ranks and the characters generally decline to use them\\
- Purple? are 'shell upgrades' -- body improvements, and they're acquired by trading reds to the monitor lizards / trees.\\
- Green were space improvements, and come from disabling space or time warping traps.\\
- Orange grant legal status.\\

I forget where red/orange drop from.
