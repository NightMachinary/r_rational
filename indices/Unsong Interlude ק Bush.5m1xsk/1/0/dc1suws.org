Duh, I feel so stupid now... I remember thinking something like: "It must have been very easy for Alvarez to hack the teleprompter because it is probably not very well secured, at least compared to equipments that can kill people. But you've just reminded me that in this universe, it's probably common knowledge that a teleprompter can kill people, so it should be actually very well secured. So much that the president would probably only read aloud from written paper sheets typed/written by trusted people.
