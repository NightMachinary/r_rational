Is it something people actually think about, though? As far as we know, there's only one Name that actually kills the user, and everyone (or at least everyone important) would know what it is and know not to accidentally speak it...

... except Dylan hid it inside some fake person's name, so Bush did speak it. Oops. They'll be reading from actual paper next time.

EDIT: In short, it's common knowledge that you can die by saying the Mortal Name - but not yet common knowledge that you can be tricked into saying the Mortal Name while reading aloud.
