A burning bush said to help hell

I don't know what to think about this

edit// wait, wait nevermind I think I figured it out; god was never a burning bush he caused a voice to come form a bush he set fire to, so dylan is the cause of both the voice and the fire it should be considered dylan is the one who said to "help hell" maybe he is the "wicked" messiah for the most wicked generation.

.... but what does that make our heros?
