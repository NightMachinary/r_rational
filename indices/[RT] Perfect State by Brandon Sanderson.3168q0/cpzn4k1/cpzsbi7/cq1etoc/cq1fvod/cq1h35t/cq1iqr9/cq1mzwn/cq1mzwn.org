Besides all which, if your proposed future scenario is less fun than Reedspacer's Lower Bound (volcano lair with catgirls and /your own free ability to develop technology based on real science/), then it's not a subversion of the horror formula, it's just an epic fail at Appealing Alternate Realities. Simultaneously failing to beat Celestia's Lower Bound (ie: being /worse/ than that story's attendant negatives) is just shameful.
