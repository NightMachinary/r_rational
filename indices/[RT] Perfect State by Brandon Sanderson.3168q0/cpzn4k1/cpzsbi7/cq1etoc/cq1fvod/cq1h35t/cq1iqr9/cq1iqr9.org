I didn't actually read this as being cosmic/existential horror. Kai was already [[#s][aware]]

I agree that someone could set up the scenario in a more optimal way, but I think that would undermine the premise of this particular story. If a perfect utopia had been constructed there would be much less room for conflict, and I think the idea here was to keep it deliberately vague if antagonist's perspective was right.
