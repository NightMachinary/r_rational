First off, I'd strongly encourage you to spoiler a lot of that. You just gave away a huge percentage of the novella, and not everyone coming to the thread is necessarily going to have read it.

I don't experience the same kind of visceral horror that you seem to about being deprived the opportunity to live in the real world. I think the point that Kai was attempting to make was that living in a sufficiently comfortable illusion can actually be preferable to living in a dystopian real world - which is a really interesting message. I don't strictly /agree/ with the message, but basically, this seemed to me to be a more "positive" take on Friendship is Optimal. I thought it was a pretty well-written rebuttal, personally.
