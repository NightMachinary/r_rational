Ok, reading the author's Excerpt. I will almost definitely purchase this, and read the whole story. It is engagingly written.

And then I'm going to snark like all hell at it.

Like, seriously, Kai is the /only real person/ in a whole sim? And honestly, man, a high fantasy desktop theme from the bloody ancient Baseline Ages? And you were /born/ into it rather than...

Which psychocidal jackass sanctioned this? Who the hell is the Wode, and why is their management so clearly and flagrantly evil!?

  Even thinking about the Wode turned me into a child again; Besk was right on that count. I'd commanded armies of thousands and I'd single-handedly forged an empire that spanned continents. But this . . . this made a spoiled brat out of me. I stopped inside the stairwell.

No, you dumb bastard. Commanding armies of thousands of simpering roleplaying sim half-AIs and single-handedly (actually, see previous statement on "single") forging an "empire" that spanned entire /sim/-continents made as a /game/ made a spoiled brat out of you.

I DEMAND TO SEE THE MANAGEMENT. If sensible and decent answers are not forthcoming, I will confer with, let us call them, my comrades, and we will return with a sufficient military force to level your planet.
