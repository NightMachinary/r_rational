I find it a failure of imagination to suppose that a properly succesful utopia would fail to contain /lagom/ (sorry I can't link the wiki page for that) conflict.

I also still think it's just /lame/ from a storytelling perspective to use the simulation gimmick. Since long years of literary practice have established that what people want is the real world, at least try writing a story in which, if you're going to have sims, the real world is /available/ and /not at all dystopian/, in and of itself.

Maybe living in a personal or collective sim /is/ more fun, and thus The Thing to Do except for a few weirdos. But lying to people for their entire maturation and having two ontological classes of citizens is certainly not how you make the kind of sim-world most people will want to spend most of their time in. It's how you cater to the simulation-horror genre's cliches, and even played for subversion they're still cliches.

So, come on people, you don't have to show my perfect future, but /try/ showing a world where Everything Has Gone Horribly Wrong/Right is /not/ played /at all/, and instead make an interesting conflict out of sub-existential stakes.

Or hey, maybe even out of /personal/ ones. Personal can be important, when you get us invested in your characters!
