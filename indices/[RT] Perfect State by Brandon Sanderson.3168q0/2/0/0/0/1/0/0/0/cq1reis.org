You're certainly entitled to your opinion. Personally, I think the level of depth that they went into was appropriate for the length of the piece - it's just a short story.

The scenario being presented was neither strictly dystopian nor strictly utopian - that's why I'd call it a subversion. I could see people siding with the perspective of the protagonist or the antagonist, which I suspect was largely the author's point.
