Replying twice, no spoiler tags, on mobile, sorry.

Basically, I want the authors of Simulated Reality stories to stop trying to write cosmic/existential horror and do something more interesting. The genre conventions of horror seem to require that these authors pervert their Matrix Lord designs in ways that no sane Matrix Lord would think.

Consider: you're trying to keep people sane and fulfilled. On its own merits, do you surround them with a solipsistic fakery that will drive them to ennui, or do you surround them with conscious equals in a consistent world from the get-go? If you're smart enough to manipulate them, you're smart enough to spot that the solipsism is flagrantly suboptimal.

The only reason for the solipsism, the stupid fake challenges, and the stupid manipulation games is because you're trying to horrify the reader. If you were really an evil utilitarianism robot, you would largely work with people and keep their sense of reality healthily grounded, for cheapet and easier Fulfillment Points with no nasty aftertaste of ennui.
