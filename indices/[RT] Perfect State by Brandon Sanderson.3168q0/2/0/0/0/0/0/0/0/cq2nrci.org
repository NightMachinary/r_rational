I admit I probably should be a little more selective with how I'm using the spoiler tags, but I'm trying to be very broad because Perfect State just came out and I'm sure a lot of people haven't read it yet.

I'd argue that the Matrix-a-like part and the pony part are both problems, although in different ways.

*Potential spoilers for Friendship is Optimal below - the section seems to be too long for me to spoiler tag it.*

The primary horror from the Matrix-a-like part is that people are being railroaded into uploading themselves even if they don't want to.

The horror from the pony part is that people are being forced into a state that may not in any way resemble what they're comfortable identifying as.

In Perfect State, the antagonist is essentially the mouthpiece for the viewpoint that the Matrix-like simulation scenario is inherently wrong.

I would argue that the conditions of the scenario are probably intended to be less horrific than the Optimalverse stories in three key ways, however - one in that each player is given a world that is tailored toward their personalities and desires, and two that they are integrated into the system at birth, rather than being forced into it at a later stage in life. The third is that there still appear to be human administrators, rather than an AI ruler, which means that there's a higher potential (imo) for getting out of the scenario eventually. If they have the tech to keep brains alive, it's highly likely they have the tech to give people new bodies.

Any of these points can easily be argued as still being as bad or worse than the Optimalverse, depending on your perspective.
