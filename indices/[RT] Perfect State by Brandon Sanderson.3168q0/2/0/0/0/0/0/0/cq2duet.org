Uhhhh, regarding your two spoilers, that's not any /different/ from the other story: its "NPCs" were fully conscious, intelligent individuals /as well/, and in fact, the other story's Evil Overlord considered them to be of /equal/ value to the +harvested victims+volunteer uploaders. (Euphemizing because you're spoilering both stories indiscriminately.)

Besides which, I'm realizing that one of the primary reasons I've taken to ranting on this subject is because a frighteningly large amount of people really seem to think the only thing wrong with that other story was the /pony/ part, rather than the Matrix-a-like part. Whereas I always thought the /Matrix-y-ness/ was the problem, and the ponies were the /redeeming/ quality.
