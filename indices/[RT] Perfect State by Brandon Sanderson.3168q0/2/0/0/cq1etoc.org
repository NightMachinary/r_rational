Ok, finally managed to buy and download the entire novella.

The author managed to successfully surprise me when it turned out that [[#s][]]

I still find myself with a deep urge to find the Wode and Xin Dey, /rip their guts out/, and go liberate the poor souls they've got in all those sims.

Like, seriously, even if they really are [[#s][]] in a really elaborate scifi version of the Mere Addition Paradox because some bastard took over the world and implemented utilitarianism... well, everything I just said is an elaborate description of why /that was a terrible fucking idea/.

And they don't even let [[#s][]]

And COME ON, no access to the real world whatsoever!? I mean, yes, it's a cliche of the brain-in-a-jar you-should-be-horrified-by-this genre, but other than portraying the villains as subjective-fulfillment utilitarians Gone Horribly Right, what's the fucking point in it!? It's /stupid/, it's something that no halfway intelligent techno-dictator would ever /bother/ with if they weren't /deliberately trying to conform to the tropes of Matrix-y existential dread/. Could someone explain what utility these people get out of imposing existential crises and angst on anyone vaguely brainy?

Fucking weaksauce shit! Fleets deployed! Planet will be disassembled to make a new planet with a healthily balanced ecosystem, and the perpetrators will be trampled to death by animals for the crime of Bloody-Stupid Cliche!
