It depends mostly on the quality of the item itself. The process of attuning an artifact to yourself works best when you're fixing damage to it rather than just shining it and oiling it every night. Any of the best items that stand the test of time are going to be items that had durability as one of the physical attributes that were enhanced, or were made of very good quality materials in the first place and so won't need as much intensive maintenance.

That being said, it also takes more time to attune to an artifact the more magic has been imbued in it so while it is possible to obtain and bond with an Ideal level item, it would take a very long time. It's probably still better than making one yourself from a time spent perspective just because you get to use an already powerful item while attuning it, but given that the high level fights in this setting would basically turn into a battle of concepts and ideals anyways, there is a sort of upper level power cap. IE is your Ideal Cutting Sword better than my Ideal Defensive Body Armor. Or even, is your visualization of what the ideal cutting force looks like better than my visualization of the ideal blocking force.
