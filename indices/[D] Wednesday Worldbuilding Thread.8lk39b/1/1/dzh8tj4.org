Well, my first thought about this was what happens with art, what happens when you use tools that you've spent time on, what happens when you scrap it and start ove with the stake materials and the same idea or theme, and how does this affect things like farmland, buildings, plants, and animals? Farmers spend all day, everyday taking care of their farms, and this can be extended to anything on a farm, from a grove to individual fruit tress, strains of plants, the farmland itself, etc.

If things can get conceptual, and it applies to things like land and living things, you get into mythic territory, where you've got a pomegranate tree that improvising you in someone's domain, fruits of knowledge, etc.
