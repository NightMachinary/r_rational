Hmm I hadn't thought about the effect on plants or animals, but in regards to the art, it would really depend on what the artist intended. If the artist wanted to elicit an emotional response, or evoke beauty, then the painting would change to reflect that.

The idea I had to represent that was an autobiographical account handwritten by a narcissistic. He's writing his life's story to try and convince people to believe him more, and when they read his handwritten copy of the book, or he reads it aloud to people, they do.

I'll have to think about what kinds of effects could be applied to plants and animals though because that could change things as well. Like a horse you raised by hand and helped deliver could be the next Pegasus.
