I don't think a single generation could make Pegasus, but would instead take a couple of generations at least. Even then, it would probably be a seven league horse rather than one that flies, or otherwise one very well adapted for the environment that bred it.

Have you read of Ars Longa, Vita Brevis? In the same way, it might be diffcult to make something capable of granting immortality, it might take generations to store enough magic, but it would happen. After that, it would just take a society putting in enough literal man hours to get it spread around, or even less if it's a plant or animal.

I think that your world would tend to the mythic, with gods and monsters (escaped Pegasi?).

Actually, poor people would have an advantage over the wealthy, since they have to spend so much time maintaining stuff. Knives, fires, there's this thing called perpetual stew, where you just keep adding whatever's on hand to the pot so you don't starve, bread starters, people who make their bed are technically maintaining it, laundry and clothing repair, there's a bunch of things poor people do that rich people don't bother with and that poor people have to.

I think farmers would imbue magic for harvest, hardiness, nutritiousness, and other things like that. Medicine men, wise women, priests, shamans, etc. would go for potency and efficacy.

Edit: If the performance of a piece has the same effect as the piece, then bards are a thing.

More abstractly, nobles would work on their persona, image, bearing, etc. Nobles would work on their makeup style.

A fighting style can gain conceptual effects.
