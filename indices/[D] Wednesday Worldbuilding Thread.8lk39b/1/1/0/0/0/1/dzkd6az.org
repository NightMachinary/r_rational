Alternatively: people's inate magic calls other peoples magic a bitch and kicks it out of it's house. Alternately, anything that has a mind does the same.

Alternately, the difference between imbuable things and unimbuable things is ownership. Someone owns themself on a fundamental level that plants don't, and magically speaking that animals don't.

/Alternately,/ in the same manner that your bards charm person spell is in some ways inherent to him, animal/plant bloodline magic is reset with each new generation. I think that might be based on a fundamental misunderstanding of how your system works, but I think that it would work, since otherwise bards could use 7000 year old battle hymns to cast opposing armies into illusory worlds or summon literal gods. Same for ancient martial arts.
