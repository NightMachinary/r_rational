Between the two of those, it's more to do with innate magic rejecting other people influencing it, but then again I could change my mind later depending. There's a lot to think about.

In regards to martial arts and musical performances, I think the reason I'm not going to let the power creep on those get out of hand is going to have to do with the minor differences. There's always going to be differences between people's actions whether it be from their understanding of how to do something (like how some guitarists do some weiiiird finger transitions to get to different chords) or from different body types making certain things need adaptation. That combined with the need for every user to adapt to the style before they can begin to infuse it with more power would mean that in-setting it would take a long time for the power of these things to increase appreciably.
