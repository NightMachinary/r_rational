The problem is, I'm not really sure I want the magic to be transferable. So even if plants or animals can be imbued, I wouldn't want it to be something transferable to their next generation. By that same logic, then raising a child would be imbuing them with magic and humanity as a whole would grow stronger magically over time which just seems incredibly inelegant as a solution. I think It's probably easier to just say that in the constraints of this system, living things cannot be imbued.

There could definitely be workarounds, such as a field that's been worked on for generations that has the imbued Concept of Growth and therefore crops in the field grow faster.

You definitely bring up a lot of interesting points as to what is imbuable and what is not that would have some interesting ramifications on my setting that I'll have to think about, so thanks for that!
