Oh dang this hadn't even occurred to me! A couple of solutions that occur to me is that magical items could lose their 'charge' the longer they've been sitting without maintenance, and/or the process of attuning a magical item to yourself makes it lose some of its 'charge'. With both, it would mean that even longstanding magical items that have been passed down through families without degrading due to time left alone would still not grow out of control whereas neglected items would eventually become magically inert. Thanks for pointing that out!
