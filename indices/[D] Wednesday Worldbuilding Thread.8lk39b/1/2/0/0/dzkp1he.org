  An institution relies on a lot of moving parts to function which means there isn't really just one contributor to its success.

- You can say the same about a clock. The man who makes a clock may also be the man who makes the mainspring, but he is unlikely to be the man who mines the metal.
- While it is true that many institutions are made by many people, it is nonetheless possible for one person to be the driving force behind an institution, to truly pour his heart into it.

...on the subject of clocks, here's another point to consider. A clock can clearly be an Ideal Clock (which I imagine is one that never needs winding and is always perfectly on time). But, surely, a mainspring can also be an Ideal Mainspring - what happens when the Ideal Mainspring is used (perhaps by someone else) as part of a clock? (What about adding to that Ideal Hands, the Ideal Clockface, and perhaps even the Ideal Cuckoo?)
