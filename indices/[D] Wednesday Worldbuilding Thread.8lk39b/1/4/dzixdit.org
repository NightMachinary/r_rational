You mentioned it in your post, and I agree that an idealised item seems very broken, as anyone with enough time could create a killing sword, and if it takes all the minor ideals someone could come up with - well, bad things happen.

So what if, theoretically, the sword had to learn the new conceptual changes from interacting with others? This makes heirloom items have an interesting significance (as they become more powerful as they are handed down, and means older is better in this case) and also puts a pseudo cap on power. After all, why would you give your personal weapon that could kill you in a single blow to someone who may want to kill you. Even if the weapon becomes more powerful, there is a risk beyond putting your eggs in one basket. This means that powerful items are A, rarer, and B, more powerful if older.

The system on its own is actually really cool, I've haven't heard of anything like it. As for possible consequences, people will develop WMDs just a little earlier than expected. Bombs are an early invention after all, though by the looks of it, it would be a slow process. There may also be a different economic system, as the quality of mass produced items is objectively worse in a lot of cases, so there may be more artisans and such.

I could also see idealised artwork and literature creating interesting propaganda states, where posters on the walls are magically compelling if they are large and long-lasting.
