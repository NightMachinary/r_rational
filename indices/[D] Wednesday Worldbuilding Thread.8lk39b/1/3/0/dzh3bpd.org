Thanks for your criticisms! The point I started trying to make is satirizing the obsession we have with artisanally made goods, but it then evolved into an idea of a world in which the cottage crafting industry never really died out. We as a society value things that took an individual a lot of time to make even though it might not always be as good as a machined version of the same thing, so I wanted to make a hypothetical situation in which it's the other way around.

As far as the way I'm presenting it, yeah it is presented much like an RPG mainly because that's one of the ways I'm considering exploring this world: by running it as a quest on SV or SB. As it currently is, I'm not trying to capture the entire nuance of it but instead to present it in a way that could be easily understood.

However, your criticism that conceptual effects aren't as interesting as the visual or dynamic results of effects, I think I have to disagree with entirely. The presentation of the effects in prose is where readers would get the vast majority of the visual or dynamic effects regardless, but I think the magic system using concepts works primarily because it's dependent on the psychology of its users. The association cause and effect which is then subverted by a magical twist because of the mindset of the magic user.

I also think that not literalizing the model, while useful from an outside perspective, would not be as visible from within the system itself. Using ideals or concepts as the vehicle for which the item acts leaves a lot of room for interpretation and exploring the psychology of someone as they use it. I think this would both obfuscate a lot of the rules and demonstrate the way thought process affects or interaction with the world.

I hope this clarifies my thought process about the whole thing!
