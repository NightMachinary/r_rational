In addition to adjustability, I'd expect Fantasy-Diversity-Act-compliant companies to be focused on modularity, to be adjustable on a macro level.

So if you advertise your hotel as "All races^{\}within) ^{the "23 most common races" Imperial list, Elder Dragons not included\}) welcome", you're gonna have equipment and procedures to be able to refit your rooms for specific races. So you'll have a few titanium beds with synthetic moss in store for the occasional Rock Monster client; a few low tables and chairs for when a Dwarven scribe congregation books; and since storing every different configuration of furniture is expensive, low-cost inns probably have "you either book in advance, pay premium, or get the one-size-fits-all service (or no service at all)" race-dependent policies; eg Goblins who don't book ahead get the uncomfortable one-size-fits-all solution, Volcanic Elemntals who don't book ahead often get no service because the inn has no heat-proof bed and chairs in store.
