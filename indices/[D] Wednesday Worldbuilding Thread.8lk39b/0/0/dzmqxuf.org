For trains used by the less affluent, there would have to be a standard of some sort. There can't be much downtime between stops or the company running the train would lose revenue, so they can't have much in the way of customization unless it can be done quickly on an individual basis. Most likely there would be standards and norms in place to accommodate as many people as possible while some ethnic groups may be shafted if size and other factors necessitate drastic changes.

Another way around those issues would be race based train cars. Daandle-Trens have a very specific sitting posture that necessitates vastly different seating situations from humans else they get extremely violent. So a company that has railways that service both the Imperium and the Daandle Collective would have passenger cars that would hold either Daandle-Trens or humans. The Daandle-Cre while at a higher average height to humans have a rather similar sitting posture so the Daandle-Imperium Express would seat humans and the Daandle-Cre in mixed-race cars thus lowering costs.
