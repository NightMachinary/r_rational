I want to talk, briefly, about ergonomic considerations for fantasy worlds with multiple species.

There's a [[https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2016/01/16/when-us-air-force-discovered-the-flaw-of-averages.html][great article on "the flaw of averages"]] I'd recommend checking out that's all about how the Air Force switched from making things for the "average in every way" man to making things that adjust on multiple metrics to men within a fairly wide range around average.

Assuming that technology and society are far enough along in the fantasy world, eventually people will start having some inkling that design considerations need to take different races into account (and even if that's not a consideration, it's something that authors can/should think about as part of how a foreigner interacts with local culture).

With a wide(r) range of body types for multiple kinds of humanoids, if you're designing (say) seats on a train, or beds in a hotel, you need to take into account a lot more variable, either by making things adjustable to the specific needs of the person using it or making it sufficiently generic that /anyone/ can use it. The former is expensive, while the latter sacrifices comfort/efficiency.

So what would this look like in practice? Because of variable width, chairs would be less likely to have arms and bench seating would be more common. Because of variable height, doors and ceilings would probably be built to accommodate the tallest humanoid, and seating would also need to account for people with very long (or very short) legs -- booster seats would probably help a bit, but it's not a full solution. Variable /weight/ means that things are engineered to the upper end, unless the society in question is fine with just saying "no rock monsters".

I'd really like to see a fantasy novel dealing with some aspect of compliance with fantasy ADA compliance -- maybe a backwards kingdom that's being brought into the international community and needs to bring their government buildings up to code. The analogy to real-world disabilities might be a little too on-the-nose though. Also, I'm not sure how you'd pitch it to potential readers.

(This all gets a lot more complicated when you start introducing non-humanoids into the mix, naturally.)
