Sorry about the wall of text ahead, but I'd really appreciate your thoughts on this magic system I'm designing and the way it would affect society and technological development.

The magic itself is everywhere. Anyone can do it, and it has the same effects regardless. Essentially what it does is imbue items that you've made with magical power. The more you worked on the item from the beginning of its crafting to its end, the more power the finished item will have. This also means that items that take longer to make end up with more power because of the additional time spent working on them. You can use someone else's creation, but it will be roughly half as effective as it would be in its maker's hands. In addition, time spent on the upkeep of an item counts towards the imbuing of the item with power but is about half as effective as the actual process of creation is. Maintaining an item that was not yours can eventually make it 100% effective again.

There are three stages to the magic imbued into things, and for the purpose of explaining, I'm going to use the example of a sword. The first is the strengthening of Physical Traits: hardness, sharpness, flexibility, etc... It simply makes the item qualitatively better. The second stage is Conceptual Traits. In this example, the sword you're making a sword has reached the amount of time necessary to start changing its Conceptual Traits and you make the sword embody the Concept of Cutting. This could take many forms depending on the mindset of the creator. For instance, a sword that is meant to cut should be able to cut regardless of length, so the cutting edge of the blade begins to extend beyond the edge of the sword. Or perhaps instead, the maker feels the sword should be able to cut regardless of the armor of what is being struck so it becomes better able to slash through armor with little resistance. The third stage is the one I'm having the most difficulty with, but it has to do with Platonic Ideals. Basically, at this stage the sword becomes the Ideal of its Concept. The Ideal Cutting Sword would do basically anything that different creators could have done to a lesser degree with their Conceptual changes, but at the same time, it requires the creator to shift their mindset to each usage as it comes.

The reason I'm having difficulty with that is because it simply seems too powerful to really be practical in any setting, but then again the amount of time necessary to make something that realizes an Ideal rather than just strengthening Concepts is ridiculously long. As soon as you start making an item, you can begin to change its physical traits, but the effects become stronger the more you do. At roughly a hundred and fifty hours, you can begin to change Concepts, and again, the effect strengthens the more you work on it. At roughly four thousand hours, the item begins to change from a Conceptual item to an Idealized one, but the process is very gradual and is done by layering Concepts on the item.

What would a society in which this magical system has always been existent look like? I'm envisioning one in which there is even more of a power divide between the rich and the poor because the rich can spend their time and money on crafting more magical items whereas the poor must spend a more significant portion of their time on trying to survive. By having the disposable time and income to dedicate to the project, the rich ensure that they will always have the most effective magical items, which in turn makes their social status solid.

However, the world could also turn out more idealized than that other prediction. A farmer who has created their own tools and maintained them for their whole life could feasibly feed a much greater number of people proportionally to their efforts. This could create a population boom, a technological revolution, a literal revolution, etc... as many booms in agriculture have done in the past.

Which do you think is more likely? What seems broken about this magic system?
