This magic system reminds me vague of a book I once read, called "The Practice Effect"; wherein a planet is found where 'practice makes perfect' takes on a new meaning. The more you use a tool for its intended purpose, the better it gets at that purpose; thus, if one wants a /really good/ axe, one makes any old axe and uses it for hours and hours and watches it get better and better and sharper and sharper; city walls can be strengthened by beating on them with clubs (but not so hard as to actually smash them); and a sufficiently rich man will hire guards to stand at strategic points in his house, where they can appreciate the artwork and thus cause the artwork to practice being appreciated and thus keep the house looking nice.

--------------

Now, how does this translate to your setting? The first thing to come to mind is this - that /time spent creating/ is valuable. If I want a perfect sword, I can spend four thousand hours - or I can pay a local blacksmith (an /exorbitant/ amount) to spend four thousand hours on my behalf. Sure, it's less effective for me than it would be for him, but it's still as effective for me as something I would have spent two thousand hours on, plus, as a bonus, I didn't actually have to spend two thousand hours on it. (A /smart/ rich man will specifically request something that has /not/ had its Durability enhanced, so he can then work on enhancing the Durability himself and get a head-start on attuning it to himself).

--------------

But then there is also the question - what exactly is an object? Sure, a sword is easy to see as Improved in various ways - what about a farm? A kingdom? Or some sort of institution - is it possible for a Chief of Police who really throws himself into his work to create a patonically ideal police force (opposed, naturally, by a platonically ideal thieves' guild)? What happens to the rookie who joins one of these institutions - does officially joining the Ideal Thieves' Guild give one the power to instantly open any non-Ideal lock? Does a warlike King create a platonically ideal army, while a more economically-minded monarch creates a platonically ideal tax system?
