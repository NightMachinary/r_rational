Thinking about this further makes me think that rather than do a flat time-spent algorithm for everything, part of the limit to magic capacity should also be based on the quality of the materials used as well as the complexity of the item being built. It would do a lot to nip problems like exceptionally complex heirloom items in the bud while still allowing for more technological growth and progress.

As to what constitutes an item, I think it has more to do with the mental state of the creator than it does the actual 'itemness' of something. If the creator of something can conceive of it as a self contained thing then it would act as such. I also replied to someone higher up that I don't particularly want to allow for living things to be effected by this system because then we would get human beings who are inherently magical simply because of the time spent by their parents raising them. I think it's an easier solution to say that living things have an inherent energy that is incompatible with this kind of enhancement.

Institutions being imbued with energy is a really interesting concept because it sits in that weird middle between being a concept and being alive. An institution relies on a lot of moving parts to function which means there isn't really just one contributor to its success. I still haven't decided whether or not to allow for multiple contributors to an item, or if I do, how that would effect the strength and usage of the item in the end.

You raise some interesting questions that I'll definitely have to think about, so thanks for that!
