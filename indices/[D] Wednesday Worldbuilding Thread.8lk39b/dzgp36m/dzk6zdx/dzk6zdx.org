I realize I'm a bit late to this party, but have you figured out how magic will leave the system? If people are spending, say, 1 hour a day on average maintaining their non-magical stuff, you get a new conceptual item at a rate of about 1.2 x <world population> per year.

Now some of those will break down beyond repair eventually, but considering that magic items become more durable the longer they are around your setting will end up accumulating more and more magic over time.
