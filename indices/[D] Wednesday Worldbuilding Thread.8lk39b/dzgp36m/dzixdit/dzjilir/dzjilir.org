I think the way I'm going to go about having a cap on power is something I mentioned to someone else further up, but basically limiting that amount of energy something can be imbued with by its complexity and the materials its made from. It seems the best solution to stopping ridiculously broken heirloom items being something people constantly stumble over.

You're definitely right about bombs becoming much more deadly much more quickly which is something that hadn't even occurred to me. Afterall, the Chinese invented gunpowder back in the 9th century which allows a lot of time to develop deadly weapons alongside this magic system.

In regards to idealized artwork and literature, it's difficult to quantify what sort of effects it could have since it entirely depends on the mindset of the creator, and even then has a lesser effect on other people because they're not wielding it in the same way. That being said, propaganda would certainly be more compelling under this system as well. Thanks for giving me some stuff to think about!
