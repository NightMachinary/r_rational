Hey!

Do you like /genocides/? Are you looking for a nice real-life setting to take inspiration from for you dystopic post-apocalypse settlement, with all the human right abuse, sexual exploitation and inescapable poverty that entails? Or do you just want to make yourself miserable for a whole week?

Then look no further than the Rohyngia genocide in Myanmar and the subsequent refugee crisis in Bangladesh! It has all the human misery, death and systemic injustice you could ever think of.

Anyway, I've just been studying this stuff for a presentation. It's pretty horrible (in one BBC interview, a Rohyngia said his people was like a football: everyone's kicking them); the gist of it is, they're an unrecognized ethnic minority in Myanmar; they've consistently been the victims of human rights violations for decades, and recently the Myanmar military has started a purge where tons of them have been tortured and killed, deported to Bangladesh, or put into what amounts to concentration camps. The Bangladesh government doesn't know what to do with them and is so far keeping them in overcrowded refugee camps (Bangladesh itself being one of the poorest, high-population density countries in the world), and is hoping that the UN will strong-arm Myanmar into accepting the refugees back (which is never, ever going to happen).

Point is, it's pretty good inspiration material if you want to write a Worm fanfic in post-Leviathan Brockton Bay or something.
