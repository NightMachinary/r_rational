There are a few points where Liv could have been more rational - Call the CDC about 6 months before the show starts, which would be an entirely different show, dropping the secret the second she figured out it was shielding a murder inc operation... or just going "One is fewer than many" at the appropriate time.. Hmm. Can't think of any fics with this sort of departure though.
