They are a complicated mix of zombies and vampires. They eat brains instead of drinking blood, which means their "brain donors" can't be alive. They are alive, but their bodies are modified: low blood pressure, muffled sensations, etc. They have to eat brains to control themselves, and if they don't, they permanently turn into stereotypical zombies.

It was mentioned that the drug has been mixed with something. Medic dude speculates it was an engineered virus.

I generally like the "zombies absorb brains" interpretation. It sorta explains memories, muffled sensations, low blood pressure and permanent stupid-zombie-transformation: brain is fucked up, consumes itself instead of oxygen and needs spare parts, and eats all the personality parts if not fed properly.
