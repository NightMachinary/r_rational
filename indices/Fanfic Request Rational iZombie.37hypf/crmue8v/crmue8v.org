I'll say this: these guys are vampires. They're vampires who eat brains instead of blood, but they're vampires.

With that said ... obvious first place to look is the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IZOMBIE][original Virtigo comics]].

EDIT: and, having looked, meh.

OK, I'd at least want a better handwave than "this drug just happens to make you into a stereotypical movie zombie, except you sorta absorb people's brains when you eat them." That's ... that just doesn't make much sense for a drug. A virus, /maybe/.

/Or/ you could throw out the "mleftover memories" part and just say your brain is now deficient in some chemical that's present in other human brains. One of the two, but probably not both.
