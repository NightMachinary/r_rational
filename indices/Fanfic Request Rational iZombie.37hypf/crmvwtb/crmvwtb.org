The primary plot of iZombie isn't too bad. What's bad is that it's following the monster-of-the-week thing that pretty much every show in its vein does to start out. If you strip the primary plot down to an antagonist trying to spread zombism to powerful people and maintain a monopoly on the supply of brains, with a protagonist trying to understand zombism and incidentally discovering his plans, then I think you'd have basically a recut version of the show. The problem with "freak of the week" is that it usually results in a very passive protagonist, which is the primary problem with Liv as a character and the plot in general. Major takes a whole lot of the available agency in the plot, since he's at least got a goal that he's working towards.
