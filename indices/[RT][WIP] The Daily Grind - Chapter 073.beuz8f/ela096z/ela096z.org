Holy fuck what a chapter. Please dont read if you dont want spoilers. Last week chapter: sneaking past a single monster This week chapter: surviving last minute against an infinte hoard of monsters, people riding dragons, someone cloned themselves somehow, book flat out ends On one hand, im happy something actually happened On the other, more happened in one chapter than the least 10 combined
