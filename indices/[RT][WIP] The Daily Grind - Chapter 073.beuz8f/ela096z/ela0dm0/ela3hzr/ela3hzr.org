I mostly just figured that the characters were the kind of people who would do that thing, where consumable items don't get used because you might /really need them later/. Which, yeah, led to some things, the nerf gun especially, being unused for a while.

As for the whole last stand thing, well, I can sorta see how it was contrived, yeah. I did try to set it up by showing some parts of the dungeon getting more aggressive, and with the small glimpse into what the larger people-network was thinking, but it wasn't my best foreshadowing.
