Seems like a subset of military fantasy/sci-fi? Like Practical Guide To Evil has a lot of bits upgrading military units and army compositions. I'm not actually sure what would be different to make it more RTS-like. Focusing on upgrading units even more? Putting a gamey layer of upgrade trees and numbers on top of it?
