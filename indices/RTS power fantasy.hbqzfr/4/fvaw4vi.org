I don't think RTS is the wording I'd use, it's not real time, strategy is a good enough descriptor though I get it, but I do prefer tactics games like XCOM over rts.

​

I've frequently requested and praised on the use of power caps and the fact that it allows for unit vs unit and large scale conflicts rather than no power cap scenarios. Examples of these are more generally found in published books rather than webfiction though.

​

An example that comes to mind if Prince of Thorns. There are no super powerful people in that world. But the MC is Evil, read the first chapter if you can handle him the story and writing are top tier. You can find it for free if you look hard enough.

​

Historical fiction in general, including alternative histories also tend to have these elements present in them. If you find some in fantasy settings that are readable, no need to be good, tell me I'd love to see some of them.
