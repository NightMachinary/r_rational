If you're willing to branch out to CN webnovels there's The World Online. It's a Chinese VRMMORPG peggy sue, practically its own genre by now. In this case the twist is that the game in question offers players the choice of playing as wandering adventurers or as local lords in territory management mode.

The scale of things eventually got away from the author a little bit, IMO, but there's a couple hundred solid chapters of entertainment there.
