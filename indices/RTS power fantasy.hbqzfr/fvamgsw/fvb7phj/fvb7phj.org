If you are talking about cross-fics I have issue with commanders holding massive idiot balls. Any instance of supcom in a world of Worm, for example, will completely trivialize anything if they just spend a little time on scaling up. Infinitely replicating army of self-sufficient drones doesn't really offer itself for a challenge.
