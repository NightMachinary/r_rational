There's [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-cloudy-path-worm-supreme-commander.301286/]] which is long and has a consistently high quality, it also avoids the idiot ball aspect thanks to the timescale, the story starts out with her having managed to cludge together something that outputs refined feedstock at a rate that could optimistically be called drop by drop, WOG says it'd take months to go from that to any proper SC unit by which point the story would be pretty much over and since she's not putting everything back into increased production it'll take significantly longer. Though it's hardly an RTS power fantasy.
