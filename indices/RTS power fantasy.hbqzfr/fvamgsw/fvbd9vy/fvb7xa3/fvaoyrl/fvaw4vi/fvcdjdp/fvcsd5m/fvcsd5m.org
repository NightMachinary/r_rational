One of the most interesting parts of the first book is discovering that world, but if you want the spoiler I can tell you if you ask me. But yes there's magic and strange creatures.

Biographies of certain historical figures fill that niche somewhat. Alexander the great, Julius Caesar, the hardcore history series on Genghis Khan, maybe Napoleon but that's a less interesting period for me so I've never bothered..

The manga Kingdom is mostly this, the pacing got very slow and I dropped it last year, but up till then it was good. His troops get stronger, he raises through military ranks, the side character who's the king does diplomacy, the enemies counter and defend his strategies..

Though there's hardly any intelligent or interesting use of tactics or strategy going on other than the author making it seem that way by making the characters say so.
