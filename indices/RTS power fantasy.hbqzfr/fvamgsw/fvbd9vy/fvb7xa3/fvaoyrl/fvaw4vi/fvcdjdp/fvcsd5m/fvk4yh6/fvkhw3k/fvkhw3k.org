They get less edgy as they go. Second one is a LOT less edgy. First one is more of a hey this is as bad as it can get here if you don't like it leave now. The kingdom building and rulership aspects also increase.

Book of the ancestor has better worldbuilding, but more focused on individuals instead of armies and rulership. Most mutations are hinted as being non radiation related though.. It's also 1k+ years and weapons that changed environments drastically so it's not too jarring imho.

Edit* also notice other interesting changes in people like people being taller on average in the story. It kind of makes sense given sexual selection and female preferences, but also not, because bigger people need more food and their food production capacity likely decreased after the fall and yet they have other advantages like better crops than our ancestors did in the same technological level so it's fun..
