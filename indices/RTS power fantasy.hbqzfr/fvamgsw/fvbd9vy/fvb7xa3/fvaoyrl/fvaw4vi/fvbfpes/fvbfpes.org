I would say some "use modern technology to take over a low-tech world" - stories are a lot like what you talk about. [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20920/enlightened-empire][Enlightened Empire]] is a good example, albeit it is almost annoyingly realistic about the time and effort it would take to actually do this, even with a protagonist who happens to be an expert on the matter. (Don't take me wrong, there is plot and such to keep you entertained while the long-term plans are slowly bearing fruit.)
