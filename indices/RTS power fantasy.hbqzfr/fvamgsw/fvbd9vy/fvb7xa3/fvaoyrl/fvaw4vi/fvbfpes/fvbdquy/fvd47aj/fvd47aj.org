Ender's Game, where Ender unwittingly controls the human fleet? Figured that was kind of an RTS interface with the Ansible allowing instant communication. More RTS than anything resembling a normal real world military command.

Would probably be more interesting to read a Moba-fiction. That at least seems writeable.
