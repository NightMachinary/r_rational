  I can't really agree with that point. Some of the best anime out there never got a dub or were sold in the west and vice versa some of the worst stuff the industry shits out does get licensed.

The argument is not that the filter functions perfectly to only grab the cream of the crop. It's that the filter greatly increases average quality. For the stuff that gets imported, someone had to sit there and think, "Yes, this is good enough that it's worth the cost of importing", then they had to spend thousands of dollars on doing that. Unless that filter is no better than random chance, the stuff that gets imported is going to be of a higher average quality.

The exact same argument applies to work the fans do. The only works that get fansubs are the ones where some fan sat there and thought, "Yes, this is worth the hundreds of hours it's going to take to translate this". Because fans have limited time, they're going to be selective in what they translate. So they're applying their own filter, except the filter has somewhat different criteria.
