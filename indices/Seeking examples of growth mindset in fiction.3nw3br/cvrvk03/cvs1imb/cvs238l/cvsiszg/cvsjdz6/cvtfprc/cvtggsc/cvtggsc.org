No, it's not the same argument. The argument is similar to one that says "books which get published tend to be better than books which don't get published". But that's not at all the same thing as saying "the best books are the ones that sell the most".

Business decisions /are/ different from fan decisions, but business decisions are predicated on people either sticking around so that they can be fed advertising, buying the product, or buying the merchandising for the product. Those are all things that fans do.

A businessman /purely seeking to maximize profit/ is going to put his money towards the things that he thinks will make him money ... but the way to make money is to have people actually willing to buy the product. So if a businessman is looking to put dubbing on an anime in order to release it to Western markets, he's not going to pick something that absolutely bombed and which no one liked, he's going to pick something that has shown some measure of success. We can be pretty sure that he's not going to be picking from the bottom 10%.

And yes, /some of it/ is going to be shit. Sometimes our businessman is going to get a license on the cheap, sometimes his predictive power is going to be terrible (or simply fail him), sometimes he's going to select things which are generally palatable instead of those which are daring and bold ... but he's /still/ applying a filter and that filter is /still/ going to raise the average quality.

It's possible that we could even empirically test this if we had a big database of anime, whether or not they were imported to the west, and ratings, assuming that we could get past selection biases. Assuming such a database existed somewhere, my prediction is that the average rating for the set of all anime would be lower than the average rating for the set of all anime that got imported to the west.

(My views are somewhat colored by having briefly worked at a publishing company where I sifted through manuscripts to see which ones might be suitable for profit-motivated publication. The idea that this profit-motivated process doesn't incidentally filter based on quality is just ... well, I don't think I could disagree with it more.)
