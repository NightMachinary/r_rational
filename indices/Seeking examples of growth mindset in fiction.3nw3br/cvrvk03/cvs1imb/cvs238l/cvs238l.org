Welllll because it is, really. I mean, just because anime tropes allow for a higher level of baseline weirdness, doesn't mean /most/ anime aren't just repeats of the same crappy tropes over and over again.

I mean, consider how many anime deal with cute girls doing cute things in high school, /and don't even have airsoft battles or zombies/. Or harem romantic comedies with soulless, no-personality male protagonists obviously meant to let the otaku audience fantasize about being surrounded by adoring beautiful women without having to relate to others.

With anime, the import process pre-filters things, so you see a selection of higher-quality material without having to browse through all the crap. There's actually quite a lot of good Western media when you exercise an equally strong filter.
