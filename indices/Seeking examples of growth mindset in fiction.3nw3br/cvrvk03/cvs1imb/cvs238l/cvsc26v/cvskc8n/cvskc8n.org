Define cute? Because the first thing that comes to mind (for me) is the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManicPixieDreamGirl][Manic Pixie Dream Girl]] archetype, which values cuteness over hotness and tends to be romantic but not sexualized. And that archetype (or shades of it) shows up everywhere.
