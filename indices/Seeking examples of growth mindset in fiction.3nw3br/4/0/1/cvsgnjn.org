A fair part is inherent to the medium. A large assembly of people in a musty church is about as expensive to draw and render as a large assembly in space. Hell, if you go detailed enough the church might actually be more expensive in some cases, so why not do it space? While live action can send actors to a church for cheap, rendering a spacescape is horrendously expensive in CGI. This means that smaller companies can pump out crazy shit at a lower cost, allowing them to take greater risks.

I mean, imagine trying to shoot Attack on Titan or Gundam in live action. Sure, you could technically do it but the price would be astronomical (no pun intended). It gives them much greater freedom to be off the wall.

Think back to western attempts on the same medium and you'll find they can be pretty damn creative as well. Consider Courage the Cowardly Dog or Wren and Stimpy or even South Park. The differences between that and live action are many and obvious, because they do just have more freedom.

Say you're a creative young writer in the US and you want to do a zombie scene. Just a throwaway zombie scene for a gag on a low budget live action show. It's a huge hassle and like as not just not going to happen. In an anime you can totally do it pretty easily.
