Cute girls doing cute things barely exists in western media though. It's either gone through massive sexualisation so it's hot girls doing hot things or uh I can't even think of anything else. Western media has a serious lack of female centric shows. I guess some kids shows ala power puff girls would come under it so the or would be it's demographically targeted at toddlers.

The harem thing is more common, but you can hardly use things that never or hardly happen to show that anime is similar to Western shows.
