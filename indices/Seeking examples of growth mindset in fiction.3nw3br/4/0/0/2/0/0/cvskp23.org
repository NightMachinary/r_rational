I suppose I could for the discussion accept that definition as cute, but I'd say that that's a cute girl doing cute things which isn't the same as cute girls doing cute things.

There's a very different use of characters there, one is cute as an additive or reward or even contrast for the main character and the second is cuteness for its own sake which as I said seems restricted almost entirely to very young children demographically.

Flicking through that trope page some of the examples, like Her, under films really don't seem to fit the concept brainz was referring too that is very common in anime.

Edit on my phone but having a look at brains comment looks like I misunderstood what he was saying anyway
