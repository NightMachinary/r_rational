Protector of the Small is a great example. Tamora Pierce's other works fail on this front: Daine is born with a unique system of magic. Alanna is better, as she trains a lot, but she's also chosen by the Goddess and was born with a magical Gift and a talent for healing.

Protector of the Small has Kel doing good old fashion work to improve, and highlights the skills she starts the book with as a result of the same sort of training throughout her life.
