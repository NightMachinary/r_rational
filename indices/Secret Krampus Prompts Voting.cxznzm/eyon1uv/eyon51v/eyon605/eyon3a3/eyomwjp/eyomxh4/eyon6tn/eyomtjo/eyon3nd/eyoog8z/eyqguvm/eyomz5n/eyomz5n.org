Prompt: A doomsday meteor will soon hit Earth! Can you convince your parents to help you stop it before bedtime?

Suggested framing: You are a brilliant young scientist whose talent and acumen for building experimental doohickeys has won you many social media followers. Last month, you discovered and constructed an experimental device that seemed to confirm that the world would be impacted by a doomsday meteorite next year! You've spent your last month's allowance on widgets and thingamabobs to help you build the refined super-device that will help you and your correspondents across the globe determine whether this rock will hit or miss Earth, but you're missing one critical component.

Suggested framing: You have latent psychic abilities that allow you to feel the future deaths of people you care about. You didn't know this when grandma died last year, but now that the whole world will die, you've figured out what your power is.

Suggested framing: The last electronic toy your $family_member gave you wasn't what it said on the box: it was a receiver for messages from the future. It's sending you messages from yourself, $time_span in the future.
