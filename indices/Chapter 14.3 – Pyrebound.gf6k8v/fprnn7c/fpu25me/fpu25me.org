There's one unknown: it hasn't been disclosed how the pyre chooses its next candidate in a vacancy, or if it's truly random. It could, potentially, randomly pick Etana or some other diehard aristocrat. Of course, this is highly improbable, given the ratio of elite, non-castrated men to ordinary working-class schlubs. They'd have to either get really lucky or have the pyre show really perverse priorities. They do not have cause to feel lucky lately.
