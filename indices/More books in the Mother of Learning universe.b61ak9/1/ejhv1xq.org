I've been thinking of the MoL universe as a bog-standard D&D setting (with bog-standard D&D spells, even), with a body of lore worked out to *accommodate* the complete complement of standard D&D sourcebook---and even splatbook---assets (e.g. lizard folk, animal bonds, psionics, Perfect Spell feats, an 8th-level Wizard spell called /Gate/, etc.) rather than the standard approach of working out a setting and then selecting/modifying the sourcebook assets into a form that fit that setting (as seen in /Eberron/, /Ravenloft/, etc.) The standard approach is what it is because bog-standard D&D is tuned to be a fun (if campy) setting to /play games/ in, but doesn't particularly make for a good basis for narrative works like tie-in novels. The various D&D “settings” are built so that they /do/ form a solid foundation for tie-in novels---but at the expense of some of the simulationist playability of “anything goes” base D&D.

But that's not to say it's /impossible/ to make anything-goes “splatbook soup” D&D into a coherent setting. MoL does it. It takes a lot of work, but it's possible.

Presumably, any other novel that has tried to “take the anything-goes simulationism-focused D&D setting seriously as a narrative setting” in this same manner would end up with a similar setting (other than the “time loop” part.) So:

- Do any of the official (TSR/Wizards) D&D-branded novels do this? (I haven't read any, but is my understanding that they don't, since each one comes from one of those settings that modifies “sourcebook D&D” into a more self-consistent setting.)

- Does any unofficial D&D-“inspired” (i.e. basically ripping off) novel/series do this? (I feel like this is more likely.)

Sadly, I don't think any novel/series that's just “based on someone's D&D campaign” would qualify, because those aren't really based on “taking the source material /seriously/” in a self-consistent-narrative-setting sense, but rather upon playing a fun game and then recording the fun you had. Media like /Slayers/ are based on D&D campaign after-action reports, so they look less like a self-consistent setting and more like campy pastiche---if you describe them in terms of historiography, they're a murder-hobo's gonzo-journalist subjective experience of the setting.

(And /Worth the Candle/ is essentially what you get when you try to play a game set in a world with a self-consistent setting and rules favouring narrative interest over game interest---and I kind of doubt that people tend to actually desire to play an RPG campaign that way for any length of time. Though, if [[/r/rational]] were interested, we could try...)
