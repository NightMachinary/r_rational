That makes sense. The style is more reminiscent of very early D&D, like the basic set and 1st Edition, where there aren't a lot of powerhouse characters. You also don't see a lot of the classes that came into the game later on, like Monks and Paladins (although they do have Rangers and Bards, so it's not entirely basic set stuff).
