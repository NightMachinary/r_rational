If we're being precise, /Mother of Learning/ is the standard D&D universe fused with fanon /Naruto/. The author has a previous story in that setting, and you can see some of the relics of that: shaping exercises vs. chakra control; the similarities between raw mana manipulation and raw chakra manipulation; and a few worldbuilding details that seem to be inspired by it, like bloodlines. If we're really stretching, we could draw a parallel between the primordials and the tailed beasts, but it's such a generic plot element that I'm not super confident about it. Obviously, that's not the only thing that /Mother of Learning/ inspiration from, but it's definitely a component.
