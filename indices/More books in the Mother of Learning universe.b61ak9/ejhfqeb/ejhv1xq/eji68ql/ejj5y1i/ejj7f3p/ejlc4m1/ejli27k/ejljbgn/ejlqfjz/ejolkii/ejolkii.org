I've read a lot of Naruto fanfics in the past two or three years (in addition to HP, Worm, etc.).

One of my favorite Naruto fanfics is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15406896][Hear the Silence]], which I highly recommend. It's an SI fic, but that really only used for perspective, and rapidly drops off after the first few chapters. There's a wide, detailed, amazingly done cast. It's before canon Naruto, and even then, it's clear that it's real life and more realistic than an anime could be. People die in it. It's the only Hurt/Comfort fic I've seen done well, and everything that happens makes a lot of sense. The plot progresses at just the right speed. It's actively updating.

It's definitely my most favorite actively updating Naruto fic, that's for sure. (Vs amazing fics like Sanitize, which has very slow updates.)

I'm the type of person whose favorite fic is MoL. But /everything/ about Hear the Silence is amazing. (I like it more than Chiaroscuro, though that's pretty good too.)

Please go read it. It's amazing.

(At some point I really need to look through all the fics I've read and get some solid recommendations I can copy and paste. I type out similar recs for Hear the Silence way too much.)
