Everything else recommended /here?/ Because there's a lot of Naruto fanfiction out there - the subreddit for it is [[/r/NarutoFanfiction]]. But off the top of my head, I enjoyed [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8611318/1/Chance-for-a-Prophecy][/Chance for a Prophecy/]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10857388/1/I-Am-NOT-Going-Through-Puberty-Again][/I Am NOT Going Through Puberty Again/]] for serious and comedic time-travel, although neither is rational. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7347955/1/Dreaming-of-Sunshine][/Dreaming of Sunshine/]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9255749/1/D%C3%A9j%C3%A0-vu-no-Jutsu][/Deja vu no Jutsu/]] are the two most popular self-insert stories, and I thought both of them were pretty neat. I want to stress that I haven't read the first two in a couple of years and the second two in about four years. There are a lot more that I read, not many of them I'd consider even okay by the standards I have now.
