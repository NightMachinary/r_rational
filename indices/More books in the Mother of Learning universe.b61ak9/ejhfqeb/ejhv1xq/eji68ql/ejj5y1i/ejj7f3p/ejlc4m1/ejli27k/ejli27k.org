It's generally well-known in Naruto fanfiction circles - especially back when it came out - for having an interesting premise and being the best out of a batch of Sasori-focused fanfiction. At that time Sasori was one of the more popular Akatsuki members because of the first arc of Shippuden. The officially translated Manga volumes of Shippuden dropped just three months before the first chapter of Scorpion's Disciple, so despite Sasori being the first to die, he was fresh in everyone's mind.

But if you weren't tuned into Naruto at the time, or only started reading fanfiction 2-3 years after it was abandoned, you probably wouldn't have heard of it.
