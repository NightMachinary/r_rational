A week later, this paper is still throwing me for a loop. Looking at this paper and its bibliography, it seems like physicists have gone a far way in deriving quantum equations from classical ones and accurately describing quantum phenomena in terms of classical mechanics. Does this mean quantum physics, at some point in the future, might be revealed to be a classical system? Or am I reading wayyy too far into this?
