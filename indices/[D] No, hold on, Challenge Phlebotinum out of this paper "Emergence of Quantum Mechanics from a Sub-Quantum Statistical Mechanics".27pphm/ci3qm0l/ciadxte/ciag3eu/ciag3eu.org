  Does this mean quantum physics, at some point in the future, might be revealed to be a classical system?

In a word? No. It's just not going to happen.

What these papers are doing is basically just like explaining electric circuits in terms of hydraulic circuits. It's an extremely useful analogy and you can certainly explain a whole bunch of electric behaviors in terms of flowing water. But it's just a analogy, the systems just happen to be similar in some ways. These researchers are saying, "Therefore, it is likely that electric circuits are actually composed of a classical sub-electric liquid."
