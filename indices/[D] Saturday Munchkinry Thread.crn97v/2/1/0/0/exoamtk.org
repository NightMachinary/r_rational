[for some reason it appears my comment wasn't saved, so I'm reposting]

Maybe you could justify it with something along the lines of how our body abstracts coordination of movement to a thought of what we want to happen. Either she has had/trained it long enough to develop the intuition, or there is a secondary intelligence that can mediate thoughts into precise control.

Can you give more clarifications on the ability though? Is it unlimited range? Can she set water to any velocity she likes? Can she forcefully retain or change its state (to ice/steam)? Can she control water in other people? What about plants? Does anyone else have water control like hers? Do other people have other abilities which interact with hers? What is the technology level of society (eg. can they harness infinite energy devices)? Any non-conventional goals (such as enemies to reverse-munchkin)? I only knew that she could sense foreign movements in her water particles after you gave examples that require them.

These parameters vastly change what can and can't be done. Limitations + objectives are what motivate creativity after all, and without giving them you increase the chance of getting unrelated or generic solutions.

Actually, play also motivates creativity, but cannot test out her ability for ourselves.

I like your munchkins though. Some more ideas

- She can leave water droplets on things/in people and track their movements. Droplets in the open may evaporate though.
- Hidden switches can contain some of her water. They can only be used by her, and if there is no distance limit, she can seal it permanently. (stolen from Mistborn)

  - can extend to arbitrary distance communication

- Anything along the lines of dispersing her water into a water supply. Even a gram contains some 3x10^22 molecules.

  - This could mean that any reserve tanks she has can contain a single drop of her water instead of the whole lot, for efficient access to water /anywhere./
  - A property like 'her water sticks together when not actively separated' can alleviate how OP this is

- She can use saliva to get water at any time if necessary. This means she never needs to get water by touching it, instead just sending over spit.
- Water is polar and she might be able to do something with magnetism, but I'm not sure exactly what the properties of aligned water molecules would be.
- Recycling waste water when needed is a given
