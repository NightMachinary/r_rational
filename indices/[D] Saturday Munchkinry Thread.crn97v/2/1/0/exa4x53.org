The 60x speed is for things like replicating exact shapes with her power and interpreting where her water is at a reasonable speed, not for exact molecular control. For example, she could make human silhouettes in the dark, or talk by creating vibrations or shaping her water into letters, and listen by feeling vibrations and recreating them by her ear. I'm also aware that the 60x speed is overpowered ignoring the water power, but that's pretty easy to figure out what to do with, so I'm asking about her water power.
