60x faster is not enough for perfect molecular control, as there would be ~2*10^27 molecules to control. On the other hand, 60x faster thinking is extremely overpowered regardless of what powers you do or do not have. The 60x speed doesn't really complement the water control enough to seem justified.

I'm going to assume that she has the ability to relinquish control over her water at will, or she would be a normal waterbender. A possible middle ground could be that she has to drop all her water at once if she wants to drop any.

If people touch water that you are controlling, then some of it will pass through their skin by osmosis, and you can very quickly take over the water in a person. Once you have water in a critical position (eg. the brain) you can relinquish control over the rest of the water in their body and divert your focus elsewhere.

In her place of residence, she can set up open water channels in numerous places that allow her powers quick access to any part. This can be for defense or for quality of life.

Can she control water vapour? If so, then she can fill spaces with water vapour to feel the presence of objects.

A water gun is a good weapon to have.

While swimming, she can manipulate the water pressure and movement around her to push her quickly in any direction. It would also be easy to move anyone or anything else which is in the water. She can move air bubbles around in the water to get herself oxygen. She can neutralise any attacking pressure waves. She can push away water contaminants. Light-based attacks can get through, but she can wear something to protect herself.
