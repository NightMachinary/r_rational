You know the portal gun is basically a wmd with that in mind. All you need is a vacuum chamber with a couple of portals and a retractable arm holding the rod. Once in hi vac you release the rod and retract the arm, and to unleash the weapon all you need is a drone with a portal surface and the portal gun pointed at it.

Even with a range limitation the whole setup can be transported via a pickup truck.
