Well, no, if you use a low tech solution your angle will be way more than a nanoradian off, and it won't do anything impressive /at all/. My number of 1000 m/s sideways movement per second for a 50kg rod means your control system needs to be exerting about 50kN of force on the rod, continuously. If you ever stop, the system will self-destruct within about a millisecond. If you never started, you wouldn't get up to a millionth the speed I was calculating with.

So how do you exert 50kN on a rod going .3% the speed of light? I imagine magnets would do something exotic at this speed, but if they work you'd only need, well, a top end MRI machine? Not exactly low-end tech either.

  Why would the starting location be destroyed?

I was actually mixing things up originally, so you're better off than I thought, but note that as soon as the object hits the new portal and touches the air behind it, that air is going to do extreme physics things which will come back through the portal. If the rod lands remotely close to the opening, that impact energy is also going to rush through the portal.
