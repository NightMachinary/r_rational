Here's a "superpowered" character to munchkin.

Name: Barbara Roberts

The character is a slender, young woman of average height with long blond hair. Whenever she dresses up as a member of any "profession" and surrounds herself with suitable props, she can perform the duties of that profession at the median skill level of the people who get paid to do it. This only works if people can recognize the profession she is trying to dress as just by looking at her - wearing a generic pantsuit is not enough to pass as a lawyer, for example, unless the rest of the context of the situation would let people immediately identify her as such without anyone speaking.

Some subtleties / Required Secondary Powers (or lack thereof):

Anyone who checks her credentials will find that she is qualified and licensed to do whatever she's dressed as, but she will not magically have an employer or any required insurance. (For example, if she dresses as a surgeon, she'll have the skills and credentials of one and magically be licenced to practice medicine, but she can't just walk into a hospital and start operating without having been hired and getting appropriate malpractice insurance.)

Being granted skills will NOT affect her physical strength and stamina. Being a slender young woman will limit her ability to perform duties that require physical strength; having the skills of the median professional boxer probably won't let her fight outside of her weight class, for example.

Ideas?
