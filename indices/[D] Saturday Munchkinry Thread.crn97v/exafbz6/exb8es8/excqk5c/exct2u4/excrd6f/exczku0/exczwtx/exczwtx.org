I meant "the average of a population whose values are all zero" (e.g, the set [0, 0, 0, 0...] - every human in the profession "witch" has zero magical ability) not "the average of an empty population" (e.g, the set [] - there are no humans with the profession "witch").

The average of an empty set is not a number.

Of course, that could lead to some really interesting bugs in the power - what happens if you dress up as a witch, and there's no magic? Do you have =NaN= magical ability now? How does that interact with the world?
