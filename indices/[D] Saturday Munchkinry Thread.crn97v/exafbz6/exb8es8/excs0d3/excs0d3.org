  I suppose Barbara would be useful as an astronaut on long-range missions, because she would be an expert in any situation that might come up.

Similarly, with a nice outfit she could pass as a "consultant" fairly easily, and thus be a medium expert in whatever her current context is.

Really, any outfit that makes people think you're omni-capable (lab coat, suit, astronaut outfit, uniform, any of the above plus hardhat and clipboard, etc...) would likely result in being non-specifically capable.
