I suppose Barbara would be useful as an astronaut on long-range missions, because she would be an expert in any situation that might come up.

Someone who studies two related fields can steal useful ideas from each to the other. She could be the best ever at this.

Does what she gets depend on the people who look at her? If, say, a mathematician looks at her writing on a blackboard while she's dressed as a mathematician, he could think from her writings that she specializes in algebra. Would she then get algebra knowledge?
