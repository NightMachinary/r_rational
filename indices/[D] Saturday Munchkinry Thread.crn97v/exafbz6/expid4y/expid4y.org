If I were Barbara, I'd have a few costumes to wear on a daily basis that grant me useful skills when I'm not aiming at anything specific. I'd probably have "krav maga instructor," "policewoman," and "olympic sprinter" as my basic three, and then have things like "trauma doctor," "scientist/historian in [x] field," "psychoanalyst," etc. on standby.

How specific can she get? If she dresses in a lab coat and carries around a box of ocean sampling tools, does she get "median scientist" or "median oceanographer"?
