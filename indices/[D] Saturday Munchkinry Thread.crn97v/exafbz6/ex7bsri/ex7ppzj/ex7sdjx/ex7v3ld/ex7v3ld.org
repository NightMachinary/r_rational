The range limit of apparition in Harry Potter seems to be the distance between continents, like we see movements across hundreds of miles in the books, but Rowling mentions that it gets increasingly harder across larger distances and that only few wizards could apparate across continents.

It also doesn't necessarily require visualizing, Its mentioned that either visualizing or knowledge of the location are required, so probably knowing where a place is should be enough to apparate their as long its not too far away.

this is from Rowlings website.

  Apparition becomes increasingly risky over long distances. As with most magic, much depends on the skill of the spell-caster: Apparition requires knowledge of the terrain to which one is moving, or the ability to visualise it clearly. Cross-continental Apparition would almost certainly result in severe injury or death.
