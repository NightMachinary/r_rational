Sounds like it is possible to do. The height would have to be from orbit. There is high (36,000km from Earth's surface) , medium (20,200km) and low orbit (which the article I'm reading doesn't specify).

Seeing as no one has launched rods from god and physics isn't my strong suit I can't tell you what the optimal height is. The best bet would be high orbit with the densest and largest thing that the teleportation method in question can move.

As for application with a limited one mile radius (With the safe guard that you won't telefrag and assuming you can take people/objects with you).

- Delivery, taxi, ferrying, bodyguarding service

- Busting people out of prison

- Going into locations with valuable information or items

Harry Potter Apparition has a range limit but it's never specified what the range is. Only that if your determined and can visualize the end location well enough that it will succeed. So like eh
