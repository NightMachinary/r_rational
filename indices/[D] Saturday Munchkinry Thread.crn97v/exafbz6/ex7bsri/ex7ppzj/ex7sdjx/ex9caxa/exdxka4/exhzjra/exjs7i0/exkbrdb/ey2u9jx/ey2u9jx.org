Every material changes shape on nm scale based on some external stimuli. Heat is most well known for that but for this I'd choose something that responds to an applied electric current. A pair of optic sensors (similar to a camera) captures the direction of acceleration and the current (or heat, of we must) is applied to adjust the angle to accelerate back toward the center.\\
Modern control theory can easily keep the rod's position within the generous tolerance of the portal.

As for the air rushing in due to breaking the seal, I've watched that happen to industrial equipment. The truck might bounce a bit. Good steel can handle the impact. Since this is a normal part of the weapon's operation placing some crumple zone material underneath the chamber to absorb most of the impact ought to be part of the design.\\
The rod would deflect some, like a bullet being shot into water, but considering the typical altitude of a drone and the expected size of the targeted area it's not going to deflect enough to matter.

These are all engineering problems, not reasons why the concept wouldn't work.
