This is a really interesting idea but it's going to take a lot of work, and you're not going to be putting it in a truck. If the portals are even nanometres misaligned from being perfectly parallel, you have issues.

Assume the portals are 1m apart and 1m wide. After 24h, the rod will be travelling about 0.3% the speed of light, or 1,000,000 m/s. If one side of the top portal is 1 nanometre higher than the other, the angle, too, is a nanoradian off. Thus after a second, or a million passes through the portal, the rod will have turned a full milliradian. Multiply back through, and that translates to a sideways velocity of 1000m/s.

Let's say you can get this difference down consistently to a handful of picometres. Your limit would be about a 24h charge, to a velocity of 1,000,000 m/s. If your accelerated object is 50kg, the resulting energy is approximately that of Little Boy.

On top of angle misalignment, you have translation misalignment, which is approximately as bad.

Note also that when you close a portal, the location from which the rod is shot will be similarly annihilated.
