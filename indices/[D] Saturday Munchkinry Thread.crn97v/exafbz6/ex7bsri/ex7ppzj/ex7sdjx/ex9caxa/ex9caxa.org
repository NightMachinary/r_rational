At ‘short' distances, energy is mass × g (10 m/s²) × height. This will work fine up to, say, low-Earth orbit. It's not very impressive.

At longer distances, you care about the total size of the potential energy well of Earth, which is GM/r (gravitational constant × mass of Earth × radius of Earth), or ~60 MJ/kg, or about 1 ton of TNT per 100kg dropped. This is particularly unimpressive given the force will not be transferred as an explosion, but mostly wasted in the atmosphere (as the object disintegrates) or, if the object is strong and aerodynamic, also dispersed into the ground. The object will be travelling around 11 km/s ignoring all friction. One ton of matter would equate to just 0.1% the energy of Little Boy, the nuclear weapon that hit Hiroshima.

In the video Tom Scott talks about giving yourself downward momentum using your superpower... only he says ‘a few hundred miles per hour downwards', which is about 1% of what gravity will already give you, so doesn't itself matter to the end result.

In real life, these weapons have been envisioned as bunker busters, not for large scale destruction. They act like very large, very fast bullets, not like grenades, and that's what they're good for. But as a superhero you'll be completely incapable of aiming them, so they're even pointless at that.

This particular proposal is a peeve of mine because Marked for Death players kept proposing it. They finally seem to have let it rest, though ;).

The ‘drop things through magnets to make energy' thing is also pretty silly.
