Sure thing!

I got the numbers by plugging in to these [[https://www.omnicalculator.com/physics/kinetic-energy][kinetic energy]] and [[https://www.omnicalculator.com/physics/free-fall][free fall]] calculators. The number for gasoline is from [[https://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/ArthurGolnik.shtml][here]].

Note that if you burn a hydrocarbon like gasoline, it consumes more than twice its mass in oxygen to form CO2 and H2O. Depending on the hydrogen to carbon ratio this will be between 1:8 (pure hydrogen) and 3:8 (pure carbon). So if you want a wizarding rocket, you might want to adapt a bubblehead charm to get out of needing those heavy oxidizer tanks.
