I have a character in a story I'm writing with a power that would be interesting to munchkin. She can control water. Specifically, she can add any water to the water she's controlling either by touching it herself, or touching it with the water she's controlling. The maximum amount of water she can control at once is equal to her own body mass. She can set the exact velocity of every molecule of water under her control, and her brain perceives time 60 times slower to handle this. How can you munchkin this?

EDIT: Just to clarify, she can drop control of any of her water at will. She can also control water within her body, and water vapor.
