"She can set the exact velocity of every molecule of water under her control"

So she can control the temperature of her water, creating ice and steam? Plasma?

How much force can she exert on the water? Is there an equal and opposite force exerted on her as a result? Could she strap some water bottles onto a harness for flight? Pressurized water lasers?

Depending on how dense water vapor in the air has to be to qualify as something she can control, she could potentially create very large areas in which she can take control of any water source ... hopefully, she can't control water in other peoples' bodies or else you're looking at blood bending that doesn't even require line of sight.

When you say water, are you talking h2o molecules only? If so, you could probably purify water with the ability. Is it possible to manipulate h2o without separating the molecules from whatever impurities were mixed with it? If so you could work with potentially flammable, acidic, or poisonous additives, which might not count towards the total weight of water you control. Mix your water with sawdust, then whenever you turn it into ice you'll get pykrete which is as strong as concrete and it floats.

edit: you could probably create magnifying and telescopic lenses as well. A cursory Google search indicates there might be some metamaterials you could produce with water. Generating sound should be possible as well.
