She can cook food by rapidly heating water in contact with it.

If she can sense water, she can use this to spy on people; maintain a long but very thin line of water from her to her target, and sense the movement of their own internal body water.

Does she expand the amount of water she can control by gaining more mass?

By refusing to permit the molecules on the surface to move, she can make liquid water act like a solid - either as a shield or a club is straightforward. Depending on how thin she can make the edge, she might even be able to manage a monomolecular knife edge.

Can she break conservation of energy, or does the energy she imparts into the water have to come from somewhere? How much force can she apply with water?
