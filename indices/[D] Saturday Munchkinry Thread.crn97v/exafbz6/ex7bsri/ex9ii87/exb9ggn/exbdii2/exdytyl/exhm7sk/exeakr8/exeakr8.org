So I may be missing something, but what downside is there to choosing an item, other than no longer being able to pick an item? What does lack of a soul actually do? When you die are you guaranteed to go to hell, or is it something else?

Really the Ring, Gun, and possibly the locket are the strongest choices.

The locket really only if it works on the demon to give you the other items.

The Gun and the Ring, it's obvious for both. Gun is less effort but distasteful, Ring is more work but greater benefit. Gun is less risky in some ways, but if you choose the ring you're gambling on being able to figure out immortality whereas with the gun it's guaranteed.

The Ring changes your personality, so I might go for the gun. Just gotta be careful not to get caught. Then again, maybe I'd choose the ring. It's a tough choice.
