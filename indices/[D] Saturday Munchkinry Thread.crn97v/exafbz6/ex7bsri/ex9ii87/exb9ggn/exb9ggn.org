A bit old, but I feel like this is ripe for munchkinry.

As a secondary challenge, reverse munchkin the Gun of Wrath, with or without the other sins. Condition: You know that the wrath wielder exists, but not who.

Modifications:

- Ring of Pride specifically helps memory retention and recall, motivation and confidence. You will not forget skills. It won't directly improve your learning speed, but perfect memory will mean that identical repetition to memorise a concept is not required.
- Locket of lust will affect people at your will, to a degree of your choosing (still has to be opposite sex (not an equal opportunity sin)). It doesn't give you control over how they will react.
