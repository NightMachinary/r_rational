Well, the higher you get from earth the less gravity. But at shorter distances say 200km, you can approximate it by acceleration at 1 gee or 10 m/s^{2.} So an object falling 200km will fall for 200 seconds, and be going at 2000 m/s if we ignore the atmosphere. The amount of energy contained there is about 2 MJ/kg, which is under a tenth of what gasoline contains when you burn it. If you change that to 2 km, it's only 20,000 J/kg, 1/100th of that. So a 1 mile drop won't be very efficient compared to 100+ mile. But if you can do it with extremely massive objects, it can still be quite dangerous.

Note that bombardment from orbit is much more energy per unit mass. 8 km/s is 32 MJ/kg, nearly the same as gasoline (45 MJ/kg).
