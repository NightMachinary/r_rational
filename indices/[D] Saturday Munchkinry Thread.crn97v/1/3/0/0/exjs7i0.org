You sound like you're naysaying my idea but all I hear is "this is even more effective than I said." No need to relocate, the truck will self detonate if you use a low tech solution. Otherwise you need to make the rod self-centering in some way. Of course passive control systems have been around for a century for that purpose (controlling the position of an object) with ongoing incremental improvement but we can use active ones if we really need to to really get that rod moving back to the center whenever it starts to drift.

Why would the starting location be destroyed? That's clearly a challenge that would need to be solved to build a portal gun in the first place.
