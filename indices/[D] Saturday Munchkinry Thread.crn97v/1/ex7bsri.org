I was watching a YouTube video that showed what one could do with teleportation. In it the person talks about teleporting and using a tungsten rod to destroy a city. I understand the idea of kinetic bombardment but would that actually be possible or would the teleported have to "rev" it up? Mostly I'm just wondering if the teleported has to drop the tungsten rod from up high (and if so how high?) or do they have to speed it up. [[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zJt8yzR2aoY][Here is the video in question]] I can quite make out what he says when he starts talking about destroying a city and how to do it. Finally what munchkinery besides in the video is possible if teleportation is limited to one mile aka Harry Potter Apparition? Thanks for reading!
