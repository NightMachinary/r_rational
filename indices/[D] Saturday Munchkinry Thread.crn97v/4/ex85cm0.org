I'm curious how you guys think Earth magic could be exploited. For the purposes of this post, let's say Earth magic allows you to move molecules of anything so long as their initial distance from each other (at the time of you applying your magic to them) is close enough that they qualify as a solid. Once you have suffused the solid with your magic, you can then move the molecules however you like. You can't actually control the molecules individually, but you can separate the material enough to create sand/dust, condense them to create stone(or some other solid), or vibrate/still groups of molecules to alter the temperature of the substance. Think of it like water benders changing water into mist, steam, ice, and snow. The one main rule is that you can't put earth magic into something already occupied with magic, and all macroscopic living organisms contain magic. I'm also interested in both how people and some entity like an Endbringer with superhuman intelligence might exploit this. Various ideas I've been toying with:

-*Bone Conduction* by placing a relatively small piece of earth near someone's temple and vibrating it, earth users could pass sounds directly into another person's inner ear.

-*Dry Quicksand*: I know blowing air up through sand or loose gravel can cause its properties to function like that of a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCiIUjPF060][liquid]]. Seems like the cause of this is more room between the grains of sand which should be replicable with earth magic. Could be pretty useful for traps and moving underground.

-*Laser*: making a bootleg laser out of a bunch of large magnifying glasses all directed at the same point.

-*Glass Dust Poison*: coating glass dust in poison might help the poison get into the bloodstream through small cuts in the lungs and throat.

-*Generate Electricity*: moving permanent magnets around conductive materials to induce a current.

-*Resonance*: Vibrating the earth beneath someone's feet could result in many of the same effects as sound-based resonance techniques.

-*Dust*: if you can sense the location of your magic relative to yourself, you could probably use clouds of dust and the way they are displaced by things in the environment as a sort of poor man's echolocation. Depending on how precisely you can sense the movements, you could place dust on someones face to help with lip-reading or noticing microexpression (with enough practice).

-*Lava*: vibrate the molecules of a solid to heat it to the point of it melting.

-*Freezing*: stilling the molecules of a solid to cool the object. Not really sure how useful this would be.

-*Metamaterial*: Are there any particularly useful metamaterials that could be produced with earth magic? Super lenses? Graphene?
