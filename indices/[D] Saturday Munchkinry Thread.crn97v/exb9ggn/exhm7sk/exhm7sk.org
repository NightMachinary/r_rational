The wallet can wipe a credit card free of debt, thats ridiculously more powerful than the 1000 usd a year. Get a credit card with a high limit, buy lots of stuff, rinse and repeat. For a simple infinite money hack you buy stocks, shares, equity, or other easily resellable commodities.

(There is a limit to this though since it is seemingly creating the money from nothing, so effectively causing inflation, provided you kept the number low enough it didn't alter the overall money supply noticeably its not a huge problem.) /edit/ or you can weaponise it to crash a currency
