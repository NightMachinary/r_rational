I was actually thinking about an 'and-i-show-you-how-deep-the-rabbit-hole-goes' scenario, where the locket may be the only semi-reliable defense against someone with the gun.

If we consider objectives other than immortality (say you are highly confident that it's either impossible in your lifetime, or almost guaranteed to exist), the glasses and watch are also ridiculously powerful. For an unambitious person, the flask and wallet are extremely useful, practically guaranteeing an easy life.

I think the most interesting feature of this line up is that they are items, so they can be shared or stolen.
