  : if you can sense the location of your magic relative to yourself, you could probably use clouds of dust and the way they are displaced by things in the environment as a sort of poor man's echolocation. Depending on how precisely you can sense the movements, you could place dust on someones face to help with lip-reading or noticing microexpression (with enough practice).

This makes me wonder how super senses in general are supposed to work. It kinda feels like people's imaginations are so dominated by vision that they default to imagine a master at an alternative sense using it as close to exactly like vision as they can suspend disbelief for. However, vision takes up huge amounts of neural real-estate. Skitter's bug-senses have a shard of an extradementional demigod to handle the processing. I have not heard of studies finding that human echolocators repurpose unused visual cortex matter for echolocation, but it'd be more interesting if this were not the case, and echolocation is still far less detailed than vision (between the serialization of hearing compared to sight's mass parallelization, and the shenanigans that it would take to echolocate a visible mote of dust, never mind the different properties of sound and light, the difference will almost always be significant).

So I have to wonder how this sort of thing works neurologically. Is magic handled by magic that has an independent system that doesn't care about brainspace? Does it repurpose your least-used neurons for the job? I know people in real life have given themselves new senses, such as with implanted magnets, and adapt to those pretty quickly, so I can see it going either way, until we get to the truly impressive stuff that normally takes a large cortex to resolve. I kinda want to come up with a way to give people senses that could potentially give highly detailed information, and see how far they can take it and what it does to their brains, but this is starting to sound like the origin story of a supervillain.
