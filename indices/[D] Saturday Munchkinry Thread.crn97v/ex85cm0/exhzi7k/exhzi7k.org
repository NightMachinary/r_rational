Land combat against you would become impossible, because you can alter the hardness and stiffness of the ground at will.

You can probably make powerful airguns by making pockets of air aboveground, shifting them downwards, and squeezing with your power then expelling it through channels made through the power. This gives a lot of versatility and air combat potential.

If you can think fast enough, you can probably make an army of earth golems that go to combat with you. Also what about making the battlefield a maze of earth structures.
