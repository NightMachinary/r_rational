You think I'm over-analyzing the part about Momo's brother's (I don't think we've been told his name) recklessness? I'm not sure if there's an explanation as to why he would move with such disregard other then the reason I mentioned.

3 in the linked post there does point out something awkward. I did not consider that Seto could have OK's Momo's brother's plan although it does make sense. However, that post points out that Kano and Seto could have created a more controlled distraction rather then rely on Momo's brother. The problem is that this implies that Momo wanted a distraction which I don't think she did. Sato, Kano, and Momo's brother could have done nothing, except wait for the right time to release the monitors, and the plan would have still worked.
