I made [[http://thingswhichborepeople.blogspot.com/2018/07/state-of-writing-2018.html][an updated inventory]] of writing projects, which was more depressing than helpful or enlightening. Reading some of the old, semi-abandoned projects is really frustrating, because it's often when I'm at the point where I'm actually invested in what's going to happen that the story just comes to a screeching halt - and unlike when I'm reading something that's hit the in-progress point, there's no more coming unless I write it, and no one to blame but myself.

When rereading things that I've mostly forgotten, I tend to make a bunch of notes when I get to the end, comments on the middle, minor edits for things that make no sense, or I add to the notes that are already there, if I'm not in the mood to actually add on more prose. There are some projects that have seen steady progress made on them over the years, because I add bits and pieces to them every now and then. That's my primary reason for keeping those things around, in addition to the fact that I'm a hoarder.
