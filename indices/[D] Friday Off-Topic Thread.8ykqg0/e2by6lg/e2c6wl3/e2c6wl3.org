On a similar note, I'd also be curious to hear book recommendations for baby's first intro to the philosophy of science. I haven't engaged with the field much since ugrad (in a few elective epistemology classes and occasional forays on my own) and am curious to get back into it (specifically, this morning I saw [[https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/8ykq66/cambridge_university_embedded_three_philosophy/][this thread]] and recalled an observation an old friend of mine made regarding how naive and mistaken most practicing scientists were with respect to their views on PoS). Was thinking I'd start up a reading group this upcoming quarter since I can imagine a few peers might be interested, too.

Currently leaning towards Okasha's /Very Short Introduction/ followed by Hacking's /Representing and Intervening/, but am curious what people here think.

As for OP's question -- I think popsci serves as a great springboard (and enjoyed Sagan, Dawkins, Hawking, etc. when I read them in secondary) but it's hard to beat a good textbook + review papers for learning about a field's fundamentals. I've only read a few of the former these last years but have found them a bit lacking when it comes to robustness and detail of argument.
