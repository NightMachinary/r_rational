  Ferverently devout cartographers, for their god ensuring them perpetual employment and relevance. The Cartographer's guild would actually be really powerful, because up to date maps would be worth their weight in gold.

  I think raising animals would be a safer choice than farming, if the landscape changes so much. The animals would be happy to move to newly created land and eat the grass there, while you can't move fields of wheat. This would create more incentives to steal farm animals, ranchers would be aggressive to outsiders and rather territorial, high crime...

Good point. I'm not sure animal husbandry alone can support a particularly high population density though.
