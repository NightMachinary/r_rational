Antitheists, railing against a god that has abandoned them in favor of geography.

Ferverently devout cartographers, for their god ensuring them perpetual employment and relevance. The Cartographer's guild would actually be really powerful, because up to date maps would be worth their weight in gold.

Various cities would be abandoned as the local geography changes. If you have a port city that suddenly can't access the ocean, or if a major trade route gets cut off by new mountains, then it can't persist at its current size.

Plucky adventurors would be liable to go looking for said newly created natural wonders in search of profit. Not if it's just pretty scenery, but something like caverns of rare gems and ore would be profitable.

Border skirmishes between neighboring factions would be super common, because the geography changing could alter the balance of power occasionally. If there's a new river 10 miles into your neighbor's territory, that's a good reason to attempt to expand to the next choke point.

Logging would be easy if trees are continually being created.

I think raising animals would be a safer choice than farming, if the landscape changes so much. The animals would be happy to move to newly created land and eat the grass there, while you can't move fields of wheat. This would create more incentives to steal farm animals, ranchers would be aggressive to outsiders and rather territorial, high crime...

Are new animal species being created? Could have more domesticated species than we do IRL if so.

Weather patterns would be all over the place, if mountains can just spring up whenever. Last year's climate wouldn't be very indicative of the current year's climate, and deserts and forests would be popping up and disappearing all over the place as rainfall patterns change.
