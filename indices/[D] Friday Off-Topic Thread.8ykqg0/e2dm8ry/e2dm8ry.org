Watched "A place further than the universe" anime. It was amazing and touching. Other anime I've watched, which produced big emotional reactions from me:

- March comes in like a lion
- Log Horizon
- Baby steps
- Haikyuu!!
- Toradora! (good if you ignore over-the-top tsundere actions)

I hope you watch them, and also hope you would recommend something similar :)
