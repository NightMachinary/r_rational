"A Place Further Than The Universe" was nothing short of amazing! It was a really moving show. If you want to watch something else that's deep and emotional, with complex thinking characters, I'd suggest the wonderful "Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinju". An absolute masterpiece. If instead "plucky girls camping out in a cold environment" was the best aspect of SoraYori for you XD, check out "Yuru Camp", which came out the same season and it's chill and comfy as fuck. You know that wonderful feeling of being warm and tuckered in bed, possibly with a hot chocolate, while outside it's icy? This anime is that in distilled, concentrated form, for 12 episodes.
