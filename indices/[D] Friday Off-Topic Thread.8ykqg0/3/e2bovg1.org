Protip: If you've already used up all of your 100 slots for filtering subreddits out of your [[/r/all][r/all]], you can filter EVEN MORE subreddits by using custom CSS (through, /e. g./, [[https://github.com/openstyles/stylus][the Stylus browser extension]]). You also can use this method to eliminate all links that use Reddit's atrocious video hosting. For example:

#+begin_example
  div[data-subreddit="boottoobig"],div[data-subreddit="DadReflexes"]{display:none;}/*This is case-sensitive*/
  div[data-domain="v.redd.it"]{display:none;}
#+end_example

Submissions that are hidden in this fashion still will take up spots in your [[/r/all][r/all]] ([[https://i.imgur.com/fcNj24p.png][example]]), but they'll be invisible as long as you keep the custom CSS rule active, so you can just go to your Reddit preferences and increase the number of submissions shown per page. If your /entire/ [[/r/all][r/all]] is hidden, just disable your custom CSS, click the "hide" button on each objectionable submission, reÃ«nable your custom CSS, and refresh the page.

[[http://alicorn.elcenia.com/][Alicorn]] (the author of [[http://luminous.elcenia.com/][the illustrious /Luminosity/ series]]) recently published [[http://alicorn.elcenia.com/stories/exaltation.shtml][a cute little story]]. It reminds me of when I first discovered FanFiction.Net (circa 2011, before the site had implemented sorting by favorites and by reviews) and searched, not for [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][awesome]] [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6207715][adventure]] [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3745099][stories]], but for [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Fluff]["fluffy"]] NaruHina romance.

(The foregoing paragraph should not be interpreted as expressing approval or condemnation toward the story. My opinion of it is merely neutral: I give it three stars out of five.)
