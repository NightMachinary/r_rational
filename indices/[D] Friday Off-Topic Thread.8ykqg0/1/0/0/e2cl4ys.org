I usually think of this situation by noting that there is no inherent virtue in finishing things -- it's entirely a function of how the payoff changes as you get closer to completion.

For something like this, it's probably subject to pretty normal diminishing marginal returns, so maybe you're better off reading all the greatest hits first, and only then hitting the less famous ones. You gain more value at a faster rate, and lose less when you eventually get tired of it.
