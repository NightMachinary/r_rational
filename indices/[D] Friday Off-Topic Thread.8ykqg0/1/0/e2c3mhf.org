I'm a fan of Oliver Sacks, and have been slowly making my way through his bibliography. There's a lot of explaining neurological concepts, but it's all done through fascinating case studies, which makes it feel sort of like if House M.D. were trying to teach you medicine along the way. /The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat/ is probably his most famous. I'm running into what I call the Greatest Hits problem with him, though, in that I'm delving into the stuff that he's not as well known for, and predictably, it's of a somewhat lower quality. This happens whenever I start a deep dive on an author, and it's sort of a question of what the bailing out point is.
