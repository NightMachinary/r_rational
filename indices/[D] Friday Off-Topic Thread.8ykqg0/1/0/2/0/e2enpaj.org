/An Anthropologist on Mars/ is a pretty similar collection of medical stories, mostly dealing with bizarre presentations.

/The Island of the Colorblind/ is sort of about perception, and has a little bit more of a travelogue feel to it, since it's about a particular period in his life.

And /Awakenings/ is about a bunch of people who fell into a "sleeping sickness" around WWI and were near-totally cured by a drug (administered by Sacks) in 1969.
