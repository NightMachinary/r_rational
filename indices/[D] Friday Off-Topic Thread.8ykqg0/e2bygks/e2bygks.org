Today's surprising yet wholesome internet discovery is the fan theory that the protagonist of Danny Phantom is a trans boy because the clone Vlad made was female with no explanation besides the trope of “weird cartoon science”. That theory.....actually makes some sense....and adds an interesting layer to Danny's character that kind of ties into the underlying themes of the show. Hear me out.

Danny Phantom is a fairly typical superhero fantasy about a dorky teenage boy who gets bullied at school, but transforms into the archetypal knight in shining armor he's always wanted to be. Reoccurring plot points include Danny's insecurity over his masculinity, dealing with social stigma at school, and learning to reciprocate the unconditional support he gets from his friends and family.

Doesn't all of that become way more interesting, and less of an example of normalized patriarchal culture, if the hero is trans? I always found Danny to be kind of a boring male archetype who, for some reason, everyone was either irrationally forgiving of or irrationally rude to, but this fan theory turns that into a social satire of the (sometimes cartoonish) challenges of living the life you want and being accepted for who you are.
