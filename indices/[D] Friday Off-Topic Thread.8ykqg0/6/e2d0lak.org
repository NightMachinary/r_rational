Came up with yet another cool premise I'm not sure I'll be able to do justice.

#+begin_quote
  It is the Second Age, and while God still takes an interest in his world, he no longer takes an interest in his people. His hand passes over the flat earth, and grandiose mountains and forests rise in its wake, unique natural wonders conjured from a divine architect. But divinity does not feed hungry bellies, and to the fragmentary, upstart civilizations that inhabit the world, mountains are no replacement for farmland.

(I know, this is worldbuilding thread stuff, but I only came up with it today and I don't want to wait.)

What kinds of plots would you like to see in this world? I actually have a pretty good idea of what the "main" plot is, but I like having peripheral plots happening offscreen to give stories a sense of scale and grandeur that the main plot doesn't need to carry alone.
