How about a city called The Caravan that doesn't stay in one place? Merchants come and go, and the city often fragments and re-fuses as it explores new terrain. All merchants want to set up shop in the thick of things, so predicting (or trying to direct) where the city is going would be an important skill.

New mountains would have new minerals, maybe there are mining camps like The Caravan, or even associated with it.
