Yep. It was fun, and I loved how the admins got involved. Some decent content got produced. I especially liked how one of the mods got banned as a sacrifice like Gamora.

I'm not gonna subscribe to inthesoulstone though. The thanos memes were fun, but I was already getting tired of them by the end. Probably would have unsubbed even if I wasn't snapped.
