Not that sport can't spark violence itself sometimes... in Italy we had years when every Sunday meant tiny riots around stadiums all over the country. But I digress.

Yeah, anyway, that sort of balance is what I mean. A bit of randomness can be overcome by skill and make it shine. Too much just makes you feel a good player is being dragged down unfairly. All I meant is that, even among rather popular sports, soccer has such a difficult scoring mechanism it makes it even more likely that some random event changes the course of a match. Think a referee giving a penalty. It's going to be a way more momentous decision than a basketball player getting free shots. There are referees who are still bitterly hated, years later, for such decisions that were deemed wrong (check out some guy called Moreno who refereed Italy-South Korea in 2002...). You could argue that the drama is part of the attractive of the sport, in a morbid way, but this kind of stuff makes it also potentially more toxic.
