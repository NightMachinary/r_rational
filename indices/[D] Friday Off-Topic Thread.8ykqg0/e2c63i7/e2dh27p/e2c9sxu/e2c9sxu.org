My recommendation: Do not read your unfinished work until you're ready to start working on it again. The repetition and familiarity always makes me feel exhausted, even when I love what I've got, because it reminds me of how intricate things were getting and how much more I have left to do. When I'm motivated that can be the push I need, but when I'm just fishing around and feeling guilty it's super discouraging.

Worse yet, rereading can crystallize that sense of hopelessness by locking me in the parts of the story that already exist rather than inspiring me to brainstorm its future. I feel, with reasonable evidence, that the more I reread something I've abandoned the less likely I am to return to it.

If I'm genuinely looking for forward momentum on something old, my most successful trick is to write crappy stream-of-consciousness fanfiction of it:

- Some interaction between minor characters that happened offscreen, or might in the future!
- Unnecessary flashbacks!
- Alternate versions of existing scenes with somebody making different decisions!
- A wild character from some other story (my own and the greater canon) appears!
- Gratuitous shipping!

It's terrible stuff. No focus on crafting efficient language, consistent worldbuilding, or plot legibility. It also makes me fall in love with the original ideas, people, and environments I'd invented all over again. Really chips away at the inertia and, better yet, adds depth to my understanding of what I want for the work.

Nothing irritates the oyster like a bad example.

The hardest part is letting the fanfiction be genuinely terrible. It's also the thing that melts the crystals.
