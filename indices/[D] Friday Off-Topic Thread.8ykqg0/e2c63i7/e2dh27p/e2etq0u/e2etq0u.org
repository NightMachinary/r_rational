Oh, I /do/ like it, don't get me wrong. There have been some projects I've completed and I get to the end thinking "the structural problems with this are so severe that I'm going to have to rewrite from scratch". For DWoD, it's more like ... I don't know, looking at a pile of work which will result in it becoming the thing I meant it to be? I was reading through it the other day, and happy enough with it, but it /does/ need to get to a second draft state.
