I really liked reading /The Ascent of Man/, and I also recommend /The Power of Habit/. Not only is it interesting to read, it's also genuinely useful if you have habits of your own you want to change. More than that, it changes your perspective on a lot of things so that you see how and why other people/groups/organisations form habits and how they're self-perpetuating.
