I know Dawkins has a book called The Magic of Reality that I believe is aimed at children. Not entirely sure how literal you mean "baby's first intro to PoS", but I think he's generally a good author, so maybe start looking there. I think Sagan also does a good job with conveying the philosophy of science, The Demon Haunted World touches on it a good bit, but it's been long enough from when I read his other books that I couldn't say if any of his books really focuses on it.

Textbooks represent rather large investments of time, and are rather dry reading. I'm personally limited by my attention span, and don't always have an interest in diving deeply into a subject, so textbooks aren't always a great option for me personally. That said, I do intend to finish reading a textbook on astronomy that I have, and later to read through some calculus and probability/statistics books. Kind of low priority at this moment, however.
