I'd love to see some decent genderfluid and non-binary representation, though comic!Loki is pretty awesome. There was a recent Disney cartoon that lasted a single season called SheZow about a boy who turns into a female superhero, but it was even less progressive or representative of LGBT people than the one you describe.

The beauty I find in the Danny Phantom idea is that it is related to the themes of the show, but isn't the focus of the plot. The question of Danny's gender is settled and all his loved ones support him unconditionally, the only thing that matters is his life from now on and how he interacts with other people. This is just as compelling, if not more so, if he's a trans boy.

His superhero persona isn't any different from him, it just gives him the chance to do things and earn respect he's always wanted but never been able to without the same social stigma he usually faces. Its a narrative that can apply universally, particularly for teenagers, but is especially empowering for people who aren't the “default protagonist”.

There are theories like this for other characters like Jimmy Neutron, but this is the one that I think fits with what the show was actually about. That's on top of how well it fits into the canon, like how Danny was the only guy at a pool party in a tank top and is sometimes drawn with a chest that sticks out slightly.

There is one episode where he is depicted shirtless with a flat chest, but trans men have pointed out that's not unusual /at all/ and the episode is about him trying to build up muscle because he's insecure. I can totally see this character as a well written trans man, which is a big deal to me because I always found the character to be a generic male hero doing generic male hero things, but this theory makes that the whole point.
