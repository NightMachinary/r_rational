  “And so HE spoke: ‘There will be no disease or age or injury or death. The fields will provide food without work, and without end. The rains will be plentiful and regular. Those lost to you will be found once more.'” “So [NAME 1] asked. ‘If you reward all men in the afterlife, why, then, are we forced to live with these evils in the current one?'”

  “And GOD replied. ‘You're not.' Thus spoke GOD to [NAME 2], his penultimate proclamation.”
