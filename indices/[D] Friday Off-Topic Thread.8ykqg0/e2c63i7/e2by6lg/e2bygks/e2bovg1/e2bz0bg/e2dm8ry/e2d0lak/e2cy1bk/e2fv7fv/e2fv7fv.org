Random thought solicited by the end of the Soccer World Cup that I had already some time ago (even wrote a joke paper about it): soccer definitely is /not/ a rational sport. Scores is too low, random fluctuations and refereeing mistakes can seriously offset the outcome of a match, when paired with a direct elimination tournament format it's basically only marginally better than simply giving the Cup to one random team out of 16. Unless a team is consistently, significantly superior to the opponent, pretty much everything can happen, regardless of individual merit.

What would you consider a more rational sport, where by that I mean, one that truly follows the spirit, "may the best one win"? I'd say basketball or volleyball are probably pretty good in that respect as they have such high scores you can't simply win because of a blunder, you need to keep up a consistent level of play throughout the match. I'm not much of an expert though so I may be missing something (for example, cricket looks awfully boring - but is it more /fair/?).
