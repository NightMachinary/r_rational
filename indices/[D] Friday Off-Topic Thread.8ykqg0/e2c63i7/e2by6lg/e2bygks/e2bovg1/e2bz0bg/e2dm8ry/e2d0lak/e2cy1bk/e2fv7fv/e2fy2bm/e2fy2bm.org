I don't think most people want rational sport. They want /competitive/ sport. Not knowing who will win is more exciting than watching the best triumph over and over again, so many sports favor increased randomness in order to allow for the sort of underdog victories and lucky breaks that sell tickets and put butts in seats.

A great player is kept in line by crappier teammates. Chaotic interactions with the angle of the sun, the speed of the wind, irregularities of the ground defy attempts at perfect play. Randomized competition schedules shuffle who faces who at which point in the season, in what weather, on which field, at which level of preparedness.

"Pretty much anything can happen, regardless of individual merit" is a selling point.

EDIT: Kind of a jackass move not to answer your question. Most (non-team, non-projectile) olympic sports are relatively fair. The competitive tension there is usually that an extraordinary athlete might come from anywhere, rather than that the best might not win. It's still a lot less popular than the world cup.
