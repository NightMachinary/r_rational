Hey man, you're the one trying to sneak in the last word on a months old argument. Don't get snippy when I call you out on dodging good faith debate.

Your link has very little to do with the discussion here. It says "the moralistic fallacy is that what is good is found in nature". If anything, we were talking about the opposite: here is an aspect of humanity that most definitely exists naturally (shooting people for holding heretical opinions) and it is condemned as abominable (never ever never forever).

I can only assume that you linked it due to interpreting the original statement as an observation of the way things are ("does not get bullet"). Since I had already clarified that this was an imperative statement (a command or instruction), I can only assume that you were unaware of that usage of the word.

If I've misstepped here at all, please enlighten me.
