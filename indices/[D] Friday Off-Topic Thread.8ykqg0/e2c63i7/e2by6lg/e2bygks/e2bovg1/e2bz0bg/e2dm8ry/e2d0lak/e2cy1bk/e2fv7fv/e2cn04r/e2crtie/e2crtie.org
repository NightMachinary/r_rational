This is like the second time this week I've seen rational-adjacent community members jump to killing idiots as a solution.

Like, I get it, maybe you're all just venting. But normalizing that sentiment is /dangerous/. Complain about it in a foul mood today, and it starts to sound a little more realistic tomorrow.

Bad methodology and bad argument gets met with good methodology and good argument. Does not get bullet. Never ever never for/ever/.

It's an obstacle, nothing more. Stop treating other people like a cancer and start treating the ideas as cancer and find a way to treat them, instead of sitting here masturbating your monkey brains by thinking how good it would feel to do a national violent purge. It's a crutch, not an actual viable alternative.

Focus your brain on how to educate the masses, accept that you will never ever do it in one fell swoop or dramatic anime moment, and channel that anger and frustration into actually solving the problem instead of simmering in dangerous wishful thinking.

Your great grandchildren (and theirs) will thank you. Because if you don't, they'll be trapped in the same cycle you're in and it will never get better.
