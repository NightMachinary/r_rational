Man, fuck people. People are the worst. We need to kill them all, one by one, until the survivors learn not to act like self-centered assholes with no basic pattern recognition or awareness that their actions can have negative consequences.

EDIT: Present CouteauBleu no longer stands by the opinions of past CouteauBleu. You may all safely ignore the ramblings of past CouteauBleu.

EDIT: Future CouteauBleu is now wondering what past CouteauBleu was even ranting about. Huh.
