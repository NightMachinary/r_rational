So what are some non-fiction books that you guys enjoyed? This sub has tons of recommendations for stories where the characters use the power of science/their own intelligence to further their own interests, but not as much about the books that teach those concepts directly. Or just, whatever nonfiction books you like and want to talk about.

I'm almost done reading The Demon Haunted World by Carl Sagan, and it's good. It's essentially a book that espouses the value of reasonable skepticism, giving examples of the pitfalls for the people who have never learned how science is done or why science has created the world we enjoy today. Faith healers, new age mystics, evangelicals, UFOologists, etc. It also talks about how important it is to spread rationality and science without being condescending, because it just cements scientists and science enthusiats as ivory tower elites who don't want to bother with the people they consider lesser. Overall very good book, and I recommend it. Bit slow for the first half, but it picks up.

One small error I noticed was when the book briefly mentions the Higgs-Boson, and its nickname as "the God particle", named so by physicist Leon Lederman. Sagan sounds disappointed in this name, as he puts it "I think they should all be named the God particle", conveying his disappointment in using mysticism to explain physics. But Leon Lederman didn't name it the God particle for religious intentions, he named it the "God Damn particle" because it was so difficult to find, which I think his publisher shortened for the media attention. They had to build the Large Hadron Collider just to confirm the particle's existence, so the full name is rather appropriate. Kind of sad to see such an error from someone I generally expect to do the proper research. It was only a line or two, but still.
