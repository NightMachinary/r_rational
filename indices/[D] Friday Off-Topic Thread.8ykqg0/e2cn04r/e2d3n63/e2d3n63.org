It sounds like you had an interaction with humans who suck -- that sucks!

In my experience, you can't change other people, apart from a very slight effect of serving as a role model. And killing is illegal (besides which, well you know, bad). The person you can work on the most effectively is yourself. It is hard, but less close to impossible, to improve yourself. There are even some steps that aren't too hard, and can be considered low hanging fruit.

Here are a few suggestions that you can take or leave, to whatever degree makes sense to you:

1. Steer clear of subreddits/communities where complaints/politics/fights are the norm. At least consider taking a break if it gets to be too much of a thing for you. Go to the light and fluffy ones instead, even if they seem a bit boring. Better yet, find light and fluffy ones that are well moderated and suit your aesthetic preferences in some way that prevents boredom. Rationalist communities are good, but bear in mind that the neutral-to-critical tone we often prefer won't necessarily be the best therapy if you are going through an intense emotional event and need more positivity as an antidote. You may need to give your brain a temporary break from focused criticism style thinking if you have been pushing it too hard. It happens. On the other hand, rationality is a great voice for structure/control/sanity, so don't abandon it.
2. Keep a [[https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/tips_for_keeping_a_gratitude_journal][gratitude journal]]. I haven't tried this yet but there's some evidence it works well. Write down three things per week that you are grateful for. If you can't think of any due to being in a weird mental state, one thing to try might be to think for five minutes about what you "should" or "could" be grateful for and write those down as a placeholder. Of course, no deity needs to be referenced to be grateful to, it can (and likely should, unless a specific person was involved) just be general gladness about the thing.
3. The Pareto Principle says 20% of relationships cause 80% of your (relationship related) stress. One way to take action on this is to identify the 2/10 people in your life that are worst for you and interact with them less, or find ways to interrupt their reward loop so they will bother you less. In extreme cases, you may need to cut them out of your life entirely. Alternatively/additionally, find the 20% of people who cause 80% of the good effects on your psyche and find ways to reward and spend more time with them. Familial bonds can be an intensifier here, so be sure to build up any family relationships you find to be positive.
4. Lower your expectations for anonymous strangers. People who don't have a specific relationship to you are frequently not incentivized to push your positive buttons, and are incentivized to test or throw you off balance to that they can outperform or even take advantage of you. This often happens for game theoretic reasons that are hard to fix at the broad societal level. Some pseudonymous groups (say positively toned subreddits like this one where people are regulars with reputations to build/uphold) are much better than others (usually the high volume political ones, for example) when it comes to being able to expect that a stranger will treat you well. In any case, bear in mind that happiness is often the result of [[https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/ambigamy/201408/the-secret-happiness-and-compassion-low-expectations][lower expectations]] in life.
5. Obligatory plug for standard therapy if you have a mental health condition ([[https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/mental-illness.shtml][around 1 in 5 people do]], and wanting to kill people even in jest is a strong indicator that you might), as well as taking any prescribed medications on a regular schedule as precisely and consistently as possible. If you have trouble with taking meds on time, an alarm on your phone can work wonders. Don't trust your brain to remind you unless you are already getting 100% success with that method. Chances are the alarm method will make it less stressful even so because of the reduced cognitive burden. If you find yourself ignoring the alarm, finding a reliable person willing to call or text you and remind you to take the meds (or check that you have taken them) for a month or so can be a good option. What they can do to make this simple is set an alarm on their phone for 15 minutes later than your alarm.

Best of luck. Even if this has zero value to you personally, I hope other frustrated individuals will get some use out of it.
