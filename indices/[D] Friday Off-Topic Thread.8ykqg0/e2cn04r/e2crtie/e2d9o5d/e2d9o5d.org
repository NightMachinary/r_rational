Yeah, I guess I should know better and include a bunch of disclaimers by now.

If you're curious, what got me into this mood was a colleague of mine acting in a way that showed they had paid zero attention to what I'd been doing, what I'd been telling them, and the impact their own words had.

It got me thinking about how people behave socially, and... it's complicated to describe, but the idea I often come back to is that people are often completely, thoroughly unwilling to learn from their mistakes or open themselves to new perspectives if they have no immediate incentive to do so.

I have trouble articulating it... which means it's probably not that coherent, I guess, but it's that sense that people are going to make the same dumb mistakes again and again and again, because they don't care if they hurt you, they have no incentive to listen if you point it out to them, and they're not introspective enough to realize they're hurting themselves in the long run. It's frustrating.

Anyway, I'm better now. Thanks for everyone who had kind words.
