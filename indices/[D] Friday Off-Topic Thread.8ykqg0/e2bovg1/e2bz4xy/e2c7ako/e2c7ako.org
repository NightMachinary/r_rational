According to [[https://www.ghacks.net/2017/05/16/stylus-is-a-stylish-fork-without-analytics/][some random (possibly untrustworthy?) website]] - originally there was Stylish, and Stylish was good, before being bought out by an advertising company that added the 'feature' of collecting browsing data, so an open source fork was made called Stylus that was essentially Stylish without tracking data and with support for later browser versions.

I can't find a website making the claim that Stylus is owned by a marketing company that collects your browsing history; But I only looked at the first page of google. I'd be interested in a source or more details on your claim.
