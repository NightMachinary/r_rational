  Protip: If you've already used up all of your 100 slots for filtering subreddits out of your [[/r/all][r/all]], you can filter EVEN MORE subreddits by using custom CSS (through, e. g., the Stylus browser extension).

Honestly, if someone needs to filter out more than 100 subreddits from [[/r/all]], they're probably using it incorrectly. Only a limited number of subreddits break into the first 500 slots or so, and many do so only very infrequently. If you're searching down below that very frequently, you're just drowing in the noise of mediocre or highly specialized content, and should probably figure out something else to do with your time other than browse reddit.
