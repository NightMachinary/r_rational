I did. Premise: I love Ghibli, but Made in Abyss is definitely not like Ghibli at all. It's more like Hunter X Hunter, in that it looks innocuous and childish at the beginning to then become crazy dark. And I mean /crazy/ dark. [[#s][I mean]] dark. So no, not very Ghibli at all, if anything the Ghibli-like aesthetic is there for added cognitive dissonance. It's pretty cool but honestly it also ends up inconclusively because the manga is still ongoing (and apparently becomes even more disturbing, to the point that some people drop it simply because they can't stand its sheer sadism - there are some who imply the author might be purposefully making it a form of pedopornographic snuff of sort, and I'm not sure if they're wrong). So, your call I guess. I enjoyed it but part of that was me really liking the aesthetic (both the Ghibli-esque aspect of it and the Moebius/Giger-like abominations that populate the Abyss), so if that's not a plus for you, you may want to give it a pass.
