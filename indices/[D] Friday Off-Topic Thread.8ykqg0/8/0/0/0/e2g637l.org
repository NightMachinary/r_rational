I figure randomness is balanced by the fact that skilled players performing skillfully are a lot more fun to watch than less capable folks. In entertainment terms, it really is less important who wins or loses than how they play the game. People remember great moments at least as often as they remember great games, and they're more likely to be fans of great players than they are of great teams.

Mostly, I think, sport satisfies a visceral need to choose a side and root for it and against its opponents... and I prefer a focus on sport over violence in that regard.
