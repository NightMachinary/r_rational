Mmm, good point. But you'd expect that from a narrative standpoint, since ultimately even sport is a /story/ (bolstered by the belief/knowledge that it's all real!), having only controlled randomness would favour a more coherent development, where people can form educated guesses about who would win between any two given teams. Of course that touches on another completely different subject - more randomness is good for the betting business.

Still, I think a sport that relies too much on randomness becomes frustrating to watch. Soccer feels like that to me more often than not (and this came back to my mind after seeing a friend expressing the same feeling on FB). There's a balance - it's fine for random occurrences to spice up the story, but you don't want it to turn into a senseless mess in which some nobody without any merit wins because of pure luck either. That's part of why national championships use round-robin tournaments - a much more consistent way of grading teams - the rest being of course that more matches = more ads = more money.

Guess there's a lot in play. Reminds me of that time some years ago when Ferrari dominated the F1 championship so completely (with Schumacher & Barrichello driving) they basically started changing the rules just to oust them from their top place. F1 being a sport that relies heavily on technological know-how and money, once Ferrari had gained a competitive edge, it was very hard for it to lose it again.
