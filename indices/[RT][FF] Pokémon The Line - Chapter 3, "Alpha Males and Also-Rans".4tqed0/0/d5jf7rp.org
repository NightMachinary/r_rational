Haven't read the latest chapter yet but I feel a need to acknowledge that /holy crap I'd given this story up for dead and now it's back, this is awesome/.

Anyway, here's hoping for a swift and resounding comeuppance for Blue the traitor and thief.

Edit: Have now read it, good solid entry right there. A shame his squirtle is kind of an ass, but I guess that's more characterful than having every 'mon be perfectly sweet and compliant.
