  I looked at the nidoran, and I knew his name. "Your name is Nidoking."

OMG! I remember how real people did this too when playing the games when I was a kid. It was really funny to see things like a magikarp that was nicknamed Gyrados, or to see someone with an entire team of ordinary pokemon nicknamed after legendaries. nowadays i might want to do something like nicknaming my butterfree venomoth and nicknaming my venemoth butterfree. speaking of which, does Daystar have any plan to explain the whole butterfree/venemoth thing in Pokemon the Origin of Species? why does metapod evolve into something that looks so much like a venonat, and venonat evolves into something that looks so much like a metapod?
