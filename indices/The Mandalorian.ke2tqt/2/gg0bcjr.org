Yeah, I mean, in general Star Wars is about as far from rational fiction as it gets. The central plot centers around remnants of a religious warrior cult playing out a prophecy concerning a mystical life force's influence on the galaxy. The climax of RotJ is Luke willingly surrendering himself to two of the most powerful Sith Lords in history basically just because he has faith it'll work out, and it does.
