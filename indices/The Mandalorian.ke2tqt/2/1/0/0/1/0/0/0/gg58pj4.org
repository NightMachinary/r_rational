I wouldn't bring AIs into it, frankly; the way droids work and are treated in Star Wars makes me think they're supposed to be limited in their abilities - maybe on purpose? Could the Star Wars society be the remnant of a previously post-singularity society that had to put down a dangerously rising AI threat, and thus is full of legacy technology it doesn't really understand?

But yeah, the thing you're describing doesn't seem to have much more of Star Wars. If you want to go for something more realistic you might as well ditch the idea of lightsabers appearing out of thin air and make them simple metal swords that heat up (like that one guy made on YouTube - a pretty crazy item, frankly). They obviously don't make sense as /practical/ weapons, but just give them an explanation in ritualistic or traditional terms. They look more like dueling weapons after all.
