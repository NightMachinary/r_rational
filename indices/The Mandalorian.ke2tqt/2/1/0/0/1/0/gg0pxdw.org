The Star Wars universe never was especially consistent or with some really hard sci-fi world building, that much is true, so I wouldn't want to enforce super rigid rules for it. However there is a certain "feel" to it and a sense of loose rules that is hard to pin down. The original trilogy established it. The prequel trilogy mostly kept to it (except for the very badly received, never mentioned again concept of Midichlorians), and screwed up in other ways, mainly having really terrible dialogue and often poor character writing for a story that was supposed to be a lot more complex and political than just the original trilogy's pew-pewing.

The sequel trilogy looks like it was made by people who watched the original movies once, went "ok, so, it's in space, there's space samurai and space explosions? Got you" and then just made their own thing. JJ Abrams tries to simply jam random fanservice in them while Ryan Johnson seemingly wanted to make some kind of subversive statement but /also/ really liked the idea of that sweet Disney money. If your concept is "a Star Wars movie, but it actually shows how foolish it would be to be so hotheaded all the time (Poe) or stuck to old traditions that might be flawed (Luke Skywalker)", I'm absolutely not against it, that's a really cool idea. But that concept can't possibly fit in canon, let alone in the middle of a trilogy, and it requires a lot more serious thought than was put in TLJ's script anyway. I'd see it more working as a Watchmen-esque deconstruction movie set in an universe that's a clear expy of Star Wars - something like a dark version of what Galaxy Quest is to Star Trek.
