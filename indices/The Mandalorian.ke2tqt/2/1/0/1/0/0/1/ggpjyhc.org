I don't think that's likely; the amount of damage we see a single hyperdrive suicide attack by a cruiser do is on the same order of magnitude of what we would expect a freaking Death Star to do (it one shots a major capital ship, shields and all). Definitely far superior than that cruiser unloading its whole armament against the enemy, several times. Heck, capital ships usually don't even come with warheads; they come with turbolasers, which supposedly are more powerful. The Rebels being in the position of being a guerrilla force in a position of inferiority... there's no way that wouldn't have come up as potentially useful at some point.
