The point that I was trying to make - possibly badly - is that the world is a different thing to the stories. That even if there is some aspect of the world that makes stories set in it break suspension of disbelief if highlighted, then that does /not/ mean that the world can be broken. That a hypothetical world could (hypothetically) be fully functional even /if/ something makes it hard to tell stories set in tha world.
