  They did it twice. Solo jumped out through the shields of his own ship when they escaped the tentacle things. And again, /through a planetary shield/, when they infiltrated Starkiller Base (making the scene in Rogue One where they fight through the planetary shield meaningless).

...okay, yeah, that /does/ seem a little troublesome. ...okay, a /lot/ troublesome.

Unless they can come in faster-than-light when no-one expects them (and thus beat any radio message that a sentry could send to activate the shield) and thus get through the shield before the shield goes /up/. That would make sense. But I'm guessing that's not what they did.
