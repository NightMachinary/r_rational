  Rationalizing Star Wars can lead to stuff like midichlorians

season two has him running down a long hallway towards 5+ stormtroopers shooting down said hallway who then focus fire on him so he can toss grenades at their feet. Season 1 episode two has him running to the defense of a droid (which he's shown to distrust highly to the point of not wanting a droid driver for a simple taxi) instead of either flanking everyone attacking the droid.

He is not a competent combatant.

  He also has a willingness to negotiate to get the job done.

its hardly a negotiation when he just says "yeah i'll do whatever quest you want" to every fucking yahoo who claims to know where other mandalorians are or where the jedi are and then have half of them say 'lol jk, i know where someone else is who knows where they are'

  As long as he can work and channel his money and Beskar back to his folk, he's fine with everyone.

His folk who are now dead to all but one, who as far as he knows is also dead.
