A bit. Lasers are supposed to be coherent light, meaning if they were perfect, they would just proceed in a straight line at the same intensity to the end of the universe. However, since nothing is perfect, they actually do have some incoherence, and spread out like a very thin and elongated cone. Thererefore their intensity falls as 1/r^{2.} As weapons they're probably not great, at least if we're not throwing in completely unimaginable new technologies (which is what happens in the aforementioned Children of a Dead Earth, being very hard sci-fi).
