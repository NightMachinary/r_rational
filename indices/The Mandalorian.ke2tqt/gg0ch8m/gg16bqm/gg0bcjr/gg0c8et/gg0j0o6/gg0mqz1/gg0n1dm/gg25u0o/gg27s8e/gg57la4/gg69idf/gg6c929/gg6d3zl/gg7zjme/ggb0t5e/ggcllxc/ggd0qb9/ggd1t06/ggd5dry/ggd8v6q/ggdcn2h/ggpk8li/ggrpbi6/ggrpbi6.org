  If at any point in the real world we observed with absolute certainty that the second principle of thermodynamics is violated, that would cast doubt over the second principle at any and all time.

That is true.

However, if we observe that someone in America is talking to someone in England in real-time (via telephone or similar) that does /not/ mean that someone in America could have talked to someone in England in real-time in the days of King Arthur; that feat could only be accomplished /after/ the invention of the telephone and the laying of certain undersea cables. (Or one could use satellites instead of undersea cabling, I guess. Or long-range radio...)

So it's always possible that, /at a later point in the timeline/, conditions have changed through the means of various inventions. Better shields, or better shield penetration techniques, could result in something that was possible once being impossible at a different point in the timeline.

Just doing it with no explanation is poor writing, mind you.
