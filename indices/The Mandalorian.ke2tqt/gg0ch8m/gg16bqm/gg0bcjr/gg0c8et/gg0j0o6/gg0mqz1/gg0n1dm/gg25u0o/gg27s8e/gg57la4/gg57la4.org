It still works out if the X-wing costs, say, about as much as a fairly fancy car, but you can get several dozen conventional missiles for the cost of a chocolate bar. The hyperdrive rock is still cheaper than the X-wing, sure... but the sheer /quantity/ of conventional missiles that you can get for the same cost would do even /more/ damage.
