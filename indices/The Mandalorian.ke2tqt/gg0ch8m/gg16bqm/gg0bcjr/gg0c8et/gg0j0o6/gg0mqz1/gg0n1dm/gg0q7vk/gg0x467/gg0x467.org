Many things in Star Wars look like they're just fumbling around with technology they can't fully reproduce or understand. A completely technologically static universe would make indeed a lot of sense to explain /most/ of what happens in that world. The problem is, some things instead fly in the face of such a concept. A few examples: the Death Star is an obvious one, while it's developed from plans of unknown origin in the movies (I won't consider the EU canon for these purposes), Rogue One still shows that there's obviously a lot of top tier engineering work that goes into building the thing. New ship designs emerge all the time - in some cases with a clear connection, look at the Clone ships in the prequels and then the Imperial ones in the sequels. Prosthetics advance too. When Anakin gets a replacement hand, it looks nothing as nice as like Luke's, even though in principle he should have had a lot more resources and reasons to get a top-of-the-line model.

Concerning this specific point, even if we suppose that no one truly understands how hyperdrives /work/ and they can only ape existing designs without improving on them, it's clear that new ship designs are created all the time (TIE Fighters are designed at some point between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope; TIE Interceptors and TIE Advanced even further down the line. The same likely goes for the Rebellion's own X-Wings, Y-Wings, A-Wins, Mon Calamari cruisers, and so on). So they do know at least how to stick together existing parts in different hulls and arrangements to get different performance out of them. And if they can do that... why, oh why, would they replace the existing bombers, like Y-Wings and B-Wings, which are basically just heavier fighters that fire rockets forward, with those pachydermic contraptions that get annihilated by the dozen at the beginning of TLJ? Unless of course everyone in charge of such things is a moron, or unless the writers of TLJ simply liked the idea of a very literal WW2-like bombing scene and didn't care about anything else.
