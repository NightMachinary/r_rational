Yeah, if X Wings can hyperdrive, then obviously you should do a lot more hyperdrive crashes

I think 99% of canon basically works if you retcon that out, and either have squadrons launch from small capital ships (ie, cruisers like Leia's), or use an external engine like Obi Wan uses on the prequels
