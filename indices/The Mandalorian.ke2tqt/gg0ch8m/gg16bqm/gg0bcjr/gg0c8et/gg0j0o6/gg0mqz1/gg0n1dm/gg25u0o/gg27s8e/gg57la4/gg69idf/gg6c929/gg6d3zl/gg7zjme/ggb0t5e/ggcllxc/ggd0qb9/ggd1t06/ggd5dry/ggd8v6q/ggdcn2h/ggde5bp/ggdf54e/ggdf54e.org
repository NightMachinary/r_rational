They did it twice. Solo jumped out through the shields of his own ship when they escaped the tentacle things. And again, /through a planetary shield/, when they infiltrated Starkiller Base (making the scene in Rogue One where they fight through the planetary shield meaningless).

I think that a rock (free) + big hyperdrive is so far below the cost of a Death Star, which is a man-made /moon/, filled to the brim with technology, resources and people, that you could blow up thousands of planets, maybe even tens of thousands, before you'd even come close to the cost of a Death Star.

And a Death Star, albeit reusable, can be easily destroyed by a hyper-missile big enough. Rock + hyperdrive, remember? Sure they have strong shield, but if shields is an issue just pick a bigger rock and spend a little more on the hyperdrive.
