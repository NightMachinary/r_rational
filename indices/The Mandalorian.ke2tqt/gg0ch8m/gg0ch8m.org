Honestly, The Mandalorian is exactly what it's supposed to be: a spaghetti western set in outer space. If you want rational plot and character development then you're going to be disappointed. It's 40 minutes a week of Star Wars characters running around shooting each other.

It's not going to get better. There's gonna be plot armour and (in)convenient coincidences when needed. If you can't enjoy it for what it is and spend too long thinking about why stormtroopers are such bad shots when the main characters are around then it really isn't the series for you.
