Not quite.

[[https://store.steampowered.com/app/476530/Children_of_a_Dead_Earth/][Children of a Dead Earth]] is the most realistic space combat simulator I know of (because it was designed to be that) and you cannot destroy anything there at light seconds. That's way too far.

Kinetics projectiles are too inaccurate and easily dodged at that distance. Laser energy is proportional to the inverse square of the distance and you won't be able to make it an effective weapon at light seconds, unless your laser is basically a megastructure.

Of course, you can do it with missiles, but there is very little distinction between "missile" and "unit" in space combat.
