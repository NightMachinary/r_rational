Someone on [[/r/IsaacArthur]] once asked if it would be plausible to set a Star Wars expy entirely in / around Saturn, and this sent me down a rabbit hole of trying to figure out how to get from the world we have now to an STL version of Star Wars, set in our Solar System. As usual, AI and nanotech ruined everything.

On the other hand, the Empire being managed by a UFAI who long ago destroyed the only candidate opponent AGI (who was hard instructed to not back itself up in case it went rogue) makes the Empire more threatening ... but, like, more threatening in the sense of ant Vs Asteroids. I think the Rebels were supposed to be trying to resurrect their AGI on Titan or something, and the Empire was building a giant doom-laser to launch an attack on Titan, but I'm still completely lost as to how space-wizards with laser-swords fit into things. Something something wands filled with nanobots?
