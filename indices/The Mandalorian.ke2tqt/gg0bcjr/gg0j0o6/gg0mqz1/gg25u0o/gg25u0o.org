One can only assume that the problem there is that a single hyperdrive rock costs about as much as a million or so conventional missiles, and they keep using the conventional ones for purely economic reasons. (Plus, presumably, the hyperdrive rocks need continual maintenance - I mean, look at how much maintenance the /Falcon/'s hyperdrive needs - and thus have pretty horrible storage life...)
