Wait - when did they hyperjump /through/ shields? The only time I remember seeing the hyperdrive used as a weapon, I thought it had done enough damage to overwhelm the shield and /then/ continue on to take out the ship - the Death Star II had /vastly/ better shields than a mere Super Star Destroyer.

  Nevermind that the Death Stars /would never have been built/ - it has to be chaper to take the Death Star hyperdrive and mount it to an big asteroid and hyper-ram Alderaan to smithereens. No thermal exhaust port vulnerability. No trench run. No millions of people and trillions of credits in systems.

Yeah, but that engine-on-a-rock only has the one shot. The Death Star is re-usable.
