I'm going to have to disagree there. The cruiser takes out one capital ship, sure... but /only/ one capital ship. A single shot from a Death Star could (assuming the targets are correctly lined up) take out an entire /fleet/ of them.

The rebels are - and always have been - severely outnumbered and outproduced by the Empire. The Empire would /love/ the Rebels to suicide-attack with every ship they have - because even if they take down a Super Star Destroyer with every cruiser they have, the Empire has more Super Star Destroyers than the Rebellion has cruisers, and once the cruisers are all down the remaining Super Star Destroyers will have no trouble with the rest of the Rebellion (assuming they can /find/ them).

I'm not saying it wouldn't have been useful for the Rebellion to ram the Star Destroyers. I just think that the Rebellion knew very well, from the start, that it would never be useful /enough/.
