I mean yes of course a hypothetical flawed fictional world can work to tell stories in if the broken parts are never relevant to the story.

In this case, the world already has a number of stories told in it.

The change to how hyperdrives work in the latest movies creates huge plot holes in the earlier works. In fact, the movies no longer make any sense at all.

Death Star II has a shield around it, so the Rebels have to destroy the shield generator on Endor. No they don't, they can hyperjump inside the shield, do the attack run inside the shield and jump out again. /Or put one of their capital ships on auotpilot and hyper-ram it to smithereens/.

Nevermind that the Death Stars /would never have been built/ - it /has/ to be chaper to take the Death Star hyperdrive and mount it to an big asteroid and hyper-ram Alderaan to smithereens. No thermal exhaust port vulnerability. No trench run. No millions of people and trillions of credits in systems.

The world is broken because both the new moves and the old movies can not be believable at the same time.

Sure, there are stupid stuff in the movies that makes no sense, and does this at a smaller scale. But the hyper-ramming and jumping through shields have such a vast impact, both on previous works and, really, all of Star Wars - /including the movies where it is introduced/.

Because hyper-missiles should be the default weapon, at least against anything big enough that you'd accept the loss of an X-Wing (just the ship) destroying it.
