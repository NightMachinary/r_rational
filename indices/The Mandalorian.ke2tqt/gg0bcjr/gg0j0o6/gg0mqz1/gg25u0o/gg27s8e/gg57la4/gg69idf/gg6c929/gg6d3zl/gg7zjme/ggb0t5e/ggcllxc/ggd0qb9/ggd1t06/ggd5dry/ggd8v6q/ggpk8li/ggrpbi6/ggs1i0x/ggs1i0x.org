That assumes technology significantly advancing, something that has never been really a factor in SW, especially concerning hyperdrive. Also, it still creates the question of why hyper missiles are not used widely.

I also disagree on your assessment of the usefulness of kamikaze attacks (with unmanned ships, in this case). They're exactly the kind of thing that a numerically inferior force uses in desperation. Just look at when they were used IRL.
