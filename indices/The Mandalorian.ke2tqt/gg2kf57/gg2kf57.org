Rationalizing Star Wars can lead to stuff like midichlorians. That said, the show has its moments.

Din Djarin was raised and trained by Mandalorian religious fundamentalists. He's a competent combatant, well-armed, well-armored especially after getting his new armor, and honorable to the point of near-absurdity. He is a competent, but not brilliant pilot. He also has a willingness to negotiate to get the job done.

The last point lends itself to a trace of rationalism. As long as his principles are not at risk, the Mando is a live-and-let-live sort of guy. Empire, New Republic, neutral species? As long as he can work and channel his money and Beskar back to his folk, he's fine with everyone. This attitude works very well through the series.

Much of the rationalism in the show is left understated - shown, rather than told.

- Din refuses payment in Imperial credits for a job, accepting payment instead in Calamari flan. The implication here is that the Empire's days are numbered, and everyone knows it.

- The Client attempts to bribe Din into killing (rather than recovering) the Child. The Imperial remnant is factionalized. In season 2, we discover Grogu is being used as a blood donor to awaken Force powers in "volunteers". The Client must have found this repugnant, but had his orders.

- Troop and gear quality vary widely among Imperial troopers. The factions, again, are at work here.
