In much the same way that game designers use this kind of shorthand to communicate with the player, filmmakers rely on shorthand to communicate with the viewer: we know in the first 5 minutes of Star Wars (A New Hope) that the empire, due to being called "the empire" and being led by a guy named "Darth Vadar" in all black with a mask (and the stormtroopers all having uniforms that hide their faces) are the bad guys, and we (correctly) assume that the rebels are "good" mostly on the basis of their opposition to the empire and having uniforms that don't conceal their faces so that we can see the concern and fear in the actor's faces. Every direction choice is serving this goal: There's just a certain way that evil characters /sound/ evil, probably because when James Earl Jones is recording the lines for Darth Vadar, the director is telling him that he's voicing an evil character, so he gives a different performance than he does when he's recording the lines for Mufasa in /The Lion King/.

You could poke holes in the worldbuilding of Zelda games all day, but all of the things that are "illogical" are the same things that make Zelda games enjoyable. There is no logical real worldbuilding reason that Link should be able to step into a thing called a "dungeon" and, by completing a series of puzzles, always be able to come out with the macguffin he needs after a series of challenges that are perfectly calibrated to whatever items he had collected at that point. Link's quest to defeat Ganon in nearly every Zelda game (BotW being a notable exception) is absurdly fragile: Ganon could put a halt to Link's entire journey by going into a single dungeon (pick one of the half dozen or so scattered across the land) and destroying a single key.

Hallmark movies also operate by their own internal logic. In the same way that a Zelda player will hear about "six medallions" and understand that Link's journey must end with obtaining six of them, a Hallmark movie viewer will see the hometown hunk in the first ten minutes of the movie and understand that the main character's journey must end with falling in love with him, and that doing this will be the result of her following some plot that is completed in the same amount of time that it takes for them to confess their love for each other. (e.g. stop the big corporate retailer from shutting down the local mom and pop store, receive handsome romantic partner).

I think this thing is best fully understood as "genre." When I pay $2.99 for a self-published Kindle book labeled as a "romance," I know it's going to end with a happily-ever-after, not because of the logic of the setting, but because of the genre. (And when the author breaks that promise, people will revolt!) It is /fully rational/ for me to expect that, irrespective of anything that happens in the plot. The author is being rational by catering to the audience. And if I bought one of those novels expecting a highly successful self-published Kindle author who built a career by churning out dozens of approximately identical romance novels to buck those expectations, /I/ would be the one acting irrationally.

In the opening episodes of The Mandalorian, the possibility that Mando might "break bad" and decide to sell out baby Yoda is presented as a possibility in-world, but as a viewer, I know it's not on the table. The Mandalorian is Star Wars, made by Jon Favreau. (Which can be quite different from e.g. Star Wars made by Rian Johnson.) Jon Favreau's Star Wars, much like a Kindle romance novel, challenges the viewer to approximately the same extent that viewers expect to be challenged. Which is to say, it understands that there is a reason you are watching The Mandalorian on Disney Plus, when you could be watching a David Fincher movie on HBO Max, or a Christopher Nolan movie on A. Or, as other commentors have put it much more succinctly, "The Mandalorian is exactly what it's supposed to be: a spaghetti western set in outer space."
