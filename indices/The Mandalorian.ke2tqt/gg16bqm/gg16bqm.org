  My main question is just about his competence though. I was thinking this was supposed to be a badass bounty hunter.

It seems like you went in with improper expectations. It's codified in [[https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-22-rules-of-storytelling-according-to-pixar-5916970][Pixar's rules of storytelling]] that we admire characters more for trying than we do for their successes (in fact, it's the first rule on the list!), so it should come as no surprise that when you start watching a Star Wars TV series on Disney Plus that it's made by people who understand that a person who /tries really hard/ is going to appeal to the audience more than someone who wins every confrontation effortlessly. Viewers want to see Mando get knocked down, because it shows that he has what it takes to stand back up again.

After all, this is made not only for the Disney Plus audience, but for the Star Wars audience. And while opinions amongst the Star Wars fanbase are split on many things, the thing that they all seem to universally agree upon is the fact that The Empire Strikes Back was among the best movies, despite most of the movie consisting of the "good guys" trying really hard and barely scraping by by the skin of their teeth. (A huge part of the movie is a /training arc/ for Luke: we only forgive Luke for being a badass during the opening of Return of the Jedi because he /earned/ it.)

If, as Pixar says, we admire characters more for trying than we do for succeeding, then there are two options: you can ratchet the difficulty up, or you can ratchet the character's competence down. /Die Hard/ opts for the latter: Bruce Willis is a badass, but he's dealing with an entire team of guys with automatic weapons when he himself is armed with nothing but a handgun and the shirt on his back. The Mandalorian can't really ratchet up the stakes too much, because the main thing that sets it apart from the Star Wars movies is the smaller stakes: he's not trying to save the galaxy; he's just trying to save a child (and also act as an errand-boy for a number of small bit players in the Star Wars universe.) The real badasses probably have much bigger problems to deal with.

Our protagonist's highest goal is "be likable." (Protecting baby Yoda is, in a way, just a means to an end: protecting the adorable puppet will make him seem more paternal and more likable. But not /too/ paternal: he has to kind of resent being made into a dad, because this makes him more relatable and thus more likable to the audience. It also gives him an "arc," which it should be noted is a thing that has no "logical" or "rational" reason to exist, but which audiences will generally notice the absence of in a protagonist.)

  Instead it has more of the feel of a player in a video game that fudges by on the easiest difficulty setting.

Video games are actually a great comparison, partly because video games illustrate a great point about metatextual communication with the audience. (Which is to say, beyond the mere lore connections, The Mandalorian exists in conversation with the rest of the Star Wars universe, much in the same that each Zelda game is sort of in conversation with every other game in the Zelda series in terms of game design.) The Mandalorian, in many ways, operates by the film equivalent of "video game logic." Examples of "video game logic:"

- Regenerating health: An NPC shoots you three times, and apart from red blood splotches obscuring your vision, you are no worse for wear. A fourth shot would be fatal, but luckily you manage to dive behind a rock, wait for 10 seconds, and your bloody vision clears and you are 100% fighting fit and ready to dive into the gunfight once again.
- The unit of currency in this world is gold coins. You easily carry 30,000 gold coins. The currency is stable: a merchant that sells a potion for 100 gold coins will never change their prices.
- A questgiver tells you that he needs six boar pelts. From this, you immediately know that 1) you will easily be able to find boars without traveling too far from where the questgiver exists, 2) that no matter how you kill the boars, their corpses will yield usable pelts (even if your method of killing them involves fire, explosions, etc). 3) that you are the only person in this world that can fulfill his request for six boar pelts, despite basic laws of economics suggesting otherwise. This will be true even when playing an MMORPG, where /by definition/ you are crossing paths with hundreds of other people who can (and in fact do) complete this same quest. (Actually, it's /especially/ true when playing an MMORPG.)
- You need a bomb bag to store bombs. Despite bombs being a common item in this world (enough that nearly every merchant in the world offers them), nobody has thought to mass produce and sell bomb bags. Despite how much money you obtain, you will never be able to buy a bomb bag: your only option is to dive into the inner catacombs of a dungeon where the bomb bag will conveniently be accessible without having to use bombs. (However, obstacles /later/ in the dungeon will /definitely/ require the use of bombs.) Despite the apparent rarity of this bomb bag, you are the only person who will ever seek it out; you can wait as long as you like to obtain it without fear of anyone beating you to the punch.
- The big evil villain is about to enact his plan which will cause mass destruction. Before going to confront him, your companion notes that this seems to be a point of no return, and suggests that maybe if you have unfinished business to attend to, you should take care of it before confronting the villain. Despite the urgency and high stakes, you take your companion's advice and decide to spend the next 3 days fishing. Nobody thinks this is weird, and the villain has gained no advantage during this time.
- All keys in the world are fungible, and immediately break upon being used. Exception: a few keys in the world are not fungible, but are conveniently color-coded: blue key goes in blue lock.
- Any time Link is told about "six medallions," you immediately know that you need to obtain all six of them and there is literally no other way to complete the main quest. You also know that each of the medallions will require an approximately equal level of effort to obtain (though the later medallions will be slightly more challenging).

(The Mandalorian follows it's own sort of video game logic: when Mando is told that he needs to obtain an egg, we generally understand that 1) the egg exists, 2) only he can obtain it, 3) attempting to obtain it is necessary for his quest to progress, for reasons that are more-or-less identical to the boar pelt example above. Mando is basically fetch-questing his way through the galaxy in a way not all that different from an MMO player.)

All of these are examples of what many people would call /good game design/. Regenerating health doesn't make sense, but being able to get back into the action after waiting a short period is more fun in an action game than backtracking to scrounge for health packs. (And both regenerating health and health packs are more fun than getting hauled off to a trauma center and spending several months going through physical therapy before diving back into the fight because you got shot three times in the arm.) When you're playing an open world game, the player wants to have time to do all the open world activities before "finishing the game," irrespective of the urgency of the ending of the plot: players generally /hate/ unmarked "points of no return," and so the game designers mark them, despite there not really always being a sensible in-world explanation for them.

Video games, despite this seeming "illogic," are /remarkably consistent with their own logic./ In part, I understand the logic of puzzles in Zelda 4 because I played Zelda 3.They don't follow /real world logic/, they follow /video game logic/. When you find a locked door in a Zelda game, the game designer is clearly communicating to the player that they need to find the key. And when the door has no keyhole but has two unlit torches on either side of it, it's obvious that Link needs to find a source of fire to light the two torches and open the door. (We're not really meant to question /why/ this dungeon was designed by a person who created doors that would open when those torches are lit, nor are we meant to ever wonder whether the mechanisms that they put in place might ever malfunction.) You /intuitively know these things/ when you find them in the world, despite there being no logical /worldbuilding/ explanation for them, because the game designers are using the conventions of game design and a sort of shared language to communicate them to you.
