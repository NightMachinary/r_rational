I don't know why you expected more. I like the series, but its star wars. Its fantasy in space, and its is more about themes and cool shots. Internal consistency was never a part of the franchise.

I manage not to be bothered by most of that, although the one thing that i can't seem to ignore is the fact that he never bothers to lock or even close the door of his ship.
