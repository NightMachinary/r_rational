I mean I haven't seen many rational stories in mainstream TV series, but the Mandalorian is in my opinion even worse than average. The plot is riddled with holes. People do stuff for no reason other than "results in (supposedly) cool stuff". I honestly don't get why it's so beloved other than the green mascot. I mean I'm not much of a Star Wars fan but if they treated my favorite settings this way I'd be very disappointed.
