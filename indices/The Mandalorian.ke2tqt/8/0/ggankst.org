"Good" fiction is inherently subjective so i see no problem with associating rational fiction with good fiction if you happen to like rational fiction.

But I'm not passing judgement on the series overall. I understand that people can like it without me liking it. I was just hoping for a competent main character. This shouldn't pose any problem for rational fiction vs "good" fiction ... unless you think incompetent main characters are a hallmark of good fiction?
