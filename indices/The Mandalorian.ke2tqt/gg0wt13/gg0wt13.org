I think the whole point of Mandalorian--and also it's charm-- is it's supposed to be a low stakes Star Wars series. None of the Skywalkers are involved, no epic plots or messing with canon. It's also clearly not supposed to be high art. It's just Mandalorians and yodas traveling through space, shooting stuff and helping people. I like it because of baby yoda and Pedro Pascal, tbh. It's also nice to know that if I /don't/ want to watch it, I'm not missing anything that's canon.
