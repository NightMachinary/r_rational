Reposting my belated rant from the chapter's comment section:

You know, Akua has called Black Knight a patriot in this charter, and this, combined with another passage from her speech here has reminded me of another mistake nobody mentions, and the reason I never could understand the concept of patriotism.

  “Twenty years ago, we were more powerful than the people of Callow,” she continued. “Twenty years ago we were better than them, for beyond all the lies and stories that is the bare truth of Creation: the powerful own the world.”

What kind of "we" are you talking about here? It's not "I and all of you", because twenty years ago you were nothing but your mother's scheme, the one she denied your father the support to his claim to the Name of Warlock for. But it's not "we, the peoples of Praes" either! Even if we ignore the fact that you didn't contribute anything to that victory, the peoples of the Praes are on the other side of those walls. You and your army represent the Praesi nobility, the small part of those peoples, the very same part that the people besieging your fortress had to subjugate first in a far more brutal civil war. Your mother probably didn't assist the Conquest in any way other than the average amount of taxes she owed to the Tower anyway, and maybe sponsoring a few promising officers to become her spies in the Legions.

This kind of demagoguery puzzles me. How can people think that slapping a "we" on other people's accomplishments somehow makes them stronger? It's a faulty way of thinking even in a universe that literally runs on this kind of magical thinking!
