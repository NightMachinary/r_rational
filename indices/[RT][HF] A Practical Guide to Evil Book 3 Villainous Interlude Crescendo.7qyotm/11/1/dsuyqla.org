While I think Akua has a warped sense of perspective you could argue that without the oppression of the High Lords the Calamities wouldn't exist. She might think that the Legions and the Calamities are a direct response to the system she's a part of, hence she feels the system itself is validated. "Iron sharpens iron", so to speak.

It's all bullshit of course but that's Diabolist for you.
