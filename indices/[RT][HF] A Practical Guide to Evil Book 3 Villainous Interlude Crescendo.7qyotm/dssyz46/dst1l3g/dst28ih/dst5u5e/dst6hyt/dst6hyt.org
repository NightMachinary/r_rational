Precisely. That's exactly why they would Crusade. Because the Crusaders have no chance in hell of beating the Diabolist. Therefore they will. White has shown he's savvy enough to exploit such tropes.

Balance and symmetry are core themes to this story.

You have the Gods Above and the Gods Below, The Winter Fae and the Summer Fae, Heroes and Villains. The Gods Below have propped up Diabolist and gave her a power that's damn OP. If it falls in the hands of Malicia that would strengthen Evil greatly and throw the whole balancing theme out of wack. Who's to say the Gods Above won't answer that terror by elevating some religious priest in Procer with a Named like the Evangelist for example, that is capable of opening breaches into whatever domain the Angels live in?

They've already done something similar with White, giving him Recall that allows him to gain the skills and reflexes of every single hero Name before him to offset Black's experience and skill.

Procer has a good chance of succeeding (relatively speaking) if they Crusade.
