Crusade.

Opening a single portal is one thing. Being able to open a Hell Gate ANYWHERE in Creation, a Gate that leads to forces that you control that for all intents and purposes could be considered infinite in number AND ARE DEMONS?

I think Malicia misjudged herself. There's absolutely NO WAY ANY NATION THAT CALLS THEMSELVES GOOD CAN LET THIS STAND. Or any Evil aligned nation either. An enemy that can move their entire army right smack dab in the middle of your city is TOO MUCH of a threat to your interests to keep alive.

Arcadia already fused. They are mirrors of Creation. This even right here will force Procer to work with Praes to end the threat of Diabolist.

Diabolist just picked a fight with the ENTIRE Calernia. The balls on this chick..

But she fucked up. She made the one move that will force any two enemies to work together: she gave them a common enemy. Just like Triumphant...

... She has returned.
