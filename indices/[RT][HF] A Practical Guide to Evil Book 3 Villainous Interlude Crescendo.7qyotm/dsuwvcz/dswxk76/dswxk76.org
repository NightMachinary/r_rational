  Even if we ignore the fact that you didn't contribute anything to that victory, the peoples of the Praes are on the other side of those walls. You and your army represent the Praesi nobility, the small part of those peoples, the very same part that the people besieging your fortress had to subjugate first in a far more brutal civil war. Your mother probably didn't assist the Conquest in any way other than the average amount of taxes she owed to the Tower anyway, and maybe sponsoring a few promising officers to become her spies in the Legions.

I think she doing some... creative reframing of reality, where she thinks the people of Praes are stronger when they're lead/oppressed by powerful nobles?

Yeah, I'm not sure I get what her ideology is supposed to be, or if it's even supposed to be coherent.
