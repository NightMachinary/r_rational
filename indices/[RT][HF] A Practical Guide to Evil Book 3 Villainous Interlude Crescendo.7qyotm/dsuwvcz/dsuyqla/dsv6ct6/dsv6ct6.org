The "iron sharpens iron" principle as applied by the Wastelanders is bullshit for one more reason: success isn't measured in some singular, easily quantifiable parameter, and so the competition that has the place at the top as its prize isn't anywhere near as important as the nobles make it out to be. The only thing that the overabundance of schemers fosters is prowess at taking the prize from other such schemers, not prowess at keeping it, as evidenced by average Emperors turnover rate.

I wonder, just how common is the gambit of openly letting a villain "touch the greatness" for a few seconds and immediately stabbing them? As long as the one doing the stabbing doesn't actually need the thing the villain is after, anyway.
