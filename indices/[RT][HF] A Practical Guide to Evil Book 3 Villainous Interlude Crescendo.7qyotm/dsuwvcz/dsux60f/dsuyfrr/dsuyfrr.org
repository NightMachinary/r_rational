But this is also reflected in her way of thought, and in her monologue to Fasili back then. The reason I'm posting this now is that while she always was quick to connect the achievements of the Empire and her own in her thoughts, this is the most open way she could have stated that yes, she does actually believe that. And everyone, both in story and in comment section, somehow treats it as though that the strengths of the Empire are actually her personal strengths too, and she was only mistaken in not being genre savvy enough.

Knowledge of tropes helps when we're in the story, with individual characters and the masses becoming the background, and she just put her success in her hands of a few key individuals and mages instead of, you know, actually adopting the structures that allowed the Empire to conquer Callow. True, that would go against her character, but admitting that other people exist shouldn't!
