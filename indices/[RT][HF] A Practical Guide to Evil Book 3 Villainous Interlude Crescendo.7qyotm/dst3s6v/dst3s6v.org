Ha, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/PracticalGuideToEvil/comments/7pwhfa/how_do_you_think_book_iii_will_end/dsqkt23/][called it!]] I feel like I deserve a cookie now :D

Cat will probably end up kneeling in front of Akua but if Diabolist thinks that's the ending of her story she's got another thing coming for her. Pride comes before the fall and I don't think I've ever seen her so smug.

Will *Take* work on Akua's gate binding? Despite the complexity, it seems likely considering it was used to steal a resurrection from an angel.

It's interesting that Akua assumes the lesser devils disappearing into dust is Warlock's doing and doesn't even consider Hierophant, who imo is the one who actually did it. He had a lot of time to study the walls after all.

With all the talk of making Cat kneel, I think Black's iconic phrase - "We do not kneel" - will become extremely relevant. Perhaps when (and if) Cat becomes Black Knight, she will recall his words and break whatever hold Akua will have on her.
