My impression was that Malicia knew, or at least believed she knew exactly what Diabolist was planning. She hinted as much in the interlude, and I can't imagine she would risk so much on such a vague understanding.

Assassin is still unaccounted for. It seems plausible to me that he is already inside Liese. I still expect it to go wrong for Malicia, but having him in place would make the most sense.
