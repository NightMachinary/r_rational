Cat's not really the underdog in this situation. She has the full might of the government behind her. As she pointed out, even if she fails and dies, the Legion still has a lot more armies to throw at Akua.

Catherine's problem is that even if she crushes her enemies, she can still take crippling losses. Also, generally speaking, she's going against the system, not against a specific enemy.
