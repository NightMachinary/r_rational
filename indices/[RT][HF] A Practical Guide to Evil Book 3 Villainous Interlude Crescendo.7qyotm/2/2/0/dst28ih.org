She can't back off.

How could she trust Malicia to NOT use the weapon n years after the truce when the Principate is at its weakest? The entire Principate would in effect be living a sword dangling over their necks because they'll always be wondering when a portal to one the hells is going to open underneath them when they're on the toilet.

The only way Cordelia could conceivably agree to a truce is if the weapon is destroyed. But how could Malica trust that Cordelia won't simply call a Crusade the moment she destroys the portal?

No, far easier to have Warlock and Masego reverse engineer the array and use it to wipe Procer off the map.

You don't leave an enemy alive if you're a villain and you have any sense in you at all.
