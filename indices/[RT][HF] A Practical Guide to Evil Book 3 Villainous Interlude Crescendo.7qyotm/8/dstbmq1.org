Welp, Ubua just lost the battle. Used her trump card before the other side used any of theirs, took herself off the battlefield insuring she can't affect how her enemies deal with that trump card in any effective way and still left a "practically untouchable" door to her city, meaning any Named can still go into it if needed.
