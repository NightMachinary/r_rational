The challenge thread has now been up for 19 days. In the thread itself, it is claimed that the new challenge would go up on September 13th. (8 days ago)

Is this delay intentional? Does it mean that the biweekly challenges may be over?

I'm sorry if I seem nosy, but I'd like some closure. Though I've only participated in three challenges so far, I've really grown to like them. (Also, my story for the next challenge is already finished, and I would love to post it. If the challenges are over, I would post it as a standalone.)
