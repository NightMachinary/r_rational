  I also want to automate adding the winners to the wiki page of winners; that's horribly behind

Actually it's not, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge][I've been updating it]]. Only the record of the latest development is not included in it.

I wholly support its automation, though. Keeping it up-to-date it is annoying and, yes, possibly pointless: we may be the only two people interested in its existence.

Hmm, while we're at it, can you also automate updates of wiki-pages for weekly and recommendation threads? Unless [[/u/ToaKraka][u/ToaKraka]] enjoys updating them, that is.
