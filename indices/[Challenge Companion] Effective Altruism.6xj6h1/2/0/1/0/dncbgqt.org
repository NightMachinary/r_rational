Monthly rec threads really should be automated. I took ten minutes to do that just now, ping to [[/u/ToaKraka]] and [[/u/magodo]]. It should post at October 5, 2017 3:00 PM UTC, but one of the things I hate about Automoderator is that it's hard to actually test that it's not going to screw things up. (I had always said that I would do that if they were popular enough, and then never checked back or had anyone tell me that they were popular enough.)

Automating the challenges would probably take more time than automation is worth, though you're right that partial automation is probably a good halfway measure, which wouldn't be too hard for some of the most annoying things. I'll try to get to that sometime in the near future.

(I also want to automate adding the winners to the wiki page of winners; that's horribly behind, because it's grunt work that I never feel like doing and I don't actually know whether anyone looks at it.)
