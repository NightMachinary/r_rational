No, I went off to a wedding last Wednesday and missed the usual calendar event, then sort of forgot about it, so ... sorry about that. It's super-late in my time zone and I was just about to go to sleep, but I will have the next one up tomorrow around noon Central (UTC -6).

(You won quite handily; I gave you the gold and disabled contest mode, the announcement will be in the post tomorrow.)
