So, here's a setting I've been thinking about, which might provide some inspiration:

Suppose, in the near future, someone engineered and released virus that caused people to develop an extreme amount of empathy and compassion. As in, so much empathy that hearing about the death of a stranger on the other side of the world would cause an emotional reaction like the death of a loved one, and hearing about a stranger giving birth would feel like having a child yourself. If most of humanity was infected, what might happen?

My take: in the short term, you'd see an enormous amount of chaos. There would be a global epidemic of severe PTSD as the traumatic experiences of individuals caused global effects. Most people might eventually learn to cope with both that and the constant mix of extreme joy and grief, especially with the entire world motivated to develop new psychological techniques and drugs. Initially, however, suicides would be a huge problem.

On top of that, industries and maybe even entire economies would collapse as consumers would feel uncomfortable about buying unnecessary goods while other people were still starving or suffering. Something like the economic mobilizations during WWII might occur, though focused on massive third world development projects. In first world nations, you might start to see things like food rationing, while people in extreme poverty would see a dramatic increase in standard of living.

A century later, the world might look like a kind of utopia- free of poverty and most kinds violence and abuse, with a global economy slowly reapproaching pre-virus first-world standards and with huge medical research initiatives. It might be a world where few people could endure learning about history, however, and where taking any kind of risk was severely discouraged.
