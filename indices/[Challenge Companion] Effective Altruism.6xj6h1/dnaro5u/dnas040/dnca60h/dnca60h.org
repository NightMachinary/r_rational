This raised a point I wanted to raise for some time now: could the rest of the regular threads be automated? AutoModerator posts weekly threads, but the recommendations thread is posted by a human, with them [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6rrew4/monthly_recommendation_thread/][having to plan ahead and recruit help]] if they expect to be unavailable, which I'm not sure they enjoy.

It would be more complicated with challenge threads, but having AutoModerator un-stick the old thread, disable the contest mode in it, and then the create and stick the new thread should be doable, with the theme of the new thread decided on your leisure during the corresponding two weeks, and the winner's info pulled from the old thread. I'm not sure that giving flair and gold is possible to implement, though, and formatting of top-level comments would need to be standardized.
