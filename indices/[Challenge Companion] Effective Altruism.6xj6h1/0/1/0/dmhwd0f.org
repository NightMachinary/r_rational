I'm not so sure; I think that human grief is probably bounded. If you hear news that two of your family members have died, you'll feel more grief than if only one had died, but would be severity of the emotion be doubled? Suppose you have a large extended family, and you hear that fourteen of them have died in a disaster- would your grief be substantially different than if only thirteen had died? I suspect that each additional death increases your experience of grief by a real, but diminishing amount, converging on a state of severe grief close to what a lot of people experience during wars and natural disasters.

Also, what we feel has a lot to do with what we focus on, and while there's a lot of death and suffering in the world, there's also a lot of profoundly felt joy. I think a person infected with this virus might slip from paralyzing grief to euphoric high just by scrolling through photos of strangers being married.

The effective altruism angle has to do with imagining a setting where almost everyone would be strongly motivated emotionally to behave altruistically- not just toward the people they normally interact with, but toward everyone, which is what effective altruism calls for- and trying to imagine the shocks to our present system that might produce, and the sort of civilization it might eventually result in.
