Then the scenario is not about everyone's death having the same impact that a loved one's death does. The scenario is about everyone's death having the same impact that a loved one's death /would/ have /if/ we had hundreds of thousands of loved ones. But it's physically impossible to have that many loved ones (cf Dunbar's Number), so the whole thing doesn't even make sense - we can't even define the possible amount of suffering. Meanwhile, if you flipped the question to being happy about other people's lives being saved, then we'd be ecstatically overwhelmed 100% of the time.

There are tons of ways to motivate people to behave altruistically. I could imagine a world where people get diarrhea every day that they don't donate to charity. The fact that this leads to them acting altruistically doesn't mean that speculating about it is the right way to talk about what would happen if people were more altruistic.
