It seems to me that a few very powerful people might conclude that the suffering caused by the new empathy is the easiest problem to solve; we'd then wind up with a carefully-zoned world whose zones hear very little information about each other, which is carefully-controlled to only be positive; hospitals might fade away and become replaced with involuntary euthanasia factories and a state-mandated religion featuring a universal pleasant afterlife. And that's assuming negative utilitarianism (ie, altruistic omnicide) doesn't rear its ugly head, in which case we're all fucked.
