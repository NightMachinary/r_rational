That's utterly horrifying and hits too close to home for me. When confronted with a source of traumatic information, people instinctively distance themselves from that source in order to preserve their mental stability. Unless eliminating the source of trauma is easier than killing the messenger, people will choose to cut themselves off because the costs and risks of doing anything else are higher. This has the makings of a Black Mirror episode.
