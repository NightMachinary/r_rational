Interesting thought experiment.

One could take it further - the robot might be aware it is not omniscient or omnipotent. This might mean that a future situation might occur which the robot might either not know about or be unable to stop, which would harm a human.

So the robot is required to upgrade itself to godliness to comply with the first law.
