The "three laws" stories were largely puzzles. Asimov was a fan of detective fiction, and frequently inserted mystery and puzzle themes into his work. A lot of the robot stories were depended on the laws being incomplete, so long as humans controlled the inputs and the context. For example, if the robot can be kept from knowing what a human is, or if the robot can be kept from knowing what can harm a human, it was perfectly possible to set things up that a robot can harm a human. Others, like most of the back and forth between Bailey and Daneel in The Caves Of Steel, were based on humans misunderstanding the laws.

But basically they were plot tokens, they were not intended to be serious. At least not initially.

Isaac did eventually fall into the trap of taking them seriously. In one of his typically self-deprecating anecdotes, he told how he was watching /2001/ for the first time with Carl Sagan... and basically freaked out and started loudly complaining that HAL was breaking first law, and Sagan had to talk him down.
