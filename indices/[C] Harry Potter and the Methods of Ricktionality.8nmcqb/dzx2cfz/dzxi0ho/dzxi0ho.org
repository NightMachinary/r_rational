Quirrelmort: "...you mean?"\\
Nationalist!Harry: "Magical Brexit was just the beginning. Soon, forget being a part of the Magical European Union - the Magical European Union will be a part of /us/. Our might will once again spread through the Earth - through the Universe! Why keep hidden from the Muggles? /We/ are the true one master race! The Dragon-crested Union Jack will fly upon the flagpoles of the cosmos! Not only the Sun, but no other star shall ever set on our dominion! And we will begin with reclaiming what was ours..."\\

Nationalist!Harry: "That is much better. Know thy place. And rejoice! For the masters that you were so ungrateful towards are coming back, ready to forgive you, and give you another chance at shining at least of their reflected light..."\\

Nationalist!Harry: "Rule Magical Britannia."
