This was nowhere near as terrible as I expected it to be. In fact, it was thoroughly entertaining. As much as I love both R&M and HPMOR, many fans of both are quite cringeworthy, and many people hate both, so I expected this to either be uber-cringeworthy or some sort of mudslinging denigration calling itself "satire."

This tickled my fancy a great deal. Pure, undiluted crack. Bravo.
