Not gonna lie, I skimmed most of the beginning as it felt like it was taking too long to get interesting, but after I got to the good part went back and reread it all. Suprisingly well done, and honestly with the added bonus of the improvised song (that I heard in the appropriate voice in my head) and end-credit scene, this deserves to be called a legit fan-episode, imo.

Well done! One minor nitpick: the burping mid-sentence has gone way down in recent seasons, which I think is to its benefit, as it ups the weight of each when they happens. Might be worth removing a few here and there so it interrupts the flow less :)
