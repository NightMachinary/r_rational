Thanks for the critiques! I felt that the exposition at the beginning was necessary because the information all comes back later, one way or another... and also so I don't have to do it in a sequel if I decide to write one. I agree that the exposition is a bit too long, but I'm not sure how to shorten it. As for the burping, I don't know if you noticed, but after the beginning, it happens a lot less or not at all. I used it to set the tone, and then dropped it because it's unsustainable.

Don't know if I'll spend too much time editing this, though... it's not the sort of writing that demands perfection...

By the way, knowing that you read r!Animorphs, how would you feel about a sequel, "Animorphs: The Rickoning"?
