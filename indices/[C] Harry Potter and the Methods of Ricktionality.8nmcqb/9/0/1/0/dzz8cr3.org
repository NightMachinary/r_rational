That's a good tip. Don't think I'll bother editing, at least right now, because I need to stop procrastinating on my real-world stuff.

I think I'll write an Animorphs sequel eventually. (Let's be honest, I was going to write it anyway). I've already begun plotting it in my head. The problem is that I'm such a fan that all my plots are turning serious. I don't necessarily want Rick and Morty to be in "God mode" again, but when they have vulnerabilities, Visser 3 becomes too serious of a threat the minute Rick makes a mistake. Fun problems to have.
