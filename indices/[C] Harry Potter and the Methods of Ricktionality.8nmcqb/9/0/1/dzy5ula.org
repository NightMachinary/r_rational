To cut down exposition weariness, might help if all the trips to random dimensions have purpose, maybe they're important to building their superwands, while to Morty it just looks like they're grabbing random stuff as usual. What beats hair of unicorn tail for a core? Dried piece of squid intestine. Maybe the wand itself is made of sapient rabbit bone. It's a bit of a big edit, but at least things would be happening meanwhile.
