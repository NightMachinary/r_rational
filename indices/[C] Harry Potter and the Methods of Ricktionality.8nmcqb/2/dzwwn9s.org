This... I can imagine it being a real Rick and Morty episode.

  *Rick:* HAHAHAHAHA, oh man, Morty, when that wears off everyone's gonna go full Cronenberg. Damn, son, you Cronenberged HPMOR! Hahaha, I didn't Cronenberg up /my/ first universe until, uhhh, forget I said that, but /man/ you really fucked this one up, haha!

Yup. I can picture that very scene. Can't say it was 100% Rick and Morty style, but it kept the important bits, at least.

This was a journey. A bit of an unfocused journey, frankly- in the beginning I kept wondering when we'll get to Harry's adventure. There was a good payoff to those moments, at least.

The techno babble was on point, and the conflicts of out-sciencing one another were appropriately ridiculous and over-complicated. In fact, there was /a lot/ of this bizarre world-building that wouldn't look out of place in the show. Plenty of competently handled topics.

Rabbit were the funniest, got to say. Especially the song.

So... crack. High quality crack. Sold on the corner of your local university, right next to the philosophy department.
