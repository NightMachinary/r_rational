That ended on an unjustifiably optimistic note. Science can do a lot, but you need good politics to fund the right research, and the right incentives to actually try to progress humanity rather that develop Huxley's Brave New World, and I don't see it. Automation, which should have freed up our time, was instead used to not pay employees for that time and will continue to freeze out billions from opportunity while we are hitched to a scarcity-based capitalist economy. Space travel, which was interpreted as a continuation of manifest destiny, was motivated by little more than militaristic posturing and dried up the moment that particular utility was exhausted. No one has yet come up with a reason for space colonisation that's good enough to actually try it, and the reliance on unknown future science to solve problems, especially problems that could be solved by choosing not to cause them anymore, is the same as relying on miracles: you don't know that that future will happen or is even possible, you don't have a plan to get there, your sci-fi imaginings conveniently ignore the chasm between now and then like they all do, and you are not paying sufficient attention to the immediate problems that threaten to scupper that and all other worthwhile futures right now.
