The Bridge to Lucy Dunne is fantastic all the way through. Pretty much all the short stories have the same weight as the video, and they cover a variety of topics. I'd heavily recommend that one to anyone on this sub.

Prince of Milk is a bit more abstract and hard to follow. It's a lot of concepts woven together by a loose premise, which makes it sometimes feel cluttered. There's a lot of interesting ideas that are explored, and all of the characters are written very well, but if you can't keep up with a large cast, I'd say you should skip this one. It's very Pratchett-esque, if that's what you're into, especially the dry British humor.

Logic Beach is one I started but never finished. From what I read, it's very low-concept and it takes the metaphysical aspects of Prince of Milk up to 11. I wouldn't say he got worse at writing over time, but he moved gradually from rational to rational-adjacent in the same vein as Unsong. My reccomendation to pick up Lucy Dunne and move on to Prince of Milk if you really enjoy his style.
