I'm on chapter 15 and I just want to warn people that the main character is, well, not the brightest bulb, so I'm not quite sure that if people like it for the normal rational protag that you're getting that. For the same reasons I like rational fiction to a lot of people might mean intelligent characters (even if they're not rational).

I'm also a little confused if Dan was just absent for all of the mass shootings in the USA after 9/11. Dan's points seem insanely on the nose and he obviously is from a world with smartphones so I don't get it at all. Did he forget about them?
