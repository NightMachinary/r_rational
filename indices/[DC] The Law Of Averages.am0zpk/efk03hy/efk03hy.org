Agreeing with the other poster. First chapter is an isekai explaination. Just go through it.

All in all I am liking it so far. Frequent updates, but they are relatively short. Writing varies from being decent enough, to having some very good lines. I am on chapter 20, and enjoying it. Came back after reading:

The injured man's eyes snapped open, dark grey orbs meeting black clouds above. His hand jerked into the air, and fire answered his call.

Excellent line, imho. How good of an actual book it is depends on where the story goes, but I am invested enough to read and find out.
