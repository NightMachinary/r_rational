Dumping the library seems really really, ridiculously stupid. It contains all of the knowledge he seeks on everything he has deemed important in that conversation, it includes things he has figured out later. If he dumps it in the sacrifice pile, he'll lose gained knowledge,and he WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO LEARN ANY OF IT.

This seems by far, his stupidest idea ever.
