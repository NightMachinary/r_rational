Thanks, fixed!

And yes, this is a great place for spellcheck. No matter how many times I edit, when I go back a few days / weeks later, I always find more errors. :/ The chapters which have to be finalized on Saturday (such as this week's and last week's) tend to be a bit worse about that, obviously.
