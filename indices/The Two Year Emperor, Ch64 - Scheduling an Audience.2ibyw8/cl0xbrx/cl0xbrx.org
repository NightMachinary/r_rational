I -really- like the way you handled Jake finally getting his wis and cha upgrades. It hasn't really changed him directly, it's just made him pass all his saves. Now people are kinda forced to go along with even his stupid ideas, and have a reduced ability to debate and improve them.

If anything, that's gonna get him in /more/ trouble! Wonderful :)
