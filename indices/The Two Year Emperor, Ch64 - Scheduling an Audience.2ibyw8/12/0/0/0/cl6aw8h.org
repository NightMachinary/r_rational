Everyone, even commoners, has skill ranks. It's just that the average commoner, until they interact with a PC is so /completely uninteresting/ that their skill ranks are in a quantum state of bonus.

And some things, like strength, would be really easy to test. Strength determines carrying capacity, so if you know the moment you move from a light to a medium load you can determine your exact strength.

If TYE-verse works like some campaigns I've seen, where everyone gets max HP at first level, it would be easy (albeit painful) to calculate your CON - simply allow yourself to be struck by a shruiken (flat 1 damage, plus STR bonus) until you reach 0 hp. This can calculate your CON bonus, getting you within 1 point of your true CON.

WIS can be determined (roughly) almost as easily: tell someone how you're going to test their CON. If they agree to be tested, their WIS is below-average.
