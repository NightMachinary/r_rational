Re. Suze, there was a clue early on in the story where someone commented on her having an accent they couldn't quite place. Ever since then, I've been paying attention to what she's doing, though tbh I can't think of more than a handful of ideas (like yours) for who or what she really is. If you use meta-knowledge, major characters in a story tend to serve a purpose to drive the plot, and we have yet to find out what hers is other than super-secretary.
