I don't think that's hugely likely.

As Allison explained to Jake, servants in Flobovia were (de facto, if not de jure) at their master's beck and call for any number of 'services'. Sure, "Suze-As-Lich-Queen" could be a possibility. But that would imply that a Lich Queen would be able to bury her own ego and live as a mortal human girl, /serving/ others, for a long period.

Instead, "Not-Quite-Dead-Lich-Queen" could easily have lived as a commoner - or even a skilled craftsman or displaced foreign noble. If access to the leadership was desired, I'm sure there's a dozen ways to do it that wouldn't require NQDLQ to pose as a servant.

Sure, "Suze-As-Lich-Queen" wouldn't have to *actually* submit to serving a master in any unpleasant ways (she could always /Mindscrape/ the desire away or false memories of it in) but she would have to live with the fact that everyone she meets expects her to do so.

For a typical medieval commoner, raised to believe that this is just how the world works? It's absolutely survivable and most likely prefereable to a life of hardscrabble farming or working as a common laborer. For a Lich Queen used to commanding, and able to rewrite parts of reality with a tiny bit of effort and a few carefully-chosen words? It would be intolerable.

This isn't absolute evidence that Suze can't be a Lich Queen, but it's pretty strong evidence against that possibility. Any conceivable goal that could be accomplished by a Lich Queen being Suze (whether that's by replacing an existing Suze or - more likely - by always having been Suze) could be better achieved by another hypothetical person that wouldn't have the socio-economic issues that a Lich Queen would find so grating.
