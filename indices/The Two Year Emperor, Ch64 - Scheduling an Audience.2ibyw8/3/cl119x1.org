Is it really a good idea to put the books in the ritual fires?

Even assuming they'll be forever useless, i think that there's a reasonable chance that burning the books will have a negative result.

Because burning a million books full of secrets given to you by Loki in fires feeding a nascent goddess just seems like you're not only holding an idiot ball, you're standing on it while trying to juggle chainsaws.

Those books are pretty good artifacts. Why not have some bookbinders unbind the pages, and have tailors sew the paper into anti-magic armor for the army?
