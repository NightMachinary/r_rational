The teleport marbles have a pretty terrible flaw, even if they work exactly how they're described - a single untrustworthy member of your group could teleport everyone away. Hell, a single untrustworthy /enemy/ with access to a marble could teleport everyone away. I am fairly certain that you wouldn't even get a saving throw, depending on how the wording of /Teleport/ is applied to the magic item.

I don't know whether this flaw is intentional, but I suspect that it is.
