Wait...so whomever sacrafices the books will never be able to understand the secrets they contained.

So if you take a person X and have him perform the sacrifice, can't you then regain the knowledge by simply writing down a list of things you suspect it said and having him identify the lines he can't read?

It seems like a (really destructive, potentially lossy) way to test the books for known unknowns, but also like a really great way to lose the opportunity to learn things you don't know you don't know. Sorta like Indiana Jones destroying a priceless archaeological site, full of complex engineering of amazing resilience, to steal a tacky paperweight.
