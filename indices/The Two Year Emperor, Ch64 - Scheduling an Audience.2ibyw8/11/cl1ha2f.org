Loki said that one can destroy known knowledge and what it would do is that you won't just forget it, but also be unable to understand any of it at any time in the future. This was proven to be true when Loki talked about his double agent stuff after the Emperor burnt that knowledge away. He only saw gibberish. Wouldn't that mean that whoever is the one to say the prayer and throw the books into the fire will be forever barred from knowing whatever knowledge, mystical or mundane, is in all these text books? From things like all the useful secrets about gods that they figured out on their own afterwards to whatever else Loki filled the library with. Who knows, maybe in there there is a dissertation on basic magic or the mechanics of putting food in to your mouth. Honestly, burning it sounds like the most stupid idea ever.
