It's true, that could be an issue. Mostly though, it's a question of priorities. Suze was optimizing for "will let everyone escape very quickly as long as anyone can still act" and not so much for "secure".

Also, note that she oversimplified the functionality slightly -- when you drop a marble, you are included in the teleport even though you aren't personally touching it anymore. I wondered if I should call that out, but decided it was too fussy to spend screen time on.
