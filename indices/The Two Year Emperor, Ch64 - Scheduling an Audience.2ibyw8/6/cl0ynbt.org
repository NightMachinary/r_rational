So, Jake is giving up on getting the information out of those books? Also, who is going to be at the end of the railgun? They could end up forgetting a /lot/, depending on what information is in those books. Given that Jake's sacrifice meant he forgot about the idea of scrying other planets altogether, they may not even be able to function after. Getting an Ice Assassin to do it seems a good idea.

Wait, would it even work to get someone to sacrifice the books when they don't know what's in them? All other sacrifices we've seen had the person write the thing down and sacrifice it, not sacrifice something someone else wrote down. Actually, might the person who wrote it down lose the knowledge lose it in that case? I can see this annoying Loki significantly.

Why is Jake concerned about the others discovering that he enhanced his intelligence? I can't see any reason that they'd care. He's already told them about him having jewels which can cast Wish.

Loki's mention of Expeditious Retreat seems significant, by the Law of Conservation of Detail, but I can't really see why. Neklos' land speed increasing by 30 doesn't seem particularly useful, unless he can stack it or something. And it doesn't do anything about dying.

Jake's plan remains mysterious. It clearly involves doing something to Neklos, rather than just talking, since he needs reinforcements and is worried by Neklos getting an action. But you almost explicitly said in last week's thread that Jake does not plan on killing him, and there was the issue raised about Neklos being able to foresee death. Could Jake Mindscrape Neklos? Does Mindscrape even work on a god? And since they have promised not to harm Melvin, and Neklos will be manifesting through Melvin, I don't think they can attack Neklos. The only use I can think of for the reinforcements would be to cast millions of spells at Neklos until he fails to save on at least one of them, but what spell would be useful?

Icefi's trust in Thomas' word seems strangely not paranoid. He knows that Mindscrape exists, the Landguard has access to it and the Landguard are extremely pragmatic. They would definitely use it on their leader if it let them kill Melvin, let alone Neklos.
