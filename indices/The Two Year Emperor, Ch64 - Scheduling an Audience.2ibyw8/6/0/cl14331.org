  Why is Jake concerned about the others discovering that he enhanced his intelligence?
#+end_quote

He originally concealed from them the fact that he Wished his intelligence higher. Now that he's no longer psycho he doesn't feel that he needs to have an edge to help him with his plan to kill everyone, but he isn't comfortable admitting to having hidden it from them. This gives him a simple out.

As to the rest -- these are great questions, but I can't answer them without spoilers so I will leave the answers to your fertile imagination.
