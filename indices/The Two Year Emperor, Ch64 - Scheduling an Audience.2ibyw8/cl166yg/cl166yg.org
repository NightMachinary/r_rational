Jake's smart, but he has had a *massive* failure here.

"I am imagining a magical item called the *Block of Power*. A Block of Power is a three foot by two foot by two foot block of magically invulnerable adamantine that magically weighs no more than fifteen pounds. Along one of the thin ends of the Block of Power there is an adamantine handle to facilitate the carrying of the Block. Upon the speaking of a command word, the block will magically adhere to a single flat, continuous, nonliving, hard surface against which it is placed firmly. It will remain magically stuck to this surface as if held there by sovereign glue. Another command word will release this hold. Neither the affix nor release command word will function unless the handle is firmly held by the one who speaks it. Another command word will activate the Block of Power, causing it to begin producing electrical current that meets the following criteria: [insert appropriate wattage, amperage, and direct/alternating current type]. This power is not transmitted to the surface of the *Block of Power*, which always remains magically at 71 degrees Fahrenheit. When the command word for power generation is spoken, an otherwise inaccessible compartment opens on the face of the Block opposite the adhered face. When a humanoid reaches a hand into this opening, which is always 1.5' diameter they are able to safely retrieve the female end of a well-insulated power cable of up to 200' that terminates in a standard female outlet socket that is insulated properly to prevent someone touching it from being shocked."

Seriously, with Jake's intellect he should be able to create a magical power generator that could power a completely nonmagical device that can read those books. If he phrases it correctly, he could have that device send the output out of the antimagic field. Then *shennanigans* can happen.

Off of the top of my head, a magical device that 'reads' the output of one or more microscopes and writes that output into nonmagical books (or even a single magical book). Even better, it reads them into a single magical book that has an improved version of Scholar's Touch that'll transmit the contents safely to the brain of someone touching it and speaking a command word.

Jake. Has. Free. Wishes. He also has a template for creating items with arbitrary spells, or that can cast arbitrary spells, EVEN IF THOSE SPELLS DON'T EXIST. I really don't get why he looked at the room full of all the information he needs and gave up. He hasn't even /tried/.
