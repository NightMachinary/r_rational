They're becoming better utilitarians. Grey Pilgrim is a deontologist. Things are good or bad to the degree that they are mediated by Above or Below, and no greater purpose in any action exists. Things like context and subtlety are not lost on him, but they don't matter. He wields Good as a blunt instrument, bashing the world into shape, and damn the consequences or those crushed by his club.

Cat is the exact opposite. She will make pact with demons and angels alike if it serves her purposes, and her purposes serve her vision of a stable world. Good and Evil are meaningless to her, but she wields both like a scalpel, trying to minimize the damage done in the process. Those who follow her see what she is doing and seek to emulate it, even when their natures rebel at the task.

As always, Catherine Foundling is the Breaker of Stories, and the stories she breaks the most are always those of thd people closest to her.
