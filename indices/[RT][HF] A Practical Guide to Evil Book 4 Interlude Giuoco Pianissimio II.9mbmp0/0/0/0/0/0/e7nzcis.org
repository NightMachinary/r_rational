Having a single guiding principle and ignoring parts of your own moral intuition, instead shutting up and multiplying is much closer to utilitarianism. "Evil Never Wins" isn't an ought statement, making it into one we get 'Prevent Evil From Winning,' which understanding that he doesn't give up the instant he suffers a setback we can rewrite to 'Minimize the number of times evil wins.' Which is closer to a utility function than a list of rules.

Deontologists are typically characterized by having multiple, possibly conflicting moral principles, as demonstrated most famously in the trolley problem- "don't commit any action that kills people" clashing with "save as many lives as you can."
