Hakram 2020!

Also, Adjutant is a new Name. No one has had it before. It's also unaligned. I think that's a core thing about the Woe vs. the Calamities.

The Calamities:

1. The Black Knight (Evil)
2. Warlock (Evil)
3. Ranger (Neutral)
4. Assassin (Evil)
5. Captain (Neutral) (I'm guessing this isn't an exclusively Praesi Name but I could be wrong)

The Woe

1. Catherine (formerly Squire thus evil... now just something else, but Winter related so still evil.)
2. The Apprentice (Evil) --> Heirophant (Neutral)
3. Archer (Neutral)
4. Adjutant (Neutral)
5. Thief (Good/Neutral)\\

The Woe have been moving away from Evil Names throughout the series. The Calamities subverted their evil names but didn't change them.
