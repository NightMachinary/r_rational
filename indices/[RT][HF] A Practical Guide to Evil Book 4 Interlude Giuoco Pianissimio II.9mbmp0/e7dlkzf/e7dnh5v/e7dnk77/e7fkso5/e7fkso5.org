  the "Squire" Name can go Black Knight or White Knight
#+end_quote

I don't think that this is the same thing as the Squire name being a Neutral name being "neutral", as in something that's /neither/ Good/Evil or from Above/Below. Rather, Squire is something that can /either/ be Good or Evil (but is going to be leaning in one direction / given by one side).

For instance, when Cat gets the Name, it's made pretty clear that it's a Villainous Role given by the God's Below. See Cat constantly talking abut how she was given it by the Gods Below, how the Name pushed back against a redemption story, how every character talks about Cat's position, or these WOGs:

#+begin_quote
  “The Squire Role isn't always Evil, no. It largely depends on who they'll be squiring for, though anyone squiring for Black is going to be Evil. Catherine taking the shortcut he offered made that a done deal: since he effectively used his own Name to kickstart hers, there's going to be bleed over in several ways. As for the possibility of a “good” Squire, for that kind of a Name to appear there'd need to be an equivalent to the Black Knight out and about. ~~ /Erratic Errata 1.9/

and

#+begin_quote
  the Name tricks displayed so far are something pretty much every Named can do with a little training, save for the necromancy -- which is for Evil Names only, and not all of them. ~~ /Erratic Errata 2.4/

#+begin_quote
  Ranger is explicitly neutral
#+end_quote

Not quite?

The only real evidence I can find for this is that Black said:

#+begin_quote
  “Calling Ranger a villain is something of a stretch,” my own teacher finally said. “She's not particularly concerned with matters of Good and Evil. Mostly, she does what she feels like doing. We can discuss it more later, Catherine -- it's a somewhat complicated issue.”
#+end_quote

back in 2.11. Which isn't saying that she's not a villain, it's saying that it's complicated. But the Name was presumably given by one side, unless there's a whole other set of gods we've never heard of (Gods To-The-Side?).

Whether that name came from Above or Below, well, there's only one set of Gods that's okay with people just doing what they feel like doing:

#+begin_quote
  “The influence of the gods is usually on the subtle side. You're right that Evil Roles usually let people do whatever they feel like doing -- that's because they're, in that sense, championing the philosophy of their gods. Every victory for Evil is a proof that that philosophy is the right path for Creation to take.

  ...

  Good Roles have strict moral guidelines because those Names are, in fact, being guided: those rules are instructions from above on how to behave to make a better world. Any victory for Good that follows from that is then a proof of concept for the Heavens being correct in their side of the argument” ~~ /Erratic Errata 1.12/
#+end_quote

That said, Names certainly seem to be able to shift away from the alignment they're given. There's all the redemption stories thrown at Cat, or Thief's transition to Villain-hood.
