I don't think the Bard is a hero at all. She seems to work against Evil most of the time, but it's implied that her motivations are entirely her own. Neshamah referring to her as Intercessor also implies that her Role is to foster...communication? Between the sides. In any case, her Name works entirely differently from anyone else's in that it makes her absolutely, conceptually immortal even if she doesn't want to be. Always being wherever the Story is regardless of whether she wants to be also implies that she is supposed to be a kind of observer. She is the recorder, and the record, of the Bet of Creation.
