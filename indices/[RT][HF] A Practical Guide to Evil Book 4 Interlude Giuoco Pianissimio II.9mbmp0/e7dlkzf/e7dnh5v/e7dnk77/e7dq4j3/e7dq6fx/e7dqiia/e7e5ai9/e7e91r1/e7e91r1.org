I think the Wandering Bard is the Game Master figure.

Her name is that of a narrator, she pops in and out rarely having a direct impact on events, and she has generally acted to escalate the conflict between good and evil. Could be she's acting as a moderator/judge for the contest the gods are having and her role is mainly to nudge things towards the eventual resolution by preventing long periods of coexistence between good and evil.
