It was my understanding that Roles and Names were never directly or explicitly created by the Gods, Above or Below. Paraphrasing, since my recall is imperfect, the first chapter said something like, "Eventually, the pattern repeated often enough that grooves were worn into the fabric of Creation, so that the stories happened more easily with each cycle."

Named are referred to as Blessed or Cursed, as Gifted or Damned, but that's the religion of the mortals showing. It's not a confirmation that the Gods are deciding who gets which Name. I'm pretty sure that the whole Role and Name mechanics are what we'd call emergent behavior. The Gods didn't plan for it when they set up creation, but it's kinda cool, so why patch it out?
