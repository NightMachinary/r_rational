I don't think so - that goes against the premise. I think it's more like Creation was explicitly set up as a substrate to run narratives on, with individuals gaining culturally-established Roles, and then the Gods Above and Below investing those Roles with extra power. So you've got three layers - mundane creation, the place where things happen - setting. The narrative layer, the place where Roles get worn in - plot, and to some extent character. The Name layer, where the Gods have their say - this supercharges the character aspects of the Narrative layer by granting distinct Aspects. Arcadia is basically a high-energy prototype of Creation, where instead of having the Gods invest through the Name layer, there's just a ton of power tied up in Roles, aligned to fluid dualities rather than Good and Evil. Kind of a proof-of-concept. The devs screwed up and didn't sandbox it right, which is why you can get arbitrary courtier execution in Arcadia from Creation. There's no way that will be a problem, though, it would take a one-in-a-million chance to set up circumstances so that a potent Arcadian mantle... would... become invested in a. Creation native.
