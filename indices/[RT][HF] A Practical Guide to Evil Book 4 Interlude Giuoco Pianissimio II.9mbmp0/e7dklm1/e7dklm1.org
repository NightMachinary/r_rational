"I bet my hand on the new age." - +Shanks+ Hakram

I feel like Hakram will have a lot of things to talk about with Cat once she gets back. I do wonder how exactly any of their decisions might have changed if they listened to Vivi. Wasn't she an advocate of the bonfine plan?

This also ties in a nice parallel to Grey Pilgrim's words : "Your people are being warped by your presence", but it's actually more along the lines of "becoming better people".
