I'm interested to see what she proposes, because, up until this point, I really do think her status as an obstacle has been entirely her own fault. She's objected to plenty of plans, but I can't think of a time she's provided a workable alternative prior to her suggestion in Zwischenzug. Hakram is hearing her out, but by the end of this chapter, all she delivered was some useless moralizing. Ball's in your court, Viv. Prove me wrong.
