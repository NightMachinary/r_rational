Summary:

- Here, have some more worldbuilding
- Thief finds it reassuring that Hakram randomly cut his own hand off in the middle of a conversation without providing any explanation
- Thief is important because she values Cat's vision of a better world and isn't as willing as the rest of the Woe to set it aside in the name of expediency
- She's also important because she's the head of the intelligence service
- She doesn't value herself and apparently no one else does either because they've mostly been ignoring her
- The author doesn't value her much either, since the update shows her complaining and then cuts away as she starts saying things that are important and relevant to her character

Good Lord, could we /please/ get back to the actual plot?!
