Short chapter. I wish there'd been more on how the Protectorate alternately stifles and aids in Parahuman uses of powers in the civilian side of things. There are some implications in canon and WoG that governments try to reduce the economic disruption of powers by stopping capes from using their powers in the private sector, which I thought this section was hinting at, but it was pretty short.

Good part at the end with the way good people cooperate.
