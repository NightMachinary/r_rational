That's Amy-tier bad reasoning. It's not implausible for people to be that stupid, but seeing an [RST] tag sets my expectations for non-brain-deadness of characters to certain levels, and I'm disappointed when they don't live up to them. You'd think someone who strongly self-identifies as intelligent would have enough intelligence not to play meaningless status games for zero benefit.

I can kind of see her doing it just for father's sake, but it doesn't sit well with me. I wouldn't behave like that, but, more importantly, I'd rather read the drama involved in Taylor having arguments with her father about it, than about her meekly getting into bad deals with Piggot and wasting her time on useless bullshit.

Well, nothing to be done about it, I guess. Hopefully some arsehole comes along and informs her of the opportunity costs (preferably measured in dead children) associated with her school bullshit. Would make for a satisfying "The Reason You Suck" speech at the very least.
