Honestly, that type of bad reasoning isn't the exception, it's the rule. It also isn't conscious, it's almost entirely sub-deliberative, manifested in flinch reactions and nebulous feelings. If you don't spend a significant amount of time regularly investigating your mind and double checking your plans for flaws like that, you'll never notice they exist and never have even a chance of getting better. We just have high enough standards that the typical main characters of stories in this subreddit would never make a mistake like that.

EDIT: So, I guess what I was trying to say was that, yes, it is a hilariously bad way to reason, but it's also really common, so it's entirely realistic that even a smart and somewhat rational person could make that type of mistake.
