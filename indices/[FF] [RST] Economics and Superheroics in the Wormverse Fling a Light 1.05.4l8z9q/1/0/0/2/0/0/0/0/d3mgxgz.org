You can't just open up a portal between transport hubs on different continents. I mean, you can, but you shouldn't, because you'd be violating a huge number of laws, and on top of the laws that you'd be explicitly violating, you'd be violating the /spirit/ of a whole lot more laws.

If your portal goes from Brockton Bay to Cologne, you're dealing with:

- Invasive species laws in both countries.
- Two sets of city, state, and country taxes.
- Customs offices in two countries.
- Border security in two countries.

I don't see any way that you could get it done without a team of lawyers and another team of accountants. If you just place a portal without taking any of that into consideration ... well, it depends on what the legal landscape is like in the Wormverse, but at the very least you would make a lot of people very unhappy with you -- all people who you need to keep a transport operation going, assuming that you need it to be legal (which Taylor does). Go in half-cocked once, and you make doing it legitimately a whole lot more difficult. And at the worst, you get arrested for violation of ... let's start with the sanitary plant protection code and work our way up from there.

I mean, I agree that Taylor had better things to do than staying in school, but problems are /hard/, she needs help, and there are very real costs to trying to diversify. I think it was very sensible for Phase 1 to focus on a single industry.
