I think you're overstating the rawness of the deal she got (or more accurately, I got a bit melodramatic in the text). She takes her afternoon classes off to use her power for the PRT, likely while sitting down in a nice little room, with lunch provided and regularly scheduled breaks. Then she has a shift, no more than you'd expect of a part time job, in which she does the same thing again, and which can't interrupt her sleep or free time without bringing down the wrath of the Youth Guard. If there's an emergency, to whatever degree Piggot can manage to stretch the definition of "emergency", they can call her in the middle of the night and ask her to come in for half an hour.

Her power doesn't really lend itself to strenuous tasks, and the canonical rules for what you can and can't make a minor do are surprisingly strict. Compared to dropping out of school (scare chord) (thunder in background) it's a pretty reasonable choice.
