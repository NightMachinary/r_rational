I haven't read the fic beyond the first chapter when it began (I was actually checking the comments here to see if I should), but beyond her father's sake, I'd think staying in school for her /mother's/ would make more sense. Annette was an English professor. I could easily buy a line of reasoning where her mother had imparted a sense of the value of school and graduation as an end in and of itself. "Dead mother's most sincere wish for her daughter's future" has enough sentimental value to overcome an enormous opportunity cost to staying in school.
