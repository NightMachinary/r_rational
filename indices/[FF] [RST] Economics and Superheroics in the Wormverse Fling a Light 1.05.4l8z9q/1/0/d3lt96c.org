For someone who strongly self-identifies as intelligent and upstanding, doing something as low-status as dropping out of school is very difficult. To Taylor, dropping out is something gang kids and would-be prostitutes do (oh my!), and in doing so herself she'd be associating herself with a thing associated with a bad thing, and thereby associating herself with a bad thing.

Besides that, her father would /never/ be okay with it, even if she were bringing in ten million dollars a day. All those arguments go even further for him, since he's had decades longer to associate school with virtue and dropping out with its absence.
