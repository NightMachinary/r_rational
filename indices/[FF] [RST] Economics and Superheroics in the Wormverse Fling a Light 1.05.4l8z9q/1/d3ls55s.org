Taylor's insistence on returning to school continues to grate on me. I mean, she mentions how much of a waste of time it is each time it gets brought up, so why the fuck is she still doing it? She's literally signing up to waste her time ferrying heroes for the sake of being able to go waste time in (a more prestigious) school. What, does she think that her secret hero identity will not be able to find work because she doesn't have a school certificate? It would have been more believable if she was shown to have some incredibly important reason to not just drop out, but I just don't buy that explaining her situation and motivation to her father is that fucking hard for her. I guess I can just chalk it up to her being an idiot, but I was hoping to be able to hold her to a higher standard.
