YES! The Update schedule is on the track!

I am definitely liking Mr Chesterfields good wins reasons, it goes in line with rationalist "coop mode is best mode" ideas.

I am liking the fact that organisation and regulations are such great obstacles, from a "realistic/goody two shoes" perspective. But u also hate it from a heroic "just fix the world" point. And what the heck happened to Ms. Gaunthier and driver girl, did she plan to torture her for fucking around on their drive to boss?

Overall good, minor mistake/tidbit:

  However, with your help, obviously that changes. However there isn't time to get money.....
#+end_quote

Repeating "however" is slighty jarring and reads on first pass as a copy error. Maybe change second "however" to "but" or "unfortunately"

VERY IMPORTANT REQUEST: I've said this to other people before, but I must repeat it to you. Please, pretty pretty please with sugar on top: Whenever you post a new chapter of fic, add a small summary of previous events and general plot, just to jog readers memory a bit. This is especially important in cases such as yours, where there is a big gap between updates.
