I hadn't read this before, but I'm guessing it's Taylor with Doormaker's power, or something approximately equivalent, and she can apparently make portals permanent?

Hmm. It's definitely a power with a lot of scope for expansion, much like the original. She hasn't figured out [[http://grrlpowercomic.com/archives/1689][how to use it to cancel momentum]], yet, and her chaining technique needs work. Not to mention options such as having a low-poly costume and learning to build similarly-shaped sets of portals which open onto the interior of mountains or oceans, thus giving her shielding, effective multipresence (multiple construct bodies), and psionic shielding via routing her senses through a telepresence rig instead of directly.

She's figured out how to summon wind, but not that she can equally summon anything there's a pile of under pressure somewhere. Water, lava, oil. Or, "somewhere" being "somewhere she has set up previously", tanks of anything, either raw or via the tip of a hose/dispenser. Gases, liquids, fuel, icecream.

Or have portals to the business ends of a whole lot of auto-loading weaponry, with their triggers being touchpads a millimeter from her fingers (or toes, if she wants to use the Bakuda ruse).

And of course she should have a cave/warehouse of useful things she can reach into from anywhere. Everything from grenades to legal paperwork to spare burner phones.

Not to mention that /she can see the moon/ but hasn't gotten around to building a base there.

And of course mini-portals are great for tracking people if they don't have cape-level evasion options. I keep wanting to tell her to track things like drugs back to their sources, steal everything from the top dogs' houses in one fell swoop, and use the money and non-drug supplies to get started on her world-changing plans. "Hey railroad guys, need money? Here's five cubic yards of cash in plastic wrap on pallets."
