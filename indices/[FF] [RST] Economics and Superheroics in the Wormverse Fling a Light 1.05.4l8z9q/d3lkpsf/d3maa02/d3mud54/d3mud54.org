If they had to be refreshed daily, I'm not sure that a transport company would want to build their services around portals. All it would take would be one miscommunication, one falling-out, one bit of corporate headhunting, or Taylor stepping in front of a bus to completely wreck the company in 24 hours flat.

The only company which would ever go for hanging everything on a single person, even a cape, would be a company owned by that person or a company which was super-desperate (as in this story) but also looking to eventually transition as far away from that model as possible.

Either the portals are semi-permanent, or the company is only considering Taylor as an extremely temporary emergency measure, or something else is going on.
