Hmm. Good point about Annette. Still, sometimes the sentimental mush is not really worth it. I hardly think that Taylor places such a huge terminal value on attending school, that the decision is a deliberate one and was made with decent understanding of the trade-offs involved. It looks more like she's just being an idiot, which is quite disappointing in a rationalist work.

Room to grow is good too, though, so I'm not too salty about this. Sooner or later she'll have to realise how much of an idiot she is being right now.
