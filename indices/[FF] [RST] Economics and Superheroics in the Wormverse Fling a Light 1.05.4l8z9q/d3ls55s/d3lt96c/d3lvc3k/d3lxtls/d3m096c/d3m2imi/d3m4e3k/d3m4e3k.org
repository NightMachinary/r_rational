I don't buy that. Surely the global transport market isn't so small that she has exhausted all her options already.

And if major transport companies are being such slow-pokes, maybe the thing to do is to just go ahead and open a portal between some transport hubs on different continents. Give the big guys some incentive to move quickly, when they start seeing enterprising chaps laying tracks through an intercontinental portal, while they're busy trying to find levers big enough to prise their heads out of their arses.

Certainly you can't be implying that she literally has nothing better to do with her time than go to school? I mean, did she talk to people about getting stuff into/out of Earth's orbit? To other planets? Safe, easy and free energy generation? There are plenty of applications besides shipping stuff. Just going to hang out with some engineers and scientists and brain-storm for different applications seems like a very damn obvious idea. She wouldn't even have to get in contact with prestigious big names, just hitting an irc channel would do for starters.
