#+begin_quote
  This seems interesting, so I went and found it. First, it's not your most controversial post (though I don't really care about that), and second, saying:
#+end_quote

I guess I wasn't clear? My bad, anyway, I picked 2 posts and one/a few comments I shortened here for brevity.. That was 1 post, medieval whatever was one or a couple comments (Not related to either of these posts), and the pants thing was another post.

The comment part I talked is actually my most controversial post / comment.
