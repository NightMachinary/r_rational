Book was okay. I can't say it's best sci fi or even great sci fi frankly. I suppose the amount of things they just want you to take on faith was too much for me. If you can stomach that many conceits, like the fact that Ender family somehow birthed not one, not two, but three geniuses that are somehow superhuman in ability then I suppose it would seem better.
