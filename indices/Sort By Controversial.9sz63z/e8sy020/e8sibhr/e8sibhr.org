  Any predictive network doubles as a generative network. If you teach a neural net to recognize dogs, you can run it in reverse to get dog pictures. If you train a network to predict Reddit upvotes, you can run it in reverse to generate titles it predicts will be highly upvoted. We tried this and it was pretty funny. I don't remember the exact wording, but for [[/r/politics]] it was something like “Donald Trump is no longer the president. All transgender people are the president.” For [[/r/technology][r/technology]] it was about Elon Musk saving Net Neutrality.
