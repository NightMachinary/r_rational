A certain percentage of people would always choose the type of downvote that harms the account the most.

E.g. if "I disagree" and "this makes me mad" only change the points of a given comment, but "this doesn't contribute" results in the well-known "wait 10 minutes to comment again", they will always choose the latter. And if "this is spam" flags from 5 different accounts result in a 24 hour ban, then they will choose that one.

And those people are also the kind of people who vote the most.
