The downvote system is just so bullshit, really. The fact that you get automatically flagged for getting too much negative "karma" in a subreddit and have to wait 10 minutes between posts is rather annoying.

Much rather they do away with it entirely and just have an upvote system, or have a downvote system that actually doesn't do anything. That way, all the "unpopular" posts just naturally sink to the bottom by all the upvoted posts. Also have a report system for actual spambots.
