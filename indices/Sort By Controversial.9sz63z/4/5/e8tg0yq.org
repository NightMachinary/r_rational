My most controversial comment was telling some people complaining Patrick Rothfuss isn't dedicating 100% of his time to writing the next kkc book to take it down a few notches.

Second most controversial one is me not buying into the idea that 4 dimensionsal creatures are automatically terrifying to those of us stuck in 3 dimensions.
