It's not universal - I have read better books. But, while it could be a matter of taste, it could also be the result of higher standards. I'm interested because as far as I know there /isn't/ a maximum, so when someone says they don't like a book I like, maybe they've been reading /much/ better books - and I am very interested in reading those.
