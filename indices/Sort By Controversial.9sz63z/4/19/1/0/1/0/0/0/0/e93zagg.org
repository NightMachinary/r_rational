I think it's popular because it does some things that aren't done too often. The aliens don't speak English initially/,/ and they're different from humans; the protagonist is young, but things aren't 0% dark (work for your 'happy' ending); and if you're part of an alliance against a common enemy, do you really want to win?

It's also something I read as a kid, and it's possible I wouldn't have liked it as much if I read it later.
