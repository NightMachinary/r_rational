  "the best way not to be outsmarted was not to *play the game*"

  ARGH! I just lost the game!

  Ha, ha, ha...I'm just joking, I don't actually play the game, but was that a reference to it?

I was reading chapter 19 of /Lighting Up the Dark/ when it was posted here and thought Velorien put in a reference to the game-meme. It turns out that they were referencing the quote "the only winning move is not to play".

I got down-voted for me making other people lose the game. Thanks for bringing up the game, /again/.
