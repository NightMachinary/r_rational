1st) On a meme on the subreddit for an alternate history mod of a WW2 video game (Kaiserreich), saying that Sir Oswald Mosley makes a better queen for a Kaiserreich themed chess image than Rosa.

3rd) On another Kaiserreich meme, a post which was just the word "WE"

4th) (First non-Kaiserreich example), a post saying small ships in star wars (x-wings and the like) have always been disproportionately good for the presumed resource investment compared to capital ships, so while TLJ made that worse with lightspeed kamikaze it was an expansion on an existing plot hole.
