I think Penn Jillette said it great:

(paraphrasing) "If someone killed a member of my family, you can bet that I would be furious. I would want to kill them with my bare hands and yell and scream at them for what they did to my loved one. But the point of having a society is that we are better than a mere sum of our parts, that we aren't just angry monkeys murdering each other because we can set rules in our rational moments. So even though I'd want to kill that motherfucker, it makes me very, very happy that society would hold me back from it."

But yeah, I know other people have different opinions. I guess I have trouble relating to vengence, which is weird as I've got a very vengeful/spiteful sort of attitude IRL
