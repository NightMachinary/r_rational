A comment on one of the early chapters of EY's /Inadequate Equilibria/:

#+begin_quote
  Is Inadequate Equilibria an elaborate way for EY to come out as a neoreactionary? Decisionmakers having skin in the game, sovereignty and exit, (meta-)competition, the downsides of majority rule incentives, the inability of current systems to create coordination...the only thing missing is that magical word: "selection". Unless his answer is "FAI will solve all of this", where else could he be going? In any case, can't wait to see where this ends up.
