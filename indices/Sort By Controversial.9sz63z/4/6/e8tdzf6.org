  *Assuming we are in a simulation. Would time travel be possible?*

  Physics tells us that we can't do it. But if we are in a simulation, should it not be possible to at least go back inside it

  (even if it's just to watch events and not change anything).

  Unless the computer is autodeleting the data and just keeping the data from this exact moment, should we not be able to?

  Assuming it isn't against the simulation rules.

  We seem to only be worried about finding out if we are real, but we are not taking into consideration the possibilities such thing would create for us.

  *Why did the ancients all around the world prefer not to wear pants?*

  Greece, Rome, Egypt, Minoans, Ancient Israeli, Ancient Chinese, Ancient Indians.

  Even after they knew about pants, they still saw them as uncivilized, barbaric and ridiculous.

  Was it just stubborn tradition?

  Were they just clinging to a sense of uniqueness?

  BTW we have this image of man on the ice age wearing pants, is that actually not true? Were they wearing robes even in the cold?

  If they were wearing pants then, to protect against the cold, shouldn't traditional clothing have been pants all over the world?

  Why would they lose that custom seemingly for no reason and start wearing robes?
