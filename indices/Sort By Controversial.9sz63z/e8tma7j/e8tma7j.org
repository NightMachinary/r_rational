An excellent story!

One possible flaw is that the second list would've been calibrated with the entire country population as its target group, not fine-tuned for one specific person. And there would be plenty of people in that set for whom the statements ranked #1--#3 would've been just irrelevant, even those for whom the entire list would've be irrelevant [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality][(e.g.).]] In other words, the network was trained to generate the most controversial statements for that target group, not the most controversial statement for /all/ members of that group.

This is not an outright plot hole for the story, since the narrator could've easily just not been lucky enough to be one of such people, but I think the story should've touched on this at least with a few sentences or a paragraph.
