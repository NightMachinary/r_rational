Mine was answering why Last Man Standing was getting a revival when Brooklyn 99 got canned at Fox, that there were plenty of people who "just wanted safe conservative white people humor." with the posted source that "my (soon to be) ex-wife ate it up, alongside crappy reality shows and Angry Birds."

In retrospect, my view may have seemed (been) /slightly/ biased towards my then active frustration and resentment towards said ex-wife.
