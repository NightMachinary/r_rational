Movie was trash, I agree there. But while the book was by no means perfect, it's one of the best sci fi novels to come out in a long time. And I actually think it's one that should appeal to most rationalist readers (given a little willingness to buy into conceits of the universe, like the fact that their training station is the best way to train military genius'). None of the bad guys have irrational goals or desires (besides the normal irrationality of hormonal teenagers), people mostly take actions that, within the rules of the universe, help their goals. A lot of the psychology that underpins the novel is sketchy at best, but that's the type of thing I'm willing to give a book as long as it remains relatively consistent within it's own universe. Plus it has an interesting example of orange-blue morality with the buggers not being able to comprehend that individuals are moral beings worthy of consideration
