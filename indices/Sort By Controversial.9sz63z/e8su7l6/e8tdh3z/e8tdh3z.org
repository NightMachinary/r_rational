My most controversial post is me asking people in the subreddit I moderate to act like human beings, which actually doesn't surprise me.

My second most controversial comment is me stating my opinion on Adnan Syed's prison sentence:

  Even if he's guilty, the sentence was far, far too long for the crime in my opinion. I mean yes, a human being is dead, and there are few tragedies that can compare to that, but justice shouldn't be about punishment, it should be about rehabilitation and whether the perpetrator is a threat to the community.

Which is apparently a Shiri Scissor because I still 100% stand behind that and can't fathom how someone would think differently!
