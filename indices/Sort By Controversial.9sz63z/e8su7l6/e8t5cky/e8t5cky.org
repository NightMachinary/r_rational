My most controversial was about how Bernie really wasn't that close to winning the primary and that most democratic voters wanted Hillary, and she didn't win because of a secret cabal or conspiracy, she won because she was the more popular candidate.

My third most controversial comment was saying that men's opinions on whether or not abortion should be legal were as valid as women's opinions. I also pointed out that since men and women have nearly the same proportional views on abortion, believing this doesn't change the national discussion on abortion 1 iota.

If you asked me to guess from a list of which of my comments would be the most controversial, those two would certainly be up there.
