I sort by controversial a lot, and most of what you get is:

- People being really self-righteous
- Low-effort statements (which I imagine are upvoted by people who are upvote-happy, and downvoted as useless noise)
- People who were initially upvoted, then downvoted due to shifting opinions with increased views and/or being called out.
- People with opinions that go against the hivemind for that subreddit

Also, this:

#+begin_quote
  You can also generate titles that will get maximum downvotes, but this is boring: it will just say things that sound like spam about penis pills.
#+end_quote

Is wrong. Spam gets downvoted until it's below the threshold for views, then no one sees it or feels compelled to vote on it. The /actual/ most downvoted posts are those that get linked from elsewhere ("brigaded"), driving people to come in specifically to downvote.
