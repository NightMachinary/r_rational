I should rephrase. The technical details about how the Scissors function don't make a lot of sense. I don't have a lot of experience with machine learning, but I'm pretty sure you can't just reverse a predictive network to generate content.

That being said, I found this to be an interesting take on the human psychology of controversial statements and how it interacts with society at large. I am a strong believer that most people are fundamentally decent and that most controversial is the result of a differing set of fundamental axioms which, when applied to current events, result in massively differing opinions. The tribal nature of an us-vs-them mentality which can be seen so strongly in modern day politics also comes into play. So the idea that there exist basic statements that seem either fundamentally correct or fundamentally incorrect based on your initial set of axioms makes sense to me, and the idea that that would quickly devolve into escalation based on which side of the fence you fall is plausible.
