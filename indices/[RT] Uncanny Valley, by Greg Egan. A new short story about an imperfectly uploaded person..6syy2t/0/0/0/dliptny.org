That scene--specifically the screenplay edit--also explains why the "new" Adam was unable to replicate his predecessor's talent. [[#s][Spoiler]]

As an aside, I liked the indirectness of the reveal. It felt very believable that the original would withhold the "obvious" reveals, but overlook seemingly innocuous memories that obliquely reference the event.
