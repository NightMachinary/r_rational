Great story and character, but one glaring critique: most of the references were a little too rooted in present day (google, facebook, deep-learning algos, self-driving cars, drones, etc).

I understand only the mind-upload tech is central to the story, but it's as if the world froze in time around 2019 and /only/ the upload tech advanced.
