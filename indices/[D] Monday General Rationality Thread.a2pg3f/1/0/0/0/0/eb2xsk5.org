It's not as much as facts, and more of a way of thinking and how to apply it.. Here's an example of how I applied some of it.

I made a list of the games I play frequently, rated them by how much fun they are consistently, added a few addendums, like minimum playtime necessary, can it be played while watching things on my second monitor or podcast listening etc.

Made a simple equation and sorted them based on the ones that give me the most fun per hour and the ones that give me the least.

You know the old 20 of X (in this case of games) give you 80 percent of Z (in this case fun). This made it easier to define which games I should spend more time on, which games I should play less or stop etc..

As you can see this can be applied to anything, even games, and without reading this book and applying it, this concept would have continued to be some exoteric knowledge I have, but don't use for anything other than using it in hindsight to explain things and sound knowledgeable in discussions.
