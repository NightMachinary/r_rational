    A lunar colony will need to be industrial.
  #+end_quote

  That's the problem I'm trying to avoid. If a self sustaining lunar colony must be industrial, it places the minimum population size for human self-sufficiency on the order of tens of thousands of people. You'd need metal workers, miners, smelters, mechanics, electricians, glass blowers, computer fabrication, etc. etc.

You're probably best off choosing a subset of industrial technology rather than avoiding it altogether. You definitely don't need computers. I'd try looking at the minimal way to make a high temperature solar-powered furnace; once you have a good way to melt things you have a lot more options for resources. Anything that makes farming less labor-intensive also has a huge impact, since any time spent farming is time spent not doing things that aren't farming (that's a tautology but this ends up being a useful way to understand what a civilization is capable of).

  Wouldn't the lunar colonists be trapped on the moon forever now?
#+end_quote

You'll need a way to bootstrap up to a larger population size. Water is the biggest limiting factor so you'll need to settle near a pole and melt that. [[http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/enginelist.php#al02rocket][Aluminum-oxygen rockets]] are apparently a good choice for getting off the moon.

Rocket science isn't /that/ complicated - you just need metal, propellant, and math. If you're just trying to get someone to Earth I don't think it's too outlandish (it's a lot easier than the other way around). If you want to head anywhere else you need to solve a whole lot of engineering problems that haven't been solved yet even using the Earth's resources.
