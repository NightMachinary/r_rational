I've been trying to think through the problem of a self-sustaining lunar colony. It's not as easy as it sounds, because a self-sustaining colony doesn't just need the ability to create more air, food, water, power. It needs the ability to /make/ the things that make more air, food, water, power. And to make space suits. And mining equipment. And metal tools.

What I've got so far is this:

1) The colony needs to relocate underground immediately. Lunar dirt provides a way to retain atmosphere that can be infinitely expanded to meet the needs of the colony without requiring the continued existence of space-proof suits. This also saves the colonists from all dying of deadly radiation over years of living.

2) A sort of genetically modified palm tree could be used to extract energy from the sun. The tree's leaves are the only part that stick above the lunar surface, and are heavily coated in transparent wax to prevent a lose of water to vacuum. The tree's trunk is extends down some 10-15 meters into the lunar regolith, with the roots coming out of the roof of the human's living caves. Gas exchange of carbon dioxide-> oxygen happens at the roots, and AOX provides heat to the colonists.

3) Humans eat the bark of the air trees for sustenance?

Several problems though:

1) How do the air trees reproduce? The humans can't get near the surface without being sucked into space, yet without the light of the sun no sapling can grow big enough to both have leaves poking through the surface and roots in the human caves.

2) The hydrology cycle is totally wack. Everyone dies of thirst in the first week.

3) Wouldn't the lunar colonists be trapped on the moon forever now? Even if they flourished, and riddled the moon with a maze of tunnels and air trees, how are they ever going to start building rocket ships under these conditions?
