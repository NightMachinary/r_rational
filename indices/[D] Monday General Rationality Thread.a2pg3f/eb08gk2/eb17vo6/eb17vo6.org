The trees aren't going to work. A lunar day lasts about two weeks, and surface temperatures would easily be high enough during the day and low enough at night to kill the trees, even assuming they could survive in a vacuum. You're right to build underground, but the main benefit is the thermal mass of the regolith above you to help maintain stable temperatures.

A lunar colony will need to be industrial. You'll need mining, refining, and construction equipment. Your food can come from hydroponic farms using artificial lighting. For locally-sourced water, your only option is to collect it in tiny quantities from polar craters as ice. You'll want to recycle it religiously, because it's not easy to come by, and only naturally sticks around in areas which are in permanent shade. Aside from water, your other big limiter is carbon. Everything else is fairly abundant - almost all of the rocks are oxides, so you can easily extract oxygen in the course of mining and refining materials to expand your base.
