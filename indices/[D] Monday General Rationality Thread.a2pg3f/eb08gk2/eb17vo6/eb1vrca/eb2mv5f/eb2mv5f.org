  Couldn't they just make the tree operate like winter trees on Earth, cutting off its leaves in the cold (or in the extreme hot in this case) and re-connecting them to the trunk when temperatures become more reasonable? The overwhelming majority of the mass of these trees would be buried under dirt, only the tippy tops would stick out.

In two week cycles with temperatures more extreme than anywhere on Earth, and in a vacuum? No. Even if you could, water losses from the plants via evaporation and sublimation at extreme temperatures would make it completely impractical considering how scarce water is on the moon.

  That's the problem I'm trying to avoid. If a self sustaining lunar colony must be industrial, it places the minimum population size for human self-sufficiency on the order of tens of thousands of people. You'd need metal workers, miners, smelters, mechanics, electricians, glass blowers, computer fabrication, etc. etc.

Humanity depends on large societies with specialized labor. I don't think it would require tens of thousands of people though, maybe a hundred or so. Let's make a list. I'll start off with what you've listed, add some more, you can fill in any gaps you can think of, and the next person fills in any gaps they can think of, etc.

- Miners

- Smelting furnace operators

- Industrial maintenance mechanics

- General mechanics

- HVAC mechanics

- Electricians

- Electronics technicians

- Glass blowers

- Semiconductor fabrication technologists

- Metallurgists

- Machinists

- Mold-makers

- Tool-makers

- Die-makers

- Welders

- Pipe fitters

- Plumbers

- Mechanical engineers

- Chemical engineers

- Electrical engineers

- Materials engineers

- Mining engineers

- Engineering technologists

- Engineering technicians

- Construction workers

- Heavy equipment operators

- Automation technicians

- CNC machine tool programmers

- Wastewater treatment plant operators

- Chemical plant operators

- Avionics technicians

- Hydroponic cultivation specialists

That doesn't look terrible so far.
