You need to get your work area hot enough to melt lunar rock and pull the iron out. That sounds hard to accomplish with mirrors, but there are advantages to trying it on the moon (no atmosphere, so you can make your array as big as you like).

If you can accomplish it with just mirrors made of glass and iron, then it's self-supporting, since those are things you can get by skilled application of digging up rocks and putting them in a furnace.
