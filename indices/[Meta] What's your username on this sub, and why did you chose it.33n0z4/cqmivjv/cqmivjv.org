Avret:\\
This goes back a while...In my first playthrough of skyrim(still one of my all time favorite games) I named my character Avret the Executioner...no idea how I thought of it. I thought the name sounded cool, so used it for many things in the interim, and then decided to post my fanfics under it. To preserve continuity I use the same name on reddit(My lessWrong username's different because I created it 5 months or so before I started using Avret for everything).
