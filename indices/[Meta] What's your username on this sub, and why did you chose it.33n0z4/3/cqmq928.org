I choose xamueljones, because I like to have a normal name with the first letter switched out for an uncommon letter (J, Q, X, Z). For example, I would take Richard and change it to Qichard. Hence Samuel had s switched out with an x.

Names where no (sane) parent would ever name their child feel weird to use. That goes double for usernames with numbers at the end. I suspect that people who don't put a decent amount of time (a few minutes at least) into picking a name tend to treat politeness in social interactions on an online communities as a suggestion instead of a necessity. If you aren't going to care how you are perceived by others through your username, then you aren't going to care if others get offend by what you say or do.

I added jones to the end and made the name lower-case to subtly honor [[/u/alexanderwales]] because he was the one to lead me to [[/r/rational]] and reddit in general via [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9915682/1/The-Last-Christmas][The Last Christmas]]. By matching his style of all lower caps and a first-last name, I can pattern my username after 'alexanderwales' without being too similar.
