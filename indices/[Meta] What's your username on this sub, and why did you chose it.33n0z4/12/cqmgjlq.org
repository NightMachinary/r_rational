- The name of my first (attempted) romantic interest was fairly closely related to the location of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krakatoa][the volcano Krakatoa]].

- In the old Lego toyline [[http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/BIONICLE][Bionicle]], of which I was quite a fan when younger, the protagonists held the title of Toa--they were called in full "Toa Lewa", "Toa Gali", "Toa Tahu", etc. There was also a shapeshifting enemy named Krahka.
