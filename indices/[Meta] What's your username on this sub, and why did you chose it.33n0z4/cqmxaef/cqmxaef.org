Mine contains elements from different usernames I've had in the past.

My first username I ever used was CubicZirconium (CubicZirconia was already taken) because the only thing better than a diamond is an artificial diamond made with the awesome power of science! Unfortunately, it and the other username I've used, CopperFlower, are apparently fairly popular so I had to come up with a new one. CopperZirconium 1) sounded cool and 2) combined both my nerdy and artsy names.

I don't know if Copper and Zirconium actually form a useful alloy or not. I assume not due to lack of Google results.
