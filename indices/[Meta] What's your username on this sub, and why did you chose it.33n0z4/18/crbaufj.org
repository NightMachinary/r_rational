My username was inspired by Sailor Moon and Spock from Star Trek:

"I am Sailor Vulcan! Champion of justice and reason! And yes, I am already aware my uniform is considered flashy, unprofessional, and borderline sexually provocative for my species by most intelligent lifeforms. I am currently in the process of reverse engineering my.../sailor transformation/ to something more appropriate and aesthetically tolerable to me, hopefully without eliminating its temporary paralysis effect on all those the transformation program deems to have intentions detrimental to intelligent life."

/glares/

"In the name of Vulcan, I will correct errors, triumph over irrationality and deter those with intentions detrimental to intelligent life. And just in case it wasn't communicated with sufficient accuracy and precision, THAT MEANS YOU."
