Your request has a certain qualia quality to it, so I'm not certain I fully grasp what you're looking for.

- try asking [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/SCPFoundation][the SCP community,]] there's no way there aren't at least half a dozen SCP sketches somewhere out there that fit your description (esp. among the memetics-tagged ones).
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10629488/1/Blood-Crest][/Blood Crest/]] --- has in-depth magical theory on the setting-specific flavour of soul magic and nature of consciousness / self.
- one of the later [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThursdayNext][/Thursday Next/]] books featured an antagonist that was capable of infecting minds of others with a sub-copy of her own mind.
- (IIRC) in [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ArcOfSacrifices][/the Sacrifices Arc/]] large concentrations of magic became pseudo-sentient, developed instincts, etc. The series also featured artefacts that allowed literally cutting away connections to other people, patterns / prophecies as semi-sentient magical entites, etc.
