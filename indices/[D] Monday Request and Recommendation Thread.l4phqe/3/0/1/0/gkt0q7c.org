I dunno what the other guy is about. Pale has rather dark moments, like all of Wildbow's stories so far, but in total it's less dark.

Pact spoilers: Blake was often alone and had no one to depend on for most of the story. Even the people who he should have been able to depend on were often set against him by circumstances (an effect of his seven generations' worth of bad karma). The three protagonists from Pale don't have that problem; they awakened as a trio, and therefore the world itself is invested in keeping them together. There's arguments between them, but they're usually of the "You're doing this thing we all agreed is bad for you, you're worrying us" angle. Also they're thirteen, there's lots of moments where they're just... being kids having fun playing with cool magic.

If you want a low-spoilers look at the limit of how dark Pale gets, you can read [[https://palewebserial.wordpress.com/2020/06/06/lost-for-words-1-z/][Interlude 1.Z]], that's pretty much the biggest gut-punch we've gotten so far.
