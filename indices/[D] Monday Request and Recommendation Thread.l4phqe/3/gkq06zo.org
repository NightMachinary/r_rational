The most recent chapters of /[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28254/nanocultivation-chronicles-trials-of-lilijoy][Nanocultivation Chronicles: Trials of Lilijoy]]/ have been focused a lot on what can or might be capable of thinking, and what that might mean (in addition to a bunch of plot going on). In particular the sort of shape the whole of (their) human society forms and how that might be a thinking thing independent of the humans that make it up, to some degree. Does anyone have any recommendations for works that explore similar ideas? Stuff like :

- fractal intelligences where the sub-parts are themselves intelligent (e.g. what sort of minds are formed by human organization)
- thoughts that think themselves
- environments that are fertile ground for producing things that think
- the nature of conscious thought
- what a "self" even is

The only other thing that really comes to mind is Nighzmarquls' excellent /[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34353/onward-to-providence][Onward To Providence]]/ ([[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/onward-to-providence-original-fiction.616857/][SB]]) ([[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/onward-to-providence-original-fiction.45926/][SV]]) which /definitely/ covers some of this ground, with things like the character who is actually a micro-polity made up of a market of individual agents bidding on things, cultures that are capable of flirting (like, the whole culture, not the members of it) with characters who are actually able to reciprocate, or beings that are mostly or entirely made up of information and have to continuously think themselves into existence.
