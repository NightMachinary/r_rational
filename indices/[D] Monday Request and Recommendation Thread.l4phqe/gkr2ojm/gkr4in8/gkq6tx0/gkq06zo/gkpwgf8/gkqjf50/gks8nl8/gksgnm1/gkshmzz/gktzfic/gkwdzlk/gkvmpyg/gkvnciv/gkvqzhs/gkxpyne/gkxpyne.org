I don't think I agree with this claim. I can believe that patriarchy first took off when agriculture came about and humans were no longer foraging on a daily basis, but I'm very much unconvinced that it would have occurred if women weren't physically much weaker than men.

I'll admit it's not an area of personal study for me though, so I'd be interested in seeing any sources for your claims.
