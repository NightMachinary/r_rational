Acutally, I mentioned it [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/kzw82j/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/gjqdjkr/?context=3][last week]], and it has been mentioned several times on the Monday threads.

Though, technically, I said at the top of that comment that I wasn't explicitly recommending anything... ;-)
