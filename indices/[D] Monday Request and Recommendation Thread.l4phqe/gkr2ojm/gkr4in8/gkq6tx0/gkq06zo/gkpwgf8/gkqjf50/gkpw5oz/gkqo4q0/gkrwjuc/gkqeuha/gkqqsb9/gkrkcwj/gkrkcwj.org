I think this criticism is warranted, but with the caveat that (at least at the beginning) he does get called out on this. I think if one of his rants were interrupted that would add a lot more realism to his monologuing. But so far; binging up to chapter 200, I haven't been put off by this yet so still don't recommend prospective readers to give it a pass for this reason.
