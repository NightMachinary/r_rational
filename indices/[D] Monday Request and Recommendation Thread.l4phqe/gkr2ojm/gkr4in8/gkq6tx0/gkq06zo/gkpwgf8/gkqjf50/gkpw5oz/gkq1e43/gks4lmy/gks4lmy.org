Harry turtledove and SM sterling are two of my favorite alt history authors.

I particularly loved Turtledoves darkness series [[https://www.amazon.com/Into-Darkness-Harry-Turtledove/dp/0765383314][here]] which was a alt history of WWII with a scientific magical system which takes the place of technology. It's executed well and works better than it sounds. He also wrote Guns of the South and many other alt history books.

SM sterling wrote [[https://www.amazon.com/Island-Sea-Time-S-Stirling/dp/0451456750][island in a sea of time]] which is quite good and ends up in the ancient world which may satisfy your desire for pre colonial alt history. He also wrote Dies the Fire and the Novels of the Change. Modern tech fails due to an apparent change in the physical rules of combustion leading to chaos and disaster. Communities struggle to survive and merge old technology with modern understanding to create something new and unique. The first several books of the series were excellent but I dropped them around the 5th book as the introduction of magic was not handled well in my opinion.

I also enjoyed the +Years of Rice and Salt+ [[https://www.amazon.com/Peshawar-Lancers-S-M-Stirling/dp/0451458737][Peshawar Lancers]] in which a meteor shower led to a temporary ice age around the height of the british empire. This leads to widespread starvation and a regress in technology. The book is set a couple decades after the fall as society begins to stabilize and recover. The regress in technology and setting in India give it a different cultural feel that may satisfy your desire for a pre colonial period setting despite it being set in a byproduct of colonialism.

Hope you enjoy! If you happen to have any alt history you enjoy, I'd appreciate any recommendations you have.
