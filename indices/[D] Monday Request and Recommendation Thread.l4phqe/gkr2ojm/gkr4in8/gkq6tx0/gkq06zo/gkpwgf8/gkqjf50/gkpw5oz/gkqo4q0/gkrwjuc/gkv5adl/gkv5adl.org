An analogy I saw someone use about the first part of this story:"jason is that aggressively shit-talking short skinny kid you can't do anything about because his friends are jacked".

But it's worse than that, because their society is structured based on personal strength, might makes right. Nations are usually autocracies, ruled by golds and diamonds, and the few institutions that aren't parochial are still led by individuals based on their power level first and foremost.

So maybe it's like "if a white belt(jason) constantly ran his mouth off at a bunch of black belt regional champions(silvers) and they just let him because his friend's parents are lawyers". Doesn't really make sense.
