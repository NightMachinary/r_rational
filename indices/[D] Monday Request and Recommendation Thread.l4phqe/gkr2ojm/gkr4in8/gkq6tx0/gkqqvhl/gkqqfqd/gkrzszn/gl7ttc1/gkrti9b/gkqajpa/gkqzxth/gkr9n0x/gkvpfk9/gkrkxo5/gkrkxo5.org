If you're talking small-scale small-location Groundhog Day stuff, the movie Groundhog Day itself is really good for that. But also the new movie Palm Springs is a really good time loop story that does so much more in a subgenre that tends to be pretty unoriginal at least in the early parts. It does some things that may annoy rational fiction fans though, if I recall correctly.

The movie Ready or Not is also a really good single-location story.
