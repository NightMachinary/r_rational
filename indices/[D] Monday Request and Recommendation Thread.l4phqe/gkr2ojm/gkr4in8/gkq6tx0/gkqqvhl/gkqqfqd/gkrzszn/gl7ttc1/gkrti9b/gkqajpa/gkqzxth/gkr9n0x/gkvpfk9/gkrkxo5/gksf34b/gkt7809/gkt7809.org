Oh, just remembered another one, [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/232430/Gone_Home/][Gone Home]] is a walking sim that takes place inside your family's house. You come back from college to find that no one's home. While trying to find out where everyone's gone, you explore the place and piece together the story. Creepy atmosphere, but no jumpscares.
