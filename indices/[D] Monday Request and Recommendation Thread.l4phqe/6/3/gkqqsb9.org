I still keep up with it, but the side characters are more bearable to me than the main character. I still root for him, insofar as you'd root for the protagonist to win, but I'm not really as enthralled with him as I used to be in the first few chapters. A part of that is because of his pretentious, holier-than-thou attitude about his philosophy. It's not wrong per se, but it's also not compelling after the 15th time he goes off on a tirade. In a world of characters that are mostly believable, he comes off like a caricature, or a manchild, or both. Yeah, I get that deep inside he's really mature and that his behavior is a facade and whatnot, but maybe that's just something I don't find enjoyable in a character. He's sorta like Shallan in Stormlight Archives in that way. He has a defining character trait that is done... alright I guess. But when it's not great it's really irritating to read about.
