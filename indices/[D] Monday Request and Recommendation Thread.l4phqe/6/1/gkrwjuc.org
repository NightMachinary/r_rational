I agree with everyone else's criticisms, but it also seems namely irrational in that the main character has a set of abilities that could take out a diamond rank. Even other characters with abilities that are "irresistible " can be resisted by a higher rank, but once he gets his 3 debuffs on, there no stopping it without specific cures. It will cascade in perpetuity until the target is dead. Furthermore, he doesn't just load his 3 debuffs into a target and move on. He continues to fight for some reason.

He also is supposed to be a social rationalist, but never runs into opposition socially. People incredibly more important than you don't angrily engage until you trick or convince them, they have their flunkies shut you up, then throw you in prison, or otherwise destroy you. Not everyone that is "good" will allow someone to run their mouth at them that they find annoying or distracting.

All the legitimate complaints aside, it's probably still in the upper 50th percentile, and I read it until finish a while ago (to the end of book one, nothing else was out at the time).
