I just read [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47701.InterWorld][InterWorld]], by M. Reaves and N. Gaiman.

Honestly, it's not all that great or rational, pretty typical YA stuff, but ten years ago I would've loved it. Multiverse, science, magic, all the big words like "Singularity", "Möbius strip", "Klein Bottle", conscious-centric interpretation of the quantum uncertainty principle - and it's used to tell the story of a boy who joins a multi-dimensional organization of his alt-world doppelgängers who fight against two armies that try and force the entire multiverse under either a scientific or a magical paradigm. I would've loved it if they'd /done something/ with that "versions of this boy exist in every universe, no matter its underlying metaphysical/magical principles". Stuff like explore how their different upbringings shaped them. Stuff like have some of them join the magic-fascist army, or the tech fascist army. Or I dunno, use the different alt-versions of him to externalize some kind of conflict within him. Or have some kind of conflict with how some versions of him are male and others female. I dunno, I just feel the way it was used kinda wasted the potential that format had.

And maybe that happens in the other parts of the series, but right now I'm not feeling like investing the time to find out.

As it stands, the book is good popcorn reading, but not really a must-read. Gaiman's other works that I've read or experienced, namely Good Omens and American Gods, stand head and shoulders above this one.
