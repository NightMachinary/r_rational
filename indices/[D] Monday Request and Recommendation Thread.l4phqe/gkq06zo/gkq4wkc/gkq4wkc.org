Wildbow's [[https://palewebserial.wordpress.com/about/][Pale]] has some truly fascinating ideas about consciousness. Within the first arc, there's a Ritual Incarnate, which is basically a sentient lethal "game" that self-propagates by drawing in new people. Other examples include the Forest Ribbon Trail, which is part of the Paths, a realm partially made up of the collective human dreamscape; the Callers of City Spirits, people who work with the incarnation of an entire city; a Dog of War, which is an animus (human-shaped thing) that naturally emerges in mass casualty events and is spiritually made up from fragments of the dead, evolving with every human it kills; a Ghoul inhabiting a casette player that feeds on abandoned children who died of medical causes after basically being their last friend; the ability to cut away parts of your human Self, Soul, and Spirit to make yourself into something more than human; and Cig, a sentient (?) cigarette that only communicates with the rest of the world by burning holes into a map to indicate intruders.

The story approaches the question of "how much can we call this sentient" from the angle of "hey doesn't that... thing... deserve rights as well?" because the entire world is really really cut-throat and most Practitioners don't think anything about summoning and enslaving Others, which our main protagonists are much more sceptical of.
