Eh, no, I don't agree. I'll give three reasons:

1 - The population pressure argument made in-setting (that is, women held as second class citizens as a measure to maintain high population growth).

2 - It could just be arbitrary; if such an arbitrary thing grew (and it could, even with zero merit) it could calcify.

3 - There could still be biological gender differences (though obviously miniscule compared to the stat differences of Classers). Children will have their initial attitudes towards gender influenced by their pre-unlock experience, and maintain that at least subconsciously.

None of these reasons is commanding, but none of these reasons is bullshit, and the first one is offered explicitly in-text.

That said, even if the reason were purely Doylist, it would be unlikely to lower my opinion of the story. Sometimes people want to write about a thing, and that's fine.
