Having read through the story, I have to agree that there's not really a good reason for it to exist. An argument could be made that women would tend towards less dangerous jobs, but that wouldn't be nearly enough to make them second-class citizens the way they are here.

(As a side-note, before puberty there are no real differences in strength due to gender - it's quite common for a girl to be stronger than a boy.)

It's been a constant minor irritant in an otherwise excellent story, which is a shame. I give it 4 stars, with the recommendation that people who are worried about it push on through the early parts where it looks like it's going to affect the protagonist more than it does for [reasons].
