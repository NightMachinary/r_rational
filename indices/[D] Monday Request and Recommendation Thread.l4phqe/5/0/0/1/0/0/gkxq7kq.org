I can see how it would have stayed in place after it was established, even without the large IRL disparity in physical strength, but I just don't see how it could have come to exist in the first place. It being based on places or settings with such views is a Doylist reason, not a Watsonian one, and is on the same level as "because the author wanted to write about this" - believable, but not really sufficient for worldbuilding.
