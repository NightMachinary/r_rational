Literally just pregnancy. In a violent, high mortality world, many women of a successful 'tribe' would spend a significant amount of their time physically weakened and in need of protection just to meet the rate of replacement. They would naturally have fewer combat capabilities just from spending less time fighting and more time producing new 'tribe' members. It would be human nature for at least some of the men of such tribes to take such an opportunity to hoard power.

The idea that a patriarchy emerging is somehow unrealistic given a fantasy world with an inherently hierarchical system of magic seems a strange conclusion to me. Ultimately, we don't even know all the lore, and we haven't seen anything that makes a patriarchy particularly less likely, either.
