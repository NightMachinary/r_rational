I'm going to assume good faith ignorance and reply on that basis.

  the primarily limitation on population growth for most of human history wasnt related to the production of a certain number of offspring but was instead limited primarily by agricultural output, disease, and death during child birth.

A high mortality rate requires a high fertility rate to achieve a replacement rate. It doesn't matter the cause of mortality since they didn't understand or couldn't address the cause back then. Typically, 50% of children would die before 10 years of age. Just to maintain replacement rate *the average woman would have to have ~5 children*. If you take into account wars, famines, plagues, it's much more, between 6-9 children per woman, just to maintain a baseline. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_the_Roman_Empire#Fertility][See here the details of fertility of women in roman egypt]], one of the few places in the ancient world we have in depth census data for.

  it is also incorrect to say that more efficient farming lead to a higher proportion of society being able to engage in warfare - the people engaged in warfare for most of human history were precisely the same as the people engaged in farming, and the development of a professional soldier class was primarily driven by the formation of more organized states.
#+end_quote

My reference to farming efficiency leading to more men in was about the last few hundred years, not for antiquity. Even in the 17th century ~90% of people still lived and worked in agriculture.

Regardless, your incorrect refutation was itself incorrect. "The formation of more organized states" was in fact *precipitated by more consistent agriculture output*. That is, high fertility areas(nile, yellow river, mesopotamia, indus, etc) allowed more sophisticated nation states to arise, which allowed more intensive agricultural methods and more food output, which allowed bigger and more organized states, and so on and so on.

Additionally, if as you say, most people are engaged in agriculture, and most soldiers in a given society were primarily farmers, then wouldn't a larger population of farmers necessarily give a nation state more soldiers? You seem to be arguing against yourself.

  the idea that patriarchy was a sensible evolution is just not supported by any evidence
#+end_quote

I'm going to steelman your argument rather than dismissing it. Maybe you meant something like:

#+begin_quote
  "the idea that patriarchy was a +sensible evolution+ *natural result of social darwinism* is just not supported by any evidence"
#+end_quote

I think the main problem with this is that there is no evidence regarding the formation of any ancient cultural norms, especially not of the patriarchal social norm, which predates human history and probably human civilization. Just observations, extrapolations, and theories. Some theories have more support, some less. The idea that women were "dominated" in order to ensure their "reproductive labour" is fairly well supported, I believe. Another is that women are further sequestered in order to ensure paternity and the continuation of a husband's genes.

It is all supposition, so I guess in essence you're correct.

#+begin_quote
  there are plenty of agriculture cultures *that did not have features of patriarchy*
#+end_quote

This is... interesting phrasing. I admit genuine ignorance about what you're referring to. There are many societies where women had a more "respectable" and somewhat equitable position in society, the Spartans, the Hittites, the Scythians, Vikings, a lot of Celtic and Germanic tribes, but none of those could be categorized as anything other than patriarchies as far as I know. Maybe matrilineal for some, but beyond that it's a stretch.

I'd be interested in an example or two since you claim there are "plenty" of such societies.

  development of patriarchy was most likely driven by ideology
#+end_quote

From this point on you lost me. A lot of value judgments based on your social norms. Do you really think if you'd been born two thousand years ago as an illiterate subsistence farmer you would have chosen differently than anyone else around you? Choosing ex nihilo to enact enlightenment values within your family unit?
