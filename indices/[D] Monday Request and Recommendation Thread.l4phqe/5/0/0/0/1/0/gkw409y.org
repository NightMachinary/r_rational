  they developed all over the planet for different reasons in different places and for the most part the reasoning behind it was quite nonsensical

Social norms usually do provide utility for the society in question /when they first get instituted/, or at the very least they don't meaningfully cost any. Even if the reasoning is faulty, the underlying cause that led to the norm usually has a reason for existing. If social norms start being detrimental, for most of human history the society in question would usually get absorbed or destroyed by another. Maybe Carthage would still be around if it didn't sacrifice children to their gods, or more likely it had nothing to do with it because it's a relatively small part of their society. In the case of a patriarchal social order in which women are relegated entirely to breeding, child-rearing, and tasks which can be accommodated whilst/between breeding/child-rearing, it's such a major and consistent part of every society we know of that you can't dismiss it as simply "nonsensical".

Just on the basis of pure math--without opening an anthropology book-- it's possible to see that a society that didn't culturally enforce the role of broodmares on women would quickly get out-numbered by a society that did do so, and then that egalitarian society would get conquered and extinguished. Check out this [[https://calculator.academy/population-growth-calculator/][population grown calculator]], you'll see that a difference of 1pp growth year over year can result in a difference of millions of people over a few decades, which is untenable. From a starting population of 100,000, the difference between 2% and 3% growth over a hundred years is 1.2 million people, 700k to 1,900k. This is a dynamic that would remain intensely relevant for all of human history until relatively recently. Even when farming became more efficient and agriculture no longer required 9/10ths of the population to feed the other 1/10ths, that just meant that there were more men available for warfare, and the number of men in a society who could be solely dedicated to war grew and grew.

That's just one cursory examination of "why sexism", a proper one is a career. So while it's true that contemporary "reasoning"(i.e. adoption of legacy norms) for the continued existence of a patriarchal social order are non-nonsensical like you wrote, they are grounded in real and relevant factors, an existential factor, most of the time. When those factors changed and stopped being relevant, so did our society change(with lag).
