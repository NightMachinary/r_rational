  even if the reason were purely Doylist, it would be unlikely to lower my opinion of the story. Sometimes people want to write about a thing, and that's fine.

I agree in theory, but in practice I find it means the author hasn't put much thought into the topic, doesn't care to understand it holistically. Or worse, has nothing interesting to say about it, beyond the cultural normative.
