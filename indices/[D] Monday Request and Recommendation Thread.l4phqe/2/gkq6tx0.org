I've recently been enjoying a lot of smaller scale works, and one thing I noticed a lot of these stories share is that they take place within one set location.

Think Fall of the House of Usher or the thriller-suspense movie Hush. All the suspense and action is tied into one house.

I've been trying to think of other works that do this and for the most part I keep reverting back to horror/suspense. I understand the reasons for why that story telling mechanic is so useful here, but surely there are other genres that make good use of this too right?

Some of my favorite parts of long running series certainly have aspects of this during a climatic arc but then its back to traveling the nation/world/etc.

So anybody know of any work that prominently features one set location? Doesn't matter the genre or medium, just ask that it be something you would actually recommend as good. Something in a rational/rationalist vein would be a plus but not necessary.

Some other examples off the top of my head that I've enjoyed:

- Fly - Breaking bad episode that's just in one room
- Breakfast Club
- Source Code - which actually if anyone else knows of groundhog day stuff that's very small scale like this that'd be great.
