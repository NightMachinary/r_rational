The classic bottle episode. Like already said, /12 Angry Men/ is required movie-watching. It's not perfectly rational, but it's just damn good.

More contemporary: Tom Hardy as /Locke/ chronicles a guy driving a car one night and the phone calls he makes (to his subordinates, wife, and mistress). A whole movie carried by Hardy's acting, basically, and I think it was a good time-killer.

Closer to horror-movie territory is the cult classic /Cube/, featuring the eponymous murder room. Also in the 'strangers wake up in a strange place and things happen there' genre: /Circle/ (2015) which was . . . okay.

It's probably not relevant as a recommendation, but Luigi's Mansion is a great Gamecube game featuring the titular mansion. It can be emulated onto Dolphin if you've, ah, 'lost' your own copy in the past ;)
