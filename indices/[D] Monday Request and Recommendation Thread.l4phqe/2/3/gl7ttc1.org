- The Cabin at the End of the World (short novel): A (gay, but I don't really think that matters) couple and their daughter gets unexpected visitors in the form of four very odd home invaders. The entire book is basically a hostage negotiation. 5/5 and while maybe not a central example of “rational fiction”, is scratches many of the same itches.

- Phonebooth (movie): Colin Farrel answers a ringing phonebooth. The caller is the sniper trained at the phonebooth. The entire movie takes place in or around said phonebooth.

- Buried (movie): Ryan Reynolds is buried alive by insurgents while working as a contractor in Afghanistan. The movie is basically all dialogue, with close up shots of Reynolds' face lit up by a phone screen.

- Alien (movie): The crew of a space freighter respond to a distress call and picks up, well, you guessed it.

- Cordyceps (written fiction; web original): Rat fic. The protagonist wakes up in a hospital (?) with memory loss, and the staff won't tell him why he's there, and certainly won't tell him why a long-term acquaintance is in the next room. Lots of hypothesising about what's going on and explicit explanations of the MC's reasoning. Quite short, and one of the best pieces of web original fiction I've read.

- Testimony Before an Emergency Session of the Naval Cephalopod Command (short story): This arguably counts as a single-location story since it is all testimony delivered at the titular session. Some cool ideas about how intelligence relates to theory of mind. (If you liked Peter Watts' Blindsight you'll probably like this as well).

- I Identify Sexually as an Attack Helicopter (short story): A short story published in Clarkesworld maybe a year back, but has since been scrubbed from most places because some assholes who didn't read it decided it was anti-trans. It takes place in the cockpit of an attack helicopter (who'd have thought), and explores what the famous meme would actually mean in practice: What would it /actually/ entail to sexually identify as an attack helicopter? I'm still not sure I agree with the author's implicit assertion that it is even meaningful to sexually identify as something orthogonal to the man-woman spectrum, but after reading it I was certainly less sure than i was before.

- The Test by Sylvain Neuvel (novella): A recent immigrant to the UK is taking a citizenship test when masked gunmen occupy the classroom. Entirely contained within a few rooms, and contains a bunch of rationalist tropes (questions like “Given this information, what is the likely state of the world?”).
