I binged The Dragoneye Moons ([[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36299/beneath-the-dragoneye-moons]]) this past weekend. I liked it! The MC is about as rational as you can expect, given that she's got the body of a kid, which is to say she knows herself pretty well and seeks her own best future and best self... and mangos. And flying, and fireballs, and healing people, and mangos, and long hot baths, and definitely mangos.

I like the setting and the system well enough, and I like the other characters quite a bit. The author does a good job with team dynamics, banter, and friendships/working relationships in general.

Also, there's a wicked sick elements mandala.
