See, I have a thousand reasons why it exists in the setting - and it makes a ton of sense - the issue is, I have NO WAY of getting that information to the protagonist! Gender studies aren't a thing! Anyone she asks about it would say "That's the way things are."

I'm writing a 1st person limited POV, so I literally can't get information to the reader that the protagonist doesn't know. I've thought long and hard on it, and have dozens of different ways and interlocking pieces for the existence of sexism in the setting, but again - without being able to get that information to the MC, there's no way to show it to the reader.
