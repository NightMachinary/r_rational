It exists because the setting is heavily based off of ancient Rome, mixed with MTG's Ixalan. The patriarchy is 'justified' by the strict caste system, the martial culture, the effect of high vitality on incumbent lifespans, and the lack of human planetary domination that would allow greater social development. Besides the issue of 'high mortality rate = strong cultural pressure into motherhood roles,' there are plenty of plain old social reasons that some people would want to, given the opportunity, oppress others for their own benefit.

I think it really adds to the story and the theme of freedom vs obligation. Also, overall, the author has greatly toned down the level of sexism that would be present in such a setting. The MC encounters quite a disproportionate number of 'enlightened heroes' who just so happen to have more egalitarian mindsets for the setting, likely because the story would just be too grim otherwise.
