It's about the purest "numbers go up" LitRPG I can think of. I do wish it would branch out a little with the character voices though. The sheer number of repetitions of a snarky/sarcastic male-identifying companion being brought on a tour of everywhere the protagonist has visited to that point is getting a little old.

You could snip entire back-and-forths between her and the former-dagger/former-king/Meadow/elf-dragon, then mad-lib the power references to match the flavour of her current companion, and it'd be very hard to tell which of the tours the material came from. Throw in the pirate, the curse-elf, and the fire-fox for shorter sequences of the same template.
