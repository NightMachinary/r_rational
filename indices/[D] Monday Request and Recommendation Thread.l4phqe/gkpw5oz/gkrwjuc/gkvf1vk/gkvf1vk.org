  He also is supposed to be a social rationalist, but never runs into opposition socially. People incredibly more important than you don't angrily engage until you trick or convince them, they have their flunkies shut you up, then throw you in prison, or otherwise destroy you.

In general they'll just ignore you. They wouldn't engage him in any form of dialog. If he showed up to their house to 'talk' they'd just have the servants tell him they are indisposed / out or busy.

Sure if he talks too much crap he might get beat up, or have his fingers broken or worse depending on how bad the situation is and how nice the target of his criticism is.
