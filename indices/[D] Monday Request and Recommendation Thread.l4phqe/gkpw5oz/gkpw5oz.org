I'm throwing in a strong rec for [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26294/he-who-fights-with-monsters][He who fights with monsters]]. not because it is the best out there, but because I had read a few reviews for it which discouraged me from reading the work which turned out to be *completely wrong.*

1. Setting aside how rational the story is its bloody *rationalist!!!* I couldn't believe that I hadn't seen a rec for this here. The MC is (in his own words) "very good at people" (specifically, not good *with* people but *at* people), and the perspective is from a social rationalist (someone who understands and approaches social interactions from a rational perspective). I have personally learnt a lot about social interactions from this story.

2. From a review: "The MC stupidly stays an atheist when there are gods in-front of him." This really tuned me off, because I remember another Isekai story I read in the past which I got completely turned off of when the MC said "I never understood how people on earth could deny the truth [being Christianity in this case]". Being Isekaied is irrefutable proof that your religion (as you believed it) is completely wrong, its just so petty for an author to add a line like that I couldn't believe it XD. I assumed this was the same thing but for atheism, until I read it and its completely the wrong impression; the MC doesn't stay atheist, he stays principled against the very idea of religion (worshiping someone by virtue of their birth not actions). This perspective is completely reasonable and IMO exactly what many in this community would enjoy.

3. Various reviews talking about inconsistencies: From what I read so far (chapter 200) I can't think of any glaring plot holes or unrealistic actions anyone has took really, maybe a little stretching to fit in the overall plot but IMO as good a quality as later chapters of MoL and better than Azarinth healer.

4. Various reviews not liking the MC cos he is pretentious, (comes off as a closet Atheist) etc. He is pretentious, but to me his interactions are believable (and I'd be happy to discuss this) and IMHO I suspect most people put off by him are religious people for obvious reasons (his philosophy is directly antithetical to religion) which colors their opinion.

So, if you haven't tried it because you saw some negative reviews, I recommend you give it a go. Its not perfect or like super incredible but I would say may appeal to this community more than the layman.
