While I second this recommendation, I do it with the caveat that in my head canon the story *ends* with with the first book. As much as I liked the story until he died and got resurrected back on Earth, everything after that I can only describe as terrible.

And by everything, I mean everything. The worldbuilding, the characters, the pacing - if it wasn't for the familiar smugness of the main character, I would honestly wonder whether it is still the same person writing the story. I kept reading by inertia for a while, but finally dropped the story a couple of months back.
