Yeah, the guy created an MMO-depth system, only with random skills instead of a skill tree. Of all the lame things in this story, that's the worst.

- Each "essence magician"(universally lame naming btw) has 4 essences, and each essence has 5 skills.
- Each skill gets an additional effect every time you levels up.
- At the second level, bronze, an essence magician would have 20 skills with 40 possible effects.

How do you keep track of that AND maintain an interesting narrative with decent pacing? The answer is you don't. Because such a complex system doesn't leave a lot of room for intricacy and depth, it's too much for a reader to handle. So naturally what ends up happening is that despite having dozens of skills, every character is necessarily reduced to a single archetype just like in a system with 10x less details. Just look at Farrah for an example: she has 20 skills with 60 effects, but in combat she's just a glass cannon that spews lava. That's what every character is, in the end.

Add to that:

- what skills you get are random(!!).
- you can't learn additional skills, or spells, or anything magical except for rituals. Those 20 random skills are what you have for the rest of your life.
- You can't change any skills you do get. It's been mentioned that if you get a deleterious skill, something that harms you or doesn't synergize with your kit, you're shit out of luck.
- You have to level each skill individually, and every skill must be leveled in order to rank up
- You feed yourself with... coins? iron, bronze, silver, gold, diamond coins. Why that (modern) arrangement of value? Essences are supposedly a natural part of the world since time immemorial, so Iron was more valuable and rare than bronze until relatively recently, so how does that work? Oh, and diamonds are much more common than anything except iron? And bronze is an alloy and not a natural metal?

The whole thing is sloppily gamified, bad worldbuilding on bad worldbuidling. Even though it's not a bad story, per se, it leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
