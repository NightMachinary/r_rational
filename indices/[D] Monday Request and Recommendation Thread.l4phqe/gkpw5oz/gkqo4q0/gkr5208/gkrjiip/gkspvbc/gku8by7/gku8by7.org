I feel you're missing one element of why litrpgs are common, which is that they are basically a crutch for inexperienced or mediocre writers. They're an easy hook for readers with the leveling up aspect, while stats and magic and skills take away the difficulty of combat scenes - why did Steve win the fight? He used his punch skill. Done. I think that's why a lot of litrpgs gradually put less and less emphasis on the system as time goes by, since they become confident to write without blue boxes detailing exactly what happened.
