That's one thing I really don't like about RoyalRoad litrpgs, and a lot of litrpgs in general. A lot of them use completely incomprehensible game Systems that just don't work or make sense. And then they also don't fit into the worldbuilding of the story and create a lot of plot holes.

It's a rare litrpg series that has a System that actually makes sense and is enjoyable to read about, actually manages to have it make sense in the scope of the world and universe, and to finally make the story enjoyable. Virtually all litrpgs I've read always manage to fuck at least one of these aspects up.
