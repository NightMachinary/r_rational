Forty Millenniums of Cultivation.

It's both extremely rational but also so "anti-munchkin"

It's not just self-consistent but consistent with the way we see humans act irl.

The author will go off on long but also genuinely interesting tangents.

It will reexamine its own Nationalism/racism in a far more nuanced way than most other things.

Y'know the trope where the MC has like some evil thing sealed in its head? MC has socratic dialogue with it, and like real socratic dialogue, not like "Don't do bad things" "No me like bad things"

It's very rational, but it's also willing to accept dramatism and emotion as driving forces.

Good takes on philosophy and ethics in general.

Good subversion of the xianxia genre.

Extremely likable protagonist and cast of characters
