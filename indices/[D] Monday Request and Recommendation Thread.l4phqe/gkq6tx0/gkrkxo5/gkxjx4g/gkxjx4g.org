Speaking of time loops, I found Happy Death Day to be a lot of fun. It's got the exact kind of mood you'd expect from "time loop but it's a slasher teen horror", but executes on that premise perfectly well. It's a typical knows-what-it-is-and-doesn't-try-to-be-more piece of competent entertainment.
