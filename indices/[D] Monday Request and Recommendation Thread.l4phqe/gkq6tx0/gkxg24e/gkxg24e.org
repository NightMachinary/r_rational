I second “12 Angry Men”, great movie. For another example of single location movie that's not actually a horror, there's “Carnage”. “Destination wedding” is a weird case in that it's relatively limited in locations, but it's a lot more limited in cast. The whole movie is just Keanu Reeves and Wynona Rider cynically quipping at each other. You may love or utterly despise that.

Honourable mention for a comedy example: the half episode “Nothing to room” from the anime show “Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt” is literally all a single shot of a couch.
