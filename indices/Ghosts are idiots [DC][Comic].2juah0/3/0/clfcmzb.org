It's hard to know how to munchkin the hell out of being a ghost without knowing what rules we're operating under. The rules for ghosts have a huge variance among them. Just saying "ghost" is like just saying "vampire" - it doesn't really mean much, given how large the differences. Hell, in HPMOR ghosts don't even seem sentient.
