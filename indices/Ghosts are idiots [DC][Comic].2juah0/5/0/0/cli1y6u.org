True, but unless whatever it is that makes you bored isn't attached to your ethereal self, by the time you get anywhere significant outside our galaxy , the boredom would've driven you mad. Not to mention, you are pretty much accepting that, should you choose to explore beyond our galaxy, you're giving up on ever coming back to humanity (like to interact with humans) Although trans-solar system travel would give you plenty of time to circle back and enjoy Earth, although again, dat boredom tho
