It's ambiguous and depends on what kind of fictional canon you're in. Really, the idea of "moving on" seems like a better thing to question. If I was forced to haunt my place of death until I resolved my unfinished business, I'd do so as efficiently as possible, but I certainly wouldn't be interested in "moving on" into some ambiguous white light afterwards. I'd like to enjoy my time as a free, unattached ghost instead.
