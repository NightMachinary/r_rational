Sudomir wanted to make a whole heck of a lot of of wraith bombs. I imagine they are now just trying to make a small amount of them for some purpose. If we assume that every wraith bomb takes 1000-5000 souls to make then they could feasibly make one to five off of this where he could make 100-500 from the invasion.
