Normally what you are saying would be true. And had it been a telenovela, I would have bet ALL my money on RR being Zach. Or Nochka and Kirielle in a trenchcoat.

That would be both shocking and would not include a new casting.

But this is Rational fiction. We should be atleast able to logically rule out possibilities.
