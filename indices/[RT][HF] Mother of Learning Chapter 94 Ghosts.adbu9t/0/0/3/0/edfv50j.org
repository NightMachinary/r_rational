We saw that, oh god what was her name, angry old silver lady didn't leave a soul killed corpse behind when she left. She left a normal copy of herself that was unaware of the loop. We saw a soul killed copy of Veyers.

That means that the only possible way Veyers could be red robe is if he left the loop (which happened a significant portion of the way through the story) and THEN Zach soul killed him after that off screen, That would require Zach to get the dagger off screen (something he couldn't do even WITH Zorian's help later in the story) and specifically soul kill Veyers and apparently no one else.

It's not technically impossible, especially with the checkov's gun of Zorian learning to mind fuck people who are mind blanked, but it's exceptionally unlikely.

Edit: Technically we only have Zach's word that silverlake didn't leave behind a soul-killed corpse. So there's another technical possibility that Zach is working together with red robe, but I think you'll agree that that's even more unlikely.
