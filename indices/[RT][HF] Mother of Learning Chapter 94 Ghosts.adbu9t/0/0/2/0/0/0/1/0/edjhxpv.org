QI doesn't share that common sense that "good people" don't massacre fake people. QI's common sense is from an ancient and violent era. Also, nothing so far has shown QI to consider himself anything but a "good person". His standards and those he judges people by are exceptionally different from what you would consider common sense, and trying to apply it is when meeting him is a mistake you might not live to regret.
