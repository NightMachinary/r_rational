But QI wouldn't believe RR was an ally. If he was told the other was a looper, no action or dedication could possibly convince him. Nothing he can do won't be undone. Nothing he can pay won't be returned. No accountability can ever be held for any promise he can make.

The potential advantages a looper promises might be high, but the cost of betrayal is much higher and just as easy. Perhaps easier. He knows he isn't real. Death costs him nothing. Bombs away.
