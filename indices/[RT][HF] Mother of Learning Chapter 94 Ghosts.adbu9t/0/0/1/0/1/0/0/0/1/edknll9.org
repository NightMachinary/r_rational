Again QI is suspicious because Z&Z are enemies (he became aware of them when they interfered with his operation enough to take notice) offering him irreplaceable artifacts for a pitence. That's hugely suspicious. It also means that when he realized he was expendable the equation was "self destruct for a chance at harming the most dangerous enemies he's likely to encounter".

RR would be somone with an aligned goal (release Pan) who is offering him something not especially costly (aid optimizing the invasion) in exchange for something that would benefit them both (It's to the benefit of QI that only allied loopers leave the loop, or enemy loopers leave with as little correct information as possible).

That's a completely different scenario. Also RR is a looper. He can try again if he fails to create the correct impression the first time.
