I doubt it. If Red Robe wanted to fight ZZ he could have just fought them while Zach was half dead and bleeding out. Waiting days for them to recover then attacking them in the middle of a school full of powerful mages doesn't sound like something the guy whose simulacrum ran from a fight would do. Maybe if he convinced QI but I highly doubt they could convince QI to do something that would immediatly attract the government's attention so obviously like this. We are missing something here or this is Veyers doing something stupid on his own.
