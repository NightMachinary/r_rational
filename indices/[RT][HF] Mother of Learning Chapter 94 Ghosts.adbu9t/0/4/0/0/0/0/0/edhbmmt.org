Except we already know the lawyer isn't really important in the grand scheme of things at the beginning of the month. And RR is not the type to leave things up to chance, as we know. I feel like it's safe to assume that Veyers presence at school is part of RR's bigger plan, it's just not clear what that plan is yet.

It's entirely possible that Veyers was soulkilled for reasons that we don't understand yet; maybe he actually was very important to the invasion, and RR soulkilled him in order to hide that from Z&Z in addition to laying a false trail. But that said, my best guess is that Veyers' whole story is completely unrelated to the time loop and Z&Z are about to realize that the only explanation for his soulkilling is to trick Zach into thinking Veyers is RR, along with everything else that implies about RR.
