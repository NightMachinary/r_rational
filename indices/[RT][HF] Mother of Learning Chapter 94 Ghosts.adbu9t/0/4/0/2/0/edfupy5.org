Veyers was soul killed in the loop. That means if he IS red robe, he would have to have left the loop and then have his copy soul killed by Zach off screen during the story somehow, since people who leave the loop don't leave soul killed corpses. Which would require Zach to have gotten the dagger off screen at some point in the story. Which is exceptionally unlikely.

He was someone significant enough to be soul killed and have a memory aversion to him placed into Zach's mind, but the chance of him being red robe is practically non-existant.
