I have to wonder what the hell Veyers is doing here. I think this pretty much confirms that he is not Red Robe. I just can't see RR taking a risk like this at this point in time. I bet RR taught Veyers how to control his power a little bit then went off to do more important things. Veyers not understanding the situation entirely then thought it'd be hilarious to go flex on the school he got expelled from, not realizing what he was getting himself into. That's my best guess at least. RR has up to this point been the quiet efficient type when not fishing for information. I can't imagine him thinking this debacle is a good plan.
