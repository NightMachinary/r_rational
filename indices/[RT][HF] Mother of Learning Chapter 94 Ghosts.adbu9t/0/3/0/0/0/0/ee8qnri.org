1 out of 15 is as good as 100% identification rate at their level of skill. Certainly better than 1 out of the whole country's population. And every inch of anonymity is valuable to Zorian (and RR).

There are a lot of variables here, but both sides have a singular goal: information. What's the other side planning?
