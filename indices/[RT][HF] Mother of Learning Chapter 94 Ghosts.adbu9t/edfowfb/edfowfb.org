  He was tall, with messy blond hair and rumpled clothes that looked like they had seen better days. The door had been opened so forcefully that Zorian suspected the boy had kicked them open with his foot instead of using the handle. They rebounded against the wall with a loud bang and promptly closed themselves behind him.

  As he marched forward towards the front of the class, the boy swept the whole class with his gaze. For a moment, Zorian met his eyes and found himself staring at vividly orange eyes, their slitted pupils burning with barely contained anger and aggression.

  Veyers Boranova had arrived to class.

Veyers isn't Red Robe.

I honestly don't believe he would be capable of pretending to be angry to that degree, while also being the mastermind behind all the different stuff he supposedly did.

Zach is Red Robe.

He got in a fight with Veyers sometime early on in the loop and got pissed off so badly, he figured out how to get the dagger and soul killed him. But Zach was the one acting as Red Robe all along. He worked with Quatach-Ichl to make the invasion stronger because he found it interesting and wanted to practice fighting it. He pretended to have memory problems to avoid explaining what he did in the earlier loops, and didn't want Zorian to look into his mind for the same reason. He pretended to not know who Veyers was since he had soul killed him and didn't know how he would explain that to Zorian. He created the simulacrum that he fought after getting out of the loop and had it injure him enough to clear him from blame. He kidnapped Veyers after getting out of the loop, but now he's either gotten loose or Zach let him go intentionally to distract Zorian while he makes a move.

This was all because Zach liked Zorian for some reason, realized he was smart enough to have a somewhat decent chance of figuring a way out of the loop, and didn't want to look bad by helping the invasion murders thousands of people each loop just for fun.

I know there are some holes in the theory, but it makes a lot more sense than Red Robe being some other person who has barely been a part of the story this entire time. Or worse, being some person who isn't a classmate of Zorian and just comes completely out of left field. I'm predicting that Zorian realizes Veyers isn't Red Robe pretty early in the next chapter and things blow up big time during the assault on Sudomir's mansion.

What I don't know is Zach's intentions at this point. Now that we're in the real world, I don't think he actually wants the invasion to succeed. But he obviously wants to keep up the charade for some reason, so he still wants something that Zorian doesn't know about. Which is saying something, since Zorian would probably help him get just about anything he wants.
