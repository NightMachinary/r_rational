It's a cool theory. I don't think it's accurate, and prefer the "mad simulacrum" theory myself, but I enjoyed reading it.

Mostly, a lack of actual danger would make an unexciting finale, so if this is the case, then Zach has no particular reason to fight Zorian only now, and the ending kinda would fall apart.
