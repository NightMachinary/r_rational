When Zach and Zorian first went into the Sovereign Gate room the Guardian told them the gate was barred because /someone had already left/.\\
There was an entire arc of collecting the keys to unbar the gate because someone else's exit had caused it to lock.

When they finally got all the keys, the primordial told them that it had already sent someone through and Silverlake was its /second/ agent. The Guardian even said the gate was barred again when they checked after Silverlake was gone, which shows that when the primordial sends someone to the real world, the gate locks itself.

For Zach to be RR he would have to find a way to trick the Guardian into thinking he had already left the loop. And the primordial, which wants Zach to be mind scrambled, would have had to lie for him. There's no way.
