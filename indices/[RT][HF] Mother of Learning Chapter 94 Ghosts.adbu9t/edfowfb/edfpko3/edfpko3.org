Zach *sealed himself into a collapsing timeloop with no way out save a very slim and risky chance* and also somehow cheated a millennia-old divine artifact so that it would say someone with the brand that the best soul-mages on the planet couldn't replicate in 2 years left already and sealed them both in *just so Zorian would be friends with him.*

Then once he got out *he committed mass murder, slaughtering thousands to make bombs to restart the splinter wars that *killed his entire family** for shits and giggles?

I could believe one of those things, maybe two, but either Zach is the greatest actor /and/ most retarded planner on the face of the Earth or he's not RR.
