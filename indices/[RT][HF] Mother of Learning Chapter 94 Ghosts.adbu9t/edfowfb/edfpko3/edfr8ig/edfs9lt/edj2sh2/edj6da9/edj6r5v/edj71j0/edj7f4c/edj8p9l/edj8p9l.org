Lol okay.

Zach didn't use any kind of defensive spell, including mind or divination based ones, outside of combat because he assumed that no one was out to get him until RR showed up at the dance. Or at least that's what he says and since Zorian got the same impressions from him that he got from everyone else before he realized his empathy I think we're set.
