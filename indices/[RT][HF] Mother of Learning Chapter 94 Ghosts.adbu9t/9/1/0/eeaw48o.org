Zorian is sending simulacrums to do everything because his mana is still in a bad state.

He did already talk to Alanic and Spear of Resolve, the only other person they intend to inform is Xvim. And it's been established that going to Xvim early tends to cause him to be more suspicious, and doesn't actually get him to accept their story any faster than waiting until their planned mentor session.
