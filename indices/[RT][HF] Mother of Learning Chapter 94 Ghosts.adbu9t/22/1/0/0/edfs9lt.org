  No, he could get out whenever he wanted.

Not according to the Guardian of the Threshold, unless he somehow had the power to make it lie perfectly and repeatedly in front of Zorian and all the temporary loopers.

  I'm fairly sure it's Silverlake who clued Quatach-Ichl in to the time loop and is why he changed plans.
#+end_quote

What? QI never knew about the time loop as far as we know, and if he did then Silverlake literally could not do so unless Zach told her since Z and Z spent months with her and she didn't figure it out before the primordial test which was at the behest of Z and Z. Even if she did, what, did she decide to tattle to the most powerful mage on the continent with a vendetta against her country *when no one was supposed to know QI was in the country*? And for what? To what possible end? We saw what happened when QI figures out he's in the time loop and it's blow himself up to screw over the loopers.

If you're talking about afterwards then Z and Z already talked to the guardian meaning they were trapped and... what "he" :are you talking about in regards to changing plans?

  I'm sure I got some stuff wrong, but I'm confident that Zach is Red Robe.
#+end_quote

And I'm confident if that's true then Zach is both the best actor on the planet to fool the *empath* that is Zorian and the most retarded planner as he locked himself in a collapsing time loop *just* to be friends with Zorian, not even touching the "restart the atrocity that killed his family and doomed him to life with his shitty caretaker for no reason"
