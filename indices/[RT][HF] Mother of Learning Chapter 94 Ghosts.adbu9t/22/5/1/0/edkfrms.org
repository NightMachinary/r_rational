Well simulacrums are definitely in the time loop, as are all sorts of other non-souled objects.

Mmmm, I wonder if it's possible to put a temporary marker on a simulacrum.

Either way, I'd wager that Zach did something brilliant/stupid that resulted in the memory issue/etc. Not necessarily a simulacrum, though that'd be cool....but Zach can't actually be Red Robe for a number of reasons.
