  let alone the fact that you might not even know what the true nature of this soul tug if you felt it plus the difficulty in reaching/finding the mansion.

you're just speculating at that point. Zorian even mentioned that it's a liability since any wandering soul mage with sufficient skill can detect it. It's even mentioned in the next line that you omitted.

  So a sufficiently good soul mage could tell that the soul trap existed just by entering its area of effect? No wonder Sudomir considered everyone with a hint of aptitude in the field a threat to his plans. Even if most of the people he killed and kidnapped weren't on the level of skill that Alanic displayed, it only took one to blow his conspiracy wide open
