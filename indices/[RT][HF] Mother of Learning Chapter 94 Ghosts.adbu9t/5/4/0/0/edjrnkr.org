In a normal city, the wraiths would be purged by mass exorcisms by the clergy, because (and it's really in the chapter you quoted), the wraith multiplication process takes time. The damage would be substantial but the city won't be depopulated. So the initial wraith bombing has to be /really/ massive to overwhelm the initial defense systems or it has to be accompanied by a supplementary attack.
