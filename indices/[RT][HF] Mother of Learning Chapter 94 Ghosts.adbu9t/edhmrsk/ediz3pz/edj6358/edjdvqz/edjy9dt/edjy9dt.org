We have reason to believe that Red Robes left the loop after his confrontation with Zorian. If he were a simulacrum, he could have soul-killed Veyers to prevent an information leak, exited the time loop, and used necromancy to harness other souls to sustain itself. The soul-gathering could fulfill more than one purpose.
