*breaks out the tinfoil*

Zach learned how to make simulacra, but did it poorly and recklessly, creating an evil!zach simulacra, who, uh, continued to exist as a soul-construct when the time-loop restarted, looping through their shared soul? Who eventually learns to do soul possession (possibly due to /being/ a soul-construct giving it soul-sight, maybe?) and used the dagger to soul-kill Veyers and possess his empty body at the start of every restart, and then altering the memories of the original to conceal his presence, unknowingly removing his knowledge of how to create simulacra.

Maybe this means that in order to get rid of Red Robe, Zorian has to destroy Zach's soul? May also explain why Red Robe expects a whole army of loopers?
