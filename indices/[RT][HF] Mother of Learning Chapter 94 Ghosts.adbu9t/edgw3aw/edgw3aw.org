Ok, ok, I got this. (Wild Speculation Warning)

Veyers is another looper. He probably figured out how to get the marker to enter the loop and told Zach and they fiddled with things and got the marker for both. He probably needed Zachs resources.

Zach and Veyers then leveled up in the loop. Veyers got captured and mindraped and his loop thing stolen for RR/QI. Zach didn't get his memory messed up more than just what we know, his early loops with Veyers and existence of Veyers. Plotwise that's why we didn't get a glimpse of his mind, there is nothing that important there and it's a red herring.

Now Veyers is maaaaad because he knows they were going into a loop with Zach, but he knows the loop is not going on and he thinks Zach backstabbed him.
