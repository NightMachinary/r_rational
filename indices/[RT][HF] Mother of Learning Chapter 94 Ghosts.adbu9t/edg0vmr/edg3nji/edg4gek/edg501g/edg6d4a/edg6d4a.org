Could be, but Fortov tends to keep his distance. I'd guess next chapter we're going to have another hint. Or another faux-hint, like "I am forgetting something" from Zorian, that will eventually fall into place and it will turn out that nobody103 has been giving us a middle finger this entire time when it's finally deciphered.
