There are plotholes, and it could still be a rogue simulacra or someone from Korsa or a rogue royal or something. But there are plotholes for every candidate so far.

Fortov's main strengths are how regular it is that he pushes Ibery into the creepers, and how under the radar he manages to fly. If it is him, who knows: Maybe his shitty mind reading skills were him realising that he didn't get the innate aspect of the bloodline and trying to rectify it with classic Fortov skill. Ibery seems to shift a bit too with when she's on the train, which is a very early change and could also be Fortov.
