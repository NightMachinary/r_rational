  Currently, having a giant soul well is a big liability that can't be hidden since any soul mage can easily find it. Also, the soul well can only be utilized during the invasion, which means this is a liability with no useful near-term function.

Wrong wrong and wrong. The soul well can only be detected if it's affecting you (I mean theoretically you could use divination but it's behind very powerful wards so basically you have to feel it). The invaders can extend it's reach to literally anywhere they bring one of QI's gates and feed it enough mana to stay open. Assuming that they have a mobile one they can just pop into a village, kill everyone and steal their souls, and pop to the next one with no one the wiser.

  Red Robe's first priority should be to collect enough souls and get rid of the mana wall. Second priority is to turn the wife into a lich so that they can abandon the mansion.

I mean I guess you could get rid of it. If Z and Z find it they can call in the military but it might already be too late at this point and the wraith bombs are ready to sail. Also, QI promised him that if Sudomir helped in the invasion QI would turn Sudomirs wife into a lich. We're not sure if he was lying or not so even if QI can Sudomir can't force him or do it himself so no real priority 2.

  Veyers is obviously not Red Robe. He is there today to find the 2nd looper (Zorian). Easiest way to do that would be to start launching fireballs everywhere, which will force Zorian to protect people. Chances are, Red Robe stabilized Veyers and Veyers now knows how to use his powers.

Fair guess.
