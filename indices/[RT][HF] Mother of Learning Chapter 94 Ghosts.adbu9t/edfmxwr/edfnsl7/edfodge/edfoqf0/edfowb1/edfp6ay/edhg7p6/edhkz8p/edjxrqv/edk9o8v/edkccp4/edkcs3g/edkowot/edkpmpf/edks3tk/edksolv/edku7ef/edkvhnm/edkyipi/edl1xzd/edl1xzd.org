You're missing the point. Either they prepare for the military coming, or they start evacuating. Otherwise they're risking blowing the roof off the invasion on random chance.

You're saying that since they don't know if it's possibility A or B they should act like C (they somehow discover it by happening to be in the area and detecting the well), I say either prepare for both or just one if you're confident but it's not going to be C so don't throw away options pointlessly
