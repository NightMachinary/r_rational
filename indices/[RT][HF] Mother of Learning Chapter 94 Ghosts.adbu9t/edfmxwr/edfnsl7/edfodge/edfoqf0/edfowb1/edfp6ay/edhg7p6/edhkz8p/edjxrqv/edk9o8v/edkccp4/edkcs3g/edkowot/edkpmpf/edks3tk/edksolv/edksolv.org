My conclusion is that your premise is stupid and contradictory. The well of souls is no longer any kind of liability because at least Zach is active in the time loop with knowledge of the place so the mansion is going to be found out no matter what.

There's no liability because there's nothing left to hide. No one can accidentally stumble upon it because they didn't in the time loop and if Z and Z want to arrange someone finding it then not having the well there won't stop them.
