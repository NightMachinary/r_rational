What are you talking about? If that mansion goes half the invasion collapses, and if they didn't discover it during the time loop how on earth would they discover it now solely because of the soul well?? What, they got info that there's invasion related stuff there but the massive army of fucking zombies didn't give it away? It's ridiculous to assume they're genius soul mages but so retarded they wouldn't recognize the iron beaks and winter wolves from the invasion and enormous flesh golems wandering around.

It's either safe or it's not, there's no middle group where your logic makes sense.
