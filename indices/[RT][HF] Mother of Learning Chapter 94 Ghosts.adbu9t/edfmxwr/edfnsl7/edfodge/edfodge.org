  Wrong wrong and wrong. The soul well can only be detected if it's affecting you
#+end_quote

exactly, the soul well can be detected if it's affecting you. But it's always on which is why Alanic can feel it. It can be found by any soul mage and can't be hidden. That's a huge liability. Sudomir needed to kill every soul mage, but he failed. Having a giant soul well that can be detected by any soul mage is a huge liability that can disrupt plans because it allows an easy way to get the government involved. Therefore, the priority is to get enough souls to create wraith bombs so that they can ditch the soul well. Or maybe find a way to move the soul well to a new location.

We should assume, at this point, that all "holes" in the invasion are being patched or strengthened.

Edit: In one of the previous restarts, the invasion was cancelled after Z/Z stole the gate. So Z/Z can always steal/destroy the gate to see what the response will be. If the invasion is still going on, then Z/Z can assume that the invaders are now using a different method of invading.
