Currently, having a giant soul well is a big liability that can't be hidden since any soul mage can easily find it. Also, the soul well can only be utilized during the invasion, which means this is a liability with no useful near-term function.

Red Robe's first priority should be to collect enough souls and get rid of the mana wall. Second priority is to turn the wife into a lich so that they can abandon the mansion.

Veyers is obviously not Red Robe. He is there today to find the 2nd looper (Zorian). Easiest way to do that would be to start launching fireballs everywhere, which will force Zorian to protect people. Chances are, Red Robe stabilized Veyers and Veyers now knows how to use his powers.
