For RR and Silverlake, it doesn't matter if freeing other primordials is something Panaxeth would like or not. They are soul bound to free him by the planetary alignment or die. That's the terms of the deal Panaxeth and gave Silverlake and, according to Panaxeth, RR as well. Even if Panaxeth didn't want them dead due to a change in circumstance, and quite frankly dead servants are unhelpful, that's their time limit. It's hardcoded on their soul now.
