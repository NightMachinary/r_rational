Because they're up against two (or potentially many more from their perspective, but at least 2) other loopers and potentially the full force of the strongest nation on the entire continent, depending on what the loopers do. Their life is at risk, they can't afford to just shrug and assume the best case scenario. Also, the day on which they are going to attack and the location of that attack is known and something they absolutely can't change (or more specifically the time and place of the ritual to free Panaxeth), which is a massive disadvantage they can do NOTHING about.

If they're using their limited time and resources to work on things that don't specifically help them in that battle, they're idiots.

Splitting resources to try to free another primordial during the planetary alignment, even assuming the knew and had access to it's location, is highly unwise.
