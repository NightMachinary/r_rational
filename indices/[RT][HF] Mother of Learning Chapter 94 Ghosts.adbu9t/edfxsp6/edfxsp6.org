Rather weak chapter. I was already primed for big plot point from the last chapter, to see little happened here is disappointing. The first part about Zach asking Zorian his long term plan seems came from nowhere. Zach should already know both his and Zorian non-invasion-related plan, they talked about it sometime in the past. Taiven interaction is natural, but I can't find its higher purpose. It gives reader example that Zorian might not be able to keep all his secret, but why Taiven get the spotlight? Why not condense it at the upcoming Veyer-Zach confrontation? Benisek knowing rumor from distant land also strange, aren't they only at the 2nd day?
