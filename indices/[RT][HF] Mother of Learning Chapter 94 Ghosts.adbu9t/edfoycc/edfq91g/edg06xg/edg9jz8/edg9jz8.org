We know that the towns attacked had some survivors and while most of them individually wouldn't have been likely to be able to contact a nearby city, a lot of towns were attacked and it only takes one to get a teleporting mage out to confirm the story, nearly instantly. We know Cyoria has a teleport point that has comparably heavy traffic, so if news was going to travel anywhere nearby, it would be Cyoria. We also don't know how long exactly this has been going on. It could very well have started the very day RR got back (though likely would have needed at least a couple days to get access to the well of souls). We only ever saw his simulacrum.
