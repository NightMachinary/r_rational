  It's been mentioned that there are intercontinental teleportation devices but they are heavily monitored and require background checks to use.

Not true at all. In fact, it's even explicitly stated that intercontinental teleportation /doesn't/ exist. That's why Quatach Ichl states he's operating in "impossible mode" with his gate devices. What you're thinking of are teleportation platforms. The range of these platforms is limited and they operate on an strict (and slow) schedule meaning that Zach and Zorian couldn't use them to get to Blantyrre. They could barely use them to get to Koth but managed to do so with a few days left in the restart, enough time to find a Bakora gate key. Doing so required multiple teleport "hops" all chained together.
