Wraith bombs release wraiths that are moderate level monsters that can multiply with each kill. It would cause a lot of casualties in a population center, but nothing that couldn't be contained. They were initially intended to be used to frame other nations and start a new splinter war. Now they are apparently being readied earlier in order to, presumably, be used to aid in the attack on Cyoria.

Getting QI to give up on what are essentially future allies would be a hard sell for red robe, me thinks. The advantage he gets out of a new splinter war starting is immeasurable after all. His enemy suddenly fighting a war on countless fronts. I'm not sure he'd even give that up for the primordial, since he believes the angels will defeat it soon after it's released.

That being said, he might do so if RR clued him into the time loop happening. We saw earlier that he seems to be aware that such a thing exists, since last time he realized what was going on he literally blew up his own soul to try to kill them. He clearly takes that threat very seriously.
