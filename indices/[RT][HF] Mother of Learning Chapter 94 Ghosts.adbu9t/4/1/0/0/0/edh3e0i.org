It could also be the misdirection ploy- we know that other primordials exist, more than one person in these threads has brought up the idea that Panaxeth was anyway planning on freeing his brethren, and the story already mentioned info about the other primordials and showcased ZZ's search for other prisons. From the early ending loop where Zorian and the army attacked Sudomir head-on, we also know that the primordial can be successfully freed before the planetary alignment. RR and the Cult could prioritize releasing one or two primordials outside of Cyoria first, throwing the world into chaos while still be working towards Panaxeth's longer-term goals.
