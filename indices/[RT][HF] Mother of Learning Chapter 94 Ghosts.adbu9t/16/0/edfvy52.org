Nah.

Both sides - ZZ and RR+Silverlake+Q - know too little about one another to engage in immediate battle. They don't know the other side's identities, resources, tools, etc. And there are no more restarts, and death is permanent. So both sides are playing it safe and conservatively, acting through simulacrums while accumulating resources and securing advantages.

Given the knowledge and powers the two sides have, either side could have already set fire to a significant part of Eldemar and other neighboring nations. But they aren't doing so precisely because they're both fearful of the other side, and acting so openly would invite deadly reprisals.

So it's going to be a war in the shadows until, well, the shadows aren't big enough any more. I'd suggest that you have faith; I'm sure Nobody is going to give us a significantly action-packed conclusion in good and due time.
