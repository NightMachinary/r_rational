There are <10 chapters left of the story, and all of them can't be nonstop fighting. Also, a lot of the fighting going on is immaterial to the larger goals- the specifics of how their simulacrums are clashing are largely unimportant, the intrigue is actually figuring out what RR's current goals are and what can be done to stop them. IMO one or even two more "ramp-up" chapters would still be good.
