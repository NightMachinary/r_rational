While intelligent agency could (or rather, must) be true, it should never be taken into consideration. We are at the endgame, the time for guesses had passed. Furthermore, it's Benisek we're talking about. A son of a merchant. He being adept at grasping local political climate is one thing, he knowing news from distant land in just a single day is another.

Edit: I might be too quick on laying suspicion. Benisek said he read it on newspaper. If true, then it's the news network that should be the target of our stink eye. Not Benisek.
