Yeah, he said something snarky about them caring more about protecting their treasury than their subjects when they were planning to rob the treasury, and one or two other comments that are eluding me right now.

Tinami mentioned that the royals knew what what was going on but both Tesen and Noveda were big crown supporters and with the massive casualties from the wars and the Weeping they backed the house that was still intact. Plus Tesen bribed them with all sorts of Noveda treasures like the Sovereign Gate. I can't quite remember Zach going on an angry rant about them, but they knowingly screwed him over and he's not happy about.

Plus, from the perspective of the government, can you trust him being forgiving or is he just waiting to sell them out to the treacherous Falkrinans
