Lol, Cyoria has been corrupt from the start. The head of the Cyorian Mage Guild and multiple other figures high in the city government were ranking members in the Cult of the Dragon Below. Zorian got /assassinated/ the first time he tried reporting things to the authorities. The story has already heavily implied that the Eldemar royals are major dicks who could be compared to IRL Vladimir Putin - they're just /waiting/ for a chance to gobble up and conquer/annex the neighboring Splinter States, whose sovereignty they don't even remotely recognize.

The MoL-verse is cool as hell, but the central governments and royals are well known to be both powerful and untrustworthy.

/However,/ to play devil's advocate to myself here, corruption isn't always a bad thing. House Noveda has a long historical record of loyalty and good service to the Eldemar Throne. Would it /really/ be such a bad thing if Zach and Zorian informed the crown of the time loop? I could easily see it being played off as the Crown handling the situation by giving the two of them a golden leash, because they aren't just upjumped peasants. House Noveda is a big deal and Zorian is the Noveda heir's best friend. The Crown might restore House Noveda's fortunes and bind Zach closely to them with a favorable marraige, giving him power and authority but on the restricted terms of serving the crown for the rest of his life, which isn't all that bad a deal in this universe. He could be a general or something.
