When Silverlake left (we assume) the loop, her soul return to it's default state. Zach interacted with her and she was left without any new memories. She was not left soulless like Veyers.

If Veyers was indeed a looper and was ejected, he probably thinks that he is still looping. From his perspective, he was hit with a mysterious spell and woke up in a new restart. He may not know that there will be no new restarts.
