  Lol, Cyoria has been corrupt from the start. The head of the Cyorian Mage Guild and multiple other figures high in the city government were ranking members in the Cult of the Dragon Below. The story has already heavily implied that the Eldemar royals are major dicks who could be compared to IRL Vladimir Putin - they're just waiting for a chance to gobble up and conquer/annex the neighboring Splinter States, whose sovereignty they don't even remotely recognize.

There's a difference between actual treason as part of a plan to burn the country to the ground to become immortal or whatever and just being greedy bastards.

And yeah, the royals are heavily implied to be dicks, but that doesn't mean the entire government is. I mean, just because the absolute monarchs of a country of millions want to conquer other countries doesn't mean everyone is war-hungry.

  However, to play devil's advocate to myself here, corruption isn't always a bad thing. House Noveda has a long historical record of loyalty and good service to the Eldemar Throne. Would it really be such a bad thing if Zach and Zorian informed the crown of the time loop? I could easily see it being played off as the Crown handling the situation by giving the two of them a golden leash, because they aren't just upjumped peasants. House Noveda is a big deal and Zorian is the Noveda heir's best friend. The Crown might restore House Noveda's fortunes and bind Zach closely to them with a favorable marraige, giving him power and authority but on the restricted terms of serving the crown for the rest of his life, which isn't all that bad a deal in this universe.

To play Jesus' advocate (and man have I waited a long time to do that), Zorian is a jumped-up peasant and Zach is a washed up member of what was once a powerful house but now is a single stripped-out building and a legacy. Zach is powerful but politically isolated, it wouldn't be impossible to make him and Zorian disappear into a black-ops site to learn everything they learned in the time loop with some lead-pipe legimency or just straight-up drugging them and using government mind mages.

They'd put a fight, no doubt, but if it was them or their families and friends....
