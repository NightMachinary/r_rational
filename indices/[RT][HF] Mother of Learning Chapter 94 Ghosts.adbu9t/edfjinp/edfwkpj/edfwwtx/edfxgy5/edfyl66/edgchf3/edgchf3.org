They should honestly stick with telling the church and try to inform the angels. I know they are against letting out the primordial and seems to be the only force that is uncorrupt in the story. Not to mention they respond immediately to events.

Though I would place Zach to brave that front since Zorian doesn't know where he stands where angels are concerned. I'm afraid the primordial might be telling the truth in how the angels are a danger to Zorian(might see him as an abomination if they find out about his true orgins).

Honestly there's so many options, though staying the pair needs to start being proactive because in war you need to have the enemy play by your rules.

So far they seem to only be reacting to whatever the enemy is doing instead or forcing the enemy to respond to moves of theirs (moving against dragon cult members/Lich). It might be dangerous but it does put them in the best spot to keep the enemy on their toes and not give them a chance to actually build up their forces.
