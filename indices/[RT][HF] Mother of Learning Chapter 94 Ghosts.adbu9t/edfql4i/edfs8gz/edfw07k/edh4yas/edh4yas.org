Zach doesn't beat Tesen Zveri at the same time, same place during a loop. The fight with RR happens earlier than Zach normally "wakes up" during the loop, when it starts, in the middle of the night. It can feasibly be in the newspapers later that day- Zorian wakes up late, and it's a few hours before he boards the train, which in turn takes some time to get to Cyoria. Zach singlehandedly beating up Tesen during the loop /has/ to take place later in the day, and may even be less disruptive/eyecatching compared to explosions in the middle of the night. The other poster already mentioned the "cover-up" aspects as well.
