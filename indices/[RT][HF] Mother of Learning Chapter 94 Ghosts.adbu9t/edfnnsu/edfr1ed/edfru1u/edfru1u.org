Yes I agree. I've been pretty sure Veyers is not Red Robe since that reveal but it's still a possibility until we know for sure who RR is and that there weren't any shenanigans. Honestly even with this I think he is still far more likely to be RR than the more absurd theories like it actually being Zach, his simulacrums or Zorian's simulacrum.
