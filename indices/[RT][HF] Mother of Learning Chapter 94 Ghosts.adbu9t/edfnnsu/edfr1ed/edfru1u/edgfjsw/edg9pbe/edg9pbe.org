Is it possible that Veyers is red robe, before exiting the time loop he gives a temporary time loop tag to someone he trusts and teachs them how to do that soul kill he used on the aranea.

Then when Veyers resets he immediately gets soul killed.

I'm a bit fuzzy on why would Veyers bother, maybe it would eliminate him as a suspect?
