I wouldn't try to imply that RR is Zach. I'm not sure THAT is physically possible given all we've seen. There might be some way to wriggle an explanation out, but it would take a lot of work if you aren't willing to just redefine old events. I was just trying to point out that while Veyers is certainly not RR, it isn't something that is "technically impossible" as you worded it. It's technically possible, just exceedingly unlikely. Conflating the two is dangerous when, even in the real world, the exceedingly unlikely happens every day.
