Actually, that IS technically impossible. You see, RR was there by the time Zorian started looping. So, given by your theory that Zach soul kills Veyers with the dagger is impossible because Zach remembers time from there on. And certainly didn't remove anyone from the loop.

Zorian also knows that Zach was not capable of removing people from the loop at that time, and had no idea of soul kill. (When they talk later). Nor does the Zach in that time loop know who the third time traveller is (because he is desperately searching for one and tells Zorian that; and that Zach was surprised by the third looper).

tl;dr: Zach can't soul kill RR Veyers, for Zach remembers stuff from soul kill restart; and Red Robe left afterwards.
