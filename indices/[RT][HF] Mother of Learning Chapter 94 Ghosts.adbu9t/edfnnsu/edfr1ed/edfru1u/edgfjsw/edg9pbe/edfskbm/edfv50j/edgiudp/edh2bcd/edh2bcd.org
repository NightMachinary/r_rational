Yes, the theory would require Zach to be both more compatent than he appears to be and lying to Zorian for reasons that are not apparent. That being said, the fact that Zach's memory hasn't returned is something we're just accepting on faith. Remember that Zach is not the protagonist. We don't have the luxury of reading his thoughts. There's a lot of mystery and a lot of intrigue surrounding Zach and the events up to the start of the loop and including him being the new chosen one and his early years in the loop, which apparently RR came from.

The by far more likely option is that Veyers isn't RR, so much so that I'm not entertaining the idea at all that he is, but remember that this is a work of fiction so probability isn't nearly as important as the real world. Even what should be possible isn't a hard and fast rule in fiction.
