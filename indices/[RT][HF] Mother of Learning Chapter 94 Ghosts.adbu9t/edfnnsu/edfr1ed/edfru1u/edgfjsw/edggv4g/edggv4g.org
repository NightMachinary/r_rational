We've seen how QI reacts to people he thinks are time loopers. QI has a code of honor and a sense of logic that don't necessarily apply or make sense to the people around him and definitely isn't always what would pragmatically give him the best final results, but we've SEEN what he thinks the correct action is when faced with a looper. He was working together with ZZ when he catches on to them, so being allies is no protection. The moment he realized he wasn't the real QI and RR was a looper, RR would be at ground zero to a soul explosion.
