You're weirdly fixated on the idea that QI self destructs in any situation where he learns he's in a time loop. Which is pretty silly.

He self destructed when he was already losing and dicovered that he had no long term survival option but did have a "screw your canoe" solution.

Pan's offer of incarnation outside the loop completely reverses that as that ensures long term survival of the instance of himself in the loop. Further, if Loop QI exited in a new body as per Pan's offer the invasion gains an archamge with a divine blessing with comparable loyalty to the cause to original QI's, and QI gains an instance of himself that is not a liche, and has his own mana pool. Even if loop QI didn't gain any knowledge useful for improving the invasion he's still a valuble asset that may open doors for future plans that would otherwise be unworkable due to the difficulty in locating and trusting mages of QI's caliber and skill set.
