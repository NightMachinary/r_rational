QI has not been established as assuming treachery until proven otehrwise. He's savvy enough to expect treachery from Z&Z but they're on the opposite side of a national conflict from him, and again, he was already in the middle of being backstabbed by Z&Z when he detonated himself. We have no examples of his doing it as the opening move for his own backstab.

RR on the otehr hand has the same goal as QI (release a primordial), and has spent the loops optimizing the same side of the conflict as QI. And he has a pretty big incentive to follow through as he'll die in real life if he doesn't. RR could in theory even arrange for Pan itself to fill QI in via the soverign gate, but I kind of doubt that would happen as RR should be worried QI might pull a Silverlake.
