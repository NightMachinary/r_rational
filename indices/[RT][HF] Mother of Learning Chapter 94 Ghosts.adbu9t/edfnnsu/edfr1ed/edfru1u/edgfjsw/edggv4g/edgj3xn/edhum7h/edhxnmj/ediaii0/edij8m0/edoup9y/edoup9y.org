Why bother "pulling a Silverlake"? We already know QI is so committed to the cause that he'll suicide bomb himself to try and kill Zach when he discovers what's up, and with more time to plan, QI could probably even finish the job outright.

Right after he does the same thing to RR, who very stupidly told an ancient lich that he's an untrustworthy looper who is garnering ever more power and who will be of exactly no use in the real world if Zach is dead.
