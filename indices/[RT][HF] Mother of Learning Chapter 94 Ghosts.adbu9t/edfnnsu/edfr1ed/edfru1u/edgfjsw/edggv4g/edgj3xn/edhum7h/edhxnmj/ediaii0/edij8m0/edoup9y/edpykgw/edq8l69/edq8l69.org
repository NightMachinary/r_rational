QI has few reasons to be tempted by Panaxeth; as far as he's concerned, if you'll remember, the invasion is a success as long as it causes chaos, and he doesn't actually want or expect Panaxeth to rampage for long. He's already had a life longer than any looper, and clearly isn't in great need of more training or power. And he is not so selfish as to worry about himself over his original, since he has no problem blowing himself up for the cause.

If RR told QI about the loop, the correct thing for QI to do is immediately kill RR (who definitely Knows Too Much) and then find a way to turn Zach's soul into Swiss cheese. That neatly ties up all the loose ends from his perspective.
