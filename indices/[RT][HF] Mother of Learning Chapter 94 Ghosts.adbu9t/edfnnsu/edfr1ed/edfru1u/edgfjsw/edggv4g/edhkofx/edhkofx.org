I don't think this checks out.

First off, if Veyers is RR, why erase his memory of Veyers in the first place? It's very lame if he just assumed that leaving the loop would leave you soulkilled; the RR we know might even have had Panaxeth test that in some way. Just barely erasing yourself from Zach's memory and then soulkilling your old self seems like it couldn't be better designed to get found out the first time Zach actually tries to solve his memory issues, something that was bound to happen.

Why would RR tell QI anything about the time loop? Why would QI do all the complicated soul stuff to keep RR in the loop if he could just do it to himself and avoid having to rely on some random person whose goals are only tangentially related to his?

And we have good reason to believe that QI doesn't typically even get told about Zach, given that he usually doesn't attack him until after he's already caused a lot of damage. Even in the reset where RR specifically has QI and his vampire friend seek out Zach with him, it's not remotely clear that QI understands anything about what's going on; he certainly doesn't act like he's dealing with a time traveler.

And because you can't really tell QI, you also can't get QI's crown to get somebody else to do it unless you take it by force. Good luck doing something that eventually required Z&Z to gather several archmages and a teleporting hydra to accomplish!
