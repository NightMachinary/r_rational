  First off, if Veyers is RR, why erase his memory of Veyers in the first place?
#+end_quote

If RR was Veyers he would remove Zach's memory of him early on to keep Zach from seeking him out. We know that Zach would often attack his appointed guardian during the loops because of how much he hated him. We also know that Zach hated Veyers, so we can assume that Zach might have occasionally gone looking to attack Veyers. If RR was Veyers he wouldn't want Zach to come looking and find that Veyers wasn't acting the way a non-looping person should.

  It's very lame if he just assumed that leaving the loop would leave you soulkilled
#+end_quote

In this hypothetical scenario, RR-Veyers isn't assuming that he leaves a 'soulkilled' body behind. He's setting it up so someone else 'soulkills' his replacement. RR-Veyers wouldn't want Old-Veyers walking around getting discovered by Zach/the other loopers, so he opted to arrange for him to be 'soulkilled' instead.

  ...the first time Zach actually tries to solve his memory issues, something that was bound to happen.
#+end_quote

Zach actively avoided trying to look into the missing memories. Zorian had to argue with Zach fairly hard just to get him to admit that the missing memory was out of the ordinary. Zorian then mentioned that Zach was probably under some sort of mental compulsion to keep him from looking into the missing memories. So it definitely wasn't bound to happen. It required not only an additional looper, but a looper who knew Zach well enough to notice that that missing memory was weird.

  Why would RR tell QI anything about the time loop?
#+end_quote

Because in this scenario RR needs someone to get rid of the Old-Veyers that would be walking around after he left the loop. Getting QI to cooperate is a simpler narrative solution than stealing the crown and getting someone else to do the cleanup.

I don't particularly want to argue about QI's motivations for helping, because it doesn't really matter. I don't even actually believe that this is what happened. I just wanted to point out that RR-Veyers theory is still possible (although quite unlikely) under the time loop mechanics we are already aware of.

I think it's more likely that Veyers was 'soulkilled' as part of the shenanigans that the primordial used to make it so RR could loop in the first place. Something along the lines of providing a convenient body for the primordial to shove an expired temporary looper into. But that is all speculation outside of our current knowledge of the time loop's mechanics.
