We saw that loopers who leave the loop, leave copies in the loop that return to their old selves. That would imply that Veyers was NOT a looper, or at least not one that left the loop, but WAS someone who was soul-killed in the loop by a looper. Probably red robe, but potential Zach.

Veyers is almost certainly not RR, but was in some way connected to the loopers. It's known that Zach and Veyers hated each other, so young Zach may have soul-killed him simply out of spite, but the fact that Veyers was removed from Zach's memory would imply that it's more complicated than that.
