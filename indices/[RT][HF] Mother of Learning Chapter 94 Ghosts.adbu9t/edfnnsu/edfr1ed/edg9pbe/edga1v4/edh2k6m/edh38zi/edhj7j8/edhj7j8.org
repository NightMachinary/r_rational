You could always let QI read your mind to discover your intentions! I bet that would work great. And since QI has the crown that lets you make temporary loopers, you more or less have to get his buy-in if you're not going to try and steal it from him.

I agree with you, in any case. QI clearly doesn't get told the entire story by RR every reset, given how QI reacts to him disappearing after he reads Zach's mind in Chapter 26. And any plausible candidate for RR would want to avoid letting QI know much about him for the same reason Z&Z are trying to avoid letting the authorities know who they are.
