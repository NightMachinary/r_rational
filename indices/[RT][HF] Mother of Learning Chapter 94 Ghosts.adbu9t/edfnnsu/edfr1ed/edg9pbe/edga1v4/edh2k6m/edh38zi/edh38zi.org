QI COULD get the dagger, I'll give you that. I'm still not entirely sold on QI helping a looper, even one that claims to be on his side, because no action taken in the loop can really be evidence of a loopers real predisposition. Not from QI's perspective. He understands that the people in the loop and the actions taken in it are essentially not "real". I'm of the opinion that finding out someone is looper for QI is tantamount to a soul suicide bombing, but I could be wrong.
