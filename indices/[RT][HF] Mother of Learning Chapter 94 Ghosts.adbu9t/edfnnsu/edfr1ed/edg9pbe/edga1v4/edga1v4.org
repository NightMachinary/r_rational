The soul kill used on the aranea was likely the ability granted by the imperial dagger and not some technique that can be taught. Outside the loopers, the people being born each cycle aren't rewinds of the same soul, they are entirely new souls. No amount of damage done to a soul will make it "soul killed" (which is a misnomer really because the soul isn't killed it's just removed from the loop by the system using the administrative authority granted by an imperial relic).

It's still possible that it was a technique used and not an imperial relic, something that marked the soul for removal from the system, which you might learn how to do if you studied people being removed from the system by the dagger, but that would require soul killing quite a few people for study, and that would be something that would be noticable. After the soul killing of a relatively small number of people, Zorian sees the news show up in the papers.

Also considering that having a temporary looper to help is also an imperial relic ability, this plan relies on RR having access to imperial relics either way. And he can't pass on the dagger.

Nothing here is strictly impossible. Just much less likely than other available options. But it's a work of fiction so odds don't necessarily have to matter.
