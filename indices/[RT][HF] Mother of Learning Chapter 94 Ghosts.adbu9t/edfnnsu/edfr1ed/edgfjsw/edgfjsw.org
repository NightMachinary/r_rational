I don't feel that Veyers is RR, but if he was it would definitely be possible for him to arrange the 'soulkill' to happen after leaving the loop.

We know that QI is able to quickly accept the existence of the loop and even go so far as to self-destruct his own soul to try to help his original self. RR would just have to explain the situation to QI, tell him how to get and use the dagger, place a temporary marker on him, and then leave the loop. QI would then 'soulkill' the new Veyers once the next restart happens. By the time Zorian and Zach go back to Cyoria, QI's temporary marker would have expired.

It's a messy situation, but RR-Veyers might do it to keep the new Veyers from ever wandering into a Zach that had no memory of him. QI would be inclined to help because he wants his original self to succeed and keeping Zach from suspecting RR's identity would be in QI's best interest.
