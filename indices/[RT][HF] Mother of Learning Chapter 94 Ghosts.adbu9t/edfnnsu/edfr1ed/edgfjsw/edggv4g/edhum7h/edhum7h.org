That's not right.

QI had already been betrayed when he detonated his soul. And the reason he was willing to do it was because he learned he was a temporary instance of himself and he saw a chance to sacrifice that instance to potentially wound people who could threaten his 'real' self in teh future.

​

If RR was an ally and QI belived he'd continue to be an asset outside the loop he wouln't go nova juts because he's ina time loop.

​

IMO the reason this idea doesn't work is instead because if QI spent a reset with the ability to soul kill and his only loopng ally had exited the loop, he'd probably have soul killed Zack (RR having pointed Zack out to him in the encounter at the dance). Worst case scenario Zack wakes up outside the loop, but not knowing he's out, and with no additional opportunity to exploit the loop. Best case scenario Zack's soul gets deleted on the next restart and the loop runs on automatic until the power runs out.
