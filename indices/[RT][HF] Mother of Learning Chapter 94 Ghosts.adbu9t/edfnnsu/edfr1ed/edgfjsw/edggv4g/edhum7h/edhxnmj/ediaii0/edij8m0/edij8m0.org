When QI meets ZZ for the first time in the bar, he clearly begins from a state of distrust and becomes even more wary of them when their excessive resources become apparent. The greater their resources the less readily he was willing to trust them. He doesn't move to work with them until he believes that he has something over them, eg. their need to study quickly and access to resources only he has, eg. his intelligence. He doesn't also trust them immediately to uphold their end of the bargain and only agrees when he has some good reason to assume they will, eg. straight up giving him the crown, one of the most powerful relics on the planet.

He was shown to exist in a state of caution and distrust by default and a looper is by default someone who's motives you can't ascertain from their words or actions. Giving him the crown as a looper wouldn't work, the ownership of property is meaningless in the loop. Promising to help him with tasks won't work because he has absolutely zero power to enforce that promise. QI doesn't know you have aligning goals, your words mean nothing if there is absolutely zero power to verify them, eg having a future that exists. Of course you want something from him, but from the Spirit Serpents reaction earlier it's clear that previous loopers in history have made a lot of promises and not fulfilled any of them. Those would be the loopers that QI was around to learn about.

Maybe if you could show some strong reason that you would want to help him, that existed well before the loop began and could evidentially be shown to exist well before the loop began. I could see that working. And maybe RR has that. Totally possible.
