Sorry, I think my reply to you must've gotten eaten by the Reddit app. Perhaps I've been unclear---I don't think QI blows himself up every time he hears about the loop, I think QI would simply take /direct action/ with the knowledge in a way that none of the other characters would.

Setting aside for now the question of how QI would even get into the loop, from his perspective, the risks have to outweigh the benefits. Unlike Z&Z (and presumably RR), he doesn't have nearly as much to personally gain, and the benefits for his nation are relatively minor; better black rooms would be cool, but as the loop demonstrates, the entire reason he's on the mainland is a resounding success absent any intervention.

On the other hand, he has all the knowledge he needs to find this whole thing very doubtful. Learning about the loop is enough to demonstrate to him that the angels aren't just involved, but /already trying to stop the primordial,/ which suggests a lot about how likely the summoning is to work, IMO. And much like Silverlake, I find it doubtful that he'd have any success working together with his original self.

And all that is contingent on someone actually telling him about the loop, which, again, would be incredibly stupid of RR to do. Now, RR isn't just a mysterious figure that QI plans on investigating after the invasion, he's someone who knows extremely intimate details about QI himself. Killing him would be the smart move. Zach would also have no reason to tell him either, and even if QI /did/ learn about it another way, I'm not sure Panaxeth would offer him anything or QI would accept. How do you tempt the world's most powerful lich?

In conclusion, I think the more interesting question here is why QI /hasn't/ taken that decisive action. It can't be because RR doesn't want QI to find out about the loop at all---there are other ways to tell QI to crush Zach's soul permanently---so there's got to be a good reason why Zach is still alive. And given Panaxeth's degree of control over the gate mechanism, I also find it hard to believe it's because Zach has to stay alive for the loop to keep functioning.
