Touche, my memory on that portion was clearly not up to snuff. I concede the point. It takes Veyers being RR from the realm of "next to impossible" to "technically possible", which is all that really matters in a work of fiction. It still doesn't seem to be the case to me, but then the story itself concerns itself very little with my particular expectations of it.

I will say that I don't think RR COULD convince QI that he's an ally while also convincing him that he's a looper. QI knows full well that actions in the loop are like actions in a dream, and not at all evidence of someone's real predisposition. For him a looper is someone of extraordinary and growing power, whose true goals are impossible to know as any action they take in the loop is guaranteed to revert itself. I still feel like it would be suicide bomb central, population QI, but I'll concede that that isn't certain.
