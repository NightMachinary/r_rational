QI found out they were loopers in the middle of a fight between QI, Zach, Zorian, Xvim, Alanic, and Silverlake. He first suspected it was an illusion and that's why he began the fight with ZZ. They then pulled the others out of the orb where they had been waiting for this fight. The battle ground was even prepared beforehand for the ambush, which became obvious during the fight.

Partway through the fight QI hit Xvim with a dispell to break down his mental barriers and did a memory probe. The memory probe is what made him realize that it wasn't an illusion, it was a time loop.

Earlier on in the restart ZZ were raiding QI's forces, then they talked with him and told him to his face that they were "irreconcilable enemies", then they brought him to an ambush after working with him to steal the dagger.

QI's response was definitely not /just/ because he found out they were loopers. At that point they were clearly enemies working to stop the invasion. And the time loop provided them an insane advantage that the original QI would have no way to account for. That's why he blew up his soul. It was a last ditch attempt to completely disable them.

He would have no reason to do that for a person who is helping the invasion, especially if that person properly describes the situation. QI would see that RR is his only option for countering Zach's timeloop advantage. And a millennia old lich is bound to have methods to make sure that RR is being truthful.
