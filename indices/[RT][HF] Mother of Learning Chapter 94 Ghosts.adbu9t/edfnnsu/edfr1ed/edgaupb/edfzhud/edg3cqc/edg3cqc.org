A former classmate, noble house hit hard by the weeping and wars, had a bloodline that needed a main family member (who were all dead save Veyers) to not drive him crazy from the power. Didn't work so well when the rest of his family tried to improvise when it manifested in Veyers. Thinks everyone is against him because he's so crazy they don't want him as a main bloodline member and are all but kicking him out of the family and takes solace in his lawyer friend who had a similar background. Got expelled from school after attacking a school official at a hearing, possibly unintentionally.

Zach had a gap in his memory about his existence even though he remembered tons of other people and Veyers punched him in the face. Had a compulsion to drop the subject/think he just forgot normally if it was ever brought up. Was found soulkilled in the lawyers basement at the start of the loop.
