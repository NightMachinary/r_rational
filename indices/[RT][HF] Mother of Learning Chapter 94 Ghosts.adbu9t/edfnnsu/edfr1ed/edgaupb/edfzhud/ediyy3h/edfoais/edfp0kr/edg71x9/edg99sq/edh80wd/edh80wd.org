No, but it might explain why Veyers was soul-killed; the kid was near RR or an asset (which is why they were evacuated) and proved himself to be unmanageable by doing crazy shit like barging into his old class on a power trip. RR may not have planned for controlling Veyers actions long term because he expected Zach to fall to his ambush and resolve any future issues... So now we have Veyers doing crazy shit again.
