Wow. That's actually really plausible, did not occur to me at all but it makes sense now that you say it. It's possible Zorian is mistaken about Veyers and RR's relationship so he might be willing to do such a thing and not really care about Veyers. I'm sure it'd be easy to trick Veyers into doing as well. There are a couple issues. The first one I see is that they still need to release Panaxeth and even if the wraiths completely conquer the town they'd then have to deal with them. The other issue is that this is like kicking an anthill and the government will respond asap to such provocation. It's possible QI can handle the first issue and they might be assuming ZZ already informed the government so I can see it.
