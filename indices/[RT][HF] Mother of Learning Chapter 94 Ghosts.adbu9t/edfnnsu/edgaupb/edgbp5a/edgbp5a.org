That doesn't really make sense with RR already trying and failing to kill Zach. If he had some mental trap why not trigger it then when he was close to killing him or when he was trying to get information about the other loopers in the time loop? There is also the problem that he should know about Zorian at this point. Even if Silverlake didn't tell him anything he saw Zach get saved by Zorian so he knows he has an ally at this point.
