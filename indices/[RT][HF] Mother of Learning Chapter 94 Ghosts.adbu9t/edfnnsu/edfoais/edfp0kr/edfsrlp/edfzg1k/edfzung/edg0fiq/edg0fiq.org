True, but he's also aware that they are either budding soul mages or had access to one now he knows his attempt to kill the loopers in loop failed. It seems like a bit of a big sacrifice to off Veyers, who is clearly important to RR (assuming he's not just a slightly stabilised but still insane RR) for a chance to kill them and turn Cyoria into a terrible haunted ruin.

I mean, if that IS his plan the invasion is happening here and now - they'll loose the Primordial since QI will be able to protect the people around the hole from wraiths, and it's action time. But it seems unlikely. Especially if the Academy somehow has necromantic wards, because then you've sacrificed Veyers to kill a room full of kids and a chance to kill a pair of opponents who can probably defend themselves.
