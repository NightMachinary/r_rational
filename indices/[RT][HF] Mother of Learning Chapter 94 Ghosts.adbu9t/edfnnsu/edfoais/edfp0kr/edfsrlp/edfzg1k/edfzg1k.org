I can't see QI signing off on it - he wanted it to be evidence of Eldemar to bring others into the new splinter wars against them. Releasing one in Cyoria, arguably their most important city, seems a bit unlikely. Unless they've got a major attack going on elsewhere right now, but that seems unlikely. Sudomir was more interested in it for the Necromantic Legalisation aspect.
