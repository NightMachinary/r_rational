It's entirely possible that this is exactly what Veyers would normal do with no prodding at all. We know he's got a hot temper and all we've seen him do is slam a door. We never saw how he behaved in the loop because he was soul killed the entire time. This might just be Veyers making a dramatic entrance (something that totally fits with his characterization so far). That would be a less interesting answer on the face of things, but it's less convoluted and thus far we don't have much solid evidence to believe it's more than that.

Caution advised, but I wouldn't jump out of my seat and start fighting.
