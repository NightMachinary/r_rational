I'm basing that off the fact that when Z&Z investigated him in the loop, they found nothing except that he was a low-level cult associate. My assumption is that Veyers has always been a red herring, and if that's true, there's no reason for Jornak to be anything more than was said initially.

Even if he is important, he most definitely isn't RR. We know now that RR was more or less recruited by Panaxeth, and there are plenty of reasons to think that the only way this could happen is if pre-mind-screwed Zach took someone into the gate to meet the Controller. It's impossible for me to imagine a situation where Zach would feel the need to bring a lawyer down there. Plus it'd be a big anticlimax to one of the series' core mysteries and Jornak didn't even show up until the third act of the story. Veyers /could/ be RR, even if it's highly unlikely, but Jornak definitely isn't.

(My theory remains that [[https://www.reddit.com/r/motheroflearning/comments/aazrb6/a_final_rr_theory_spoilers_through_93/][RR is Zorian]] and nothing I've seen so far really shakes this, but if I had to guess at an alternative, it'd be Fortov.)
