The Primordial was powerful, but didn't appear to be exceptionally cunning. Also if he had the power to soul kill people he would have probably done so when Zorian was attempting to escape. Instead he fires bone things to try to kill him. Also he expressed an unwillingness to use his limited power unless it was absolutely necessary, so him doing it to soul kill someone to make them appear to not be red robe on the off chance that they hunt down his corpse AND realize that loop leavers don't leave behind soul killed corpses is exceptionally unlikely, even if he did think to do so. Once again, he wasn't depicted as exceptionally cunning.
