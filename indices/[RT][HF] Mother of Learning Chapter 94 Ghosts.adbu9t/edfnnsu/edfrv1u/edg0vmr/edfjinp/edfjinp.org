The central government is notoriously corrupt and power hungry? That.. that actually explains a lot about why Zorian wasn't working with them more closely both in and out of the time loop. Honestly I should have expected it from an industrial-revolution era country.

It's also a major bummer. Cyoria was really cool from an outside perspective and now it's like Thailand.
