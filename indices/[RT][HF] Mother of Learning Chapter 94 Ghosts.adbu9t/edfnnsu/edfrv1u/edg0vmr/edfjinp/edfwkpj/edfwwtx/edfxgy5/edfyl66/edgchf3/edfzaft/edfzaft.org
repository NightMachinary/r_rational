This is technically plausible, and has been explored in various Naruto fanfictions that treat powerful bloodlines and the possession of them as matters of national security. But even in those stories, massive escalations like what you're speaking of here are basically a matter of last resort, reserved for powerful bloodlines in the hands of hostile powers. And Zach isn't exactly hostile to the crown, and he doesn't have any real reason to be so. His family has a record of centuries of service, and he himself is basically a general-class archmage with vast potential for growth in power and leadership potential. He would be a good marriage candidate to a lesser princess, a second or third daughter or something.

So, yes, Vladimir Putin would do that. He marries his own daughters to well-connected oligarchs and other useful, powerful families with something to offer. The Russian upper circle of plutocrats is practicing all kinds of marriage alliances nowadays.
