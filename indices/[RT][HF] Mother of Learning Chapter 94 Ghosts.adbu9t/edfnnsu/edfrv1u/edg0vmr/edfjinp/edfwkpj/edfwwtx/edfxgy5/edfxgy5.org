I don't think the royal/interior authorities would immediately resort to violence in interrogating Zach and Zorian. Yeah, the royals would want to know /everything/, but what information do Zach and Zorian really have, that the royals would want, that if shared would have major negative consequences for the two of them?

All I can think of is the location of various divine artifacts that Zach and Zorian want for themselves. But... why would the royals not let Zach and Zorian keep those artifacts, as long as they swore loyalty? Given the connections of those artifacts to the legacy of the Novedas, the Sovereign Gate? If the Crown was informed of the workings of the Sovereign Gate (a time loop once every few centuries for a Noveda Scion), then there is absolutely no way it would be in the crown's interest to alienate that Noble House. They'd probably want to marry Zach to a lesser princess and bring his bloodline into their own. Let him handle the repercussions of the time loop and rebuild his House's fortunes, all the while acting in service to the throne.
