There is NO WAY Zach is Red Robe. Red Robe could make Simulacrums while Zach couldn't. Zach didn't even have soul perception (which if someone has, is easy to tell), while RR was making Simulacrums.

Also, someone went out of the time loop via the sovereign gate, because the gate was barred. And Panaxeth could intercept him meant he wasn't the controller. Panaxeth couldn't even touch Zach.

And no, its not a rouge simulacrum because Simulacrums have no soul, they share it with their creator.
