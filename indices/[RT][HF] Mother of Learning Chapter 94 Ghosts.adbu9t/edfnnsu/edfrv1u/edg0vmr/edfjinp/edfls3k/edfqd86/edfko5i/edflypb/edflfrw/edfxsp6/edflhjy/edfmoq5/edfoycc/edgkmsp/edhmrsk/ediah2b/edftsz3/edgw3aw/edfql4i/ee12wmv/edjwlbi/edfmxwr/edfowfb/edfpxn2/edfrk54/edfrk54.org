I admit Panaxeth is a weak point in the theory. Maybe he knew that Zorian thought Red Robe was a different person and said that to keep up the pretence that he didn't need any more help. Or maybe Zach is actually helping, or pretending to help somehow.

Fairly sure Zach and Red Robe were never in the same room. Zach was Red Robe earlier in the loop, not a simulacrum. It's implied that Zorian can get past the mind blank, not that he has. I'm fairly sure Zach would be able to tell if that was happening unless Zorian wiped the memories, which I really don't think he would do.
