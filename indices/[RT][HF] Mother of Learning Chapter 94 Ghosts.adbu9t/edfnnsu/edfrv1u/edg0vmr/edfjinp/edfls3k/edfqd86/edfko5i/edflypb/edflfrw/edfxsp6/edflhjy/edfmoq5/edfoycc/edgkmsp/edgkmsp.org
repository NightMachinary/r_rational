Some thoughts/predictions:

1. Red Robe is working on Plan B/Plan C/whatever. Looks like we've seen plan B for wrath bombings and I'm guessing we will soon see plan B for summoning. The QI/RR will attack shifter villages directly to kidnap/secure Pan's essence for summoning/release of primordial. We will learn remaining secrets of red-haired classmate beauty, cause her little brother will end up being kidnapped as well.

2. Briam's familiar sensitivity. Since drakes and Briams link is emphatic, drake could work as mind magic talent/skill detector. Investigate anyone the drake hisses at.

3. Veyers. Looking at the entrance, he's the same hot-headed-with ignition-went-wrong. Either he had a fight with his sponsor/whatever and decided to take actions into his own hands (after he learned that Zach is supposed to be very powerful - he decided to confront him to defeat him). There should be some sort of mind trap on Veyers as well to see if RR can flush out Zorian (if RR and Silverlake didn't share the information yet). This may get interesting. I'm hoping we will learn who was pre-loop RR after Zorian performs mind reading and learns who assisted him with blood-line ignition. Also this could be the ploy to reveal that Z&Z are able to cast simulacra and they are not registered as spell users in magic guild - and ordering their arrest/lock down in secure location for interrogation.
