The seal thing? I assumed that was just normal magic one use to stop a shapeshifter. You could be right about that one. Some talismans blessed by angels to stop transformations could count as holy magic. Priesty thing against evil spirit or something. Transformation magic is pretty pagan after all, I doubt the prior gods or the angels like them

The golden flame is probably is a mixte between soul magic and fire magic, an expert on both could manage to do so and that would explain why zorian and Zach don't seems to have learned it. I assumed the effect would burn the soul pretty hard (no permanent damage to the core of the soul but probably serious damage to the rest) and be a pest to recover from. Something crippling to a lich, potentially for decades. If my supposition is correct that would be enough to make quatach-ichl completely panic.
