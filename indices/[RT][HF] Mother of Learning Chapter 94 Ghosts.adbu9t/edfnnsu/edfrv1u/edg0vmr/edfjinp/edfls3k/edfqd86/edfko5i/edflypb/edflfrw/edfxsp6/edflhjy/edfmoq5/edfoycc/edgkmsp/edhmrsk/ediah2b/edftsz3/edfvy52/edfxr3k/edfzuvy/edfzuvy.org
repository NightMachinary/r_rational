I'm not disappointed by ch 93, it's necessary tension building chapter. But I agree with you about this (94) being a bit of a disappointment. Zach and Zorian has superior knowledge about what their enemy capability, yet they failed to take initiative. Indeed they're wounded, but padding their allies strength while doing nothing else is lame. Zach or Zorian should harass somebody and lay the blame to invasion force. That will at least spread their enemy thinner.
