  Not according to the Guardian of the Threshold, unless he somehow had the power to make it lie perfectly and repeatedly in front of Zorian and all the temporary loopers.

He clearly meant that as Zach remembered everything, he could just have gone and gotten the key objects the easy way, like he had done many times earlier in the loop before Zorian. Guardian wouldn't probably know he had had the items on earlier runs.

I don't believe this at all, but if he remembered it all, getting out should not be a problem.

Just getting into fights with soul mutilating lich is so incredibly stupid if you don't have to do that...
