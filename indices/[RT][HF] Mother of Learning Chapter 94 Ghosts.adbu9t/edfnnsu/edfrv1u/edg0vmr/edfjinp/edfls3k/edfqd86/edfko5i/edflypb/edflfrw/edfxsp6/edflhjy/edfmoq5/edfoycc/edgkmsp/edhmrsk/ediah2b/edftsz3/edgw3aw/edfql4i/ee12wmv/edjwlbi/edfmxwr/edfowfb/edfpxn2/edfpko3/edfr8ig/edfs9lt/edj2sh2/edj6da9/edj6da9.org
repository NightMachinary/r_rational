  He clearly meant that as Zach remembered everything, he could just have gone and gotten the key objects the easy way, like he had done many times earlier in the loop before Zorian. Guardian wouldn't probably know he had had the items on earlier runs.

Yeah, except there's no reason for Zach to gather them beforehand, nor any way to detect them before his soul-training with Alanic. Hell, he can't even access the Guardian to learn about the objects without basic soul awareness, which he never had before Zorian.
