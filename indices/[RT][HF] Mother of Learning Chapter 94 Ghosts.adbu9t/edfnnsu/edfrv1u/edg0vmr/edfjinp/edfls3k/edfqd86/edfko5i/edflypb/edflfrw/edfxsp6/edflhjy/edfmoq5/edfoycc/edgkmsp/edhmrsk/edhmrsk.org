The subtext of the last few chapters has sort of underpinned the risk one takes when creating simulacra. Your emotional state can influence the aims of the created simulacrum. It would not surprise me if Veyers was simultaneously both Red-Robe, and not. Veyers seems to have little emotional discipline, he could have easily created a simulacrum driven by pure malice instead of any sense of self-benefit.

There are some issues with the specifics on the timetable from when this copy could have been created (and betrayed his original), but it's still possible, I think.
