Just caught up after rereading the story but Alanic can actually. The first time Zorian ever encounters someone breaking into teleportation wards in Alanic teleporting into his hotel room when he skips his lesson with him. After Alanic leaves, Zorian is confused about how he was able to teleport directly to him since he broke through his wards. This was early on in the time loop though so his wards were pretty basic. So Alanic probably isn't as good at it at Z&Z but he at least can do it somewhat.
