I'm confused about numbers.

From Chapter 69:

#+begin_quote
  "Why are you gathering so many souls in your mansion?" Alanic eventually asked Sudomir. "What on earth do you need half a million souls for?"

  [...]

  "For the wraith bombs," Sudomir ground out eventually.
#+end_quote

But this chapter says that one village they went to had 300 deaths, and combined the deaths reached "into the thousands".

But that seems like it's two and a half orders of magnitude off from what we previously knew about wraith bomb cost?
