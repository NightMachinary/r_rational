We know that he INTENDED to have a shit ton of wraith bombs (from the dead in the attack on Cyoria) to attack multiple cities at once and blame surrounding nations, hopefully starting a new splinter war. That doesn't mean a wraith bomb takes that many souls, just that he intended to have a lot of them to mount attacks on multiple locations. Now they've decided to play that card early, making it much weaker, in order to help in the attack on Cyoria.

Having only one concentrated target means less are necessary, but who can say? Presumably wraiths can be created from souls at a 1:1 rate, since we know that wraiths can create other wraiths from the souls of those they kill. That would mean a few thousand extra troops for the invasion that can can multiply with every kill they make. Presumably that would mean doubling in number at least, depending on how effective they can be.

A significantly higher number if they can convert the souls of people killed near them instead of just by them. That could potentially be hundreds of thousands of extra troops.
