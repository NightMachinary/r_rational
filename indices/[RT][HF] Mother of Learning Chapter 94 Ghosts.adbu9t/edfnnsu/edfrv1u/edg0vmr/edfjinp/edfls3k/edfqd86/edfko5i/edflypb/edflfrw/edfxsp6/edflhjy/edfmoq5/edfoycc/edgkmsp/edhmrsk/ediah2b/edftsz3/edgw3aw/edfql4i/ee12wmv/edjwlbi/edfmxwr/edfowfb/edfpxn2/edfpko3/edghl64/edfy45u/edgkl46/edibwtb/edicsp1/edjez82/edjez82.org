The "mad simulacrum" theory doesn't work because simulacrums don't have souls and you can't be in the time loop without a soul. Additionally, souls are impossible for human beings to create. It's highly implausible that a simulacrum could achieve a magical feat (creating a soul) in less than a month that is MORE impressive than the magical feat that almost a hundred temporary loopers working together along with Zach and Zorian couldn't manage in a year (altering the marker).
