All this discussion of RR being a Zach Simulacrum, or Fortov, or Sudomir.... it seems really obvious to me that RR is Jornak, the lawyer who Veyers was living with. I agree with all the speculation that RR cannot be Veyers, both because Veyers was soulkilled (if he was RR, he would've reverted to normal after leaving the loop) and because a RR Veyers would never walk into class the way he did in the last chapter.

​

But in Chapter 92, Zorian discovers that Jornak and Veyers have abandoned Jornak's house in the middle of the night, something that never happened in the time loop. If neither of them is RR, this change doesn't make the slightest sense: whether RR is Fortov, or Sudomir, or whoever, he'd have no reason to warn two effective nobodies like Jornak and Veyers. Therefore RR is either Jornak or Veyers; he's not Veyers, therefore he's Jornak.

​

The story would go something like this: Zach decides to plan a legal attack on Tesen, asks Veyers for help finding a good lawyer. Veyers refers Zach to Jornak. Zach, being an idiot, tells Tesen all about the time loop. Unbeknownst to Zach, Jornak is a pseudo member of the cult. So Jornak immediately goes to the higher cult authorities, and eventually to QI. Only someone with a marker can access hidden features of the key, so at this point only Zach can place a temporary marker. There's no way Zach will be tricked into putting a temporary marker on QI, so QI has no hope of entering the loop. But, as Jornak argues, Zach can be convinced to put a temporary marker on Jornak, which QI can then modify. QI sighs, agrees this is really his only option, and helps Jornak enter the loop permanently. Then, Jornak plans to ditch Zach permanently, and deletes Zach's memory of Jornak.

​

But there's a problem: Veyers is still around. Zach has forgotten Jornak, but Veyers refers Zach to Jornak every restart, and both Veyers and Zach notice that Jornak is acting weird (because he's now a permanent looper). Zach gets suspicious, and Jornak realizes that he'll have to come up with a more permanent solution to the problem. So he gets rid of Zach's memory of himself again, soulkills Veyers, and then gets rid of Zach's memory of Veyers. Problem solved; Zach will never approach Jornak again, and Jornak is free to go about on the road to becoming Red Robe. Then, when Z&Z meet Jornak, he's already left the loop, and the normal Jornak is ignorant of everything.

I'm struggling to think of any facts that don't fit with this theory, while I know this subreddit has come up with plenty of arguments against RR = Veyers, RR = Fortov, RR = Simulacrum. As for RR = Sudomir, that hypothesis fails to explain why Veyers and Jornak evacuated at 2am on the first day of the real world.
