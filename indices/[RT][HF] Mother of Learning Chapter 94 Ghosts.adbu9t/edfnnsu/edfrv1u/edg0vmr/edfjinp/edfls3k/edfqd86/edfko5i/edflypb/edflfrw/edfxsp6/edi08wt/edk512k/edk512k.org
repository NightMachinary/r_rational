  Rather weak chapter.

I agree. I can't believe how much time Zorian is wasting. With everything that is at stake it seems very uncharacteristic of him.

And why wouldn't he go to Alanic before this point and start gathering the people he plans to inform about the time-loop already? Z&Z seem way too relaxed about the whole thing and it feels really weird IMO
