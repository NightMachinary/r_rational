So now we know what Red Robe has been up to, and Veyers is back in class. Are there any references in past chapters to the wraith bombs? I don't recall, and a quick search of the interrogation of Sudomir doesn't turn up anything obviously explanatory.

Still no sign of Silverlake, which is scary. Zorian didn't even wonder about what she was up to, but she probably wasn't collaborating with Red Robe on slaughtering the village?
