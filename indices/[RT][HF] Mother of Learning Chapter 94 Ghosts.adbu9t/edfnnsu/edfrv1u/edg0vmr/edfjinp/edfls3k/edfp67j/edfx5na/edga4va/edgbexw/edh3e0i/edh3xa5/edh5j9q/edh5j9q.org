Right, but that doesn't need to be their immediate action. 1 month is much longer than what's needed to free a single primordial, so why not setup the freedom of another one (both for a longer-term goal and as a distraction), /then/ use the resulting furor to divert resources/the other loopers away from Cyoria and free Panaxeth?
