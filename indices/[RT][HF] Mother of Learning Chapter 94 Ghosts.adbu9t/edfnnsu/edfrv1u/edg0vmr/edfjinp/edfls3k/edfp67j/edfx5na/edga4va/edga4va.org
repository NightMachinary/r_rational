I have no doubt that QI has been told about the loopers. But hes not exactly fighting countless fronts. The plan was always for Sudomir to attack Eldemar's western neighbour with wraith bombs to display Sudomir's might. QI has no problem hurting that country, since the one he'd support in a war would be Falkrinea. Nothing of major import has changed as of yet.
