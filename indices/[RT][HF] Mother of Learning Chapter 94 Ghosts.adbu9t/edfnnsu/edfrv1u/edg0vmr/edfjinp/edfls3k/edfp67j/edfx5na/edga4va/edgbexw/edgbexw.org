I'm not talking about QI fighting countless fronts, I'm saying that the original plan would cause Eldemar to fight a multi-front war. The plan was to use the wraith bombs to attack Sulamnon specifically and make the attack appear to be from Eldemar inciting a war between neighbors and the moment Eldemar gets attacked by any of it's neighbors, the other surrounding nations are going to want to jump in and get a piece.

Technically that's still possible, but only if they don't use the wraiths now against Cyoria. At that point it becomes less likely that another nation will buy into the idea that Eldemar are the ones attacking people with wraiths. We've already seen that news travels quickly in a world of teleporters. Instead it will look like the Ibasans are the ones attacking which is the absolute last thing they would want. We also don't know that the well of souls is reusable at all.

Now it's still possible that they are going to use them now on their originally intended targets, but the original plan called for the hundreds of thousands of souls in the massive city of Cyoria, and likely won't be nearly as effective with only a few thousand that you can get from small towns.

It's also possible that they intend to save them and use them later for the same plan as before, but that wouldn't explain the change in actions, nor would it be any more threatening than every situation they've already faced in the loop.

RR doesn't need the war to win. He doesn't need Sudomir to get his wish. He NEEDS to free the primordial. He HAS to. If he's taking action to gather souls now, it's part of a play on the attack on Cyoria.
