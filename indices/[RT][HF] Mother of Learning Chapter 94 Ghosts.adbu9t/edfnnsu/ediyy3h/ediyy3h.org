I'm seeing a few possibilities for why Veyers just showed up:

1. RR isn't expecting Zach to show up in class and just wants to dump Veyers somewhere innocuous. RR thinks that even if Zach is there, Zach shouldn't be able to remember him after the mind edit.
2. RR wants Veyers there because he has watchers and knows Zach is attending this first day. He wants to gauge Zach's reaction or behaviors for any hints, since Veyers should still be safe from Zach's suspicion (as above).
3. RR has suspicions that the competent time traveler (Zorian) working with Zach is someone close to Zach or at least won't be far away. RR might not know that they've figured out the Veyers' shaped hole in Zach's mind.
4. RR is in contact with Silverlake already and Silverlake revealed Zorian's identity. RR knows that they know who Veyers is through SL. Veyers is basically bait.
5. Veyers isn't RR, but this Veyers that just showed up is RR using some advanced illusion magic, either to ambush Zach or sniff out the other time traveler(s).

The major hole in most of these is that Veyers was already expelled IIRC. It's probably trivial for RR to buy Veyers back into the academy, but that explosive door-kicking entry seems to suggest Veyers actually is bait and a fight is starting shortly.
