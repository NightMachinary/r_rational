Veyers does not care, but the force which is fostering him, does.

My hypothesis is that original RR was the person who assisted Veyers with bloodline ignition. Since Veyers knew RR prior the loop, he was soulkilled to hide this link.

It is hard to tell if this was happening originally. Speaking with the guardian of Veyers, when Z&Z kidnapped him, he was not aware that Veyers was re-instated into academy. He was loitering around, causing trouble.

I think this is new development (the leader of magic guild is part of dragon cult, so he should have enough weight to make re-instatement happening) to complicate the life of Z&Z post exit and get some leeway / lesser pressure from duo while arranging summoning/wraith bombings.
