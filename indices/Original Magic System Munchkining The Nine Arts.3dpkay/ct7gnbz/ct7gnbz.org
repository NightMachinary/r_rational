So the God Emperor has control of the Magic Engine, though enough magic leaks out to connect with a few people here and there. Depending on the population of the world, magic might be very rare. The learned arts might be fairly common, but its pretty clear that those are effectively just people hacking the magic engine to get comparatively weak results out of it. If the God Emperor has control over who gets the Innate arts, and not just the 'lawful' granted art, then he really holds all the cards. If it's just flat out impossible for the average person to take full advantage of the magic engine, power is going to concentrate like crazy among the powerful magic users. Excepting for Binders, which in their most powerful form would be the equivelant of a tactical nuke, just...melting, everything around them, their abilities probably wouldn't assure them any victories, but a group of them could certainly swing a decisive battle.
