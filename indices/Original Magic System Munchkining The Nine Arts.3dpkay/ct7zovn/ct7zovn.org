Be a Binder. Learn Thaumaturgy. Use Binding to reduce the energy loss from Thaumaturgy by strengthening the bonds. If it weakens the bond long-term, so what?

Also, if you can only be born with one of the first three, how did nine-arts-dude sidestep this? Can he be imitated? Actually...

What are the limits on Naming? What kind of Names can you learn? How fine-grained are they? Eg, one rock's Name takes 15 years, or the Name of Rock takes 15 years and then you can control all rocks? If Names can be abstract, try to learn the Name of Naming, or your own Name. Also, the word "name" just became a meaningless jumble of letters to me, which is hilarious in this context.

Learn to make the Elixir of Life. Use your extra lifespan to study Naming, then do the things above. Even if names are super-fine-grained (eg a single rock, not all rocks), you should be able to learn your own Name, or failing that at least the Name of your body. Now you're an immortal alchemist with telekinetic control over your own body, shapeshifting powers, and possibly the ability to recursively make yourself smarter and/or more powerful. If you can recursively self-improve (eg does increasing your INT stat decrease the amount of concentration you need to control yourself), does that shorten the time to learn new Names? If so, self-improve up to some suitably ridiculous level, spend five minutes learning the Names of the nine arts, grant them all to yourself at max power, use the Name of Time to travel back to the Bronze Age and become nine-arts-dude.
