Learn Thaumaturgy, because it's useful and marketable and easy and probably useful for Alchemy, then Alchemy, because immortality has infinitely more value than anything else any of the other arts can give you.

Since this is obvious to anyone with reasonable intelligence, it's probably really hard to get into to whatever organization controls access to Alchemy. Most countries are probably ruled by ancient Alchemists, either overtly or covertly. Any publicly available information about Alchemy probably doesn't contain whatever you need to know to brew the Elixir.
