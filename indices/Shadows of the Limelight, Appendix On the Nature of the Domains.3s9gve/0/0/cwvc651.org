That mostly comes down to formatting issues and how I have my template set up. I've been futzing with that to try to get the hardcopies looking more pretty, but this appendix uses some formatting that's different from the main story and wasn't being handled well by the compile. I don't think it's a hard thing to change (necessarily), but it's going to require some changes to the template, which means that I need to do a spot-check through the whole work to see whether I've broken anything. The appendix will be appended to the whole work once I get that figured out.
