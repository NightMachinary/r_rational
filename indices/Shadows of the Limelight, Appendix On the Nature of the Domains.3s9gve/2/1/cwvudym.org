My understanding was this: some people argued that one can't be a cat Illustrati if there are no cats nearby (because they wouldn't have any to control). The author disagrees, because there are some historical examples of Illustrati without apparent domains (which he believes just didn't have any specimens of their animal around). So the conclusion is that a person can have an animal domain, even if there are none around, so long as the idea of that animal has already spread beyond the minimum "domain fame" threshold (as exemplified by the apparent lack of cat Illustrati in the distant past even in places where they were already known).
