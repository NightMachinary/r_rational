Depends on whether it takes /my/ memories or whether it can be powered by /anyone's/ memories.

It's it's /anyone's/ memories, then we use it as part of our criminal justice system - we sacrifice a person's entire store of memory/personality before an execution we were going to carry out anyway, for example, or as part of rehabilitation so we can undo some of the harmful parts of their psychology. If you think that's too immoral, we use the beneficial aspects of memory erasure - someone who has been the victim of a violent crime can have their memories of the event erased after the trial is over. Or you can erase the memories of a relationship from someone who had their heart broken (a la /Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind/).

If it's only /my/ memories, then I use the system pretty sparingly, or possibly not at all. If it's precise enough, I would use it to erase my knowledge of some of my favorite books and movies so that I could read or watch them a second time. There are also a whole lot of memories that are degrading anyway, and don't serve much of a purpose. But mostly I wouldn't trade away my personality for gold.
