I would argue that it can use anyone's memories, since it made gold after the Alchemist was dead (so you don't have to make it for yourself) but the machine was destroyed (so the machine doesn't work for only one person).*

*Well, possibly it was destroyed to keep anyone from figuring out how to build more, which could be tailored to other people, but the fact that the Alchemist made it at all is evidence that you can get more gold from it than you spent building it.
