For my personal use, I don't think it would be too useful. A better approach is to instead license out the machine, or maybe collecting a small fee for every use.

And all this is assuming that (1) the machine could be used by anyone and (2) how "powerful" the memory is corresponds to how much gold you can make, not just how "happy" the memory is (which is how the Alchemist used it). But if that's the case, our society would end up looking very different. To start, it would be excellent for psychotherapy. Veteran suffering from PTSD? Erase the last 6 months or so (including the traumatic event), come out the other end rich and psychologically healthy. It might even help alleviate poverty in the general population- had a very poor childhood, with gang warfare and abusive parents? Use that to become wealthy. In fact, I feel like this would end up becoming an escape hatch for anyone in a bad situation. If you lose your job and become homeless, if you're in a horrible accident and need the money to cover medical treatment, this provides a perfect way out. Of course, in the end I think this would end up devaluing gold to the point where another standard had to be chosen. I think an even more interesting question is what the response to this would be and how much of an upset to our whole system it could cause.

On the other hand, if you can forcibly use the machine on other people's memories, this could easily turn out to be one of the most horrific inventions in history, I don't think the implications need to be spelled out.
