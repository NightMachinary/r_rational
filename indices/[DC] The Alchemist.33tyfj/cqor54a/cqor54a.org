no no no the real value is not the gold. bah weak metal! The ability to pinpoint, remove, and preserve memories for others perusal is... invaluable. As stated by others it could be use for therapy and/or punishment. if the memory could be played without consuming it it would not only prove the concept of qualia but bring people closer than before by allowing us to /really/ experience life as another. Lastly but not least you got a thought-powered reactor capable of creating mass from nothing! (no apparent volume change from *Fe* to *Au*) and even if /lesser/ memories are less effective (producing *Pb* maybe?) you got a way to dispose safely of radioactive or otherwise hazardous materials! sidenote: could you use the happy memory of a sociopath murdering someone? are masochists able to fuel the machine with memories of pain? who or what judges a memory worthy?
