Recruit people on their deathbed, as suggested in HPMOR? Although in their final moments they might be less willing to give up their cherished memories than their magic.

If it's just yourself:

- Warn your friends / loved ones to expect a little amnesia.
- Figure out the awesomeness rating of the memories you can produce [[http://smbc-comics.com/index.php?id=3712][by careful spending of a certain amount of gold]].
- Arbitrage away!

Don't forget you're also spending some of your lifespan (from the perspective of amnesic future you), so be sure to account for it. Or to spend some gold on immortality research; you're an alchemist, that's supposed to be your field.
