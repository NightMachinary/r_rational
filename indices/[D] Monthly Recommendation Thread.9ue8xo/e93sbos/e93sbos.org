Two recent reads:

/How to Invent Everything/ by Ryan North is a book that largely concerns itself with telling time travelers how to rebuild civilization. I think it's a great resource for anyone wanting to write uplift fiction, portal fantasy, or similar, largely because it lays out, in simple terms, the low-hanging fruit for various time periods and levels of technological development.

/The Labyrinth Index/ by Charles Stross is the 9th installment in the Laundry Files series, and you'd probably not want to start with it. I'm only about halfway done, so won't be able to give a full review, but /so far/ it's one of my favorites, in part because the series has progressed to the point where CASE NIGHTMARE GREEN is in full effect (which is ridiculous, and I love it). I've also said in the past that Stross is one of those authors that occasionally dips into full-on rational fiction, which is one of the things that I like about him.
