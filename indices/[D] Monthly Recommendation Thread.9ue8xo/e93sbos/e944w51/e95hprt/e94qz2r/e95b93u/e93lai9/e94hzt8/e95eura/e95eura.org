I've recently been hooked on Peter Watts' Sunflower Cycle. He's the dark genius guy who wrote Blindsight and The Things.

It's not much right now, only 3 short stories and a novella (plus a hidden short story that acts as a teaser for the next part of the story), but it paints a really cool 'verse that embraces Deep Time.

Basic premise is that instead of finding a network of worm holes built by precursors, lets focus in on the poor bastards who had to go out there and make them. After a while humans stop coming out of the new worm holes, but the mission continues on anyway due to +plot HAL friend computer CHIMP+, the AI in charge of the mission.

I've always been darkly attracted to stories about being lost in a way that destroys all hope of returning, and nothing does that better than a hard sci-fi story dealing with deep time. Millions of years pass, and outside of your tiny bubble the universe your culture, language, and phenotype aren't even in the historical record any more.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2309339914?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1][This Review]] of the recently published novella has a recommended reading order and warnings on helping decide if it's something you should read.

I also listened to [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/204796][The Forever]]. 6 book series published as 3 audiobooks, it's a similar premise to the oft-recommended and acclaimed Bobiverse, but it takes the idea in a very different direction. I won't say it's better or worse than Bobiverse, I can very much see someone liking either more.

Instead of being a Vonn Neumann probe on an indefinite mission in a 'verse mostly devoid of aliens, The Forever is ironically named in that it focuses on a much shorter period of time, a century long trip to nearby stars to survey them for potential immigration to move whoever manages to get off earth before it's destroyed by a rogue planet screwing up the solar system's orbits.

It's much softer sci-fi, as the "brain uploading" system and other AI is all handwaved, and later alien tech indistinguishable from magic shows up, but it's still a fun character driven comedy adventure.
