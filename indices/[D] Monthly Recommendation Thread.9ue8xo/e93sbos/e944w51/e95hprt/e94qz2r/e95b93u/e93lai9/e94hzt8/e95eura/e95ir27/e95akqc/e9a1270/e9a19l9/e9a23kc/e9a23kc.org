Eh, I treat SIs like I would any other character, for the most part. Though I do tend to connect with them more because of the outside perspective.

I'll stop if there's a ton of romance, but if it's just a tasteful part of character building, it's okay. That's why I tend to like gen fics more though, because generally romance is not tasteful.

I'm a guy btw. In comparison to you, I like female characters because of the part of my mind which adores women, even non-sexually.

There's no romance in that fic at all. If there was any "aww so cute," then it would be only for a tiny portion, and more like in an older sister/younger brother way, though they're the same age, I think.

I encourage you to just skip that part and continue. It's not romance, it's hurt/comfort (which I usually don't like).

I do have several more, but I'll have to go through my list of read fics later on my computer to find them.

I like this one a ton, though, which is why I mentioned it. You really should try to read it more.

Rictus, who does Path of Ruin, also has some other very good SIs. I really like the Slug Star Wars one.
