I am looking for well written self inserts that does not need to be rational but preferably focuses on the reality and realism of being transmigrated/reincarnated in a foreign universe. Wish fulfillment and fix-it really turns me off unless their canon patchworking and power ups are achieved in a rational/realistic manner. I want the SI to focus on survival and consequently achieving power is the beat way to do so. Here are some great self inserts I recommend.

Kaleidoscope- Naruto SI Complete

Tyrant of the bay- Worm SI Dead

A lion beyond death- ASOIAF SI
