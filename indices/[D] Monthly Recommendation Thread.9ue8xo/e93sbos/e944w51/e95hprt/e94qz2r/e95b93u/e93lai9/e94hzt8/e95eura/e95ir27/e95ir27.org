[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9402014/chapters/21285149][The World As It Appears To Be]] is a great and completed Overwatch fanfic that I discovered through this very subreddit. Most frequent and long time visitors should know about it already but it is quite a long time ago I last saw it mentioned anywhere. For those that follow Overwatch Canon, keep in mind that this fanfic was completed before the official Doomfist announcement.
