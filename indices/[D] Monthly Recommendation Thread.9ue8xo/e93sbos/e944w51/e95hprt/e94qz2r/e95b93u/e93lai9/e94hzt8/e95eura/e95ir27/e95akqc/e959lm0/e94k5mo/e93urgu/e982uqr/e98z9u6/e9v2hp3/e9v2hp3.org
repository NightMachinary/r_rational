Try [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30344847-cold-iron][Cold Iron by Miles Cameron]]. It starts as a story of a well-adjusted small town guy who's attending magic school on a scholarship and learning sword fighting as a hobby. Then he randomly gets into some trouble and adventures happen. It's a pretty straightforward fantasy story, with only one POV mostly, but it has depth and charm and is well written.
