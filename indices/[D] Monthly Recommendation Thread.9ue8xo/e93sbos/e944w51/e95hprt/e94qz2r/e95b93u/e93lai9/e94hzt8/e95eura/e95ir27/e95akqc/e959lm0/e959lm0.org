Fiction rec: [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37173847-foundryside][Foundryside]] by Robert Jackson Bennett. It has the neatest magic system I've seen in a while; there is this written language that when properly used can convince reality to be subverted. There is this society that is slowly rediscovering this language and how to use it from the ruins of a dead civilization which apparently self-destructed somehow. Enter Sanchia, a cat burglar who can hear the history of objects she touches.

Non-fiction rec: [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23995360-superforecasting][Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction]] by Philip E. Tetlock, Dan Gardner. I listened to a few very good podcasts(80,000 hours, Rationally Speaking) with Tetlock as a guest a while ago and decided to actually read the novel discussed for once. In the book he goes into how most so-called experts are pretty bad at making concrete predictions of the future, and what how actual good forecasters use evidence based, probabilistic, logical analysis to make good predictions. Though, like with pretty much all non-fiction books I've read, I felt like the book would have been just as informative and a better read if they cut like 40% out.
