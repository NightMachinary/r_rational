[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15406896][Hear the Silence]] - Naruto SI Ongoing

Best reincarnation I know of. SI actually acts like a child. Well, more than Kakashi anyway.

Point is that she acts like a Naruto-universe smart child, not like an adult in a kid's body, like many fics.

It may be my favorite Naruto SI. It's hard to say when there are fics like Sanitize.
