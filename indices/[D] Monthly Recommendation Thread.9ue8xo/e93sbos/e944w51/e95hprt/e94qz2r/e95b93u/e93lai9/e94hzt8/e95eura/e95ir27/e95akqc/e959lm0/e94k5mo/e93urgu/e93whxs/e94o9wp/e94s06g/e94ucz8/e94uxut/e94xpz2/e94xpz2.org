The plot could be resolved with a 911 call? How?

Magical girls /have/ to hunt witches, because otherwise grief will accumulate in their soul gems and they will turn into them. It /will/ happen in the long-term even if they don't use magic, because of mundane negative emotions. Witches are impervious to interventions of non-magical girls. Even though their bodies could be destroyed by mundane means, as Homura shows, you can't access or see their realms without magic; Walpurgisnacht is an exception, but /she/ is potentially immune to nuclear weapons. More importantly, Kyubey the advanced alien is the real enemy; it won't permit the government at large to know. It's likely that it could either edit people's perceptions or erase their memory, and that it has full awareness of everything happening on the planet.

So: the government can't easily save magical girls, can't easily defeat witches, and is at the Incubator's mercy.

I don't see any important part of the plot that could be solved with a 911 call, unless you're postulating a hypercompetent government made up of our Saturday Munchkinry Thread residents or something.
