I very much enjoyed Blindopraxia, but then to my surprise/horror Peter introduced:

/SPOILERS BEGIN/

Sunday, as befitting her name, goes on a up close and personal sunbathing session somewhere in the Corona of the sun.

All well and good, but then it comes about that in the mysterious spooky environment with massive electromagnetic Flux, our neurons end up unhinged from causality itself (Wtf).

Not only does that work, but it apparently supercharges her to the extent that she's able to deduce the entire cause of the expedition, namely a Kardashev 2 alien civilization spotted on the scopes. This was a leap of logic that I'd be OK with one of the vampires from Blindopraxia doing, but surely not a human who had their head stuck in a MRI.

Leaving aside physics, even Watts himself previously acknowledged 'Free Will' as a concept to be incoherent and not worth considering to anyone with a passing knowledge of neuroscience or philosophy. So no wonder I sat there pulling my hair and wondering whether the whole episode was him being perverse, or just losing it. I really don't get the whole point of having something like that ruin an otherwise great series :/
