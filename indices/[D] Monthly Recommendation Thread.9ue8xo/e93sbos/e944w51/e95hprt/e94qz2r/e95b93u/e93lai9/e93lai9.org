For anyone looking for a little more hope and rationality in the real world, I have two non-fiction recommendations by the same author: [[https://stevenpinker.com/publications/better-angels-our-nature][The Better Angels of Our Nature]] (2011) and [[https://stevenpinker.com/publications/enlightenment-now-case-reason-science-humanism-and-progress][Enlightenment Now]] (2018) by Steven Pinker

/The Better Angels of Our Nature/ shows, using historical data, how things have gotten better over the course of human history. How there is less murder, less illness, less war, famine, injury, death and suffering now than there was 2000, 500 or 50 years ago.

/Enlightenment Now/ focuses more on the recent past (really, the Enlightenment through to the present) and more on the /how/ behind the progress--the ideologies and social institutions that push progress forward. It also takes a look at the cognitive biases that make it seem like the world is getting worse when it isn't.

Both of these are fairly heavy, dense reads (with lots of graphs!), so if you're looking for something lighter, I'd recommend any of Pinker's other books, which are mainly about linguistics and psychology. In particular, [[https://stevenpinker.com/publications/language-instinct][The Language Instinct]], which is a great introduction to the field of linguistics.
