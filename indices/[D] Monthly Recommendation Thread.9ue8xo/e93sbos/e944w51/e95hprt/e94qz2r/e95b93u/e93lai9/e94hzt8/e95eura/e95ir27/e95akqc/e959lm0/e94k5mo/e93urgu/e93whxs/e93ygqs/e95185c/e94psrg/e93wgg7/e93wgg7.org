One of the really interesting things about /New Game!/ in particular is that it's /just/ girls/women. Boys/men are pretty much exclusively background characters with no speaking lines or identities, with the exception of one of the character's little brother. It's definitely a deliberate choice on the part of the creators, but it always strikes me as just a little bit odd (though not in a bad way).

(You listed all the ones I would recommend, so I have nothing to add there.)
