Practical Guide to Evil seems tonally based on two series, The Black Company by Glen Cook and The Malazan Book of the Fallen by Stephen Erikson. The Black Company has a great first book that you should read, highly atmospheric and a bit haunting, but only read on after that if you feel like it...kind of a Dune thing where the other books are different, and, for many, worse. Malazan is amazing but highly challenging, don't feel bad that you're not understanding things and treat it as a puzzle. I've described how to read it here in a relatively popular post:

If you want something that will feel comfortable coming off web novels but is a real fantasy book, try the Dresden Files series by Jim Butcher. The series only really gets going in the third book, but the first two aren't bad, and unfortunately you kind of should read them and not skip. Arguably it's the fourth book where things really get good.

Web novels are kind of like junk food, they can ruin your palette. I say that because I cycle in and out of reading them and I've found that to be true. Give yourself some space when reading, consider writing notes in the margins or even looking at summaries beforehand. Best of luck.
