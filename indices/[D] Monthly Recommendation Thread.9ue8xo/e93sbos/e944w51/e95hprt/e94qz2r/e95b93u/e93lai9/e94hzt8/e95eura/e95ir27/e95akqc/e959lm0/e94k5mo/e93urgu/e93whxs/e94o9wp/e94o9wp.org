  Hibike Euphonium- Looks at a high school concert band as they make an attempt to qualify for the national tournament. This is Kyoto Animation at their best, impeccable character animation with unforgettable moments.

  Madoka Magica- Doesn't super fit this genre, but it's still in my Top 3 of all anime, so I have to list it. Simply one of the most perfectly constructed shows I've ever seen.

I'd like to disendorse these shows.

Hibike:

Too little action. Though if one likes K-on and lucky star, they'll probably like this show.

Madoka:

I'm kinda surprised this sub likes a show where the main characters make consistently bad/stupid decisions and the biggest plot hole and driving factor behind the conflict is an unexplained absence of adults.

Shirobako was great though.
