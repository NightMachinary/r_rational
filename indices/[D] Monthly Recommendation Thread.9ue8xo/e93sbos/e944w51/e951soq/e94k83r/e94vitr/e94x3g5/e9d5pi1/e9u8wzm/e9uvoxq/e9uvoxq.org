I mean that the Cradle series and all Wight's novels tend to be really exciting novels, but they have shoddy characterization, and the worlds don't feel fully realized. There is no attention to detail, there is no exploration of the setting, there are no moments of respite where the characters can do something other than train and fight, or talk about something that's not training and fighting.

I seriously can't recall a single instance where the main characters just talk to person that they're not going to train or fight with, or think about how the faction they're a part of works, or remember something non-traumatic from their pasts, or learn something that's not plot relevant.

The book and all the characters tend to be pretty one-dimensional, as a result. Which is fine, I still enjoy them. Not every book has to have a deep exploration of profound themes or anything. But it's a shame, because the books could be so much better pretty simply.
