I've read both. The worldbuilding and setting is better in Forge of Destiny, but it doesn't explore it much, and it has far inferior characterization.

The best thing about the Cradle books is that they are very good about maintaining narrative tension (often to the detriment of storytelling) while Forge of Destiny has a lot of trouble with that, particularly with giving a reason to care about the outcome of fights. I wonder if it's because it's a quest? "Don't see the sausage being made" type of deal.

I lost interest near the final 40% when the MC chose the most boring of the available paths, to be a good little servant to a control freak and gave up most of her agency, but kept skimming to see what happens. Even in broad strokes I found the outcomes boring. The last few arcs, particularly the tournament arc was a masterwork in spoiling tension and spiking stakes.
