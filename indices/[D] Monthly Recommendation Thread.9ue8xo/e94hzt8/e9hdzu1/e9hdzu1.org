Have you read Tad Williams' fantasy? The Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn trillogy and Otherland are both classics that don't get enough exposure. Also they're pretty long, so they'll keep you for a few days :P

Also, just to make sure you've read the obvious (around here) peoples' famous books, like Terry Pratchett (if you don't like Colour of Magic because of his early writing, it's easy to jump into the middle with e.g. Small Gods or Making Money), Ursula LeGuin's early books, or Isaac Asimov (check out a short story collection).
