I'm looking for some good post apocalyptic or survival fiction. In the past I've really enjoyed The Postman and Earth Abides. I've enjoyed a couple of post apocalyptic TV shows in the past but some I've dropped because they felt too inconsistent with their universe (like Revolution). I remember enjoying jericho but I think it was cancelled after one season or so.

I've heard Ward is post apocalyptic, but it's been a while since I read worm and I've forgotten a lot of the details, don't think I want to re read that!
