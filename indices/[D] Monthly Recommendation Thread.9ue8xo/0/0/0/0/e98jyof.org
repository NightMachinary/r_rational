Having finished it, I generally agree, though I think it's important to distinguish between /setting/ darkness and /character/ darkness. A lot of what made some of the more recent books in the series dark was that bad things were happening to our viewpoint characters, and these weren't the sorts of bad things that a typical protagonist goes through at the nadir of their plot arc, they were bad things that stuck around, including the deaths of important people, permanent manglings of characters, institutional issues, etc.

In /Labyrinth Index/, we end on a personal high note for Mhari, which softens the fact that the world has gotten worse. That comes along with hints at Extended Continuity Operations as a potential way to preserve humanity and, if not win, then at least maintain some semblance of civilization.
