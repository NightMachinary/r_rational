Oh, it's definitely ambiguous, and things are definitely grim, but I do think that it's an attempt to end "up" rather than "down". The last note that a book leaves you on is, in my opinion, rather telling. It also stands in direct contrast to whichever book ended with a divorce/separation, which I assume was deliberate.
