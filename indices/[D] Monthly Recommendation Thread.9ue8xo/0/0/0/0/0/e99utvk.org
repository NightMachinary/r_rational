I don't really think it's supposed to be a personal high note, or at least not an unambiguous one. Yes, Jim is alive, and no longer staring down the short end of dementia and death but he's also a PHANG, which leaves him complicit in the New Management's policies. Also, definitely Derek, and possibly Pete (if he does actually kill himself rather than live with PHANG) are dead -- the latter will likely hit Bob hard next time we get his POV, as he was the one who got Pete involved to begin with.

And while there are a few spots of light at the setting level, don't forget the New Management's plans for England, which include a conquest of the continent under the leadership of a vampire priesthood. Plus, there are a couple of other threats mentioned that have yet to make their moves. Chernabog is listed among the Elder Gods on the Black Chamber PowerPoint and unlike the rest of them he has yet to make a move (and he's listed as working with the KGB, who are due for another appearance), while the Mandate's comment to Cthulhu about the "Cold Ones" that suggests that the series might be due for another appearance of the Infovores, possibly as a bookend for the final conflict.

There's maybe /marginally/ more hope at this point then there was at the end of the last book, but we're still at the point where victory means "maybe after things shake out something exists that still remembers being human".
