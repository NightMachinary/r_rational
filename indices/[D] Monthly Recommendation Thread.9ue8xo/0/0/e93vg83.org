I read through the Laundry Files this summer, and while I certainly thought they were very good, they were also really emotionally draining. The setting has progressed from grimdark to shitdark in tone; it honestly kind of reminded me of Wildbow in the last few books, with the degree to which the mood and tone just became /oppressive/.

This is not a value judgment: many people are fine with, or even actively like, that style. I am just reporting on my experience so that people can calibrate accordingly.
