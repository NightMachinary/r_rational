Can't really say much about the quality of the rewrite. I just finished binging the quest itself, so the subject is still too fresh in my mind to enjoy reading it again.

​

That said, the quest text has a problem with using "it's" instead of "its". If that is sufficiently annoying to you then you might prefer to read the edited and reworked version on RoyalRoad.

​

Additionally, the author has said that he is going to include bonus chapters on RR, which is content that wasn't part of the quest, so that's another point in favor.

​

On the other hand: The story is more than 600k words long. If you want to wait and read it on RR, then you are probably going to be waiting for a very long time.
