I am really bored of web novels (English & Asians ones), i feel like i have read all the ones worth reading. I want to start reading books but i don't know where to start... I am looking for something not too complicated to read if possible modern, either Fantasy or Sci-Fi with Kingdom/Empire buildings elements, something like *Practical Guide to Evil* or *The Iron Teeth: A Goblin's Tale* but in books. Any recommendations ?
