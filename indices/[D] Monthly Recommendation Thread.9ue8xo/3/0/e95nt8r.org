I believe I was the one who originally introduced Purple Days to a previous monthly thread! I can confirm that yeah, the author's Chilean and his writing skills improve by leaps and bounds over the course of the story, to the point where he's actually writing beautifully now compared to his initial rough style. As a non-native English speaker myself I find his evolution as a writer to be truly inspirational.

As for the Yi-Ti's arc, it might have dragged on a bit but I personally enjoyed it, especially since it's a crucial step in Joffrey's development as a character and protagonist. Be sure to leave the story a comment if you enjoy it, to keep Baurus motivated to write more!
