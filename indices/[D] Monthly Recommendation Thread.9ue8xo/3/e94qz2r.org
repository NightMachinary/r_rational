I'd like to second a recommendation I picked up deep in a thread on here, a few weeks back.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/purple-days-asoiaf-joffrey-timeloop-au.450894/][Purple Days]] Is a time-loop fic starring Joffrey Baratheon. It's a really fun breakdown of a character everyone loves to hate, and an interesting high-adventure take on the more typically mundane fantasy world of Westeros. The writing is rough in places- possibly the author is ESL? But it continues to pick up steam and get better as it goes.
