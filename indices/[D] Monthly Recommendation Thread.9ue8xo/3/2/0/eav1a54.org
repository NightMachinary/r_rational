I think you'd get the gist of it without having read GoT, there's certainly a large portion in the middle that is more of a swords and sorcery adventure tale not based on the Westeros setting at all. But there's also a bit of an assumption that you know who certain characters are, and why it's significant for Joffrey to interact with them in one way or another. You'd probably miss a lot of subtext in the Westeros chapters.
