I've read several of steven pinker's books, and I haven't considered any of them to be great. Average, or above average maybe, but that's it.

​

You can just tell he uses a lot of filler, and by that I mean he could make his point in 4-10 pages but because he wants to sell a book he bloats it to 300+ pages. Several little example stories per chapter that add virtually nothing but word count.

​

He's a good non fiction writer don't get me wrong, I just don't enjoy filler. He writes the kind of non fiction that people that don't read a lot of non fiction enjoy, there's value in that, you learn one interesting thing and a few examples to talk about at a dinner party. I just feel that it's too little return for a 300+ page book.
