Umm, better *Angels*, not Angles.

Yes, definitely agree with the recommendation. I haven't read Enlightenment Now, but I plan to sometime soon.

Better Angels is fantastic, and even if it wasn't for me specifically, it could be a life changing book. Very dense, I agree, but well worth it. If I had to recommend one book to change their worldview, Better Angels would be a prime contender.
