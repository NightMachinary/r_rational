I would like to recommend Forge of Destiny.

It's a xianxia quest on Sufficient Velocity about a street girl in an original world who joins a Sect and her search for power and friendship.

The work has everything that is awesome about xianxia without most of the crap that makes 95% of the stories in the genre feel like enthusiastically fellating a cheese grater.

Most importantly, the characters behave like people instead of merely being ambulatory anuses.

The first book of the story is finished and the second is supposed to start at some point in the next couple of weeks.

If you want to try it, here's the link:
