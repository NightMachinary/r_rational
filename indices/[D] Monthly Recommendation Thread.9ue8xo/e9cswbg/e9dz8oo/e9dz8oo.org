I stopped reading Ward because I'd rather just read it all in one go, but I don't think you have to remember a lot of the details from Worm to follow it. You just have to know how it ended and the basic details of the Dallon family*, since Victoria is the protagonist. It referenced other stuff exactly once that I can recall, and it was quite good about not assuming the reader had perfect memory of the event in question, explaining the relevant detail.

*The only real story one being how Amy had a breakdown and rewrote Victoria to love her in rather a botched fashion.
