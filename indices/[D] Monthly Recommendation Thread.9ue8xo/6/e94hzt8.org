I'm looking for long form text fiction. Preferably fantasy, but I'm down for good sci-fi and really good historical or literary fiction as well. I prefer stuff available for free online, but I don't mind paying if I can get an ebook of it as well. The caveat is I read really fast, like I knocked Worm out in under a week fast. So, you might have to dig a little to find something I haven't already read. I've read pretty much all the fantasy and superhero stuff in the top 20 on TWF, with the exception of the Wandering Inn, which I just couldn't get into. I enjoyed the Malazan book of the fallen, dropped the Wheel of Time series around book 6, but might be open to picking it up again if someone strongly recommended the later books. I've had a lot of downtime at work recently and all I've got left in my queue is the last book of the Witcher series and then I'll be down to picking random things off the shelf at Half Priced Books, so, hit me with those obscure recommendations.
