Brandom Sanderson maybe? He's popular, and really good.

I love me some Mark Lawrence, he's more dark fantasy / grimdark but he's good, like make you like the most evil protagonist you'll see in a while, good.

Patrick Rothfuss is great, been waiting for that 3rd book for a while now.

You can go to novelupdates and check the top rated stuff in the categories you like, it's mostly eastern origin fiction.

Goodreads book of the year votes are or were going on, maybe look at the results for the categories you enjoy.

Checking out the finalists of the Nebula award and world fantasy award of this and past years could also be useful.
