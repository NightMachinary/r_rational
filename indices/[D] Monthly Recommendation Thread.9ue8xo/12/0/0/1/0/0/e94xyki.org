Alternative explanation: The expectation for magical girls (from in-universe fiction) is to keep a secret, and Kyubey picks girls who won't because it's a manipulative shit anyway. Plus, there isn't actually anything adults can do directly for witches; they can't see them and just get trapped too.

Supporting evidence: Mami's parents are dead, bad stuff happens when Kyoko tells her parents, and the high mortality rate for magical girls means that probably none ever become adults themselves to serve as authorities.
