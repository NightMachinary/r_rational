Its hard for me to truly get into female si's since I am a male and I have a bad habit of self inserting myself in the SI shoes. So romance with female SI turns me off completely so I had to drop it hear the silence when she was gushing all over Minato saying he was so cute. Do you have any other recs? If you like star wars I forgot to add paths of ruin its a really good sith self insert.
