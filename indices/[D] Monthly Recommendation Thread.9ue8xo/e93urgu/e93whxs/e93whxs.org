Behold, *[[https://myswordisunbelievablydull.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/guide-to-cute-girls-going-cute-things.jpg][Digibro's Guide to Cute Girls Doing Cute Things]]*.

The ones I'd personally endorse are:

- *Girlish Number*- Can be reductively summarized as a more grounded and cynical Shirobako, with a more specific focus on voice actors. I probably like this one more, though.

- *Hibike Euphonium*- Looks at a high school concert band as they make an attempt to qualify for the national tournament. This is Kyoto Animation at their best, impeccable character animation with unforgettable moments.

- *Madoka Magica*- Doesn't super fit this genre, but it's still in my Top 3 of all anime, so I have to list it. Simply one of the most perfectly constructed shows I've ever seen.
