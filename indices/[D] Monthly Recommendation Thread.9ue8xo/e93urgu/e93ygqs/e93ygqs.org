If you enjoyed K-On, try Tamako Market, which I found to be the same thing more concentrated, and also maybe Hibike Euphonium.

Haibane Renmei is a classic, though arguably slightly different but nevertheless must-watch. Niea_7, same era, same artist is more fluff less misery; or Gunslinger Girl for full-on depression if you prefer that.

For character studies, a somewhat adjacent genre, try 3-gatsu no Lion and Chihayafuru.

Tamayura, Ramen Daisuki Koizumi-san, C3-bu, Koufuku Graffiti, Yuru Camp all fall firmly into the “girls doing things” genre but are all pure fluff and no substance, so YMMV depending quite what you are after (I also found K-on to be on the fluff side personally so our preferences may differ here).

Gakkou Gurashi and Happy Sugar Life are girls doing horror; the former more light-hearted, the other less fantastical but reaching wildbow levels of viewer discomfort.
