I've seen up until the first few episodes of the latest season. For a weekly formula show, it was really, /really/ good for the first three seasons. People didn't hold the idiot ball as a general rule, most of the tech made sense (there is occasional lapses where things just...don't work that way) but for the most part, probably one of the closest shows to "rational" on air ATM (note: not rationalist. Rational)

Then we come to the latest season.

For those who don't spend their time on certain subreddits where AI intelligence is discussed with regularity, it probably seems like a pretty good approximation. But it still has a procedure to follow, and procedures...don't hold up to true AI well. There come multiple points where it's just like "if you can think that, so can they - and they thought of this /literally as soon as this information was available to them./"

As a TV show? 9/10, I should really catch up on this season. One of my favorites. As a realistic depiction of a battle between AIs? 2/10. [[#s][Samaritan]]
