I wouldn't even say FOOM is necessary what's at work here though. They can think much, much faster than we can, and they always operate at peak or near peak levels. How many thoughts do you have a second? How much information can you process? How many hours of sleep do you need a night? Now compare that to something that operates orders of magnitude faster, and that never has to stop. They aren't perfectly rational, or perfect thinkers - they're just much better at it than we are.

If you want to argue that "as soon as this information becomes available to them" is closer to hyperbole than fact about how fast they can react, I'll concede if you also admit that nothing the human protagonists come up with should be something the AIs didn't already consider, and in much greater depth than the humans could've.
