Episodic, with longer arcs sprinkled throughout. Sort of like how USA does their seasons (I'm thinking White Collar, specifically). There are sundry recurring villainous organizations, characters, etc. And there will be an arc that lasts between episodes/throughout the season, especially as the seasons progress. But if you watched them out of order, you wouldn't be too lost about what was going on. Might miss some context, but the "previously on" would be enough to go on.
