  if you also admit that nothing the human protagonists come up with should be something the AIs didn't already consider, and in much greater depth than the humans could've.

Hmm, I'm not sure if I would admit that actually. Of course I haven't seen as much of the show as you have, so maybe there's stuff in there to support your position, but why would we expect the AI to have thought through everything the humans would consider? How fast does it think? How well can it model humans? How much information does it have?

With a FOOM these all become rhetorical, since we assume that the answer is always that the AI has every capability you can imagine. But in a non-FOOM scenario not only should we not assume an AI is infinitely above humans, we shouldn't even assume it is on par with us in every way. It could even be sub-human, just running at a so much faster speed that it seems (really is?) more intelligent, like if I was playing Chess against a grandmaster but I got a year between moves while he only got 30 seconds.
