I know many people in the lesswrong-o-sphere subscribe the FOOM hypothesis, but do we /have/ to say that the AI immediately becomes perfectly rational? I think it's okay to just say that it's pretty smart and getting smarter...

I don't think it's reasonable to believe in FOOM to the extent that fiction in which mostly-better-than-human AI occurs but is not automatically ridiculously, instantaneously, overpoweringly over good at everything in the realms of intelligence and creativity becomes unrealistic.
