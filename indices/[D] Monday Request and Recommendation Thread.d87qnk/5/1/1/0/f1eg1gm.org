Climate change isn't really bad because it will kill some humans, as it already has. It's irreparably bad because it represents a squandering of biodiversity and ecology. Basically, we have a huge endowment left to us by millions of years of evolution that we're throwing away for little gain. If we survive as a species (I'm not saying climate change will wipe humans out, because it won't, but there are other existential risks) we'll feel the loss of the ecology quite keenly. The loss to science alone is immeasurable.

That said, these aren't either/or problems. It does make sense to work to research and slow or stop senescence and we waste money on much more trivial things.
