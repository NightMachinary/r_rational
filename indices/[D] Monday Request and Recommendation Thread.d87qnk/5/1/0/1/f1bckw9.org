Unfortunately, I think the issue is more complicated. Most people in their 30s are likely to experience relatively catastrophic climate change and have to deal with startling inequality right outside their doors, right now and in the moment. I doubt adding immortality to that equation would make people overcome the coordination problems that exist now, and make the insulated elites anything but more insulated an elite.
