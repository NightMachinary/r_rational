I entirely agree with this recommendation; Abercrombie writes the best characters in published fantasy today. If you're a fan of the larger-than-life but still believable characters of PGTE, their banter and the witty, sarcastic POV voice then there's a good chance you'll enjoy Abercrombie's works because he's the best I've ever read at that.

He also writes some fascinating and unique concepts including a Fantasy Kill Bill, a fantasy Western, a fantasy story where the entire novel solely covers a 3 day battle and his latest trilogy is a fantasy industrial revolution; all of these within the same fantasy world too.

I agree with starting at Best Served Cold and then looping back and reading the rest of the First Law books in published order.

(His very latest novel A Little Hatred was brilliant as well and i'm Interested to hear from others who have read it).
