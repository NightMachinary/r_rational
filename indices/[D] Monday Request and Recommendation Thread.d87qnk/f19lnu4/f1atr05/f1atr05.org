Second the author recommendation. However, I would actually recommend The First Law trilogy over Best Served Cold. Perhaps it's just the order I read them, but I found Best Served Cold to be a bit boring. The First Law is IMO iconic and has some great characters.

Half a King series is also good.

Another author/series I would recommend is Richard Nell's Ash and Sand series [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35994830-kings-of-paradise?ac=1&from_search=true][(first book)]]. Like Abercrombie it has pretty good characters and a crappy world, but is more of a coming-of-age arc than straight grimdark. The way it's done doesn't give of that feeling of pointless hopelessness that a lot of grimdark stories do. For me that feeling is a hard block against reading "grimdark" fantasy - I can't read some series that many people seem to recommend highly like NK Jemisin The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms, anything by Mark Lawrence, R. Scott Bakker's Prince of Nothing etc.
