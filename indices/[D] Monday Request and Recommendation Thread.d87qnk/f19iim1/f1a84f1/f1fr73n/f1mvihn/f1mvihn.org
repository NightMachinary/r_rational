These three tags do generally correlate with lower writing quality, but none of them can serve as an automatic and objective quality gauge.

More than that, OP tried to substansively elaborate on their recommendation and got ignored and downvoted, while you refused to engage them after your initial, low-effort comment and got upvoted instead. This somewhat clashes with my expectations about the discussion quality in this sub.

As a disclaimer: I haven't read the story itself, so this comment isn't trying to say anything about its quality one way or another.
