David Edding's /Elenium/ series (and its' sequel series) might provide a solution.

Magic in there is due to the direct influence of the gods, responding to the prayers and requests of their followers. The gods have the ability to hear any requests their worshippers make, incredible ability to move and reshape matter and create illusions good enough to fool each other, can mess with time, and in at least one case it's pointed out in-story that a certain spell works a certain way (despite not making logical sense) because that's how the god in question /thinks/ it works (the Troll-gods being poor logicians).

The gods, in turn, get /their/ power from their worshippers; they feed on emotions, especially when intensely felt (usually positive ones, like love, adoration, etc., though one particular evil deity seems to subsist entirely on the less wholesome parts of the psyche) Some of this energy goes into sustaining the god, and the rest the god is free to use to grant spells to their worshippers - or to use for any other reason (it's worth noting that some gods, for various reasons, explicitly do not provide spells). Among other things, this acts as a power limiter; a god with only a few worshippers can only provide very small amounts of magic, and a god with none is powerless.

Any given spell is thus a polite and somewhat formalised request to a given god to do something, which that deity might or might not honour (but generally will because they like to be considered reliable, lest their followers convert to other churches). People with a particularly good relationship with a given deity might even make direct requests outside the scope of a formal spell.

...there is one particular macguffin which runs outside of these rules (i.e. the source of its power was from something else) which has a lot to do with /why/ it was a macguffin, but most of the in-setting magic ran by the above rules.
