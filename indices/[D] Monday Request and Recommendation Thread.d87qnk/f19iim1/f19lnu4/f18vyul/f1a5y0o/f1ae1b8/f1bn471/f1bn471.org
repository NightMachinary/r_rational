Unsounded has an excellent and internally consistent magic system. It is functionally "magic as programming," in that (for example) the way spells are cast emulates the process of giving instructions to a computer, but it's handled in an organic way that doesn't negate the magical-ness. The comic is ongoing so there isn't yet a full explanation of how it originated, but it is strongly implied that the metaphysical "network" that manages reality and carries out instructions from mages was created and doesn't just exist. There is a decent amount of info on the magic system in the comic itself, and the author answers fan questions about the finer details on her Tumblr.
