It's a little complicated because I'm asking for a lot of different things. The one you're confused about I didn't explain very well.

What I meant when I said it would only have one source was that the suspension of disbelief is only possible to break once, when the magic system is introduced and explained. This is a fundamentally different criteria from asking for a hard magic system which only requires that the magic has limits.

What I was trying to get at in my previous comment was that I still want the story to have an element that doesn't make sense in reality, it wouldn't be fantasy otherwise, I just want this element to be restricted to a single element. For example if magic was divine in its origin then to fill my requirement would be for it to only originate from one god. You could also have it come from multiple gods but then you would have to explain their existence as originating from the same explanation.

What makes my request complicated is that I am asking for the magic to follow that one explanation and be a hard magic system, both of these requirements are difficult to do alone much less together while still having a good story. Especially when what I mean by good story is that the magic makes sense according to the explanation.

This might make it sound like I'm asking for science fiction, and there are a few science fiction stories I've read that meet these criteria, but it is possible for fantasy to meet these requirements while still staying fantasy. Admittedly there is usually some overlap of the genres when these requirements are met.
