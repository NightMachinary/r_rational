I think the main difference comes from how you imagine immortality is obtained. If it's some kind of pill that needs to be regularly taken to stop Death from claiming you, then it seems likely to me that only the rich will be able to use it, at least for a while. Meanwhile, if it's some kind of virus that spreads among all humans and gives everyone 'infected' with it immortality, then the world as a result of that would be very different.
