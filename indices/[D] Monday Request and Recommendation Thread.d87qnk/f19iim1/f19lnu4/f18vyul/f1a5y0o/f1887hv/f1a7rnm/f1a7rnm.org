What would you recommend to someone as an introduction to pro-immortality ideology? Preferably stand-alone stuff; fanfic would be counterproductive for this purpose, I think. Fiction or non-fiction, blog posts, whatever. I'd like something short (think large pamphlet) and something a bit longer (think short-story).
