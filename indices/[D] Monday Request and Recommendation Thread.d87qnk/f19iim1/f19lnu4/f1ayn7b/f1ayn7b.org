Could not agree more about Abercrombie, The First Law trilogy is brilliant, but would recommend against starting with Best Served Cold (and honestly I don't think Best Served Cold is all that great).

I'd also caution against the YA series - the first book is good, but I found the second mediocre and the third outright poor.
