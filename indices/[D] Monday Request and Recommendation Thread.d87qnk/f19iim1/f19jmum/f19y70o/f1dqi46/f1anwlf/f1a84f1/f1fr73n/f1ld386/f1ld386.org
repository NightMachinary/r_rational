Fair. I probably should've explained more and gave warning to the 18+ rating, but writing on mobile is hard.

Few grammar mistakes, consistent pacing, interesting rationalization of the gamer trope. That's why I check up on it frequently.

Yeah the power fantasy and sex stuff is sometimes off-putting, but at least the author gives reasoning/justification to it in-story, even holding the opinion that its trash if written improperly.

PM what you think makes a story high quality then, so no derail?
