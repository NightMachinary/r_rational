I am really enjoying [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26294/he-who-fights-with-monsters]["He who fights with monsters."]] It's 67 chapters in less than a month but they are fairly short chapters. Game elements, evil blood cultists, MC using psycological warfare. Might not be everyone's cup of tea but very well written so far.
