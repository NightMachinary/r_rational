I'd like to recommend Joe Abercrombie, a relatively popular mainstream fantasy author. He's just come out with a new book in a new trilogy, so it seems like a good time for it.

His books are cynical, but not for its own sake, and he has some quite amazing characterizations. He's also quite genre-savvy, and plays with the form of the fantasy novel and forms and genres in general. He has a truly amazing talent for describing escalating chaos, situations spinning out of control in ways that are highly detailed and have a kind of verisimilitude.

If I had to suggest an entry point, I wouldn't start with his original fantasy trilogy, /The First Law/. Read /Best Served Cold/ instead. If you have a soft spot for YA, his YA series is quite good, it starts with /Half a King/.

/Best Served Cold/ is a revenge plot that takes the form of a series of heist-like setups. It's shockingly well executed. Here it is on Goodreads:

and here's Abercrombie's Goodreads page:

I get the sense that we're in the middle of a bit of a drought on the subreddit for recommendations, and perhaps the web serial space is a little mined out. So I thought I'd focus on something a little different this time, hope someone finds it useful.
