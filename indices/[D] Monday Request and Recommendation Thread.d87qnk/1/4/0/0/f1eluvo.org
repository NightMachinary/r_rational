I don't think of Abercrombie characters as good guys, in general. Most of them I can emphasise with despite their weaknesses or failures (Glokta is great!). Perhaps there's just an archetype that I can't stomach - Bayaz is unbearable, but for the longest time I was hoping he was being set up to fail. Nope, 'strangely' the self-interested plans of the super powerful know it all succeed, and it's only the ones which would possibly help others that 'happen to not work out'. Someone should just kill that guy and everyone would be better off for it :P
