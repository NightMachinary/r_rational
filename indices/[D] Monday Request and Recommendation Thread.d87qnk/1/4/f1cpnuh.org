I ~agree, in that I've read many of his books, but, quoting my goodreads review of A Little Hatred:

#+begin_quote
  On one hand, the book is great - action is engaging, characters very fun, writing good. The first say 80% of the book was splendid.

  On the other, it's another The First Law book, and it treats its characters similar to the previous trilogy. They get their small successes, minor victories, and invariably are later punished with a grander defeat.

  If you're a fan of that, this is a 5-star book. I struggled through the end, and so taking a bit off.
#+end_quote

In particular, the ending of The First Law (the entire trilogy) I found unsatisfying. Consistent and (if you share a certain bleak outlook on how the world works) realistic, but unsatisfying as hell. The supremely overconfident bad guy gets away with it, breaking any remaining backbone of the main character in progress. Fuck that shit :P
