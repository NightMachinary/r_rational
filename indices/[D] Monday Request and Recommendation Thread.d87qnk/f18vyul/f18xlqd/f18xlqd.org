The interactions of the kook Vybegallo from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monday_Begins_on_Saturday][Monday Begins on Saturday]] with the rest of the cast are a prime example of this.

Also, "A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court" has some of this, especially towards the end.

EDIT: looking over my shelves, got another one! Quite a bit of this in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moribito:_Guardian_of_the_Spirit][Moribito]], which contains a surprisingly pleasing portrayal of several characters applying the scientific method in a magical setting.

Oh, and John Scalzi's The Collapsing Empire (although for at least some of the characters the stance is just a public facade put on for personal gain, a common trope in recent american SF IME)
