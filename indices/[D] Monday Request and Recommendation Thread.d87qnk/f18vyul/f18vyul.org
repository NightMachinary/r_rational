Have a couple odd requests:

- A work that features real-world scientists or engineers with legitimate understanding of How Things Work coming into contact with those Who Claim To Understand How Things Work But Really Do Not (but can still maybe do amazing things, so they're not just cranks). So, for example, something with interactions between mundane engineers and Worm tinkers, where the latter spout off some bullshit technobabble, but on further probing are revealed to have a barely passing high school understanding of mechanics or circuits or whatever. Basically exploring /why/ tinkers can't just make a vastly simplified technology in their tinker specialty, or describe with connection to existing theory some of the basic principles under which their machinery operates (or, if further theory is needed, describe /that/ theory until you eventually build up to the understanding necessary to figure out their tech)
- A crossover between Harry Potter & Naruto, where Naruto was orphaned as a baby foiling the plot of the evil Madara Uchiha and goes to ninja school in Japan, run by headmaster Hiruzen Sarutobi, where he takes classes from the sketchy potions master Orochimaru and befriends muggleborn know-it-all Haruno Sakura etc. etc. etc. Or maybe Orochimaru is a better Voldemort surrogate (given the snake theme and obsession with immortality), but he'd be harder to tie into the KyÅ«bi plot
- A work of fiction where one's power is inversely proportional to peoples' expectations. So to use another Worm example -- if you go up against a very self-confident Lung who believes himself able to trivially crush you beneath his heel, you're actually able to do the same to him. But if you appear the scary, strong monster to a small child, you're powerless to harm them. The updating happens in real-time, so if Lung takes note of your strength and invulnerability, you become proportionally weaker

Some recommendations: I've been enjoying [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12703694/1/Harry-Potter-Geek-of-Magic][this]] lately and think it might appeal to the sensibilities of some here. Pretty funny, too!

A non-written recommendation: the website aliexpress.com! Has pretty much become my go to for all purchases of little electronic dongles, cheap plastic doodads, or really anything small & lightweight & generic. Most everything I've bought there is like 80-90% off what I can find elsewhere, you just have to wait a few weeks for shipping. Recent purchases have included a replacement Pixel 3 screen ($40 vs. $80), an NVME/PCI-E adapter ($2 vs $15), a cat backpack ($20 vs. $150), & a bunch of cheap, novelty jewelry (pretty much everything you'd find for $5-$20 when searching, say, 'science earrings' on etsy can be found on there for $0.5-$2, and afaict it's completely identical).
