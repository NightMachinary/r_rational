Not quite a crossover between Harry Potter and Naruto, but I just finished reading [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WWZ4V4M][/Hollow Core/]] and you could easily call it "Harry Potter and the Cultivator's Clique".

I'm not entirely sure I /liked/ the book, mind you - the protagonist is too much of a mushroom for my liking (he's kept in the dark and fed bullshit for most of the novel), but it was entertaining enough that I finished the thing.

Edit: added a link, since the book's SEO is awful (apparently hollow-core slab is a kind of foundation used to build houses, who knew?)
