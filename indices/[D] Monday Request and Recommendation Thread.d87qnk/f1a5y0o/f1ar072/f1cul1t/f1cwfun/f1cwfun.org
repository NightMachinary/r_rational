I promise I'm not trying to be intentionally obtuse.

It sounds like I you want a hard magic system where the rules have been explored and codified for (or by) the characters to at least some extent.

I'm just not getting what you're looking for when you start talking about the /source/ of magic, though. At best, a story can just make the source one more step removed from the reader (Ã  la "if God made everything, who created God?").

If I'm on the right track, some contemporary fantasy might be:\\
