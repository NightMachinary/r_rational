*Request:* Stories in with main protagonist major motivation to do hard or/and heroic things is love or friendship, like in the Good Student where Nic studied hard all his life for the chance to enroll in the school with his childhood friend/love interest(can't recommend this story, begging is cool but second half is just no good in my opinion). The "purer" the fellings the merrier. Fantasy preferred.

*Recommendation:* [[https://mangarock.com/manga/mrs-serie-61792][Domestic na Kanojo]] --- romance manga with great characterisations, quite believable unlike-manga-and-more-like-a-good-book overall quality of the world, plot, characters and theirs relationships (although still with a few not so great manga tropes). Trigger warnings: low key pedofililia, low key suicide themes, sex scenes. (There is anime filmed this year but I didn't watched it)
