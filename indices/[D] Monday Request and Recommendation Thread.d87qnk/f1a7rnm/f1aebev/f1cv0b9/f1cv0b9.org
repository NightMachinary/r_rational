This sentiment is exactly what the fable is arguing against. We should do everything in our power to end aging as soon as possible. "But the problems..." Meh. We'll figure it out. Honestly, life extension is technology I'm least worried about by far. Climate change, war, etc. will kill some of us. Aging kills all of us.
