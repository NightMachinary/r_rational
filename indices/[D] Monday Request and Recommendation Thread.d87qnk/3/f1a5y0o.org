I've recently come up with a solution to a worldbuilding problem I posed to myself a while ago: Is it possible to create a hard magic system around the magic system of Harry Potter (a series which intentionally leaves a lot unexplained about magic) while following the spirit if not to the letter of the magic system that J.K. Rowling layed out in the books. In other words no direct contradiction but some minor indirect contradictions.

People have definitely attempted and succeeded before:

But saying that magic was the prank of an ancient post-singularity alien race or where spells are programs and magicals users didn't feel satisfying and seemed to (figuratively) take away the magic of the setting.

I was wondering if anyone has come across a Harry potter fanfiction or even original fantasy that has a magic system with a similar range of effects to harry potter's magic system but give more details on how the magic system works in a way that satisifies the following conditions:

- All of magic (hopefully with many varied effects) is at least implied to have come from one source.

- Magic is at least implied to be created in a process and doesn't just exist. This doesn't necessarily mean that magic is created by something intelligent, it can result from natural phenomena just as life resulted from evolution.

- The explanation is satisfying and makes sense both before and after you think about it.

- I'm not saying the system has to be perfect, there can be gaps and for magic to exist in story in the first place you need to have some level of suspension of disbelief.
