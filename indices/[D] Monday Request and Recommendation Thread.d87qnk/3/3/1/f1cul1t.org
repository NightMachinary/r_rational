While I'm asking for a hard magic system that is not the only thing I'm asking for. What I want is a magic system that has a satisfying explanation for how it came about or how it works. Preferably both.

If you introduce a plausible technology based on current understanding of the world and extrapolate it is science fiction. Magic is independent of that, magic is when you create a new rule, set of rules, or sets of rules and then extrapolate. I'm asking for a story that gives a single rule and runs with it.

An example would be Break Blade, a story whose magic system is basically the ability for humans to telekinetically manipulate quartz crystals. There are countless complicated technologies that descend from this rule, with each type of quartz having the capability to be manipulated differently. This isn't explained like a technical manual in the story, instead the readers are given bits and pieces throughout the story (this quartz is good for vibrations, this one for spinning, this one for floating.)
