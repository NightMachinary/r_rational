I'm honestly having trouble thinking of a rational(ish) source of magic in /any/ story I've read, let alone an HP fanfic. Unless I'm misunderstanding what you're looking for?

The closest I can come is some sort of divine source. I haven't read the two you linked to - what are their sources so I can see what you're looking for?
