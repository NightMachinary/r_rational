It definitely took a while to get going. It's not until at least once they reach the oasis town that the MC's personality gets any detail other than "I don't want to die.", but in the most recent chapters there are some interesting bits of both social shenanigans and casual uplift attempts (funding the alchemist trying to make cheap healing potions). It also helps the writing's technically good enough that I don't get a headache trying to parse it, unlike a few other RoyalRoad stories I've tried to read.
