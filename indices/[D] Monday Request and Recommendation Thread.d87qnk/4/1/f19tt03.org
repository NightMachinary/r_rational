I can think of four of good quality:

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25962/cultivating-earth][Cultivating Earth]] - My favorite at the moment, if the premise sounds good to you I heavily recommend giving it a try. Has not updated recently but the writing and story quality is excellent.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/incompatible-system-mass-effect-au.777778/][Incompatable System]] - A side project of a well respected fanfic writer, you can read through the intro to see if you'll like it. Very good writing quality.

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26574/a-major-in-necromancy][A Major in Necromancy]] - Author does a good job at describing this one, good writing quality.

- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/unnamed.57272/page-2#post-12985753][Unnamed]] - original story I found, pretty good, if a bit weird so far.
