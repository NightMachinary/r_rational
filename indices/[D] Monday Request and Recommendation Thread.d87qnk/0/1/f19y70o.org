To name a few of the good ones:

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/seed-a-worm-au.340626/][Seed]] - Another good one, one of my favorite wormfics

- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/fate-first-order-derivative-fsn.47581/page-6#post-11451071][fate/first order derivative]] - This one is written strangely, almost breaks the fourth wall at points, not even sure what it is trying to achieve with that but the worldbuilding and writing outside of that quirk is incredible enough to land my third favorite work on this list.

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/18304/infigeas-online][Infigeas Online]] - Second favorite on this list, might not even be dead, the author said he would come back. Do not be driven away by the litrpg tag, this is way better than any story in that genre that I've found.

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20472/monstrous][Monstrous]] - My favorite on the whole list, I think it really would have gone somewhere if it kept updating.

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/18724/a-sh-ai-el][A SH AI EL]] - This one was really good while it lasted, and it actually lasted a relatively long time.

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/16075/a-broken-world-dropped-pending-rewrite][A Broken World]] and its dropped [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/24374/a-broken-world-rewrite][Rewrite]] - In the first one the protagonist went crazy and the second one has almost no chapters before it was dropped.

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/18633/jadepunk][Jadepunk]] - Really good writing, but not that many chapters.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/znt-the-sea-of-knowledge.236443/][The Sea of Knowledge]] - Really only good for me because I expected an industrial revolution, it was dropped before this even came close.
