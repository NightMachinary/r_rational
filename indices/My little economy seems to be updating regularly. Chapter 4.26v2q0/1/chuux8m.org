Would have posted update myself but for knowledge that all the Test: X chapters will be coming one after the other, so will be seeing Pinkie Pie's Test: Calculated Risk today/early tomorrow, and then Rarity's Test: Grey Goo Is Tacky day after that, with perhaps day's break or so between one or two of them due to intransigence of life plus fact that can feel brain squishing into shape of pony. Very imperfect chapter, wrote it mostly while very tired, could be lots of typos, subconscious code telling your dog to tell you to murder peacenik musicians.

Probably updating too frequently; sue me am impatient. Will wait week or more to get to the confrontation with Nightmare Moon, plus week or more after that for confrontation with Nightmare Moon's backers the venture capital firm.
