I find that often in rat fics the protagonists don't try to pay attention to and compinsate for their own fallability and I think that may be something to pay more attention to, including the chance that the statistics are flawed in any statistical analysis for exsample. Or include possible answers to a problem such as find someone more capable to do it or find more information on it or even attempt to increase ability to solve problems such as this before attempting again. Beyond which include factors such as that over the course of time ones abilitys and knowledge change, one might be able to surmount a problem even if one can't at time of beggining planning.
