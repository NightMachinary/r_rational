I had this for the first (and so far only) time in the last few years, and yes, that was utterly terrifying. I was driving home, picking up fast food, and suddenly had a glowing hole in the upper left of my vision that persisted, and slowly started growing. By the time I got home, I was on the phone with my significant other (who was an hours drive away at the time), panicking, trying to look up my symptoms online, wondering if it was a type of stroke or something (despite having ZERO pain or odd sensations, and feeling like other than the panic that my thinking was perfectly clear), asking the SO if I should be calling an ambulance since I no longer considered myself safe to drive myself to the hospital, etc. The blind/glowy spot grew to encompass half and then 2/3rds of my visual field, 'visible' even when my eyes were shut, and then.....just like that, it went away and I could see just fine. Aaaand that was it. No further symptoms, no reoccurence since.

Freakiest thing. Went and saw an eye doctor the next day who said it was an occular migraine, and sometimes they 'just happen', and to just go with it.

Stupid failable human body. Hurry up with the perfect nanomachine medicine, society!
