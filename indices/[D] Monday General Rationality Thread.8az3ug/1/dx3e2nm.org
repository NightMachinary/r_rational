Blegh.........

Today I had an ocular migraine.

For those to don't know what it is, it's a migraine where you experience disturbances with their vision such as flashing or shimmering lights, zigzagging lines, stars, or psychedelic images. If you're like me, you instead get blind-spots in your vision. Then a normal headache pops up once the vision issue clears up after an hour or two.

This is the second time I ever got it and while it's not as bad as the first time with a shorter duration, less severe blind-spots, and prior experience with it, it's still utterly fucking unpleasant wondering if I'm going to permanently lose my vision.

The main reason why I'm posting about it is because the worst part about it was having absolutely no clue what was going on when it first happened to me. So, if random shit is happening to your vision out of nowhere, don't worry it's very likely to be an ocular migraine. Just calmly go to a doctor with a friend to check out what's happening. After taking an aspirin for the headache of course.
