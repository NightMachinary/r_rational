Aural means ears, I think you mean ocular!

I get ocular migraines too, about once every six months (more often when I take BC with estrogen which I am no longer allowed to due to the migraine history). I actually had one on Friday, funnily enough.

First time it happened to me I freaked out, told a doctor friend, he had no advice, but it went away after about an hour. It didn't happen again until I started using estrogen-containing BC a few years later, went to a doctor, he said I was having an ocular migraine and not to worry about it, said it wasn't related to BC. Every other doctor I've spoken with has looked horrified when I told them my doctor said that and said that it was definitely related to BC and he was an idiot for saying it wasn't when I specifically asked. So, that was a thing that happened to me...

Funny thing is they happen in one half of your "visual field", but they don't just happen in one eye. Since your visual field is not divided by eye. Which I found strange.
