Interesting, especially given the existence of tropes like [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverTheObviousSuspect][never the obvious suspect]] and [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnspokenPlanGuarantee][unspoken plan guarantee]] (warning: tvtropes links) where the first guess in a case/any plan that is spoken about on screen prior to its implementation are guaranteed to be incorrect/fail.

In particular, stories in the fair-play whodunnit genre often put a lot of effort into showing the various failed hypothesis and dead ends that the detective has to go through before arriving at the correct conclusion. I don't see a reason why rational fiction couldn't use a similar plot structure.
