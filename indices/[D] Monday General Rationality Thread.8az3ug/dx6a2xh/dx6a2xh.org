Upon starting a Hero's War I realised a trope common to rational (and many non-rational) fiction that, now that I am aware of it, kind of rubs me wrong: /First Hypothesis Bias/

Let me expand on that a bit.

Suppose you have a plot with an urgent need of solving, in a somewhat rational manner (as in, the solution space doesn't require dipping too much into the typical trappings of knowledge and experience not available to the reader), and the MCs need to figure out an angle of attack or a weak point to investigate. The gather knowledge and lay it out, and brainstorm what they can do to overcome the problem. A character has an idea, it is followed through, and it works. There are variations in the narrative, of course, for instance factions putting forth different ideas and the MCs ideas being adopted only after the status quo ideas are shown to be not working.

However, the basic proposition is still: 1st/initial ideas are tested and proven true/working.

We as the reader are rarely shown the failures, the work that needed to be accomplished prior to coming to a true conclusion. The reasons are relatively obvious---it's tedious to show the twelve hundred eighty-nine various titrations, the statistical analysis that lead to the insight which approach worked better, and then refining with another one hundred five titrations before one can be somewhat sure the proffered cure has a reasonable chance to cure the ailment of the week. But there's rarely shown any of the misses; the narrative usually focusses on the successes, and therefore implies the correctness of the immediate hypothesis.

I think this narrative bias has a good chance of creating a real-world bias in the expectations and testing of hypotheses. Yes, a good scientific education should do away with this, but the problem with biases isn't so much the individual, but the societal impacts (This isn't meant to diminish the effects and importance of biases on the individual, but rather to point the focus how widely-available narratives with shared biases can induce similarly wide biases). With the narratively introduced expectation of immediate hypotheses / proposition of solutions, the actual work required to come to the proper (and probably right) solution is depreciated. An individual newly entering a field of scientific study will expect to see (somewhat) immediate success in hypothesis testing, unlike the probable slew of unsuccessful or inconclusive tests. They will perceive this as failures (personal or professional), even though it is probable and worthwhile by weeding out false hypotheses and pruning the solution space.

*TL;DR*: In that vein, are there stories that prune the solution space prior to arriving at the correct solution? I remember Frank Sch√§tzing's /The Swarm/ doing a decent job of it, but it's been over a decade since I last read it. There was also /Heromaker's Legacy/, I think, though I didn't finish it (spent too much time in minutiae).
