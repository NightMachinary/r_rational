  Do you have a problem calling an exterminator to deal with cockroaches, rats, or termites? Or settings out ant poison?

Many vegans do.

  Are you at all concerned by the mass-slaughter of animals caused by the plowing of a field?
#+end_quote

This is reduced by going vegetarian as the animals you eat themselves eat plants that require animal-destroying ploughing, so if that is a legitimate concern restructure your diet ASAP to focus on grains: [[http://www.animalvisuals.org/projects/data/1mc/]]

As far as points 3 and 4: Rephrase those questions to be about murder, women voting, slavery, etc. You're getting into nihilism or something along those lines with those, and I ain't going to dignify that sort of thinking with my time.
