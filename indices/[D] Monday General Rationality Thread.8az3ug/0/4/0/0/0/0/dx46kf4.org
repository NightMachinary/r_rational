There's plenty of rationalist vegans and you'll find ones much more willing to be patient with you in a debate like this on [[/r/DebateAVegan]].

  But my point was that not murdering humans is not a morally superior lifestyle. No matter what we do, humans die because of decisions we make; minimizing that number may have aesthetic value, but not moral value.

To actually put it in real terms: because I'm not donating every spare cent to preventing malaria killing people in Uganda, why shouldn't I just go out and murder people?

Because from your words, I'm not sure I see any meaningful difference between the two constructions.

Or are you stating that because humans are "culturally important", we shouldn't murder them? Or because humans are moral subjects but animals aren't?

If we were in the year 1800 and we were discussing women voting, would you say that's not an issue because in a transhumanist perspective, we don't need a government, so why does it matter whether women can vote? And that in our 1800s society, it is not culturally important that women vote?
