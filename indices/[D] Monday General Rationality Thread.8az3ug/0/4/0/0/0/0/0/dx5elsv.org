  If we were in the year 1800 and we were discussing women voting, would you say that's not an issue because in a transhumanist perspective, we don't need a government, so why does it matter whether women can vote? And that in our 1800s society, it is not culturally important that women vote?

You do /not/ want to go down that road. What makes you think transhumans wouldn't need government? If you really want, we can debate women's suffrage from a 19th century perspective, and from a futurist perspective. But animal rights from a futurist perspective? For a problem that is about to solve itself, you seem to have a strange sense of its importance.

Fortunately (for me), it appears you don't want to discuss in good faith. So I say adieu.
