Hey buddy I think vegetarianism is bullshit also I'm just pointing out that you can get 99% of the way there by eating beef. You don't have to believe in vegetarianism to recognize that there is an efficient way to get most of the way there and offer that advice to vegetarians. Obviously it's a bullshit concept. That doesn't mean that the advice I've given is incorrect for people who do believe in it.
