Okay, this? This I have a problem with.

I have yet to see any convincing argument that consuming meat is immoral or unethical. While the mass-slaughter of animals for meat may be aesthetically displeasing, nothing on the individual scale is wrong in a moral sense. A few questions for those who think otherwise:

1. Do you have a problem calling an exterminator to deal with cockroaches, rats, or termites? Or settings out ant poison?

2. Are you at all concerned by the mass-slaughter of animals caused by the plowing of a field?

3. Do you think the universe (or some higher entity) cares? Does society, as a whole, care? /Should/ society care?

4. At the end of the day, when the Earth has burnt up within the sun and mankind has evolved into higher form of life, will it matter how many animals died to feed us in our early days?
