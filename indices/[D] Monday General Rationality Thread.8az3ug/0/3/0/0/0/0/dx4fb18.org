Yeah, but the adults are killed 6 years before the end of their natural life and their conditions are absolutely horrible. So it's still not... nice.

Also - I am not sure if this is apocryphal or not, but there were some little baby chicks in a macerator and a journalist was doing a tour and was given the opportunity to press the "on" button to kill the chicks, and they couldn't bring themselves to do it. Putting it on that visceral level hit home for me in a weird way, there's no way in hell I could ever press that damn button, and if I buy eggs I'm paying someone to press it for me. I'm sure plenty of people would do the calculus on how many eggs they eat and how many baby roosters that means they'd kill and would happily press the button to kill that many roosters, but I personally couldn't.

Backyard chickens have the "bred to produce so many eggs it damages their reproductive tract" problem still.
