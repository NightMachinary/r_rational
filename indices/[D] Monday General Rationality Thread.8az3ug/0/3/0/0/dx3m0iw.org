Well, putting aside the fact that wild chickens lay 12 eggs a year rather than one a day, which has big impacts on even a backyard hen's bone density, commercial egg production kills billions of chickens.

First of all: egg layers and meat chickens are different breeds, so the male egg layers are economically worthless. So they are macerated (this literally means put into a giant meat grinder, alive), or they are suffocated. At a few days old. This is... not a "good" death.

Then their sisters are killed sometime between age one and three, when they'd normally live eight years. (Their egg production slows down, so they're not as commercial viable).

Oh, and the backyard chickens your neighbour / aunt / etc keeps? Their brothers would have been killed the same way as a commercial layers'. So they're not a complete loophole - and if you're thinking the ethics through, you're better off not eating those eggs and giving those eggs away to people who would have otherwise eaten eggs that were obtained in worse conditions.

(And yes, places like Germany are hoping to do sex selection for chicken embryos, preventing the male chickens from being born, which would improve a lot of the bad stuff with eggs, but these are not happening on a commercial scale yet).

Brian Tomasik of course has an article on this sort of thing: [[http://reducing-suffering.org/how-much-direct-suffering-is-caused-by-various-animal-foods/]] - again ranking chickens and eggs as worse than beef and pork
