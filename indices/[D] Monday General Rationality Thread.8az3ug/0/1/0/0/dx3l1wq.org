  I'm not really sure if I understand this point. I don't see how foundational values affect a being's qualia, (indeed to even suggest a being has foundational values is to imply it has qualia, and therefore is deserving of moral consideration)

Let's say that you know an animal is spending a day hanging upside down in a cave. If it's a bat, that's a good experience. If it's a giraffe, it's probably going be in severe distress and die very quickly.

After doing the research for the second question, you know that cows are raised in XYZ conditions. Are those good conditions for a cow to be in?
