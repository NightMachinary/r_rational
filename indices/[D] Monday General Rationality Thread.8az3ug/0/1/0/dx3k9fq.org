  How do you determine if an animal's life is or isn't worth living? (Positive utilitarianism vs. negative utilitarianism vs. ???)
#+end_quote

Somewhere pretty middle-ish, I guess? The sum of the magnitude of all positive experiences minus the sum of the magnitude of all negative experiences should be greater than or equal to(?) 0, though I recognise how annoyingly unmeasurable that is.

  How do you determine what is happening to farm animals?
#+end_quote

I've always just sort of taken it for granted that a system designed for the sole purpose of creating as many plump animal corpses as possible would be unpleasant for the animals. If I'm wrong, I get the relatively mild inconvenience of not getting to eat meat, if I'm right then I get to raise the universe's utility. (The obvious answer is to do more research, which I feel woefully underqualified for ¯\_(ツ)_/¯)

  Given some set of experiences, how do you judge the feelings/qualia of something that doesn't share many of your foundational values (such as a chicken)?
#+end_quote

I'm not really sure if I understand this point. I don't see how foundational values affect a being's qualia, (indeed to even suggest a being /has/ foundational values is to imply it has qualia, and therefore is deserving of moral consideration)
