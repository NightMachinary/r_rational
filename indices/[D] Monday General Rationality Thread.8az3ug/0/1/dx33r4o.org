How do you determine if an animal's life is or isn't worth living? (Positive utilitarianism vs. negative utilitarianism vs. ???)

How do you determine what is happening to farm animals?

Given some set of experiences, how do you judge the feelings/qualia of something that doesn't share many of your foundational values (such as a chicken)?

--------------

One set of answers (the smallest amount of good justifies existence, the industry accurately presents conditions on farms, and those conditions are suited to the well-being of the animals living in them) argues against welfare-vegetarianism.

Another set of answers (the smallest amount of suffering must be avoided, activists accurately present conditions on farms, those conditions are worse for animals than you would naively assume) argues for it.
