  I'm open to reversing course back in the other direction (i.e., less chicken, more beef) if I find new evidence, although I doubt I'll ever go vegetarian or vegan.

In case you haven't already read through it, I think Brian Tomasik's website would contain a good starting point for you to do some deep diving if you're so inclined.

Personally I figure it doesn't matter whether you stop eating beef or chicken, unless you're eating more of the other to compensate (so... if you're replacing your beef burger with a veggie burger rather than a chicken burger, you're unambiguously doing better).
