  I don't know if seafood is environmentally sustainable though, mostly it isn't is my understanding,

It depends on the fish. The factory farmed stuff is probably pretty sustainable, but not the stuff caught by fishermen.

  chickens are very intelligent (though not sure how much compared with cows).\\
  as long as you believe a chicken is more than 1% as "ethically worthy" as a cow,

I went down a brief rabbit hole looking for articles on chicken intelligence/cognition, and it was pretty inconclusive. That is to say, the majority of the research carries a clear bias from environmental and animal welfare groups in drawing their conclusions-- while they certainly prove chickens aren't /dumb/, their abilities don't seem to be anything special. Meanwhile, cows, being large, social mammals, are on the upper end of animal cognition.

I wouldn't go so far as to say that a cow has the raw mental capability of 100 chickens, but I don't think any reasonable system scales ethical weight directly proportional to mental processing power. For example, most people would feel less bad about killing hundreds, or even thousands of insects than a single rodent.

Combined with the environmental inefficiency of cows, I genuinely think that, ethically speaking, they're one of the worst common animal products.

disclaimer: independent of the OP's value system with regards to how highly they value meat, I'm invested in this argument primarily because I decided to try to lower my beef consumption in favour of eating more chicken, and reducing meat consumption in general a few months back primarily because of environmental harm, secondarily for health reasons, and tertiarily for ethical reasons. I'm open to reversing course back in the other direction (i.e., less chicken, more beef) if I find new evidence, although I doubt I'll ever go vegetarian or vegan.
