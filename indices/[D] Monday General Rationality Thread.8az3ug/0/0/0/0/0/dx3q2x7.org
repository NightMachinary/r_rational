So... become a vegetarian except for the occasional steak? Stop eating seafood and chicken, the two biggest animal killers? Become "vegan at home" but eat anything that strikes your fancy when you are at restaurants or visiting friends? Commit to meatless Mondays if you haven't already?

Heck, just buy soy or almond milk instead of cow's milk to stock your fridge at home, but keep the rest of your diet the same? (Cow's milk is worse for the environment than even the much maligned almond milk, after all, so if environmentalism is your primary concern than switching away from cow's milk in your own fridge is a very low-effort one)

It's not all or nothing, after all! The word flexitarian was coined for a reason, and maybe it was coined for people like you?
