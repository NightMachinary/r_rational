I feel a hierarchy exists.

Class (0,0): On the bottom, you've got things with no moral worth that are neither self-aware with a preference for life over death (I'll just call that self-aware) nor able to feel.

Class (1,0): Above that you've got creatures that (who?) are not self-aware, but are able to feel things, and I think it would be fine to kill them if you could do that physically and emotionally painlessly every time, perfectly.

Class (1,1): Even above that, you've got beings who are self-aware and able to feel, which should not be killed, even if painlessly.

I'll bet a few animals fall into Class (0,0). Quite a few people think bivalves fall into that category, and so I'll eat those. Certainly humans fall into Class (1,1) unless they're suicidal, and probably a bunch of other animals too, so they're definitely off the table. Uncertainty about how to perfectly humanely kill Class (1,0) as well as how to differentiate Classes (1,0) and (1,1) spare Class (1,0) for now.
