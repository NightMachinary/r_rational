He claims that he has a more detailed (i.e. gears-level) model of how consciousness works than most people who like to talk about this subject, and that this model massively drops the likelihood of most farm animals being conscious. Whether you're inclined to trust him on this is up to you, but assuming that he's telling the truth about having such a model, things get a bit more complicated than "my views are different"--for all you know, he has decent cause to rule out the possibility you describe /a priori/.

(Personally, I'm neither inclined nor disinclined to trust EY on this one. I haven't seen anything to suggest that he's normally dishonest in these kinds of discussions, and he certainly has enough relevant background in the area, but that's counterbalanced by the fact that dissolving consciousness seems /really freaking hard/. Overall I'd probably place a similar amount of credence in EY making this claim as I would in, say, Daniel Dennett, Gary Drescher, or David Chalmers making the same claim.)
