  I think fictional people are more interesting than real people.

True that. Boring fictional people get removed out from the meme pool far faster than boring real people get removed from the gene pool.

That doesn't help me figure out what I should do about it though. I can't exactly make the people around me more interesting characters. /Imagines stabbing someone's parents to give them a tragic backstory./ Yeah that's not going to end well for me lol.
