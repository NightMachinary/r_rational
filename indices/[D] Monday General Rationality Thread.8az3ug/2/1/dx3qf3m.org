Part of the thing RE hobbies: I think fictional people are more interesting than real people. I like cross stitching, but Harry Potter likes flying around on his broomstick. Even characters with "boring hobbies" usually have those hobbies chosen carefully to bring forward character traits that make them worth paying attention to.

Whereas the boring truth is I like cross stitching because I bought a mini kit at a craft shop once and then decided it was good to have something to do with my hands while I watch TV. A character in a book probably likes cross stitching because they were really close to their grandmother who taught them and passed down all their embroidery tools when they tragically died in a zeppelin accident, which is a much more memorable thing than "hipster millennial likes doing something that's kind of trendy because it's a good way to pas the time".

Just my hunch, anyway.

And to use the favourite colour - Peeta from The Hunger Games has his favourite colour as orange, and the reason I remember that is because he talked about it being like the sunset, which had a great visual image, and then later on Katniss talks about something being orange and thinking how it's Peeta's favourite colour. I am pretty sure Katniss mentioned her favourite colour in the same passage too but I can't for the life of me remember it because it didn't get attached to an image like that and didn't come up again in the story.
