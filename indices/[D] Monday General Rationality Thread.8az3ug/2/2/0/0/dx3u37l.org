Keep the notes in your phone's contacts. That's where notes on birthdays, relationship to you, etc. are expected to be kept. Probably don't take notes on anyone you aren't expected to have a phone number for. Notes on friends in your contacts book: mundane. Notes on random people: creepy.

That being said, don't take notes while talking to people. Get their contact info in conversation (hand the phone to them to enter in their name, it prevents spelling errors), and narrate as you add how you know them in the contact info (e.g. "Sam Smith, from English Class"). After you get the initial contact info, only add extra stuff after a conversation, never during. Most people are on their phones all the time so typing out a quick note to remind you of the conversation (e.g. "Likes 'Good Omens', morality") after goodbyes would look like totally innocuous behavior. If anyone confronts you, just tell them that your memory is bad and very few people will get offended.

Often just typing out the information is enough to remember it, so you shouldn't have to study it later.
