I usually add where I know someone from when I make a new contact and I have seen people do the same for me. Some people have asked for my picture to add to their contact information, but I usually don't add pictures. I rarely keep some additional information in the notes section in my contacts, but it's a logical place to put notes if I cared to do so.

As for when a person is a friend, I usually make that distinction when I've interacted with them multiple times in more than one context (class, club, self selected group project, friend of a friend, shared a meme, etc) and find that I enjoy talking to them. (For context, I am a fairly neurotypical, introverted, college-aged female.)
