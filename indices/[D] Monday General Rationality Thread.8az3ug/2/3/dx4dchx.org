I definitely have that too, I've always wanted an excuse not to have to remember things about people. I hope this takes off because I wasn't early enough to get in on the ground floor of the "[[https://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?id=2832#comic][using undiagnosed Asperger as an excuse to be a dickhead to people]]" phenomenon. /s

I am pretty sure h3 or h4 are more correct than h2 or h1 are. I don't know what my mom's eye colour is for example but I could definitely choose to remember it if I see it again and regurgitate the info when relevant (it never will be).

Another hypothesis could be that people are more complex and uninteresting than fictional people, if you read about a fictional character you're not going to read that he casually plays chess sometimes when he has the free time for it and he tried to get into rock-climbing but only went five times because that would be boring, forgettable and would tell us nothing about the character but it would be perfectly ordinary for a normal person. The character you read about wants to play chess with the protagonist in every interaction and his rock-climbing skills will come up when dramatically appropriate and save the day! You can't really define real people by saying "This is sally, her hobby is cosplay, her favourite colour is violet and she prefers earrings to necklaces."
