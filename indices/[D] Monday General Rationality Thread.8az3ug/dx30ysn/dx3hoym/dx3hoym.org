Only hot-take is that, animal death per calorie wise, eggs are one of the worse things you can eat, so you should do your best to avoid eggs as much as you can. Milk is the least terrible animal product because cows produce so damn much of it, so that's not as "pressing a concern" to eliminate from your diet if your primary concern is ethics. (Seriously, I believe beef is less harmful to animals than eggs are and it's not even close).

Been vegan for about two years now, so I've got tons of recipes and know all the substitutions and stuff. My own transition was very slow (took about 4 years), and the first thing I stopped eating was chicken and the last thing I stopped eating was very rare steak, which apparently is the opposite to the typical "i'm vegetarian but i eat chicken" so go figure.
