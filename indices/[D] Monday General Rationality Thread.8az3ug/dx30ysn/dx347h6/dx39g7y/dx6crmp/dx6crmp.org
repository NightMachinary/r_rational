Not the person you're responding too, but I am also cautiously optimistic about lab-grown meat becoming viable soon-ish.

I suspect most of the it's-unnatural-and-therefor-bad crowd won't jump on this in time to prevent it hitting the shelves and once it does I think the market of people that are not-quite-vegetarians is large enough for it to be economically viable as an alternative to animal meat.

After that, it's a matter of what process will turn out to be cheaper in the end, as that is what the vast majority of people will go for. I would expect lab-grown meat to win that fight, but I don't know enough about the technology involved to say this with any kind of certainty.
