Yes, I'm saying that images like that are basically useless. I'm not saying you have to rely on second-hand descriptions, but the image doesn't actually say anything. In the case of Nazi atrocities, it provides context for what the Nazis themselves saw. It doesn't prove anything -- it's purely context.

Imagine you're debating with a holocaust denier. You show them this image and say, "Therefore the Nazis were evil." The argument won't hold water. Even assuming you demonstrate that the photo is authentic, that it demonstrates what Allied soldiers actually observed at concentration camps, even then it doesn't condemn the Nazis. And I think you already know that. (Which isn't to say there isn't a very large body of evidence that /does/ condemn the holocaust.)

Using "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_pity][emotionally compelling]]" imagery is inherently problematic in debate, and needs to be used with caution.
