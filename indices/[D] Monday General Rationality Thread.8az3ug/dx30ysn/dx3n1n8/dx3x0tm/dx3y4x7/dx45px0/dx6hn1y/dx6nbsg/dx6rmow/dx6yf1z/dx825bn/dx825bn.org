You are basically saying that images such as [[https://www.amazon.com/Photo-Starving-prisoners-concentration-liberation/dp/B0081R6YVI][this]] of Nazi atrocities can never be used when arguing about the evils of Nazi Germany and you can only use second hand descriptions. If someone posts an emotionally compelling image of what goes on in slaughterhouses then it is still an honest debate unless the evidence is fabricated or misrepresented.
