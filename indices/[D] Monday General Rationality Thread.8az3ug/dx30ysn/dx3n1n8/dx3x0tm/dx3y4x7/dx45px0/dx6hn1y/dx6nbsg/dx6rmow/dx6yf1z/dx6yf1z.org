  So if someone has become a vegan they have been manipulated by mind control rather than convinced through honest debate. I'm having trouble taking your position seriously.

What do you call it when someone displays pictures of slaughterhouses in order to trigger an empathetic response? This sort of manipulation is designed to shut down honest debate: /You can't debate me, because this picture makes you cry./ You can call it brainwashing or mind-control, but around these parts, we call it brain-hacking.
