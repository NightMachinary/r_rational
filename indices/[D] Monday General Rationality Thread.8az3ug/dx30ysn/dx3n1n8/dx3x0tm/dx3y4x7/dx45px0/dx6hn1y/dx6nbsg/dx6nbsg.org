    I consider debating with a vegan completely unacceptable. With someone who is a rationalist first... I can work with that.

  If you refuse to listen to the views of others then they have little reason to listen to you.

I wouldn't think this needs saying: Places like [[/r/DebateAVegan][r/DebateAVegan]] exist to indoctrinate people. Since veganism is essentially a lifestyle choice, one cannot convince a vegan to, well, stop being a vegan. The best you can hope for is to convince them to stop being so annoyingly vocal about it. To even attempt debating such a person is futile. It's far more likely that the vegan will successfully brainhack the debaters into joining them than vice-versa.
