  As far as points 3 and 4: Rephrase those questions to be about murder, women voting, slavery, etc. You're getting into nihilism or something along those lines with those, and I ain't going to dignify that sort of thinking with my time. [[/r/DebateAVegan]] might be a good place for you to discuss this issue.

I consider debating with a vegan completely unacceptable. With someone who is a /rationalist/ first... I can work with that.

And I think points 3 and 4 are the important ones, the ones worth focusing on. We like discussing trans-humanism here, don't we? What I mean with the questions is to look at vegetarianism and animal-rights in general from a trans-humanist perspective. Obviously, from a modern cultural perspective, there are far more important things to deal with; human issues. Things like violent crime and recidivism, abortion, human trafficking, domestic abuse, and oppression. And /these/ issues? Most of them can be discussed from a trans-humanist or futurist perspective, while vegetarianism really becomes something of a non-issue.

With questions 1 & 2, I mean that people who go down the road of veganism end up becoming absolutely ridiculous, agonizing about killing a spider as though it is equal in value to a human life. Alternatively, and far more usefully, we can look at the impact of a lifestyle: ecological, industrial, economic, etc. Certainly I'm open to arguments about the ecological impact of one diet versus another. There are lots of ways to go here, and policymakers should (and do) take these arguments into account, given that individuals will do what is economically efficient.

But my /point/ was that vegetarianism is not a /morally/ superior lifestyle. No matter what we do, creatures die because of decisions we make; minimizing that number may have aesthetic value, but not moral value.
