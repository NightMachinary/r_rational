If you want an easier way to get most of the morality benefit vegetarian, switch to eating large animals. Avoid eggs, chicken, salmon, sardines, turkey, and so on. If you eat a pound of meat each day, for 365 pounds a year, that could be hundreds of chickens, sardines, salmons, eggs, etc, or it could be a single cow or a single tuna or something.

By solely eating large animals, you could get 99% of the way to being a vegetarian in terms of reducing number of animals horribly killed. This is one of the best possible compromises; if 100 people did this, this would be as good as 99 people becoming vegetarian, and it's quite easy to do.
