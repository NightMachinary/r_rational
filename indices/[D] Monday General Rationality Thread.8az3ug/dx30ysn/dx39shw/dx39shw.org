In my experience going vegetarian was nearly effortless, once I decided to do it. I don't think the practical side of it should be all that challenging.

I'll post my thoughts about why I believe vegetarianism is of ethical importance when I have more time, but as a matter of honestly I'm also compelled to say Eliezer Yudkowsky's post on why he /isn't/ vegetarian was very persuasive. I think he's wrong, but he's not /obviously/ wrong. It should be easy to google; I'll link it later regardless.
