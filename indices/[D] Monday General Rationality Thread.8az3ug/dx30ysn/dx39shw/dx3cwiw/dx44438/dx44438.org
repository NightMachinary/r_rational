I don't really agree with his notion of how animals work. Or at least, I don't agree with how he reacts to his perceived reality.

My model for how animals work is that they don't experience their emotions so much as they are their emotions. They don't give critical thought to what they're feeling, they simply react to it as best they know how. Yes, their minds are orders of magnitude less complex than our own, but that doesn't mean that they don't have value. Every animal is a completely unique being with its own perspective and set of experiences, and I don't think lacking the capacity for self-reflection invalidates that.
