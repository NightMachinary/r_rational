Basically, agriculture is terrible for the environment, and growing plants to feed an animal so you can drink its body fluids is a lot less efficient than growing (different) plants and blending them with water.

I'm using water consumption specifically as this is what almond milk is criticised based on.

250ml of cow's milk takes [[https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/jan/10/how-much-water-food-production-waste][255 litres]] to produce.

According to anti-almond milk sites, it takes about 1 gallon of water to grow one almond, and almond milk is 4% almond at the high end. One almond weighs about 1g so a 1kg litre of almond milk will contain 40g of almonds or 40 gallons of water (160 litres). So a cup of cow's milk takes more water to produce than an entire litre of almond milk.

Almond milk isn't a good substitute for cow's milk nutritionally anyway FWIW. I think it's great taste and health wise, but if you need high protein, high calorie, high sugar, high fat beverage you're better off with soy, which I believe uses less water than almond.
