Depends on your values/etc I guess. I don't know if seafood is environmentally sustainable though, mostly it isn't is my understanding, and chickens are very intelligent (though not sure how much compared with cows).

One cow weighs as much as O(100) chickens, so you know, as long as you believe a chicken is more than 1% as "ethically worthy" as a cow, you should probably not eat chickens.

Also, the person I was replying to specifically stated they want steak - so if wanting steak is a terminal value, then cutting out all animal products but steak is the best available option even if steaks are literally the worst thing you can eat.
