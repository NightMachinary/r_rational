I didn't really find that post very compelling at all, it mostly relied on EY's own biased assumptions and rationalizations as usual.

I think a more compelling reason to adopt a vegetarianism lifestyle is the fact that it is much more environmentally sustainable. Livestock farming generates a tremendous amount of pollution and produces a lot of waste.

BTW I'm a firm omnivore. I just think vegetarianism makes the most sense from an ethical, resource scarcity, and environmental perspective. It's just hard... I love steaks too much.
