As with everything human, there is a great big bell curve going on. On reddit/askreddit you can find a ton of people who are super-rememberers - they get in trouble for remembering that someone liked a specific chocolate brand 4 years ago.

So I'd go with hypothesis one for the missing software but disagree with the conclusion. Applying your generic memory - to people facts is possible, and notes are a great external support of that.

(My people detail memory is pretty bad, and I have made notes about people after first dates, for example.)
