How about another hypothesis?

*Hypothesis 3.5:* People remember things better in different ways, you remember characters better because you get your information about them in written format with few other distractions. Real life interactions are generally face-to-face and auditory, so not only do you receive the information in a potentially harder to remember format, you are also busy looking at the person's face. Reading facial expressions takes a lot of mental bandwidth; it's why people glance away when thinking hard or trying to remember something.

Some people could just be better/more practiced at social multitasking. And in that case taking notes would most likely help you.
