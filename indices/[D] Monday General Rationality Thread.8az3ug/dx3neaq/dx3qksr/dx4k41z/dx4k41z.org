I'll chime in as seconding Hypothesis 3.5.

I have the same deal where I'll remember people's names (though it takes me awhile) and the general level of our interactions, but personal details just don't 'stick'. Those stories you told me about your troubled childhood, or that your worst fear is turning out like your dad? Nope, sorry, half the time, those are just gone. Whereas all the minutia of hundreds of board game rules or dozen deep computer folder structure layouts--more structured information--stick with me natively just fine, right out of the box. Fortunately, my husband is more pro-social than I in that regard and can make up for my lack. Collectively, the two of us form a more functional whole. Huzzah!
