I have a specific memory problem that I would like advice/input on: I cannot remember any details/trivia about real people. Apart from myself, I don't remember anyone's favorite color, favorite foods, hobbies, dislikes, etc. I remember their names and relations to me, and that's about it. This seems weird to me because I can remember fictional characters just fine. It's just real people that I can't remember.

I have come up with four hypotheses that I can't distinguish between without other people's inputs:

*Hypothesis 1*: People remember other people instinctively. Their brains have automatic software that retains info about their friends and family without any effort. In this scenario, my problem would be that my brain is just missing this software, and there's nothing I can do but work around it.

*Hypothesis 2*: People remember other people instinctively, but only if they have strong feelings about them. Their brains have automatic software that only turns on and retains info about people they care about without any effort. In this scenario, my problem would be that I don't care about other people strongly enough (I probably don't), and so I would need to self-brainwash into caring more. Somehow.

*Hypothesis 3*: There's no such instinct. People remember other people because they put effort into studying them, just like students studying for an exam. In this scenario, my problem would be that I haven't been studying, and should start taking down notes about people.

*Hypothesis 4*: It's normal to not remember real people. Only stalkers or fictional idealized friends remember that kind of stuff. In this scenario, my only problem would be that I've been lied to by TV, and I should definitely not study up on people like a stalker. This last hypothesis seems unlikely to me though...

So yeah, which is it?
