  Funny thing is they happen in one half of your "visual field", but they don't just happen in one eye. Since your visual field is not divided by eye. Which I found strange.

Yes! When it happened to me, I definitely noticed that while it was on the left part of my visual 'field', I couldn't isolate it to one eye vs the other at all, which made me at the time panic that I was having a stroke or something else directly affecting my brain.
