Whoops! Thanks for the correction.

The ocular migraines happening in half of your visual field makes sense since headache problem originates from your brain rather than in the eyes even if that's where the symptoms are manifesting.

If you look at this [[http://www.zuniv.net/physiology/book/images/fp5-6.jpg][image]], then you'll see there is one red and one green line to each eye which explains the blind-spots in only half of the visual field.

Human brains are so /badly/ designed by evolution.
