Yeah, but at /that/ moment?

It's pretty much a word-for-word copy of what Lucius/Mr. White replied at the same time to the same question... but Lucius was sacrificing magic in the ritual, and Draco was sacrificing trust. Mr. Grim, who was in Draco's position in HPMOR, /laughed/ when he found out that the ritual was going to be redundant in a few minutes.

I'm just saying that it's odd that Draco would pick /that exact moment/ to break down, when all he'd lost in /that/ moment was his trust of Harry.
