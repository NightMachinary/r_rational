    little of what you use to justify the line remaining unchanged is actually made clear in the text

I'd argue that's where the true failure lies; if the intent isn't clear from the text, then it didn't do its job.

Originally I had a much longer section describing Draco's feelings towards the matter; basically just a more wordy version of the explanation above, with a little bit more of a deep dive into drawing parallels between Draco and his father, with Draco thinking "What would Father do", along with a brief lecture / internal monologue on why trying to mimic what smarter people is silly; a sort of cargo cult approach to intelligence.

It dragged on for about five hundred words and I wound up cutting the whole thing because I felt like it detracted from the action of the scene with unnecessary pedagogy. But it's pretty clear in hindsight that the "I've lost so much" line doesn't really play outside of that context (especially since you're not the only one to point out the issues), and really what I should have done was cut that line as well.

After talking through this, I may wind up editing that line out.
