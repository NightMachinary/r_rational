To be blunt, this all seems like post-hoc justification for keeping a line from the original that no longer quite fits. Yes, he has lost quite a bit in the past few minutes, it's true; I went too far in my initial post, suggesting otherwise. But if this had been a less derivative work, I don't believe that's what you would have written Draco to say in that moment. Which is fine, for a lot of the other stuff you've been lifting from HPMOR these past few chapters, because the circumstances haven't changed /that/ much from the original. In this case, though, the circumstances of why that line is supposedly being said have changed /massively/ (and little of what you use to justify the line remaining unchanged is actually made clear in the text), so it undercuts the emotional impact of the moment.
