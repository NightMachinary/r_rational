No. I have a story outline written, and write and post chapters as I go. I have no prewritten content. I write it, read over it, use the find function to detect a few errors that I KNOW I make, and then post it. If you follow the story and get the email version, it's a first draft. After a few responses, and a couple further read-throughs by me at intervals over time, it becomes a second draft.
