I love the idea of having people lean on other specialists like you're saying: it makes sense especially since you have a professional network, especially if you're already a really top level person (and there's no trouble with writing about the top level people. I remember my husband was watching Stargate with me and he's like "why is Carter both a world-level astrophysicist and an amazing marksman/soldier, that's so unrealistic" and I'm like "dude I'm sure there's probably one person like that in the world today and you can bet an astrophysicist/soldier would be headhunted by the Stargate program in a hot minute").
