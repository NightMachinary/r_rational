Was thinking bat guano type of component. The magic-user has 48 components they can use. The use of those in order (with repetition of components allowed) creates magical effects. What I am asking is what should the slots be. I have some ideas on how some of the slots should be used, but I am just trying to get inspired. The only things I for sure about is that I want to limit elemental components to air, water, fire, earth (and arcane if the element in the spell is not specified), and origin of effect (form caster, form components, into the caster, and coating caster).

Note that the magic system was designed by a god, so its following more of an intelligent design type of thing.
