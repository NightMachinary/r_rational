A lot of that comes down to practice and experience. Drive and motivation can take you far but the best way to optimize a route is by walking the walk repeatedly.

When I started to draw half a decade ago not only was I bad at it but also slow, it took me two hours to make a drawing that right now I would get done in under 15 minutes and probably scoff at. Same thing with writing, I'm well past the 250k words mark, yes most of it is pretty bad, and just thinking about my first few stories makes me cringe, but I'm getting better and I'm getting faster. I used to struggle to reach 1k words in one sitting, now I can do that easily but struggle to reach 3k.

In writing, and with time, you learn what to do and what to avoid, what suits you and what doesn't, you discover your niche, you find a voice, you either learn to organize yourself better with stuff like outlines or you embrace the unknown and dive into discovery writing. You learn the plots, the characters, how to weave personalities and strengths and weaknesses, you ease yourself into it, you spend less time hesitating, etc. It all adds up.

Also remember that a lot of what you're seeing is what the writers are willing to publish, what they think is good enough for their readers. They write a lot and they accumulate a lot of experience, for the most part we only get to see the end result.

The result of crafting or creating something is art, but the act in itself is not, both speed and quality come from excellence, and excellence comes from habit. So keep at it, if you find yourself lacking or not up to stuff [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSH_xM-KC3Zv-79sVZTTj-YA6IAqh8qeQ][watch a lecture]], read what other writers have to say [[https://fictionphile.com/best-essays-on-writing/][about writing]], join a writing group or community, the most important thing however is that you write.
