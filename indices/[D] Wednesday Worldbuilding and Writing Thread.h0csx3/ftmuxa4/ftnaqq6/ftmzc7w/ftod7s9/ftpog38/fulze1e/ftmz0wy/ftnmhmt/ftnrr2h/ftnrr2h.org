Obviously there is no universal system, no one 'right' way. Try it, if it doesn't work don't get hung up on it, move on and try something else until you figure out what does work for you.

That said, I strongly suspect that those mentioned in the query, who are putting out regular chapters and high wordcounts, either instinctively can or have trained themselves to make a deadline and do so again and again. Not to say there isn't one, but I personally don't see another answer to 'how do these people do this thing'.
