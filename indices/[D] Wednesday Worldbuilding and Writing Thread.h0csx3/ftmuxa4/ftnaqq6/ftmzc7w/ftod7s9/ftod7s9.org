I'm currently sitting at... 469K words for 2020. I write, on average, at a speed of 400 words per hour. That is, I can write a thousand words in the span of a few minutes, but it'll take hours of planning and plotting to prepare for those few minutes.

I'd suggest just setting out a sheet or some sort of day planner and writing down however many words you wrote on any given day. Aim for about 500 a day at first, then after maybe a year, increase that by a bit. It's like lifting weights, you don't start with the heaviest weight you can find, you start small and work your way up.
