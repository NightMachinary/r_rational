I suspect that WtC is possible to write so quickly because the author probably does have many years of real-life experience with playing D&D and running roleplaying games. If so, he would have a lot of experiences that he could draw upon to write a story which loosely threads in themes and encounters that have popped up over the course of his gaming. It's relatively easy to write about things that you're very familiar with. Even so, I wouldn't be surprised if Alexander Wales spent a dozen or more hours per month writing WtC. You need to have spare time, and writing has to be something you enjoy doing in your spare time.
