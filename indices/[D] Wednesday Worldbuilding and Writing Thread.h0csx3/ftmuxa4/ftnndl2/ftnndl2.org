Random "rationality" question:

One of the biggest complaints about the medical accuracy of /House/ was that all the doctors there seemed to be specialists in everything, running all the tests themselves, when they aren't actually established to be experts on that.

A rational story would have to honour that sort of thing, right? Like having doctors go to specialists for tests, having a real estate lawyer not doing murder defenses and a patent lawyer not doing copyright law, and whatever other professions that we chunk all the tiny little specialisations into one big general "X"

I ask because having one lawyer who does all the law in the story is a really, really handy cop-out, but I know it's actually terrible, and, IDK, I guess I am kind of fishing for "of course you can create an unrealistic world where one lawyer without even a paralegal can handle every kind of law problem there is", which I've already talked myself out of.

So, more general question: to avoid falling foul of this trope: what professions, like "doctor" or "lawyer", do people assume are polyvalent when really they have narrow specialties and would be relatively lost if they went outside it?
