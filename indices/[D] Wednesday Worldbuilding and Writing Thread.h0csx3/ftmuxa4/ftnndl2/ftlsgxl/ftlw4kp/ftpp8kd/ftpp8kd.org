For a designed system, you can easily arrange magic that relies on only /two/ components and get an infinite number of spells. Just arrange them in a pattern taken from the binary representation of the ASCII text naming the spell...

So, the number of components does not limit the number of potential spells that the system can handle. (More components just makes individual spells shorter).
