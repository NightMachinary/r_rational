There's a thing that's been bugging me every time I try to write something:

How do people write so fast!?

Like, I look at PGtE with its bi-weekly updates, and I look at WtC with its tens of thousands of words per month, and I look at the numerous other serials that update thousands of words regularly, and I'm just utterly baffled by how people can just spew out high-quality content so quickly.

Personally, I can only write at a few hundred words per hour, so it'd take me a dozen or more hours just to match that rate, let alone coming up with the ideas and editing it to snuff. Is it a lack of experience? Motivation? Spare time? How do you do it?
