What do you mean by 'components'? In D&D and Pathfinder there's 'material components' like bat guano, owl feathers, etc. You could also be referring to an extended array of classical 'elements', like fire, water, earth, air, void, life, death, light, dark, etc. It's also possible you're referring to various domains of magic, like enchantment, abjuration, necromancy, divination, evocation, transmutation, conjuration, etc.
