Presumably, you'd want to have variations in difficulty of acquiring the components in order to have some low-power spells which can be cast carelessly, alongside other high-power spells that can only be cast very rarely (using dragon's teeth, unicorn horns, etc.) Variations in the quantity of the components required could also be used to help balance usage of similar spells within approximately the same power class.

Any particular reason for using exactly 48 components? Presumably, that specific number will have something to do with what the components are.
