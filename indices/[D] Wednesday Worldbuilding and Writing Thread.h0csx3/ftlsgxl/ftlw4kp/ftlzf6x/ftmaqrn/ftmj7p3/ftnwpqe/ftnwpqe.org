48 isn't really on the smaller side unless you're going to break it up into a few simple groups. Like, 4 tiers of 10 items, with each tier being identical in effect but generally more powerful and/or rare, with exceptions. And then 8 special items that maybe don't behave much like anything else. Otherwise, 48 is an overwhelming amount of unique items/effects to remember.
