Finally caught up to the latest chapter again. Ran steals the show as usual despite barely showing up in this one. Definitely my favourite character.

The stakes seem to have subtly increased. Wondering if this is going to end either with a noble failure or with Su embracing the despair. Kam seems to be making her best effort for group cohesion but consistency is hard, and sometimes trying too much backfires. Perhaps that's why Ophelia's keeling over was a little painful to read- the story's prodded me into feeling more sensitive to their suffering.

Still, definitely a setup chapter. Good if it pays off, but the pacing did feel a little odd given the previous (pre-intermission) chapters which had established a nice flow.
