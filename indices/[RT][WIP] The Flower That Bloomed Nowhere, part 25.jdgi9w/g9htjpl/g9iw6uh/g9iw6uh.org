Yeah, the result feels a bit off to me, too. Probably the biggest issue I've had with this story is just managing the sheer /volume/ of exposition that needs to happen for plot elements to not feel like they come completely from nowhere. I mentioned this elsewhere, but both mystery and fantasy are genres that tend to require lots of setting establishment, and in this case it does compound on itself a bit.
