I suspect that you remembered the law that falling masses have a constant acceleration of 9.81 m/s^2, but forgot that this law only holds in the presence of /gravity/.

In space, when you fire a bullet/missle, the velocity will increase until fuel runs out and then is set until it hits another object or another gravitational force interferes. Acceleration is not constant.
