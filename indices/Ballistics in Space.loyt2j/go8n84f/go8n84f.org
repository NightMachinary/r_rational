As others have said, a bullet won't accelerate unless something's making it accelerate. Newton's first law- velocities stay constant by default.

A missile accelerates while it's firing its rocket, but the total change in velocity it can effect is described by the rocket equation- it can keep accelerating so long as it has fuel, once it's out, it keeps going on straight line at constant velocity (ignoring gravity).

A bullet is (sort of like) a rocket that spends all its fuel at once at the moment it's fired.
