Not exactly.

A missile with some engine would indeed keep accelerating until it runs out of fuel. Keep in mind the acceleration wouldn't be constant: it would /increase/ as the missile becomes lighter by burning fuel.

A bullet with no engine would just keep going in a straight line at a constant velocity.

In presence of gravitational fields, both cases would complicate considerably. Bullets could slow down or speed up depending whether they're climbing out or falling into a gravitational well. Trajectories would be curved and it would all be pretty confusing.

If you're interested in learning this both in great detail and with a hands on approach, check out the game [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/476530/Children_of_a_Dead_Earth/][Children of a Dead Earth]]. You won't find a more realistic simulation of space warfare out there. It's also, obviously, incredibly complex.
