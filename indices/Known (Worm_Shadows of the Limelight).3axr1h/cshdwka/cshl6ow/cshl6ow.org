I am not a highly proficient storyteller. I'm a good writer on the prose level, but I quite frankly don't have the chops to do anything with a coherent plot, let alone social consequences or themes. I just wrote this for fun.

Did /not/ expect it to end up on [[/r/rational]]. The only reason the plot doesn't dictate everything is because there's no plot to do the dictating!
