You should probably make this its own thread; right now, you're hardly making much of a splash in the raging river of the main discussion thread. Explaining more about the original world might also help garner interest.

As an idle thought: one of the main appeals of SotL is observing the emergent social effects of one phenomenon that works on a universal level, and you lose that if you simply take that phenomenon and make it a one-off bound to a single main character. It's up to you if that's a problem you actually want to tackle, or even consider a problem at all.
