I was really disappointed that the author didn't fix the glaring time travel mistakes from the previous chapters. After she started working on fixing things, I had some hope, but nope, nothing.

First of all, Quirrell is utilizing the same method that Harry tried for P=NP problem solving. He is collapsing timelines where his attack led to Harry's death. That's not allowed in HPMOR.

Second, it would be completely pointless for Harry to hide /after/ an attack has occurred - because it cannot be changed. Hiding /before/ an attack would make sense, since then Quirrell might not know that Harry was alive - which means that Harry would need to permanently hide. Doable, if annoying.

All the talk about "throwing" bombs sounds weird - this was not well stated, and repeated many times. And the fact that the word "bomb" was used so many times is a problem from a technical perspective.

Furthermore, Harry was portrayed to be rather dumb when he suggested that the wizards could just take out all the nukes and bombs in UK. It wouldn't have worked - especially with the nuclear submarines, and all the stockpiles of conventional munitions. As well as weapons from outside the country. As soon as the wizards decide to officially start a war, US would get involved and squash any opposition. And it has far more weapons.

From a technical perspective this is a well written fic, but there are serious logical problems and issues of scale.
