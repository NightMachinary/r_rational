This is still a pretty big change to the perceived initial time travel model. Harry during his prank was not making decisions based on information from the future, and was not pruning possible timelines. IMHO the moment you start making decisions based on some information from the future that may make that information invalid, is the moment you start delving into potential paradoxes which are not allowed.
