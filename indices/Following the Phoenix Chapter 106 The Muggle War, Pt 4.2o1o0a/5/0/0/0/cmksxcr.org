  As long as Quirrel only checks that Harry is alive (which he can probably use the horocrux connection for) and doesn't let any information directly about the success of the attack itself go through, he can then timeturner back and either launch the attack if he saw Harry alive, or not launch the attack if he did not see Harry.

I still don't see an appreciable difference between this and the prime number factorization problem.

  Thus Harry hiding from scrying (which may be difficult given the horocrux connection) would prevent Quirrel from seeing him and prevent Quirrel from deciding to trigger the attack.

But hiding /after/ the attack would be pointless, since the attack has happened, which means that either Quirrell knows that Harry survived anyway, or he did not check in the first place.
