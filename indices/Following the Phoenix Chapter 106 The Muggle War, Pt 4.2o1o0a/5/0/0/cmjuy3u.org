  (a) blocks the prime number problem, but (b) does not block Quirrell's trick, and (c) makes it sensible for Harry to hide under the cloak after apparent and potentially lethal Quirrell-interference, will you admit that you are wrong? :)

I remember I had this discussion already with ElimGarak, although I did not fully present the model. As long as Quirrel only checks that Harry is alive (which he can probably use the horocrux connection for) and doesn't let any information directly about the success of the attack itself go through, he can then timeturner back and either launch the attack if he saw Harry alive, or not launch the attack if he did not see Harry. If his scrying method wouldn't scry at all if Harry is dead of hidden, then he can avoid accidentally seeing Harry dead and fixing that future.

Thus Harry hiding from scrying (which may be difficult given the horocrux connection) would prevent Quirrel from seeing him and prevent Quirrel from deciding to trigger the attack.

An even better strategy may be for Harry to convince Quirrel that he is dead, although because they cannot predict his reaction to this it is riskier.
