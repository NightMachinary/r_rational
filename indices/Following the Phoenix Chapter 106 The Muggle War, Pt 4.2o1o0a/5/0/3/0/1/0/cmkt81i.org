  This is a pretty big jump though. Especially given what Harry knows and doesn't know in HPMOR. If he came to such a realization on the nature of time, then you should have explicitly explained it in the story - otherwise it doesn't make sense for Harry and Dumbles to spontaneously deduce Quirrell's method.

Well, in truth, I never considered it anything but completely obvious that if Quirrell can ask the future "hey, is Harry alive?" that it makes sense for Harry to try to make the answer come out "dunno" - no sudden epiphanies about the nature of time travel (which won't really be exploited later beyond avoiding further Harry-targeting attacks anyway) are needed if he thinks like me on this point, even without having a direct model of time travel in his mind.

Rationalising afterwards /why/ it would be obvious to him: Harry is entirely familiar with Timeless Decision Theory, as established in chapter 33. Thus, it would be clear to him that /if/ Quirrell is checking the future, that there might be some kind of simulation of the future going on, to determine the message he will get. Thus, it makes sense for Harry to hide under the cloak after an attack, even though it already happened, /because he might be in the simulation/.

(The actual time travel that Quirrell is doing is one of those "background" things mentioned in the author's note for 104, by the way. So eventually it'll be edited in - and then I expect it will seem a lot less miraculous for Harry and Quirrell to deduce it, because the readers have already seen how it works.)
