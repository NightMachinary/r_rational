  if not, find a stable simulation to prevent THE TRAVELLER from messing things up, using one of the following three techniques: (a) have them give themselves a warning (e.g. NO or DON'T MESS WITH TIME), (b) if a fails, find a minimal interference which severely hurts them (aside from the laws of physics and magic, the simulation can introduce "temporal magic" to achieve nasty effects), (c) if a and b both fail, prevent the travel simply by having temporal magic flare and break their Time-Turner (possibly killing THE TRAVELLER in the process, if we want to be nasty);

Yes, I see - if you are allowed to mess with the rules universe, adjusting things in such a way that the traveler changes nothing, then you avoid the potential infinite recursion and stack overflow. This is possible primarily because you are assuming a deterministic universe and are playing fast and loose with some of its internal rules.

  the computer makes a new simulation, branching away at 3:01, where Marielle arrives and sends Quirrell the YES-note; in this new simulation, the orphanage gets burned

I don't understand why this is different from Harry trying to solve the P=NP problem. It seems like an identical situation, except that instead of solving the very complex prime factorization problem he is solving a much simpler attack / don't attack problem.

The only difference that I can think of is that the computer has a loop counter and jumps out of the computation loop if it ran more than N simulations. In that case it just aborts and has the traveler send a "do not mess with time" note.

This is a pretty big jump though. Especially given what Harry knows and doesn't know in HPMOR. If he came to such a realization on the nature of time, then you should have explicitly explained it in the story - otherwise it doesn't make sense for Harry and Dumbles to spontaneously deduce Quirrell's method.

Now, what about Harry's decision to hide for 6 hours after an attack? If the attack has already occurred then that won't change. Alternatively, if we use the model you suggested above, then why wouldn't the simulation resolve the unstable loop by having Harry stumble and pop out from under his cloak, and get detected? A much safer and more guaranteed approach, one that avoids potential paradoxes, would be to just hide permanently. Or at least semi-permanently.
