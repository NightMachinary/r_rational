  I was really disappointed that the author didn't fix the glaring time travel mistakes from the previous chapters.

You were disappointed that the author, who has explicitly stated that she didn't agree that the "mistakes" you pointed out were in fact problematic, didn't change them?

Here's a challenge: if I can provide a possible model of how time travel could work that (a) blocks the prime number problem, but (b) does not block Quirrell's trick, and (c) makes it sensible for Harry to hide under the cloak after apparent and potentially lethal Quirrell-interference, will you admit that you are wrong? :)
