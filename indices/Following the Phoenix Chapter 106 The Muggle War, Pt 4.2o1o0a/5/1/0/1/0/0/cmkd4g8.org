Barely a single interaction with Muggle's by Wizards has ever gone successfully, and now they've to stage a kidnapping of high military officials who are likely currently all on constant survelliance and communication (when you know you can be impersonated the solution is not to give people a chance to impersonate). Then these people have to work on weapons which are specifically known for their danger and often are set so as not to be easily disarmed.

I mean with the ease you're suggesting, why don't they just go ahead and kidnap the entire population who're threatening them. Problem solved.
