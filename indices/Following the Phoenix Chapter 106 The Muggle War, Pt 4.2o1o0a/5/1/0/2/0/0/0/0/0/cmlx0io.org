  Actually, they would be very difficult to test properly without access to a nuclear missile in the first place. For once thing, even doing magic next to a nuke may cause it to go off as the magic interferes with the electronics. A single surge in the detonator and bye-bye wizard. Let alone the potential problems with radiation and strong electrical and magnetic fields in a missile silo.
#+end_quote

If nuclear missile designers are that idiotic, then just teleport a single unmanned magical item to the vicinity of the nuclear weapons and watch as every military base in the UK goes up in smoke.

But yeah, testing with a nuclear missile on one of the earlier loops might be a good idea, though most relevant stuff can be tested with merely large, complex pieces of machinery.

  No, the fact that you believe that so strongly means that you identify with and believe in magic waaay too much. You automatically assume that magic is all-powerful and can do just about anything, without providing any evidence. I assume the opposite.
#+end_quote

? I do expect magic should in principle be capable of anything of equivalent thermodynamic work as things already shown, like creating water out of thin air, or transfiguration. And that the HP world is rich in spells of this level, rather than just having the few spells that exist all be suspiciously plot-relevant.

Take [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Arania_Exumai][Arania Exumai]]: It makes for a more sensible world if there are similar spells for many classes of animals, rather than Aragog and pals happening to be the one type of animal which has a convenient "bugger off" spell taught to second-year students.

I really don't get what you mean with "identifying with magic", though.

  For example, in HPMOR we know quite well that there are strict limits on the size of a transfigured object. They are determined by the strength of a wizard, and this has been explicitly stated. I doubt that even Dumbles could transfigure an object of that mass and size.
#+end_quote

Compartmentalisation: transfigure components, rather than the whole. Or get a crash course in timeless physics and go partial; it's what all the cool kids are doing.

    If you're not constrained by ethics, evacuate all wizards to Mars (we've got pictures), then transfigure up nuclear or antimatter bombs or tonnes of anthrax spores and drop them on Earth.
  #+end_quote

  In other words you are talking about not wizards from the HPMOR universe, but some previously unstated group of infinitely powerful and omniscient beings. Irrelevant.

Other than magic not working away from the earth (which seems to contradict the Pioneer plaque thing), there is no simple rule I can think of that makes teleportation to Australia possible, but not to Mars.

Other than the danger of radiation poisoning - which there really should be a shield for, considering there's a shield against physical objects - I see no reason why rock-to-plutonium would be an illegal transfiguration. Design basic Little Boy bomb, using rock instead of plutonium and lead instead of regular casing. Have the drop be on a (mechanical) timer rather than based on impact. Transfigure rock to plutonium. Teleport to drop location (under shield). Set timer. Teleport out. City goes boom. AFAIK there is no increase in magical effort for sustaining a transfiguration depending on distance, only depending on target size (a couple of kilograms).

Similar with anthrax: Transfigure a buttload of anthrax into a container that blows up to spread them over a large area but not kill them. Teleport in, drop container, set timer, teleport out.

This really isn't too difficult to think of for me, hence my incredulity at you denying it is possible.

  Numbers, numbers, numbers. How many people can be imperioused at once? And for how long?
#+end_quote

Arbitrarily many for arbitrarily long periods of time. Otherwise it wouldn't make much sense as a defense for death eaters.

  Result - nuclear annihilation. Winner - none.

Except the /wizards on Mars/.

  LOL. Right. In other words, the wizards would act as terrorists, since they can't take on the muggles in a stand-up fight. And historically speaking, terrorists have won how many wars?
#+end_quote

Let's see. We have Rome, the Huns, Persia, the Mongols, Aztecs, I guess the inquisition should count towards a religious war in southern Europe, Turks, Israelites (according to their own mythology), Norse kingdoms, the Bacchus cult (possibly mythological), most successful modern criminal organisations, Saddam Hussein, Pol Pot, dozens of warlords in Africa, any banana republic dictator, etc.. The main failure mode for terrorists is that they attract exceptional attention from larger forces, especially when there's a Geneva treaty intended to force just that. Unfortunately, this is a war between the only two races on earth, so there's nobody to bail humanity out.

  If such an object could be created easily, then the wizards would have an infinite amount of gold and materials, since they could use it to find anything they want, at any time, anywhere.
#+end_quote

How does this not apply to any invention, anywhere? Or, more specifically, Harry's numerous one-week inventions? Wizards, like muggles, have the tendency to see humans as fundamentally different from the rest of the universe, which is simply wrong. There should be no reason (other than souls) why it is possible to invent a device that points at "Hermione" but not at "nuke 32-A"

  I am not certain - I am extremely skeptical in the absence of evidence of acts even remotely powerful enough.
#+end_quote

Powerful? What's the difference between teleporting to a point that is moving at 29.78±0.47 km/s relative to the sun and one that is traveling at 29.78±0.52 km/s relative to the sun?

  Without evidence you are just basing everything on faith.
#+end_quote

I would like to offer you a bet. I win if I get 2 heads or more in a sample of 100 coin flips. 90-10 odds. If, as you say, I am basing the >90% probability of me being right - for which I have absolutely zero evidence - on faith, and as you imply that doing so is wrong, then this deal ought to be in your favor. Choose wisely.
