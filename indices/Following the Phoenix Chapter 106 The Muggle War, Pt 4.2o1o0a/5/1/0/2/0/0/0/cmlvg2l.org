  None of which have been shown to work on objects of that size & mass.

  That's a huge jump in logic.

Both of these would be easy to safely test in-universe, and I would expect positive returns, especially in fiction. The fact that some form of wizardry should be able to disable a nuclear bomb seems so obvious that I think you're being intentionally obtuse.

  Bwa-ha-ha! Wizards winning a war against muggles. That's pretty funny. Let alone in 6 hours.

You're saying that like difficulty is something inherent to the problem, rather than a statement about your knowledge of it.

If you're not constrained by ethics, evacuate all wizards to Mars (we've got pictures), then transfigure up nuclear or antimatter bombs or tonnes of anthrax spores and drop them on Earth. Or imperius people into throwing their friends into concentration camps while continually making perfectly clear they're still their old selves except for being bound into servitude. Or Quirrel's zombie apocalypse thing, starting in as many cities as you can get people to cast the relevant inferius curse. Or just use time turners to ensure zero Muggle survivors in every violent encounter, perhaps with reprisals against relatives, though that wouldn't solve the problem in less than a week.

Following the Geneva conventions and staying on the side of Light is a lot harder. Maybe the winning move is just not to play; teleport to Mars, with the wizards who want to come with, leave the Muggles and stupidwizards be, then use magitech to colonise the solar system before the Muggles have interplanetary nuclear missiles. A magical version of the Soviet Dead Hand system would prevent government interference and arguably not be Dark, leaving only the nonanarchic hooligans, all of whom can be taken out with phoenixes, a magic-proof camera (or good memory), and time travel, or shields that block everything but magic. A lot of negotiation also fits in 6 hours, and since mutual cooperation is in mutual best interest, a solution might be found in that time too by a sufficiently clever arguer.

There are indubitably other methods.

  Yes, because that's not how this works. You don't get to say "suddenly and conveniently they invented fantastic new devices that solved all their problems". Because that's not how stories work, because you have not provided any evidence, or even plausible suggestions.

Human patronus, partial transfiguration, dark mark, acorn light bomb, troll rock, etc.. They don't magically solve all problems, they magically solve specific problems. As an object that points to items within a specific class would (like the compass points to objects in the class of "humans who are [...]").

Strange that you would expect things which I merely don't know to be things I'm wrong about: why are you so confident that phoenix teleportation to submarines can't be a thing, or that there is no possible magic which can deactivate a nuclear bomb.

  Just because you can brainstorm does not mean that you can solve the problems. Or that it even makes solving those problems possible.

So?
