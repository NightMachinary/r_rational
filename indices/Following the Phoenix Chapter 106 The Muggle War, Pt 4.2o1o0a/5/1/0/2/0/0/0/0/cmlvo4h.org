  Both of these would be easy to safely test in-universe, and I would expect positive returns, especially in fiction.
#+end_quote

Actually, they would be very difficult to test properly without access to a nuclear missile in the first place. For once thing, even doing magic next to a nuke may cause it to go off as the magic interferes with the electronics. A single surge in the detonator and bye-bye wizard. Let alone the potential problems with radiation and strong electrical and magnetic fields in a missile silo.

#+begin_quote
  The fact that some form of wizardry should be able to disable a nuclear bomb seems so obvious that I think you're being intentionally obtuse.
#+end_quote

No, the fact that you believe that so strongly means that you identify with and believe in magic waaay too much. You automatically assume that magic is all-powerful and can do just about anything, without providing any evidence. I assume the opposite.

For example, in HPMOR we know quite well that there are strict limits on the size of a transfigured object. They are determined by the strength of a wizard, and this has been explicitly stated. I doubt that even Dumbles could transfigure an object of that mass and size. And he is just one wizard - how is he supposed to deal with all the warheads at once?

#+begin_quote
  If you're not constrained by ethics, evacuate all wizards to Mars (we've got pictures), then transfigure up nuclear or antimatter bombs or tonnes of anthrax spores and drop them on Earth.
#+end_quote

In other words you are talking about not wizards from the HPMOR universe, but some previously unstated group of infinitely powerful and omniscient beings. Irrelevant.

  Or imperius people into throwing their friends into concentration camps while continually making perfectly clear they're still their old selves except for being bound into servitude.
#+end_quote

Numbers, numbers, numbers. How many people can be imperioused at once? And for how long?

#+begin_quote
  Or Quirrel's zombie apocalypse thing, starting in as many cities as you can get people to cast the relevant inferius curse.
#+end_quote

Result - nuclear annihilation. Winner - none.

#+begin_quote
  Or just use time turners to ensure zero Muggle survivors in every violent encounter, perhaps with reprisals against relatives, though that wouldn't solve the problem in less than a week.
#+end_quote

LOL. Right. In other words, the wizards would act as terrorists, since they can't take on the muggles in a stand-up fight. And historically speaking, terrorists have won how many wars?

#+begin_quote
  As an object that points to items within a specific class would (like the compass points to objects in the class of "humans who are [...]").
#+end_quote

If such an object could be created easily, then the wizards would have an infinite amount of gold and materials, since they could use it to find anything they want, at any time, anywhere.

#+begin_quote
  Strange that you would expect things which I merely don't know to be things I'm wrong about: why are you so confident that phoenix teleportation to submarines can't be a thing, or that there is no possible magic which can deactivate a nuclear bomb.
#+end_quote

I am not certain - I am extremely skeptical in the absence of evidence of acts even remotely powerful enough. Without evidence you are just basing everything on faith.

    Just because you can brainstorm does not mean that you can solve the problems. Or that it even makes solving those problems possible.
  #+end_quote

  So?
#+end_quote

So you have yet to come up with a viable plan that has a ghost of a chance of working. Since you can't come up with one you can't say "Harry will come up with it, he is smart!" - because that's not how debating works. And no, talking about brainstorming and suggesting unworkable ideas is not a viable debating tactic either.
