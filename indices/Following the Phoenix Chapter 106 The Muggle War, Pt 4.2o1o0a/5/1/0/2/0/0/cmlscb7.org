  This should be easy, and best left to people who know lots of spells. Miniaturisation which doesn't increase density might work. Transfiguration, creating technical faults, etc.

None of which have been shown to work on objects of that size & mass.

  I think it likely that you can just teleport to submarines using the same method as teleporting to physically fixed locations.

  Deactivating tens of thousands of regular explosives is much more difficult, to the point that it might be easier to simply win the war completely in those six hours instead.

  Did you just ignore the existence of Harry dementorfucking Potter? Half the point of the story is that Harry is providing solutions that takes even readers months to (fail to) solve.
#+end_quote

Yes, because that's not how this works. You don't get to say "suddenly and conveniently they invented fantastic new devices that solved all their problems". Because that's not how stories work, because you have not provided any evidence, or even plausible suggestions.
