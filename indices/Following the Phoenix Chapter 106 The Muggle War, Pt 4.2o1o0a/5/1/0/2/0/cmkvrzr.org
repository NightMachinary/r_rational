My plans were very rough draft. They might be workable, or they might not. I agree plan B is probably the best bet; I don't know the limits of "accio", but they may be tested or known to wizards and/or people with better canon knowledge.

  Wizards would need to penetrate dozens of secure nuclear launch facilities,

Use mind-reading to get the memories of locations out of captives, then teleport in. By "six degrees of Kevin bacon", you should probably be able to find someone who has physically been within ten yards of the current location of every nuclear bomb. Use technology and magic to prevent sensory overload, form kinetic barriers, become transparent (invisible, but not Hidden) to all senses, etc.

  nearly simultaneously,
#+end_quote

use mechanical watches if you have to. Though I don't see why you would need to be close.

  and then do something with the huge devices weighing dozens of tonnes
#+end_quote

This should be easy, and best left to people who know lots of spells. Miniaturisation which doesn't increase density might work. Transfiguration, creating technical faults, etc.

#+begin_quote
  And this ignores the problem with submarines.
#+end_quote

Since Hermione was able to teleport to a park she hadn't been in years, it is not necessary for a location to be perfectly as remembered: all the plants will contain different atoms, the trees have gotten fatter, etc.. I think it likely that you can just teleport to submarines using the same method as teleporting to physically fixed locations.

#+begin_quote
  This further ignores the sheer number of conventional explosive storage facilities. And their size. And the number of bombs stored there.
#+end_quote

The claim was that deactivating 400 nukes would be too hard. It evidently isn't. Deactivating tens of thousands of regular explosives is much more difficult, to the point that it might be easier to simply win the war completely in those six hours instead.

#+begin_quote
  Huge leap in logic. Most wizards don't know what a "rocket" is and call it a "rocker". And think that muggles almost blew up the moon with one. And now they are going to develop a highly advanced nuclear material detection device, in a matter of days or at most weeks?
#+end_quote

Did you just ignore the existence of Harry dementorfucking Potter? Half the point of the story is that Harry is providing solutions that takes even readers months to (fail to) solve.

#+begin_quote
  The problem is that all of the suggestions you made have huge problems.
#+end_quote

If you reject plans just because they have problems, you're not going to come up with plans. It's why brainstorming is a thing. System 1 is good at pattern recognition, but not good at logical reasoning: system 1 sees possibilities, but can't check them well against reality; for that you need conscious deliberation, which I hadn't done much myself with those plans.
