  Plan A: "Accio nuclear warhead" (n.b. do not use vital personnel when trying this out)

Does accio have size or distance limits? I feel it must otherwise Accio Quirrel, accio horcruxes, etc.

Plan B seems far too complicated for the wizards Harry knows to successfully administer.

Obviously the author likely wouldn't have mentioned it if they didn't have a method planned so my expection is there is some way to do it.
