  Barely a single interaction with Muggle's by Wizards has ever gone successfully, and now they've to stage a kidnapping of high military officials who are likely currently all on constant survelliance and communication (when you know you can be impersonated the solution is not to give people a chance to impersonate).

Assuming you only kidnap only one person per cycle, and you're properly shielded, all kidnappings take place nearly simultaneously (each time-turned one can start seconds after the previous one is completed if you want to play it completely safe) and feature no knowledge passed on from future to past wizards.

You're saying that like it's all we know of them. Like they're some kind of mystical death machines.

I wouldn't think this to be very relevant in ICBM design. But anyhoo, they're wizards. They can teleport things on touch, they can miniaturise, they can turn metal into wool. Not stuff bomb technicians really accounted for.

This might provide a risk in the most primitive bomb designs, like Little Boy, where critical mass is reached by simply sliding two pieces together. Modern plutonium bombs (allegedly) normally use explosives to compress the plutonium to supercritical density, and the explosives have to fire at once or else it is a dud. Fusion bombs typically use fission bomb primers, with similar difficulties in timing.

More abstractly, a military base would not want a couple of suicide bombers to be capable of infiltrating the base and just nuking it into oblivion by performing the same actions that someone who fails to deactivate the bomb would. You wouldn't even want a cruise missile blowing up a missile silo to trigger a nuclear reaction. Tampering isn't going to blow them up.

That might actually work just as well, assuming you can avoid bombardment, but it wasn't the victory condition.
