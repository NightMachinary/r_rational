Plan A: "Accio nuclear warhead" (n.b. do not use vital personnel when trying this out)

Plan B: kidnap military officials you know of, use time turner 1 hr into the past, administer veritaserum, inquire who might know all locations of nuclear weapons and where all nuclear weapons are. Repeat four or five times, then go to every nuclear warhead and unnoticeably make them inoperable. Administer false memory charms as necessary, or use the abducted military in future plans.

Plan C: magical/technological gadget capable of long-term tracking of nuclear bombs that we should be able to figure out using HP canon

Plan D: "accio enriched plutonium". (nb: really use someone expendable this time).

And that's just in a few minutes at my brain capacity. I'm sure Harry can figure something out in minutes and the author in days (lower bound; not expected value).
