  Plan A: "Accio nuclear warhead" (n.b. do not use vital personnel when trying this out)
#+end_quote

Umm... So, summon the hundreds of objects, over hundreds of miles, that weigh dozens of tonns, and are permanently attached to missiles that weigh hundreds of tonnes as well? Missiles that are stored under ground in closed silos, and are attached to their launchpads? You don't think that there would be a problem with this?

Also, what about the missiles in submarines? How would that work?

  Plan B: kidnap military officials you know of, use time turner 1 hr into the past ...
#+end_quote

This may almost work. Kind-of. To a degree. However, this plan still ignores some problems. Wizards would need to penetrate dozens of secure nuclear launch facilities, nearly simultaneously, and then do something with the huge devices weighing dozens of tonnes. And this ignores the problem with submarines. This further ignores the sheer number of conventional explosive storage facilities. And their size. And the number of bombs stored there.

  Plan C: magical/technological gadget capable of long-term tracking of nuclear bombs that we should be able to figure out using HP canon
#+end_quote

Huge leap in logic. Most wizards don't know what a "rocket" is and call it a "rocker". And think that muggles almost blew up the moon with one. And now they are going to develop a highly advanced nuclear material detection device, in a matter of days or at most weeks?

  Plan D: "accio enriched plutonium". (nb: really use someone expendable this time).
#+end_quote

Umm... Through bomb casings? And missile warheads? And the concrete walls? And submarines? And the water surrounding the submarines? All while keeping the stuff together, and not irradiating half the country while they are dragging the stuff to their location? And then survive the proximity of the highly radioactive material?

  And that's just in a few minutes at my brain capacity.

The problem is that all of the suggestions you made have huge problems.
