  Here's a challenge: if I can provide a possible model of how time travel could work that (a) blocks the prime number problem, but (b) does not block Quirrell's trick, and (c) makes it sensible for Harry to hide under the cloak after apparent and potentially lethal Quirrell-interference, will you admit that you are wrong? :)

Of course. This is not a religion. I don't blindly believe in something. If there is something that explains everything then that would be better.
