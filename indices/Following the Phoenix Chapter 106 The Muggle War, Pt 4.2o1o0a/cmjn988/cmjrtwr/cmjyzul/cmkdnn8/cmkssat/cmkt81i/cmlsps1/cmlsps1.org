So basically you had two of your characters suddenly and independently arrive at a brand new (at least to the reader) conclusion on the nature of time, time travel, and the universe. In the middle of a chapter.

And that's why I don't buy it.

I agree that your model might be possible in the HPMOR world. But we have seen no evidence of that, and neither has Harry.
