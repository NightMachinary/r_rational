  No, I had two characters, one of which has a lot of experience with time travel and the other of which has read a lot of science fiction, presented with a given successful use of time travel.

I did not get that sense either. This is feedback from the reader - there is nothing to prove or disprove here. Given the complexity of time travel, for them both to arrive at the same conclusion that may possibly be impossible, without discussion, does not make sense. If your characters jump straight to C without going through A and B, especially for complex problems, then that doesn't make sense.

  He only needs to conclude that if it is indeed possible to look into the future, confirm Harry-survival and execute a dastardly plot (surprising though that possibility may be), then any such dastardly plot can be avoided by making sure that there is no stable time loop where Quirrell sees Harry surviving after a plot.

So you are saying that Harry concluded that, even though his hypothesis for how the universe functions may be impossible, making that guess for how Quirrell operates invalid. Without thinking it through and going through some experimentation or research. Nope, that's illogical and irrational. Why didn't he jump to the conclusion that Quirrell had implanted a tracking device in him and was monitoring him through spy satellites?
