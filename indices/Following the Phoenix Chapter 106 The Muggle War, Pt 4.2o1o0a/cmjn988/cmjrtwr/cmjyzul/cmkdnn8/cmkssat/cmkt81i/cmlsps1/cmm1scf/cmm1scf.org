  So basically you had two of your characters suddenly and independently arrive at a brand new (at least to the reader) conclusion on the nature of time, time travel, and the universe. In the middle of a chapter.

No, I had two characters, one of which has a /lot/ of experience with time travel and the other of which has read a lot of science fiction, presented with a given successful use of time travel.

Harry does not need to conclude "oh, then time travel must work like this"; he doesn't need to draw conclusions about the likelihood of succesfully retrieving information from the future. He /only/ needs to conclude that if it is indeed possible to look into the future, confirm Harry-survival and execute a dastardly plot (surprising though that possibility may be), then any such dastardly plot can be avoided by making sure that there is no stable time loop where Quirrell sees Harry surviving after a plot.
