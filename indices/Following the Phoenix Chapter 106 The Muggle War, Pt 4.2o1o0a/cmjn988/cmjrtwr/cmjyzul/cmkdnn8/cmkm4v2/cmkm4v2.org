Huh, I wouldn't have guessed you planned to go with a computable model. You realize that this means either the universe is a simulation, or that magic is maintaining a powerful simulation forward in time. One problem you have is that your source of magic/computer simulation also needs to isolate information of time travelers from affecting their environment. Considering chaos theory and butterfly effects, a slight shift in the atmosphere from a time traveler may result in someone unrelated to the time loop acting differently 5 hours later. Does your system simply isolate these variables? Also, what about prophecies? Their existence implies much longer length stable time loops, or something with tremendous modeling and predictive capacity over reality.

I would have gone with an uncomputable model. Stable time loops simply exist. However, there are some kind of meta-rules which determine what stable time loops are more likely to exist in the first place. If Harry had forced a hard precommitment on himself he might have raised his probability high enough to make his time-turner experiment work. The meta-rules combined with how humans make decisions result in "DO NOT MESS WITH TIME" messages being the most probable outcome when paradoxes might otherwise arise. There is no hard limit on time travel, but a time-turner that goes longer than 6 hours would result in paradoxes too often and just spit out "NO" messages most of the time (with a small chance of working longer under the right circumstances.). Prophecies work by the same mechanism.
