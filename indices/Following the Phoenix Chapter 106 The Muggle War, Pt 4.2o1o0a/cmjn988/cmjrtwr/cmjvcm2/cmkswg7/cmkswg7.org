Ha, no, I claimed that I don't think that the situation presented fits into the time travel rules stated in HPMOR. I did not decide that the model is impossible to create, I said that I don't see a how this would fit into the HPMOR model.

And I still think that it wouldn't. There would have to be severe limitations and huge assumptions made to assume this - for example the absence of free will and pretty much the existence of fate, since this means that the entire universe can be pre-computed since its creation.
