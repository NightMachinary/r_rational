  Harry during his prank was not making decisions based on information from the future, and was not pruning possible timelines.

Stealing this idea. This would mean that Harry's prime number factorization failed because he was making decisions about what numbers to write down based on what number's he received. Also, I said it wrong in my post, the actual space he was exploring was all odd 3 digit number, so a space of 450*450=201601 possible outcomes 1/201601 odds of success. This still doesn't rule out a more decent success rate for more confined solution spaces.

If Harry could find an algorithm that didn't involve such a huge space of decisions, it would have a better chance of working. Hmm... already got an experimental test. Open the envelope, multiply the numbers or do nothing if "NO". If the numbers multiply to the answer, send the number back, if not send "NO". If the odds of timeline stability are determined by the decision space, this algorithm has a 50% chance of success, if determined by information sent back, it has a tiny probability of working (1/201601 or something tiny like that).
