The prime number factorization give a larger amount of information directly back to itself. This makes the timeloops very unlikely compared to "DO NOT MESS WITH TIME" messages. Checking for Harry and nothing else restricts the amount of information and makes the timeloop more stable.

So basically with my model, time loops become more unlikely the more information you try to loop back on itself. At some point (at least by the information of two prime numbers) the loop becomes very improbable. Quirrel checking for Harry alive or dead is basically one bit of information and he allows for false positives, so maybe even less than that. There are 143 3-digit prime number, which means there are 143*143=20449 combination, log base 2 of 20499=14.32. Thus Harry's prime number requires 15 bits of information to loop back on itself. Somewhere between 1 bit of information and 15 bits of information there is a point where loops start to become very unlikely. For Harry's prime number factorization to work, he needs a pre-commitment strong enough to make a 1/20499 event the most likely.

Consider Harry's time turner prank on himself, some pretty complicated time loops are possible, it is just given human decision making and the quantity of information involved they are unlikely. The fact that the time turner prank worked could mean that under unusual circumstances, what seem like improbable loops are probable because people are making decisions differently.

*Edit: If I were to make a simple model a given time loop has 1/2^{number of bits of information} odds of success. Thus Quirrel's usage in Following the Phoenix has a 50% chance of working each time, with the other 50% giving false warning for killing Harry. Tricks like prime number factorization would almost never work with this model. If Harry can come up with hashes for 1, 2, and 3 bits of information, he could test this pretty quickly. The 1 bit would work 50% of the time, 2 bits would work 25% of the time, 3 bit 12.5%. He could then introduce other factors, like trying to strengthen his precomittments or passing the information through someone that doesn't understand it in order to see if it still counts as information for the purposes of time loops (if it doesn't, it might explain how his prank on himself was possible).
