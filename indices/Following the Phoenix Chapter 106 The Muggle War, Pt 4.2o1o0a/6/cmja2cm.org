When they were connecting up the children with blue lines, all I could think of would be the harder you make it to kill yourself, the more tough Quirrell can be.

Whereas if they all publicly lined themselves up in the middle of Trafalgar Square with muggles surrounding them and guns pointing at them then Quirrell would have a tough time perpetuating anything because Harry needs to rule the world with Muggles too.

That is the solution seems to be if one persons dies they all should die (or at least Harry).

Edit: Also I'm not sure if I'm naive, but I would hope that in a 1st world country people aren't that quick to vitriol. After seeing bodies of their own dead I would expect most people would decry the whole war not just be like "Eye for an eye", examples are surely 9/11. There wasn't even 95% support for the war after that, and that was way worse than this. [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_opinion_in_the_United_States_on_the_invasion_of_Iraq#October_2002][Source]], and in this case it's literally bodies of children after two days on both sides. I mean a nuke was launched within 24 hours of first contact (well Ministry contact), surely the vast majority of people are just reacting to this, and most people aren't even affected.

Someone should make a timeline of these events.

I'm a bit confused as to the scale of this, the way it seems to be written literally the whole country is rioting, and that's far worse than anything the wizards have done. Imports and exports grind to a halt, no more air travel or sea travel to or from the UK, the whole infrastructure breaks, people begin to starve, electricity stops, etc. If no one is going to work the economy just won't be functioning.

Again, I'm not really sure why the people of Glasgow would be rioting because an orphanage in Wales was burned. And the amount of deaths in the UK seems extremely small comparative to the population. Interesting that we haven't seen or heard of any effects due to the dementors wiping out 0.1% of the entire population.
