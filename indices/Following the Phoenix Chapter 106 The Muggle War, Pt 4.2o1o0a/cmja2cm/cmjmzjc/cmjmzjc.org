  Whereas if they all publicly lined themselves up in the middle of Trafalgar Square with muggles surrounding them and guns pointing at them then Quirrell would have a tough time perpetuating anything because Harry needs to rule the world with Muggles too.

Exactly. My suggestion is that Hermione should have just teleported all the students to the UN headquarters in Geneva, and started demanding international mediation. But at least they moved the muggle attackers to the Hague.

  Edit: Also I'm not sure if I'm naive, but I would hope that in a 1st world country people aren't that quick to vitriol.

Good point. It took months for Fox News and a bunch of other outlets to stir up enough support for a war. And that was an abstract war, in Iraq, one where the first Gulf war was quite successful, and that didn't touch anything.

Even though the danger here is more immediate, there are too few wizards to be that big of a deal. More people die in car crashes every day in UK than could die from wizards attacks. There would need to be a large publicity campaign and effort to get people to organize like this.
