  And the amount of deaths in the UK seems extremely small comparative to the population. Interesting that we haven't seen or heard of any effects due to the dementors wiping out 0.1% of the entire population.

The dementors of UK had been destroyed already by Hermione (except the last one which was destroyed by Harry). UK doesn't have dementor-caused fatalities, unlike probably most other countries in the world.
