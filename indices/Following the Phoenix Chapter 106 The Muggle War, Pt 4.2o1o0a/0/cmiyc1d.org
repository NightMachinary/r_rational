  "[The Dark Lord wanted] the attack on Hogwarts, certainly. It is well-placed to lead us into a war with Muggles, and yet keep all the tensions local to Britain."

I'm curious as to what other muggle nations think about a nuclear weapon being used on the UK so soon after the Cold War. The Soviet Union is gone, but post-soviet states still have their weapons and resources, and so do the Americans, and so do all the European nations in firing range of someone willing to use nukes. Just /moving/ nuclear weapons has caused international incidents that nearly destroyed the planet.
