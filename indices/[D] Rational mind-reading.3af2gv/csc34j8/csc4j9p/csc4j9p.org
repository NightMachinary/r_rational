I generally agree, but thinking about these things can be good for adding in some details to sell your premise. If you have a form of mind-reading that works on "surface thoughts", and you have some relevant scientific literature to back it up, you can describe exactly what different modes of thinking "look like" to your protagonist.

(Much in the same way that you can "sell" New York City a lot easier than you can sell a fantasy city, because you can just look at New York City and borrow some images that you see there rather than having to make things up.)
