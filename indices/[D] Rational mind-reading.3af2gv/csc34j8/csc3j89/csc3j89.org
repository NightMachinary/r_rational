Absolutely, but what makes world design in science fiction fun for me is figuring out the nuts and bolts of how such SoD tokens work. Having the mechanism mapped not only provides the quirks and limitations that keep a story interesting, it can also lead directly to plot points and possibilities I would have never even imagined if I just leaned back and said "A wizard did it".

That's what I'm trying to achieve: Inspiration via conceptual understanding.
