When I hear questions like this on computer forums, usually my first response is "Step back. What are you trying to achieve?"

If you're trying to write a rational story in which a character has a mindreading ability, you don't need to know the details, you just need to create a setting where there is a plausible explanation. Every story is allowed one Suspension of Disbelief token--but /only/ one[1]--that it gets to spend on its main premise. Any of these would work:

- Scientists have spent fifty years building up a database of brainscans of everyone on the planet in realtime as they aged and then supercomputers did frequency and traffic analysis in order to determine correlations so as a result we can read thought-images in real time, although we can't read memories.
- An alien crashlanded on Earth. His Universal Translator is damaged but semi-functional, and....
- We have this person who has this ability. We don't know how it works but it very clearly does.\\
