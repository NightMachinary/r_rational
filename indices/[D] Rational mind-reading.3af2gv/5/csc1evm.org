I suspect that a form of frequency analysis might give a degree of accuracy. Looking at a snapshot of someone's mindstate may not be of use, but monitoring it over months or years as they are subject to various inputs and deliver outputs could allow some solid guesses as to what a mind is perceiving or even contemplating.

It might even be possible to read off an image that the mind is specifically concentrating on, if it activates a suitable number of neurons in the visual cortex.
