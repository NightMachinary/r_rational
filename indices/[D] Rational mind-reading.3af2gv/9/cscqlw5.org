What about test patterns? Like, a telepath broadcasts a certain signal into the target's brain, analyzes the resulting pattern, and when they can predict the result, uses that as a method of backtracking signals, or even just pinging words and images off various regions and interpreting the associations. Not quite quite mind-readin, but enough for surface reading and figuring out that "Johnny" brings up memories of hatred, guilt, blood, anticipation, and regret.
