Why are you modeling mind reading as reading the electrical\chemical structure of neurons in the brain firing?

Thats like trying to figure out the password stored in ram from a computer by reading EM radiation\heat coming out of it when it's running, sure it might be possible, but its overly complex for no reason, you could just freeze the ram stick and connect it to another computer, as long as it has similar design there's a pretty good chance it will be able to read the content, even if one ran on linux and the other was running windows..

You could imagine it more like an actual neural link between the person doing the mind reading and the person being read. Or lets say a copy of the neurons of the person being read being connected to the mind of the reader, obviously neurons can communicate with each other, so i wouldn't really say that it is stretching it too far to assume that if such a neural connection was made the reader will be able to read the state.
