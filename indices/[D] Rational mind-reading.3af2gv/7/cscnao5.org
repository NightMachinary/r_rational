There's always evolution. There are some truly bizarre evolutionary pathways creatures have taken. If your 'suspension of disbelief' token is that Neanderthals were able to read each other's minds (They did have a different brain configuration), and humans were able to cross breed with them (Which is true), then, well, in the right circumstances, the trait for mind reading might breed true in humans even to this date if the right genetics were passed.
