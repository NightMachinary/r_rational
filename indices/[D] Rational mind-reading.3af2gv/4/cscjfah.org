If I were trying to create a mind-reader without breaking neuroscience too badly, I'd have their ability tap into the "area" theorized to be the internal/self monitor, responsible for metacognition. I say "area" because, as far as I know, this is one of our higher cognitive functions, intimately tied to consciousness, and at this point, very poorly understood (i.e. it's somewhere in the prefrontal cortex, probably)- which leaves it more open to your fictional fiddling and interpretation than, say the visual cortex or other parts of the 'animal' brain. You could, for example, claim that it not only receives input from the senses and listens in on the internal monologue, but maybe when memories are recalled they are presented before the monitor. And maybe because the monitor's 'job' is to take all of these neurochemical inputs and observe and understand what they are in the mind it is /in/, it might do the same job for the mind-reader, whose special, extra listening power connects their monitor to others'.
