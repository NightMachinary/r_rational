hmm. that sounds plausible, but must a human mind-reader go through the whole "neuron->waveform" rigamarole? it seems to me that in this sense we can model a brain as a sort of advanced black-box encryption mechanism, and with an audio output that's a big problem. however, if what you want isn't unencrypted in the first place -- if you're perceiving a pattern of neurons firing /anyway/ -- can't you cut out the middle man? couldn't a mind-reader just superimpose whatever relevant patterns the subject is experiencing over their /own/ brain?
