That only works if the mind-reader's brain is similar enough that a) it can support the same pattern, and b) they translate to (roughly) the same subjective experiences. Also, I'd argue that mind-reading is a lot more practical if it doesn't just consist of replacing (parts of) your mind with theirs.
