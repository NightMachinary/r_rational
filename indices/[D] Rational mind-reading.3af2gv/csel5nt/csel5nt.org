There is apparently some hardware that allows thought transference between brains [[http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/scientists-transmit-thoughts-brain/story?id=25319813][here]].

Apparently the words thought in one brain as a command translate in a feeling or urge in the recipient, bypassing the need to translate. I guess in effect the brain is translating for you, crudely. A Harvard team in the article did transmit specific words.

Theoretically, a mind-reading mechanism would need to pick up the EEG from the recipient somehow. You may need to handwave this with a powerful signal that is currently undetectable or is the result of a some future development. In addition, your theoretical telepath would need some biological or mechanical apparatus to pick up signals, as well as enough experience to unravel the thoughts of various people (which is achievable through training). Perhaps the theoretical telepath would need to spend more time around people learning to interpret their thought patterns or adjusting her receiver.
