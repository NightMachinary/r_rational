Read what i said more carefully. I did not say its not possible(btw the ram as opposed to the screen is significantly less em active..) But instead i said that it is overly complex, and that there are easier ways to get the same result.

Also regarding the "credible threat" you mentioned, a quote regarding tempest attacks from the top reault on google: "However it's painfully hard and extremely expensive to successfully complete such an attack".

I.e. for most points and purposes setting up a successful tempest attack is more expensive then the data you will get with it

Anyhow the attack i was thanking about while writing the example was [[http://www.tau.ac.il/%7Etromer/acoustic/][http://www.tau.ac.il/~tromer/acoustic/]] if you are interested.
