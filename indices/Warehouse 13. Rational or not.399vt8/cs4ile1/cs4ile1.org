No, the show is almost completely irrational. There was potential with the idea, but it was never taken anywhere. In fact, the use of artifacts within the show was almost explicitly "mystical" in the sense that they should not and cannot be understood.

What I mean by this is that the effects of the artifacts were somewhat known, but causes and reasons were never investigated. In fact, there is a suggestion that they either should not be investigated or could not be. (Either suggestion would be irrational.)

In addition to this problem, the setup of the world itself is unlikely. If their behavior is at all common then the world should have been destroyed a long time ago. But if the world was not destroyed, then that behavior would not be tolerated. This also applies to the other safety and methodological conclusions others have mentioned.
