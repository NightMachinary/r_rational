Not rational. The closest thing to Rational W13 was the alternate timeline with what's-his-name running it as a scientific lab. And that version was flat out evil.

Basically, I'd like to have seen a non evil version of /THAT/.

As is, other than that there wasn't much of any sign of anyone going "hey, let's figure out how all this artifacting is going on, let's study these things, see how they actually work."

I mean, some of that was implied to have happened at /SOME/ point in history, given some of the tech/etc that the Warehouse had access to... but there was nothing at all about an active research division, etc etc.
