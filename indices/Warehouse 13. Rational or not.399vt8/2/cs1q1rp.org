The lack of any major artifact creation munchkinry by anyone seemed like a missing piece, especially since we saw the process of creation at least once in the show. There was also very little on the way of researching the specifics of how artifacts work and are created in any sort of scientific manner, which may or may not be possible, but it wasn't shown being attempted.
