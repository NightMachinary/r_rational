100% this.

I watched it on the reccomendation of a friend who described it as "SCP lite". The first episode alone had my eyebrows twitching in annoyance. The behavior of the Warehouse's agents when handling Artifacts should have gotten them killed a dozen times over at least, and if they had survived the mission by some stroke of luck, demoted to D-class and set to cleaning 173's room.
