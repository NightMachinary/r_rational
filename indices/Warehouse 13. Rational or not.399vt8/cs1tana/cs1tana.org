Hell no. Half the episodes' threats are caused by absolutely dreadful handling of artifacts. Sometimes, highly dangerous items fall off *shelves* with *no guardrails*, right next to countless *other* highly dangerous items that can react to each other. The warehouse would've gone up in flames centuries ago, possibly taking all of Earth with it.

That aside, the artifacts operate on magic and "powers as the plot demands". You can't understand them, you can only rely on the technobabble the "smart" characters spout from some font of inner knowledge.

Not that the characters have much curiosity either, or sense of self-preservation. Nobody says "hey, maybe we should put some guardrails on this thing". People lie to each other, fail or refuse to communicate for contrived reasons, misuse artifacts, steal artifacts, *play* with artifacts, and utterly fail at the evil overlord list. They spend most of their on-screen time [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableBehaviorTropes][juggling balls]].
