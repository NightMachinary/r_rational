Okay this is entirely outside my wheelhouse- you want some kind of machine-learning implementable definition of rational fiction?

I don't know if that's really possible even in the abstract. Ratfic isn't really a genre, it can cross virtually any medium- it's more like a tag on existing genres. The only shared quality is that the character's behavior seems thoughtful and informed, given the rules of whatever world they exist in. You could do some kind of parsing for written speech and thought that have higher "Thoughtfulness" scores, I guess? Beyond that, a certain amount of genre-awareness seems pretty common, maybe you could cross-reference against tvtropes articles to find significant matches?
