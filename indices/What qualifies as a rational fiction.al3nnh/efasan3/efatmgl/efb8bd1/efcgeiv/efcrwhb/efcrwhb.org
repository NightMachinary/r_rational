I don't know think I quite understand what you're trying to say. But a rational fiction is supposed to be that a rotional/NPC styles agent who, with the information he has and his personality as previously established, makes the choices that he makes naturally, not to advance the plot forcefully. A more common rational story that we usually encounter on this sub is that the agent is rational, and he is supposed to make the rational decision with the information he has, but some stories do not take into account personality, emotions when those decisions are made but they still seem to fit the mold. I don't know, the requirements for rational fiction are not very rigid.
