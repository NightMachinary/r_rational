You have posed this question in a weird way. it seems you are two steps further in your thought process than where your understanding of definitions are. You are asking the question in terms of Neuro-Linguistic Programming and Hierarchical Temporal Memories when you should be asking it in simpler ways. What about the standard definitions of rational fiction are you not understanding, or do not satisfy a coherent idea to you?
