*The Intention* To create a coherent interesting story in which a protagonist overcomes obstacles in a way devoid of cheap author tricks. Where cheap author tricks can include the protag luckily stumbling upon an item or person that they need or the protag remembering something integral to the plot, before unknown to the reader, that they were told as a child. There are lots of these tricks out there and I'm sure you can think of more of them.

*The Realization* Lets observe hpmor. We know exactly how the protag processes information (We are given a list of books from which he references). The protag will not have any 'secret knowledge' by which to judge things that are unknown to the reader. The actions of the protag are completely understandable if we know how they think and what input is given to them.

Another way to think about it. is a rational protag can be seen as a function f(x). If they are truly rational we can understand that function and when given input 'x' from the environment (literary universe) it is entirely possible to know what the outcome of the function is before the author writes it.

I could probably whittle this down a lil more if you want, but thats all imna write for now.
