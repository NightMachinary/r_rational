Categories of rational story, fitting whatever definition of "rational" you want to use: - written by an author who wanted to write a rational story - written by an author who didn't want to write a rational story, but did anyways - written by an author who didn't consider whether or not they wanted to write a rational story

The same categories apply for irrational fiction.

Thus, we have a 2x3 grid of

#+begin_example
    [irrational, irrational]
  x [wanted to and did, didn't want to but did, didn't consider wants]
#+end_example

Whether a story is rational or not is separate from whether or not the author intended to write a rational story, much the same as whether someone intended to write a work without with or without using the letter 'z'. The story has a 'z' in it no matter what the author's intent was.
