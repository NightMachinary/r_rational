  Some people also don't count Worm as rational because it tries to construct a rational powers system for its predetermined setting of Superheroes vs Supervillains rather than construct a setting based on the existence of powers. Though I don't quite understand or agree with that perspective.

Although Ward seems to be less popular than Worm with the [[/r/rational]] community (for what I think are fairly petty reasons - the protagonist is less of a stereotypical ratfic protagonist than Taylor in terms of personality), it seems like it would actually be /likelier/ to qualify as rational by this standard - the superheroes/supervillains dynamic seems to be breaking down now that the factors enforcing it have changed.
