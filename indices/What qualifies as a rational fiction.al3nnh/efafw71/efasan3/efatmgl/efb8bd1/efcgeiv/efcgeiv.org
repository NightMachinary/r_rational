I'm just going to try and pen down my dissection to the problem, or at least what I've gathered till now:\\
The agents in HpMor act in order to achieve a certain end-goal.\\
Compare that to an agent of a different fictional narrative where they act in a certain way which doesn't really convey a targeted end-goal, but rather suggests them being part of a plot device by which the Author is trying to capture/project/portray a certain insight/philosophy to their story.\\
Therefore, a rational agent(a character in a story/author) acts towards an intended end goal, whereas an NPC styled agent/story reacts to the happenstances about them which don't really seem to have an endpoint, or the way that brings forth the endpoint seems convoluted and too deus ex machina-ey.
