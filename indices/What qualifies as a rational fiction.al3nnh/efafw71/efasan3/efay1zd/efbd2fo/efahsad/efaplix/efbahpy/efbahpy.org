"Every story at least makes sense to the author." Is exactly the kind of optimistic overestimate that comes from somebody who hasn't read enough stories. The driving force behind rational fiction is that, if you take a vanilla story, no bits and bobs, and then run a simple sanity check on it, /it will fail/. There are very few stories that are internally self-consistent in a way that suggests the author seriously comprehended what they were writing in its entirety. And if we check back in on reality, that fits our intuitions - a novel is a /really large/ piece of information. You couldn't ask an author to recount their own novel word-for-word, and they wrote it, so it makes sense that they encounter problems with scale and consistency.

(I understand the assertion that "every story makes sense to the author" - you're saying that, if it hadn't made sense, they wouldn't have come up with it. But you have to understand that creativity in humans is /a lot/ like the generative processes neural networks engage in - until we refine our criteria of a valid output to include certain parameters, our output won't be consistent with those parameters. If the act of writing is divorced completely from the act of scrutinizing writing, then it makes sense that stories won't hold up to scrutiny. They weren't made to.)

New Criticism founder I.A. Richards once postulated [[https://sites.google.com/site/rushblugerman/i-a-richards---four-layers-of-meaning][four layers of meaning]]: literal context, mood, tone, and intent. These were framed from the perspective of the critic - for the typical author, these proceses are unknown to them, and thus largely automatic. However, while mood, tone, and intent are all greatly important to a story's critical reception (think of all of the accolades a novel gets where it is described as "thrilling" or "deeply symbolic") and thus authors learn how to communicate with them, the literal meaning of a story is often overlooked. This leads to lots of popular stories that are really good at eliciting emotions in readers but not very good at convincing readers of their reality, in the same way that a textbook presents its own contents as reality.

That isn't to say that popular stories have no logical consistency, just that their authors aren't optimizing for logical consistency. Rational fiction doesn't really propose optimizing for logical consistency either - instead, its main goal is to eliminate the /most common/ and /most stupid/ ways that stories become logically inconsistent, by plucking a lot of the low hanging fruit. The most naive way to do this is to read through the story, one event at a time, and ask yourself "does this make sense?" the same way that a hungry youtube theorist would ask the question, and then give the story element a pass if it survives five minutes of scrutiny. For more important elements, bump that level of scrutiny up to ten or twenty minutes, because those are the parts of the story attention is going to naturally be drawn to. Rational fiction as defined in the sidebar is a bit more advanced - it gives a set of heuristics for asserting rationality that will work unaccompanied by this kind of scrutiny (although, of course, you should still think things through anyway).

I hope at least one of the definitions there (or their aggregate) answers your question.
