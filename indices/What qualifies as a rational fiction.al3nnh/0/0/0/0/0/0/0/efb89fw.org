There is plenty of good fiction that simply isn't written to be rational, and that doesn't necessarily imply inability to do so on the author's part.

For example, fantasy stories with soft magic systems such as Lord of the Rings. I am sure many of the authors of such books could write a hard magic system if they were interested in doing so.

Some people also don't count Worm as rational because it tries to construct a rational powers system for its predetermined setting of Superheroes vs Supervillains rather than construct a setting based on the existence of powers. Though I don't quite understand or agree with that perspective.
