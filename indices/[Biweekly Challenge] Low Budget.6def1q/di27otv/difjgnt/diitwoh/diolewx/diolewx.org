I loved the story, but I agree that the "dual clever answers" kind of clashed. Like, it was cool to figure out that Ashley and Tom were demons, but ultimately made no difference in the end (other than to allow Graff to impress the rector); they could have figured out the waiting part either way.

If the test /did/ end in success when all the demons were found, then (a) the focus would have been on Graff's deduction abilities, and (b) it would have allowed Graff to locate all possible demons (after Ashley and Tom are voted out, if the test didn't end, they could have had Graff and Josh vote for Pvetre and Veera vote against).
