It isn't possible to figure out with 100% certainty who the demons are with the information the test takers have. If you grant the assumptions Graff mentions (most importantly, no human conspirators and no demons planted months before), it still isn't possible to be 100% sure that you've identified all the demons, but it's possible to identify Ashley and Tom as demons. The real trick, though, is noticing that the Rector didn't actually say that you pass if you correctly identify a demon. He just says that "the test is over" in that case. (Ashley misquotes him to try and trick everyone into holding a vote, because the "correct" answer is not to hold a vote at all.)

One of the things I kind of dislike about this story is that there are a bunch of clever things stepping on each other's toes. I think if I were doing this again I would pick one clever thing to be the "answer" (probably either "there can be more than one demon" or "the correct answer is not to vote"), change the statement of the rules to be more clear-cut, and remove ~2000 words.
