Not the biggest fan; but still well done.

I was hung up on the single-demon problem; that's probably my bad.

But I also don't trust people's memories. I mean, if you had everyone assign their belief in their memory's accuracy, the coffeeshop and the rally would be of suspicion. Pvetre shows strong belief in the existence of Veera, but Ashley only has a (relatively) weak belief in the existence of Pvetre. And Ashley <-> Tom and Josh <-> Graff, so I would have picked Pvetre.

I also didn't anticipate the rector having planted the demon months/years before, but that would only invalidate the photo of Veera.
