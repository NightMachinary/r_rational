A graph in the CS sense ([[http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/%7Esheard/course/Cs163/Graphics/graph4.png][http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~sheard/course/Cs163/Graphics/graph4.png]]). When I was first writing the story I had him drawing graphs on the board while he was explaining things, but I cut that because it was too hard to draw in non-monospaced ASCII art. In retrospect I probably should have considered renaming him at that point.
