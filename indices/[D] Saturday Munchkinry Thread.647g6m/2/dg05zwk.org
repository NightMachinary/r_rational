You have the ability to memorize long strings of text (plus images/illustrations) at a glance, and play them back to yourself at high speed, which is similar to skimming in that you can pick out relevant concepts as you find them. You can also study them with an effort level similar to if you read them manually but without the inconvenience of having to turn the pages or have the book physically present.

You can thus basically load books into your mental 'inventory', without necessarily understanding their contents. You can do this with as many books as you want, but they won't be useful in terms of skills and knowledge until you actually spend time 'reading' their contents and forming relevant mental associations.

Even if you haven't read the book properly, there are things you can do which are based on imagination plus what you can do with a real book. You can alter a copy of the memorized book by adding highlighting, creating alphabetized indexes, visualizing animated illustrations, and so on. This doesn't harm the original memorized copy, so you can still refer back to it as needed. You can look things up by page number, and you can also do text searches.
