Well, I'd see a small improvement in most everyday tasks that require recalling stuff, though the ease and speed of recall might be roughly comparable to googling (or even worse with sufficiently advanced google-fu). Most useful with respect to learning would probably be the storage and easy-access of my own notes, but that's more because I've not quite gotten around to digitizing them.

If I were still taking classes, I might be able to take more and harder classes and do better in them (maybe, IDK, back in college I wasn't limited in this regard by memorization/recall but more by other things).

The best application I can come up with would be trivia -- you'd have a huge advantage in game shows like /Jeopardy/ or /Who Wants to be a Millionaire/, moreso in ones that give you plenty of time to "think".

More fancifully, you can become a spy and copy down paper documents at a glance, though not any better than a really tiny camera lol. Maybe it would be useful on those jobs where they search you for wires and stuff before letting you see their top-secret documents.
