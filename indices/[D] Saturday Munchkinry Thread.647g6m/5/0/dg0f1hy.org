You can control the person you kill leading to their death ( light made a guy paint a pentagram and message he did not come up with) so...

Target unscrupulous rich people but have them donate all their money to research and charities of my choice before offing themselves. Do the same to dictators and regimes I don't like and additionally have them release the names and faces of everyone in the chain of command along with incriminating evidence.
