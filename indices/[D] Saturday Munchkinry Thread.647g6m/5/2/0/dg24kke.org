RE: animals, I too am not familiar with the workings of Death Notes (I tried watching it, made it ~10 episodes in, but found it too boring to continue), but what does it count as a "human" (it does explicitly specify "human" [[http://deathnote.wikia.com/wiki/Rules_of_the_Death_Note][here]], with perhaps slightly weaker assumptions that they have faces, hearts, etc.)? Can I just get some lumper taxonomists to expand /Homo/ to something much broader, or are deathNoteverse metaphysics such that /humans/ have some special ectoplasm demarcating them from other life? If I have two identical twins with the same name and I use the death note on one, does the other also die? What about people with artificial hearts, or the recipients of face transplants, or those in permanent vegetative state or w/e.

My thinking is not to use people, but rather human skin cultures shaped into little faces and attached to little hearts. You could probably fit one per cubic cm or less.

And given page limits (or not, the wiki makes it sounds like there's inconsistency), are there limits as to how tiny your font can be? Can text be machine written?
