So with the death note, the neat thing about it is that you can specify the cause of death, no matter how unlikely. Just find some good targets, and say stuff like "target is killed when an exceptionally thick stack of papers proving P=NP is dropped on his head." Or "target is killed by tripping over a functioning cold-fusion reactor and banging his head against the ground."
