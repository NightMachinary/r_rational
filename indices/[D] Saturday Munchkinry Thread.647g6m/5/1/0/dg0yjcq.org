A near-perfect example of how SV/SB, despite instantly hating anything branding itself as "rational", are actually completely fine with rational!fic which doesn't explicitly bill itself at such. Yet more evidence of motivated cognition at work. (Not that more evidence was really /needed/, but it never hurts.)
