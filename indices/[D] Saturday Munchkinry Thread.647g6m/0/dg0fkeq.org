You are given a cardboard box and told that one week from now, the box and all of its contents will be transported 500 years into the past.

*RULES:*

- The box is a cardboard cube, roughly half a meter on each side.

- The box is moved in time, but not moved much in space. The time travel mechanism has a minimal level of intelligence, so everything is relative to Earth, and it will try to put the box somewhere where it will fit and can be supported. If the box's exact location would put it inside a solid object, it materializes somewhere nearby.

- The box can only appear where no one is looking.

- As such, you can choose where the box appears, but only if you can travel there (or have the box transported there) in the present. It would be advisable, therefore, to keep the weight to something you can lift.

- You can put anything into the box which you can get access to within the time limit.

- The box needs to be able to closed in order to go back in time. If you dump a huge stack of books into the box such that the lid cannot close, nothing happens at the end of the week.

What do you put in the box, and where do you put it, to have the greatest positive impact on the course of history?
