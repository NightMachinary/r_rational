  o transmit information using entangled particles, you also have to communicate along some other channel,
#+end_quote

The difference is that for quantum entanglement, you have to communicate across normal channels at the same time as you communicate across the superluminal channel. For what I'm proposing, you can just determine an encoding method in advance. Yes, you still need to get someone somewhere subluminally, but after that you're in the clear.

Imagine a crew taking a 4-year trip to somewhere half a lightyear away. If you tell encode a message in a string of deaths, then they're getting that message three and a half a lightyear earlier than sending that message through pulses of light, which is usefully FTL.

The main problem with this system is just that communication is one-way rather than two ways. (And of course, the fact that it's only usable when you get bunch of people further than 40 light seconds away, but that's an engineering issue.)
