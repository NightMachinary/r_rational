This is the problem here. It's rather reminiscent of the reason you can't exploit quantum entanglement for superluminal communication: to transmit information using entangled particles, you /also/ have to communicate along some other channel, which limits the effective speed of communication back down to subluminal velocities. Likewise, the Death Note may kill without regard for distance, but you can't use the deaths of random people near you to deduce anything without having first established who your partner is going to kill, what a particular death means, etc.--all of which requires sublight communication.
