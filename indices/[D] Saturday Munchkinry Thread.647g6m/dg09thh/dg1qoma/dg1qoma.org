I don't know the exact math involved but I t you can send information to the past using death notes to communicate FTL, I'm not sure how exactly you have to set up things to do that( and I would really appreciate if someone more knowledgeable about relativity explained the details of how to make time machines once you have faster than light travel). For maximizing information sent a future civilization could create a creature that can transmit a lot of information effectively in ways easy to manipulate for the death note, and can be easily revived , that way you can maximize the information sent while minimizing the usage of the death note( I haven't seen the show in a long time but I think the number of pages was limited).

If I actually had a death note the first thing I would do is see if it works on animals because then I can experiment without having to kill people .
