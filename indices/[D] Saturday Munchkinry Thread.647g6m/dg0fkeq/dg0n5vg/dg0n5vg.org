Volume of the box is .125 m^{3,} volume of a person in liters is approx. equal to weight in kg...my immediate response is to recruit a thin contortionist (59 kg -> 59 liters -> .059 m^{3)} , and spend the week planning around having a person with present-day knowledge appear five hundred years in the past. Fill in the extra space in the box with whatever supplies they will require (good first steps are things like a phone with a copy of wikipedia and a solar charger).
