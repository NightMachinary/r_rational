Hmmmm.

...brief research leads me to a mathematician called Luca Pacioli, who died in 1517 (probably around June). I therefore propose to find out where he lived, and arrange for the box to appear in his attic or otherwise among his possessions, presumably after his death. I plan to insert into it a number of manuscripts detailing mathematical discoveries that were, in our timeline, not made for some years after his death - ideally, largely opening up new fields but leaving obvious and interesting questions unanswered as a goad to future research, but realistically probably a few dozen sixteenth- and seventeenth-century papers in their entirety. (And maybe a couple of more modern ones, too).

Luca gets a lot of questions asked, especially about how he got his printing so neat and regular, but it's posthumous and so no-one can answer them. The advances in mathematics push through a general advance in science and technology to the present day. That... should be good, right?
