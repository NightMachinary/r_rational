You have two magic systems with their own distinct ways of being, one of which is heavily rules-based (or at least has clear rules presented to the reader), while the other is more wishy-washy (or at least doesn't have clear rules presented to the reader). [paragraph-long digression on hard and soft magics being a reader-facing distinction goes here] Because hard magic systems are (generally) better at resolving conflicts and soft magic systems are better at creating conflict, you can have your protagonist use hard magic and your antagonist use soft magic.

In a Lovecraft-inspired work, you could have the Deep Ones (or whatever) be following rituals and rites that the main character and the reader doesn't understand or comprehend, except that the unclear consequences of completion are Bad. The protagonist could then be following their own magic system as a contracted servitor of some eldritch being, which creates bounded problems to be worked around (hallucinations, cravings, impulse problems, lost time, lost memories, changes in qualia, what have you) and bounded effects to be harnessed.

If you wanted them in "one" system you could mix detriments and benefits, so that the former are "soft" and the latter are "hard", e.g. when you make a pact with the elder gods, you know precisely what you'll get out of it, but have only vague guesses about what price is going to be paid. Hard to do properly though, I would think.

(/The Name of the Wind/ mostly just has its different magic systems living side by side, not trying to make a point or anything, at least so far as I can recall.)
