I can definitely capture the fear of the unknown. Generally speaking there is an element of gambling with your mind and never knowing if your going to slip and fall into the abyss. People with magic are generally speaking people who see outside the 'firmament' and are changed by it. They either become psychologically destroyed or fascinated. It's akin to seeing something disturbing, and continuing to look at it because you can't get it out of your head.

In regards to the psychopathy, it's serve as a concern that does get in the way of the main character's thought. I wrote the main character as someone who is pretty conscious of their mental health and is aware of what he risks becoming. A common habit that arises from magic users that target people, is that they're very good at convincing themselves that their victims deserve what happens to them.
