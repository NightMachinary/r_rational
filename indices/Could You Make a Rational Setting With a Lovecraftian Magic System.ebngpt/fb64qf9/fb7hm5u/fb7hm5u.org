Another Lovecraft homage which could work as a rational setting is /Winter Tide/ by Ruthanna Emrys.

I don't know if you'd consider it "strongly Lovecraft," though.

The premise is that all these people being driven insane appropriated the rites and rituals of summoning from a culture who actually knew how to do them safely, and then the thieves stripped off all of the warning labels and started experimenting.

The protagonist is someone from that culture, who is trying to help the government track down a spy who might have some dangerous magic, while at the same time trying to leverage that mission to reclaim her people's stolen stuff, which is being held at Miskatonic.

As far as quality goes, I'd definitely read a sequel.
