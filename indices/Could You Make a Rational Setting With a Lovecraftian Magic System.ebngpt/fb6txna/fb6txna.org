I don't think the magic system is necessarily a rational part at all.

If the "magic" is simply "go ask a crazy and capricious being to lend you a hand with a thing" you might of course get very inconsistent results depending on context and how you present yourself and whether it finds human appearance to be offensive.

The protagonists don't necessarily need to be rationalists themselves, they can be crazy people with delusions and everything, but the important thing is that they act like people who react to information presented to them in a believeable way.

If their mind is breaking under immense stress of their life situation or the intense tearing pain of the things they have seen, that may well be a fully rational reaction.

For example, one of the principles from the sidebar is to encourage intellectual pay-off. I don't think it's necessary that the protagonist be the one who comes up with the intellectual pay-off if he's losing his damn mind, or it could be the result of a plan he set in motion before he lost his mind, or it could simply be the the Bad Guys Win because they are serving a literally unbeatable deity and this is the story of how those who found out about the plot were powerless to stop it despite great skill and power.

As long as the rules are applied consistently (even when the rule is "the crazy eternally suffering Supergod Nupnup controls everything and does whatever his insane mind conjures up and he has yet to accidentally undo the entire planet the story takes place on") and the people are people and not just characters following a plot, and it's not boring, it may be almost hard to go wrong.

The "not boring" part being the truly challenging one.
