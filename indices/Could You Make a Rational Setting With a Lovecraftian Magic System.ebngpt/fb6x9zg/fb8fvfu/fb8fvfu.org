/Dark Wizard of Donkerk/ does, but they're not terribly Lovecraftian in nature. Sacrifism involves ritual sacrifice (requiring three parts: intent, ritual, and sacrifice) but if you're a dark wizard, then you're /usually/ just working off what you've been able to find in books, rather than conducting novel research, and so long as you stay within the bounds of those books, your sanity is never at risk any more than it would be from, say, working in a slaughterhouse, working as an executioner, or being a military commander sending men into the thresher for the Greater Good. Namely, you might worry about getting desensitized, values drift, or something akin to PTSD ... which /is/ a little Lovecraftian, I guess. The spirits that you perform these rituals "for" don't actually bargain, nor do they reveal their rituals except to those who perform them, and their motives (if any) are completely opaque. There's no temptation except that temptation of good effects at a reasonable price, no more than, say, a billionaire offering you a million dollars to cut off and eat your left hand.

Mental sacrifism is a bit different, because you're sacrificing mental things rather than physical things, happy memories instead of fingers, but not that much different, and working from the same base.

Denialism is the other one, which is even less Lovecraftian, more about continuous mental strain of modifying your behavior rather than the upfront costs of sacrifice. I'm not sure that it has an analogue, since it's much more inspired by monastic practices and religious vows. The mental effects are much different, and the flavor is "holy" rather than "dark".
