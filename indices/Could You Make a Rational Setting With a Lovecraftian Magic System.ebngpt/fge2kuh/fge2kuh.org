Your description of the magic and describing it as Lovecraftian reminds me of an interesting pair of examples from tabletop RPGs.

If you like the modern Cthulhu Mythos, you've probably played Call of Cthulhu, with its well known SAN point system of insanity and the Mythos skill, which degrades your SAN to learn. This is a fairly good system for implementing Lovecraft's vision, but it doesn't sound that much like your described rules.

A less well-known RPG, Unknown Armies, has a system which sounds much closer. (It's, like CoC, a percentile dice system, and similar in some other respects as well. But that's tangential.) It calls its insanity mechanics the Stress Tracks, and I thoroughly encourage use of them in literally any horror game of any type, with some fine-tuning for what your game cares about. Every character has five tracks; Self, Isolation, Helplessness, Violence, and Unnatural. (The number and nature of these tracks is the fine-tuning to be done.) Any extreme stressful situation has an associated track and number from 1 to 10, e.g. being attacked with a weapon is rank 1 Violence stress, watching someone you love die is rank 8 Helplessness stress, deliberately destroying everything you've risked your life to build is rank 10 Self stress. Each track has 10 Hardened marks and 5 failed marks. When you encounter stress, if you have Hardened ranks on the right track equal to its rank, you're fine. Otherwise, you roll; a success means you add one Hardened notch and a failure means you add a failed notch. Fail five notches on the same track and you go permanently insane and will fail all stress checks on that track until and unless you are cured. Fill two Hardened tracks to the top, or 28 total Hardened marks (28 = just over halfway to filling the entirety of the Hardened side), and you become a certified sociopath, which cuts you off from using the game's magic and also your "Stimuli" (Noble, Rage, and Fear) which are the way the game models the things you are most passionate about. (Going against your Stimuli, also called Passions, always causes some degree of stress on the Self track, which is the primary purpose of the Self track.)

This mechanic is light-weight enough that having it "behind the curtain" of a story doesn't impose much work on you as a writer, and if you tied it into the magic system you can get something that allows for a soft feel while still having real rules to rein you in. As an example, Greg Stolze adapted the stress track system to a Cthulhu Mythos RPG; there there is only one track, Mythos, but the skill you need to cast spells, Mythos, cannot be higher than your number of (failed+hardened) marks on the track * 5%, and experiencing a spell, including casting it, provokes Mythos stress with a rank proportional to the "size" of spell. (EDIT: My memory was slightly off, [[https://www.arcdream.com/pdf/Nemesis.pdf][PDF here (pages 18-24)]].) But adapting it to your description:

#+begin_quote
  It almost always involves doing something unpleasant or painful to get a result. It also requires an extreme amount of caution, and to be a consistent mage will eventually turn most practitioners into sociopaths. You can still be ethical and successful. However, even if your smart, you'd still have to essentially be fine with experiencing pain, slaughtering animals, using human remains and being witness to horrifying things. The Lovecraftian element definitely comes from the importance of summoning and negotiating beings that don't act rational or logical.
#+end_quote

Whatever fuel you use to power magic, it seems to be generated by things which provoke stress in unjaded (i.e. un-"Hardened") people. Undergoing torture, bloody slaughter of animals, viewing eldritch horrors. So anyone who does this frequently will quickly become somewhat jaded or "flunk out" and go nuts, and if the requirements for fuel generation scale with the scale of the magic to be carried out, anyone who does large-scale magic will go nuts or become /very/ jaded. Summoning some beings might be stress on multiple tracks at once at high ranks (e.g. seeing Yog-Sothoth and comprehending some fraction of the control and prescience he has over the entire universe sounds to me like rank-10 stress on both Unnatural and Helplessness). You might even make part of the cost /require distress from the user/, i.e. a stress check they're already Hardened to doesn't generate 'fuel'.

That's just spitballing, but hopefully illustrative spitballing. As a side note: I didn't mention anything about how you go about making the stress check, which was intentional. I would definitely not suggest rolling dice to determine how your characters handle the stress unless you are genuinely uncertain which option serves the story better and would be fine with flipping a coin for it.
