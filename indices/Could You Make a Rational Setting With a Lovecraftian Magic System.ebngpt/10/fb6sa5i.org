This sounds cool to me. This part especially:

  The Lovecraftian element definitely comes from the importance of summoning and negotiating beings that don't act rational or logical.

As for how you might use such a system without a psychopathic protagonist, well, there's a lot of options. Perhaps your protagonist is an 'ends justify the means' sort, willing go to brutal lengths to accomplish their goals but ultimately idealistic in their intention. That first one is the sort you most have to watch out for drifting into psychopath territory. Perhaps someone horrified by what they're doing, but who has some central goal which they can't accomplish by other means, meaning their choices are to either give up or to reluctantly use magic to move forward? Or someone who is well intentioned, but terminally curious... Lots of possibilities here, is the point. I don't have much experience writing, but I think any of these explanations could allow for non-psychopathic PCs if you were doing a tabletop RPG campaign for example.
