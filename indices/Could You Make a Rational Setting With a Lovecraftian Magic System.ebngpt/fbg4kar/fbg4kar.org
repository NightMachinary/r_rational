  How would you treat such a magic system in story without having a straight up psychopathic protagonist?

I honestly think it might be cool to have a story with a Psychopathic Good protagonist: perhaps they have noble utilitarian goals and throw aside conventional morality to pursue them, it could make for an interesting anti-hero type. Although it could be a problem as it makes your protagonist just look more insufferable when that's already a perceived problem with many ratfics.
