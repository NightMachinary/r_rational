Speaking of stories where the protagonist is somewhat insane and the 'insanity' is necessary to be able to use magic, [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-16978/MMcGregor+See+Noir+Evil.htm][See Noir Evil]] is a fantastic post-series Buffy fanfiction about a Xander who is not entirely sane.

It's very well-written, but it involves him going crazy due to months of torture and while it's not overly gory, it doesn't shy away from describing his trauma and fears of never being sane again, and whether or not he is experiencing reality versus a hallucination. It starts with him escaping from his captives and the first two or three chapters are a good measure of the worst the story will get with its descriptions. I recommend ignoring the last two chapters, because they appear to be meant as a fairly confusing sequel hook which never got followed up on.
