A major component of Lovecraftian horror is the fear of the unknown and being driven insane from seeing Things You Are Not Meant To Know, which I'm not sure applies here. In this case, if the protagonist were to uphold their moral code, I think they wouldn't fall into psychopathy (the lack of empathy or morality). Instead, I would presume that they'd just become desensitised to whatever specific things they're partaking in.

However, I'd argue that neither psychopathy nor desensitisation hinders rational thought. As long as it's not something that impacts the ability to use logic, I'd say that 'dirty' or morally dark magic systems are totally viable for a rational protagonist to use.
