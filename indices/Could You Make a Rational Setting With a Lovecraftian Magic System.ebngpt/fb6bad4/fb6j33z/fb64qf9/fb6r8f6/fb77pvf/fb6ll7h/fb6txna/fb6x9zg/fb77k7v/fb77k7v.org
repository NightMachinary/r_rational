I think you can make a rational horror story with it. Rationally minded person finds out that the universe is, at its deepest level, fundamentally, fractally chaotic. There is no sense, there is no rule, everything gets lost into an asymptotically intricate labyrinth of exceptions, and on that madness rest the Old Ones.

Have fun with the thought.
