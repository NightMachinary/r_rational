The part about Lovecraft's ethos and rationality does sort of sum up my issue.

However I strongly disagree about the insanity part. I've read alot of his work and people tend to flanderize the role insanity plays in Lovecraft. Alot of it is trauma that comes from genuinely horrifying revelations, and witnessing disturbing events. The whole 'your mind breaks from seeing a shoggoth' comes from people who broke down during stressful situations, such as being chased by horrific beings like Cthulhu or said Shoggoth. The insanity isn't some magical effect, that's just the human response to something horrifying. It's akin to learning that all the things you feared were true, aren't just true, but far worse.

In the Call of Cthulhu. The Sailors are stranded in R'lyeh, that they psychologically cannot navigate. Imagine being in a house where your afraid to move because one wrong step puts you in another room, or you lean and suddenly the wall becomes your floor and your paralyzed with fear because moving forward doesn't take you forward and moving left doesn't take you left. Cthulhu is waking as well, and is this presence bearing down on their minds. Now he appears as something moving and indescribably large. Imagine if you saw Mount Everest in the distance and a spider crawls across the landscape. You think it's a trick of perspective until you see the legs actually touch the mountain and the spider simply skittered over it.

People get disturbed easily by things that are larger than us, or things that our minds can't reconcile. I've seen a beached a whale and I've felt put off by it. A live whale is even worse, because something about it's size makes it off putting when it moves. Scuba Divers have been known to panic when they reach the open ocean and find themselves surrounded in literally nothing but the color blue as far as they can see. Even the wrong texture on something, like if it resembles meat, moves, or has too many holes can trigger a fear response.I could go on, but the fact is Lovecraft's character don't have their sanity blasted because eldritch horror, they had their insanity ground away by experiencing a nightmare that a normal brain can't do justice.

Being perfectly logical and rational doesn't stop someone from being disturbed or scarred by witnessing disturbing events. That's just being human. Even without Great Old Ones we're still very sensitive and struggle to process certain stimuli regardless of how intelligent or aware of our situation we are.

The necronomicon is a tome of eldritch lore, but it's still just a book that someone can pick up, read and put down without any consequences. But later works have to turn into this memetic insanity text for some reason.

Lovecraft's work also shows that people in the know how can still bend the rules and gain some power. Like the Joseph Curwen, Keziah Mason, and the Undying Priests.

I'll admit my I kind of have a thing for Lovecraft's horror. Mainly because I like the sea and being trapped in a building with impossible geometries has been a very common nightmare in my life.
