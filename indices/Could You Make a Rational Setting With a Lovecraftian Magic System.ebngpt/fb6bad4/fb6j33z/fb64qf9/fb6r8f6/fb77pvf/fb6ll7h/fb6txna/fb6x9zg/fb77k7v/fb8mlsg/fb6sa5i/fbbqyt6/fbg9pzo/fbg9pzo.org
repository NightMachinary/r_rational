Have you read The Erogamer? The entire premise is a fairly rational young woman and her new-found friends trying to grapple with the intrusion of an alien set of logic totally incompatible with our understanding of physics and which gradually alters her mind and preferences the more she engages with its unfathomable powers. The catch is that the incompatible alien logic is 'erotic video game narrative logic'.
