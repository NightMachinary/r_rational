I'd be interested to take it even further in what I define as lovecraftian: how does rational fiction work when magic is inherently based on madness and chaos? where the rules and effects change constantly, your senses can't be trusted, and a mischievous demon really does control your reality?

maybe it's just impossible, or you just get something like SCP. I'm currently engaged in a collaborative writing project with a semi-lovecraftian setting, though, so I'll be exploring it as best I can =)
