The core thematic principle of Lovecraftian fiction is the futility and smallness of humanity in a cold unfeeling cosmos the true nature of which is inconceivable to our tiny animal minds. Every thought and feeling any human ever had was totally insignificant and pointless in the grand scheme of things, */especially/* all our pretensions to science and reason. Our rationality is the rationality of an ant that gets shredded in a lawnmower.

So, uh, no. You can't really make a rational setting with a Lovecraftian magic system if said magic system is /actually/ Lovecraftian.
