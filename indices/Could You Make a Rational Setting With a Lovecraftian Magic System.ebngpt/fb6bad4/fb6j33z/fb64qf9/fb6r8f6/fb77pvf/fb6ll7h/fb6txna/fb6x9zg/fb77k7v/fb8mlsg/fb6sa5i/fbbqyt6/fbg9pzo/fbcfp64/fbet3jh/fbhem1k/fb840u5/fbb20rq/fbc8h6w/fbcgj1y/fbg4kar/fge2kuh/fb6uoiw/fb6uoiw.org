A lot to unpack there.

To have a "purist" Rational/Rationalist book you would need a precise magic system. There...aren't a lot of truly "purist" Rational/Rationalist works.

There is nothing incompatible about a sociopath hero and a Rational/Rationalist book. Rationality and Ethics are entirely different parameters. You could have a compassionless character who cares about nothing but power making rational decisions to reach that end.

The larger problem with a "Lovecraftian" magic system is one of the core principles of the Lovecraftian ethos is that the universe in general (and the supernatural in specific) is fundamentally unknowable to humans. This is directly contrary to the spirit of rationalism.

The hero going insane as he uses magic would also be problematic, as eventually he would cease to be rationalist. An insane protagonist in an unknowable universe would kind of be the opposite of rationalist fiction.

I suppose it would be amusing to have a book where the hero tried to use logic to plan around the fact spell working caused a period of mood swings and hallucinations...tried to develop rules of thumb to determine what was and wasn't a hallucination.
