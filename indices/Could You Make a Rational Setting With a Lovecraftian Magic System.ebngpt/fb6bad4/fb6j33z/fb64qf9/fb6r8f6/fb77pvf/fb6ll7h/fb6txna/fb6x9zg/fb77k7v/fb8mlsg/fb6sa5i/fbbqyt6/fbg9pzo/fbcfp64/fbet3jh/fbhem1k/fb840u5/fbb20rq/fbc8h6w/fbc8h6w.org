You can try evaluating [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4716493/1/Aeon-Natum-Engel][Aeon Natum Engel]]. The magic is pseudo-soft (lab using nanotechnology to engrave geometrically perfect summoning circles etc), but I thought that overall the implications of such a magic system is well handled.

If you're fine with dead fics you can read its incomplete rewrite Aeon Entelechy Evangelion, which I find is a better (if brief) exploration
