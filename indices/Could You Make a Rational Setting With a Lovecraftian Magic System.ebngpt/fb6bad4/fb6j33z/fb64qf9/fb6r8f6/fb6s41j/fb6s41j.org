I like the idea of a 'secret' as a main or special power of sorts. People who gain magic are people who died and were able to see past the 'firmament' so it kind of fits. It would solve some issues by having a power that's reliable alongside magic that's riskier. Though casting the magic isn't hard part, the problem is the prep and dealing with the consequences after.
