LotM is the first thing I thought of too. It has a very strictly laid out Lovecraftian style magic system based on Tarot suits and ranking within that.

The top rank of each Tarot card is a god. And the pool of resources to get into each rank is limited so that it's only ever possible to have one god for each card. And each rank has strict progression requirements. Failure means insanity. Even success in some of the darker paths means insanity.

It's probably one of the cleanest magic systems I've come across.
