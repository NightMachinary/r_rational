I'd set it up so that, if you stare into the abyss, there's a chance that you can wrap your mind around a Secret.

The ritual of Zalgo would grant you a full understanding of the fact that h̞͔͜ụ͍̞̹̤̟ṃ̛̟͖͕̰͖a͏n̹̬͙̖̪i̥̱̗̝͓t̺̯̼̝y̧͓̰͙̫ ̰̩̰i͎̤̫̖̟̳͞ṣ̹̰͍ ̛̯̭̼̫̠ͅͅin̡̬̲͚̩s̭̮̞̠͓̯̲̕į̦̘g͚̠͚̘̞̕ͅn͈͉̜i̹̩͙̪f́i̘̩̬̼͈c̻̞̤a̘̱͈͈̫̻n̤͍͎̠͙̳t͓̬́ in the cosmos.

On the upside, understanding your own insignificance lets you put yourself beneath the notice of other people, too. This makes you effectively invisible.

From a mechanics perspective, I'd treat these "Secrets" as being closer to superhero powers than magic spells.

But - to limit things a bit - I'd suggest that activating the powers is typically difficult, on par with willing yourself to cry. And over use might have side effects like making the power always on. (See: ForgetMeNot)

Then, while there are rituals to help, it's also possible that people who have extraordinary experiences, or just weird mindsets, get powers "naturally".

Sometimes this would be good. Astronauts get their minds bent by the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overview_effect][overview effect]] and get a power that makes it impossible for anyone to willingly commit violence near then.
