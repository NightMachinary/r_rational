The basic essence of Lovecraft isn't that magic corrupts, it's that magic implies that reality is far different from how it is understood by early 1900s New Englanders. The big frightening reveals are things like:

- a respectable member of society is product of miscegenation
- the main character is product of miscegenation
- there exists intelligent alien life totally unlike humans
- alien civilizations have better technology than we do
- there are other intelligent species on earth besides humans
- there exist geographical regions which have not yet been discovered
- the Christian God is not real, but other Gods are real
- humanity has no special significance in the universe
- a murderer wishes to kill the main character due to their ancestry
- the soul does not exist and brain damage causes personality damage

But, to quote a friend of mine:

Today if I say to the man on the street, "Did you know that the world you live in is a fragile veneer of normality over an uncaring universe, that we could all die at any moment at the whim of beings unknown to us for reasons having nothing to do with ourselves, and that as far as the rest of the universe is concerned, nothing anyone ever did with their life has ever mattered?" his response, if any, will be "Yes, of course; now if you'll excuse me, I need to retweet Sonic the Hedgehog." What do you even do with that?

The answer is, you need to find /new cosmic secrets/ that have not yet been proliferated to the point of becoming cliche. Which leads exactly into what [[/u/best_cat]] is talking about.
