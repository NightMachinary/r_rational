I think of Lovecraftian rituals as trying to map matrix onto a higher dimensional space. There isn't enough information for the higher space, but that's where magic happens.

Well, entities existing at that level can fill in the gaps for you. For a price. Then the ritual ends, and now you need to map your expanded mind back to a lower dimensional space. But there are new bits to add in now. Things that don't mesh with the you from before.

A different mind emerges from the experience. This would look like you went a bit loopy from practicing magic. And it would happen with each ritual.
