Honestly this seems like a well-reasoned and thorough argument for why the rational protagonist of a Lovecraftian story /does not go insane/.

You might even argue that to H.P. Lovecraft himself the concept of the Rational Protagonist might as well /be/ the horrifying unknowable thing that he'd write about, because a Rational Protagonist is fundamentally at home in the midst of Weird Shit in a way that is antithetical /to/ being Broken By The Unknowable.
