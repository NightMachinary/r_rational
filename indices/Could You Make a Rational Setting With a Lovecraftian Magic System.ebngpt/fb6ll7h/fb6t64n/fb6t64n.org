I've been working on a magic system (for TTRPG campaign use) based on the principle of "hard magic upsides, soft magic downsides", inspired by one of Pixar's rules for storytelling: "Coincidences that get the protagonists into trouble are great, coincidences that get them out of trouble are terrible". So what the magic can accomplish is bound by hard magic rules, but the side effects of the magic aren't and can be soft and even plot-based. This is intended for a TTRPG campaign, but the principle could be used elsewhere.
