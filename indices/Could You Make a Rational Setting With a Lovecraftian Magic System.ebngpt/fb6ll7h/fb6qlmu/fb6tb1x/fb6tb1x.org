I mean practically speaking you just have two kinds of magic in the setting, like how Warcraft III has magecraft (normal magic, gather mana and shape it into a thing), shamanism (convince a powerful spirit to do a thing) and holy light (reach for +the void+ the light and let it fill you and use it to do things).
