Lewis said it wasn't an allegory. In today's fan terminology, he mapped his understanding of the Christian Trinity into a multiverse, of which Earth was just one world out of infinity. The consequence, of course, was that in every world with both sapient life and sin, the Logos' incarnation eventually chose to be executed to save one person's life, and that sacrifice covered all the sins in that world, past and future.

The munchkin in me demands to know if His blood was sufficient for all the sins of one universe, why doesn't it cover all of the multiverse? Why would God the Father torture His Son by setting up the rules of the multiverse (“the deep magic from before time began”) so sacrifices stick to one universe? And how does Asian dying for a human, a son of Adam from Earth, cover the sins of talking squirrels?

That's the part of a “soft magic system” that concerns me, a lifelong Christian fan of Narnia.
