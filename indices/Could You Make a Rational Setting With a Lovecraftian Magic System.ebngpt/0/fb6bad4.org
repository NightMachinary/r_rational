I think the answer is the same as for any other soft magic system: yes, but your ability to solve conflict with the magic system depends on how well the reader understands it ([[https://brandonsanderson.com/sandersons-first-law/][Sanderson's First Law]]). Soft magic systems are good for creating conflicts, but much less so for resolving them, because if there's no system of rules set up, then it's hard to have a satisfying conclusion using the rules. You can get around this a little bit by making a soft magic system which has hard elements to it, which are then used as the crux of resolution, but that can be a bit iffy. As an example, elves could be capable of all kinds of magic ... but can't lie. Or demons are capable of whatever they're not explicitly prohibited from doing. Or something like that.

(And yes, I'm reducing "Lovecraftian" down to being part of the soft/hard magic paradigm. There are probably some arguments against this, but I don't want to preemptively get into it.)
