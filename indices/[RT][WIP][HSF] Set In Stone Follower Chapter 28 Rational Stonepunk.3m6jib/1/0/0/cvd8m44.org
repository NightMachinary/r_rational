Well, my point is kinda that for the first few thousands of years nobody knew what they were doing in breeding, and you had to keep a general fitness level amongst your specimen.

Once humanity understood what they were doing, so in the last 200 years or so, desirable traits amongst species that are competitively bred have risen enourmously.

Milk production per cow has gone from slightly less than 5000lbs/cow/year to far above 20000 lbs/cow/year in 80 years.

Weight of broilers has gone from 2.5 to 6.2 pounds in the same 80 years.

For wheat I find numbers for (cannot find correct english words) number of grains planted vs earned: a multiplicator of 3 in 1500, and 25 nowadays.

And all those are just a single metric that has improved cosiderably, all the other performance measures have also improved similarly! (grains are heavier by far, cows give milk longer, broilers reach the far higher weight much faster etc).

Now one might argue that intelligence is more complicated to measure than milk mass or is even a more complex characteristic to breed for, but ...

The single most intelligent dog breed - the border collie- wiki has these powerful sentences to say:

  All pure Border Collies alive today can trace an ancestral line back to Old Hemp. Old Hemp, a tricolor dog, was born in Northumberland in September 1893 and died in May 1901.

One hundred years! A single intelligent individual makes the difference in "most intelligent dog breed!"

If one were to actually breed swine for only 200 years - let alone a few thousand!- with a singular focus on Intelligence, with modern breedings methods- you surely would get far more intelligent swine than you depict.
