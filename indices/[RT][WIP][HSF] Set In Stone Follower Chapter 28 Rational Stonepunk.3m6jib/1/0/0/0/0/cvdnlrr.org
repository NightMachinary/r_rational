  pretty much brought their swine to the pinnacle of swinish intelligence that is possible without a game-changing mutation

While I can see the point of this, I seriously doubt it. Evidence points in the other direction. There are many loci in the genome who have a small influence on intelligence, and every single one can be flipped at once, due to chance or breeding. Thus we get humans that are several standard deviations smarter then average.

Given that we also have a number of individual animals that are able to converse with humans, with "random/chance" intelligence, in the relatively small sample of animals that ever were in human captivity where they cared about intelligence, a focused breeding progamm would very quickly flip all these loci.

They are already inbuilt, and dont need an exceptional individual to emerge.

Thousands of years of breeding, and your swine are still very recognizable swine! In that time you can mould a species so completely as be completely unrecognizable. Your "intelligence bred swine" don't sound smarter by much than any standard truffle pig in France!

We have speciation in 250 years of mouse population on the faroer islands!

There is a paper out there though I cant find it right now- they do an estimation of theoretical limits of oil content of some seed based on genes that can code for more/less oil content. And IIRC they find something like 40 standard deviations as the limit...

I think -without being a domain expert- that you severly underestimate the power and speed of breeding progams and natural evolution.

But to be fair, it is a relatively minor nitpick that only matters since I am a stickler for this kind of consistency and doesnt matter at all to the story.
