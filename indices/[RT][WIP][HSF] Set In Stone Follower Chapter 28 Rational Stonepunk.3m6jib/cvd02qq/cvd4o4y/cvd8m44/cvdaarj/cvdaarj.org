I don't know enough about genetics to make a scientific argument, but I can make an anecdotal one.

There have been a great many remarkably smart dogs in the world, and I'd be utterly amazed if they hadn't been bred to each other very frequently to try and consolidate intelligence genes. We still haven't seen dogs get beyond recognizably doglike intelligence. None of them are reading Shakespeare or doing algebra yet.

I suspect that human intelligence was not a simple refinement of existing capabilities. It was likely a random mutation that managed to pass Darwin's fitness testing. Our brains worked a certain way for hundreds of thousands of years until a child was born with a subtle mutation that did not prevent them from surviving long enough to breed, AND did not render them sterile. They passed on the genes, and from there on, the ball started rolling. A single individual can indeed make a huge difference.

My layman's understanding of genetics is basically that Allen's family have pretty much brought their swine to the pinnacle of swinish intelligence that is possible without a game-changing mutation. Game-changing mutations that survive to adulthood are rare. In the case of the Rickson family swine, many potentially brilliant piglets might have been conceived, but not survived to be born due to defects. If any mental mutations were born, they may have been sickly or weak, and not survived long. For a random mutation to happen in a benevolent fashion is rare. For it to happen in the benevolent fashion that would increase a specific desired trait is fantastically rare. For the animal with the random benevolent trait that you wanted to also be capable of having offspring would be yet another limiting factor.

/shrug/ I can't go beyond the anecdotal here, but if someone with more-than-journeyman genetic knowledge can address this in journeyman terms, on either side, I'd be interested in hearing more thoughts.
