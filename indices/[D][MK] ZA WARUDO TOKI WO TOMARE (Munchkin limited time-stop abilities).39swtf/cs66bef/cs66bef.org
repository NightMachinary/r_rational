Since it's a shared effect, it's got to have some limited area or you'd be experiencing timestops created by people all over the universe all the time.

The area of effect would have to spread at lightspeed or you'd break stuff at the edge of the effect. If it lasts five seconds, it's at least worldwide.

So at the very least if you have the ability you'd be experiencing apparently random timestops every time anyone in the world use it.
