Thanks! I'm glad you enjoyed it. Not surprised it looks like a failed rational story, ha ha. It is heavily influenced by HPMOR, etc. Although my goal wasn't a rational story, but a blog in story form that let's me explore ideas that I find mindblowing. The plot is definitely not a organic rational progression . For that reason I never promoted it here.
