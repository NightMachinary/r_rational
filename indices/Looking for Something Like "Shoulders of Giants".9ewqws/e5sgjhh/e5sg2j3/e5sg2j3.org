The "optimising the real world" part isn't seen often with this sort of story. I recently read [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_First_Fifteen_Lives_of_Harry_August][The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August]] and it has some elements of what you mentioned. It was very well written and I thoroughly enjoyed it... let me know what you think if you end up reading it!
