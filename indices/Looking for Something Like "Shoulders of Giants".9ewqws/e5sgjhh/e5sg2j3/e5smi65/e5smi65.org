This was one of the most frustrating stories to read, and another big example of why modern world rational fiction is extremely difficult. Few people have real indepth familiarity with medieval or fantasy settings, but everyone has experience on multiple levels with the real world. Thus, when the main character "cleverly subverts" or munchkins real world rules, it doesn't feel smart, it just feels like an asspull from the author to make his main character(s) special.

If you want another story in this vein, check out Archon on Royalroad(not sure on full title?) But it has most of the same problems, and a few more.
