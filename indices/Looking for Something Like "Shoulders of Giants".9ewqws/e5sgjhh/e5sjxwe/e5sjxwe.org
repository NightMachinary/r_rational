Then I'll promote it for you then. If you have any other fics like that, I'd really love it. Regarding the rational part, it isn't exactly "rational", but I do think it's "rationalist" because it meets (IMO) rhe two main criteria of rationalist fiction I.e demonstration of rationalist techniques as applied to optimising the real world and the teaching of said techniques. If you're willing to rewrite it after it's finished (for publishing perhaps), then I do think it could be turned into something wonderful.
