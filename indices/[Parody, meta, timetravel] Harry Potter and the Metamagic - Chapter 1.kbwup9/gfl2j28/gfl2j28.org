Summary: A crack/parody meta-fanfiction, with timetravel, polyjuice-enhanced polyamorous relationships, exotic Middle-eastern Mullahs, and other fresh goodies. No real bashing (some parody bashing included), and currently no lemons planned.

AN: This is my first fanfiction. English is also not my native tongue. Nobody has yet beta'ed this, either. (If someone wants to beta, DM me!) So please be patient with me, and try giving me some constructive feedback.
