Fun story! I enjoyed the AI's attempts to make sense of its "world." One criticism I have is that the story kind of grinds to a halt when Dr. Travers shows up and explains everything. Much of what he said had already been conveyed earlier, and most of the rest could easily be incorporated into the "action" instead of being exposited at the end.
