Yeah, I'd say most of it comes across well without Travers. I can understand your concerns about readers missing stuff. You might consider having a couple of friends read through the part before Travers' exposition, and then see how much of it they picked up on. That would give you a good sense of where you might need to expand and clarify things in order to safely cut the exposition.
