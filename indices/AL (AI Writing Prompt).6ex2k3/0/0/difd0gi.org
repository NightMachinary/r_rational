Fair criticism! I admit he came in as an exposition prop; that was sort of intentional. I wasn't sure how well I conveyed the things he explained throughout the story. It was obvious to me (because I came up with the ideas) but I wasn't sure how obvious AL made it through his actions. In this case, it seems I underestimated its obviousness. My bad!

I could probably just have the story ending with Dr. Travers and the General taking over from Tyler, honestly, if I wasn't as concerned as I mentioned I was. :P

Also, glad to hear you enjoyed the read!
