It's impossible to have all these memories, speech and AI on 50mb. Also this reads too much like a movie. Executing a directive does not magically cause the monitor to show a bunch of stuff like code written over code - that would mostly have to be intentionally programmed. And a flash drive that auto runs and can terminate an AI, that's also very unlikely. AL could just choose not to read the drive.

Why is the school staff letting the boy talk to the AI? Alone for that matter. Principal didn't even try to pretend to be him, or at least watch over the shoulder. Plot is progressing in a certain direction without any reason for it to go that way. All in all, I think this short story is not rational at all
