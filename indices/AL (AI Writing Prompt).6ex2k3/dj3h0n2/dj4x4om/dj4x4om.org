  It's impossible to have all these memories, speech and AI on 50mb
#+end_quote

The new AL wasn't that small. His seed was. He quickly grew to be much larger; the reason he didn't "spawn" earlier on the teen's computer was because it didn't have the hardware needed to run him.

#+begin_quote
  Also this reads too much like a movie.
#+end_quote

It was sort of intended to read like that. I imagined this as a sort of short film, at least in my head.

#+begin_quote
  Executing a directive does not magically cause the monitor to show a bunch of stuff like code written over code - that would mostly have to be intentionally programmed.
#+end_quote

This was a symptom of the aforementioned movie-esqueness. I didn't want to dive the reader into looking at the event from inside the computer but I also didn't want to simply write about how the CPU sat there humming as AL/the virus worked. The code thing seemed appropriately "fun".

#+begin_quote
  And a flash drive that auto runs and can terminate an AI, that's also very unlikely. AL could just choose not to read the drive.
#+end_quote

You don't know nearly enough about AI, AL or the specific technology within the story that allowed AL to exist to make that statement.

  Why is the school staff letting the boy talk to the AI? Alone for that matter. Principal didn't even try to pretend to be him, or at least watch over the shoulder.
#+end_quote

They were convinced it was a simple prank at first. Later, when they realized it wasn't, they tried several things. But nothing worked. The only response they were able to elicit was when they sat the Travers kid in front of it. As this takes place over a few days (from their perspective), they haven't exactly went into crisis mode.

#+begin_quote
  Plot is progressing in a certain direction without any reason for it to go that way.
#+end_quote

Incorrect. There are several reasons for the plot to go the way it did. The reasons include but are not limited to: Dr. Travers' regret and subsequent attempt to kill the AI to preserve the world, Travers being a typical teen and torrenting a movie only to get infected, AL's attempt to survive a murder attempt, the principal wanting the problem to be over with as little muss and money spent as possible (initially). All completely logical and rational reasons for things to progress the way they did. Would you like me to list more? (I will admit the outside assistance from Travers and the General seemed convenient but don't you think the Russian government could get them in there? Did I need to explicitly say that?)

#+begin_quote
  All in all, I think this short story is not rational at all.
#+end_quote

I respectfully disagree but you are entitled to your opinion. Thank you for reading! :)
