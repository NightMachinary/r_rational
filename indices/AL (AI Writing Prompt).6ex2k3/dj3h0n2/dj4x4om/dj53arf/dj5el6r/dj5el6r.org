I agree it was convenient that the principal was willing to leave him alone after some time had passed and it was clear that this wasn't an easily solved prank. I could've written in a few lines about AL being able to visually identify Tyler, perhaps via webcam, and thus ensuring he was the only one he would speak to. But it is implied that others tried to speak to AL and he refused to engage with anyone who wasn't a Travers. The principal didn't hop to impersonating him because, logically speaking, no one should ever really hop to impersonating someone they don't really know anything about. The principal would've been found out in seconds if AL had bothered verifying his identity (which AL /doesn't/ do, beyond simply asking Tyler if he really is Tyler Travers. He's a simpleton. But the administration couldn't know this going in. Plus Tyler looked really guilty, especially once he confessed the flash drive debacle). I do concede that it was blatantly irresponsible for them to not even try and monitor him.

And I suppose I didn't make this very clear but the school administration had no idea what was going on from almost beginning to end. They just knew their computers didn't work. And they thought Tyler was at fault. The situation didn't truly escalate (as they still had laptops they could use for school business) until Stacy's grades were changed. And that very same day was when the General and Doctor showed up.

  From a programmers perspective for example, that visual is irrational. Just like watching "hacking" in movies where they type stuff really fast. That's not how things work in reality.

You're right; it's not. But doing it the real way wouldn't really tell a good story (especially since I have some basic coding knowledge but not nearly enough to fully simulate something like that) and, as the rational thrust of this story wasn't focused on accurate visual representations of hacking, I took a few liberties.
