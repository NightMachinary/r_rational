I actually think the ending where the uncle and the general came in was very rational. My comment on irrationality is mostly joined to the earlier statements about the principal and how AL was conveniently defeated by a flash drive. For a flash drive to have any effect on a computer, it has to be read (and often executed, but reading the contents should be the least.) Realistically, a computer with top security could avoid reading the contents fully, making any program within the flash drive unable to do anything.

Furthermore, it could be read but not executed, which is when the contents can be scanned for viruses. If we assume AL has an in-built function that when reading a certain string will shut him down, he could avoid reading contents of anything in full, but scan a few pieces of the content looking for part of the string, treading the water. Since he is 9 years old mentally, that is excusable.

I can see you imagined it as a movie, and it's not wrong in writing. However those small things that spice up the writing can still be irrational, because movies are not made to be rational but to be interesting to watch. From a programmers perspective for example, that visual is irrational. Just like watching "hacking" in movies where they type stuff really fast. That's not how things work in reality.

The principal and the staff allowing Trevor to talk to the computer, or prankster, 1-1 is not rational nor realistic. There is someone holding the entire school network, including principals computer, and they decide it's fine to comply. Such a thing would first and foremost warrant a police report, including the boy. Secondly, there is a random guy whose acquaintance took over the school network - this guy should not be left alone, lest they will do worse things with both network in control and physical access to the terminal. Things such as controlling grades of the students. From others POV, it may as well be Trevor who had a grudge against the girl and made her grades tank. Inexcusable, from principals POV. The principal should always (try) to stay in control. Always look what the boy is typing, always see what the AI types in real time. I don't think there is any principal alive that would act this way, and that is what I meant by story progressing unnaturally. The story's main point is Trevor talking to AL 1-1 and understanding that he is just a kid (AI), rather than a hacker who wants money. For this to happen, the principal and staff have to act irrationally and leave him alone. If they acted rationally, this situation would not easily happen. This could be remedied by Trevor having a reputation for being anti-scammer, or having most IT knowledge in school, and principal having bad experience with scammers. Thus there would be a real reason to leave Trevor alone, including not suspecting Trevor himself. His connection to principal and uncle should be stated, which would explain why he is trusted and not suspected.

PS: I suck at remembering names, I don't know if he really is called Trevor or Travis and I'm on mobile so I can't look it up while typing this
