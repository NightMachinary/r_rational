If magic is a natural aspect of the world, there will be natural creatures whose evolution has stumbled upon that aspect. You should seriously consider creatures that have memetic and antimemetic effects, and in a medieval setting they could certainly come across as demons. Mages themselves could come across as demons, or present themselves as creatures or forces of nature, depending on the versatility of the memetic system. I would recommend at least one legendary-level character that does just that.

To make things really interesting, detection and prevention of these effects should not be easy, or even possible. It should be very hard to resist memes and antimemes. This could be reflected in cost. A mage that imprints backups onto their own mind to counter memetic interference may become a little inhuman, or be forced to sear backups into the minds of others.

Possibly antimemes and memes have to balance, so the mage imprints the antimemetic impression of information onto others minds so that his own will have a sustained memetic effect. You could approach Imp's invisibility in this way, the mage using a supernaturally large portion of their attention to erase themselves from the attention of others. Long-term, short-term, and attentional memory could all be distinguished in this system, maybe modeled as a trifurcated pool of resource allocation, where you could diminish someone's long-term memory to increase the breadth of their attention, or to steal it for your own. Perhaps antimemes and memes have to actually balance, as in per-person, and a meme in one mind requires an equal antimeme in another. This means that Imp can only weakly disappear in the minds of a crowd, which may be all that's needed, or strongly disappear to the view of certain people, such as guards or a ruler to be assassinated. Maybe Imp steals whatever attention anyone devotes to her.

I kind of want to write something along these lines now. Maybe for the next contest. The important thing to remember is, when making a hard magic system, you're making a mathematical model of it, not just a list of effects. If you have a model, then you can play around with it and see what kinds of effects that could arise and how people would use it or model it themselves.
