I like this, but I think that larger memes while powerful, could be unwieldy and inflexible compared to secret or niche information. There wouldn't be any immunity established for things that hadn't been encountered and survived. That's not to say wizards wouldn't actively be spreading precursors to allow people to become susceptible to more complex meme structures.
