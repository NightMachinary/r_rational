[[/u/Transfuturist]] inadvertently performed [[http://myelvesaredifferent.blogspot.com/2007/02/summon-author-is-good-term-for-common.html][Summon Author]] so now I am here and must comment. ;-)

  Was thinking about the possibilities of a magic system based on information.

That immediately puts me in mind of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole_information_paradox][black hole information paradox]].

This is the observation that:

1) Particle interactions are predictable. (Electrons repel each other)

2) Predictable interactions are reversible. (Two electrons that have interacted will be further apart)

3) All that get gets tossed out the window when a black hole wanders into the picture. (We have no idea how many electrons got sucked up. They're all contained inside the event horizon even if that volume of space wouldn't normally hold them.)

If you treat "information" in an anthropomorphic way it seems to get where you wanted to go. If we take "you can't destroy information" to mean "you can't get rid of the knowledge in a letter" then Wizards would have some sort of a spell that gets the knowledge from the ashes. For even more fun maybe they can recreate the letter (or something more important?) from the knowledge and the ashes?

You wanted to abuse the system, you say? Then let's overthink information theory! What does encryption do to these wizards? The information exists, but isn't readily retrievable without more information. Or how about Godel's paradox? (Credit to a reader Para on my story for thinking about that one. I don't know if they hang out here or not, but "Hi" if you do.)

Wait, I wasn't supposed to go for the esoteric physics first? Blast...

  "Antimemetic field": People forget about the user a split second after seeing them.

You're probably just thinking back to your last date with Aornis Hades there....

Anyway, sounds like a fun idea. Now back to the nether hells normally occupied by authors of web fiction.
