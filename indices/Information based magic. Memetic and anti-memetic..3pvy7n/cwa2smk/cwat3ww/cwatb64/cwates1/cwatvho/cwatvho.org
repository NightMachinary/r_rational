I think it is more that unimaginative or unadventurous wizards would build towering piles of original (but mostly "useless") work in private, then hide it away. Remember, letting people /know/ the secret /at all/ is what loses power. An exposed and examined secret would just lose /less/ power if people weren't easily able to figure out much about it.

The interesting part comes when two people think they can discover something twice as valuable together than they could working apart. Then you get apprentices, covens, orders, entire secret societies, etc. All with their own secret rituals that do nothing but grant them power as they get more and more complicated and well used (as their history of secret use is complex information itself).
