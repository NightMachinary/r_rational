I'm writing a short story (that may become a novel) using the idea that wizards gain power from knowing rare and secret things. The more secrets they know, and the fewer /other/ people who know those things, the more powerful they are with magic. This power from secret knowledge is a zero sum game.

This explains wizards speaking in riddles, hording knowledge, and even having True Names they tell no one. Even showing off or explaing the magic they know cost them some power. The more organized the knowledge, the more powerful the secret, but also the more power loss when others find out.

Displaying a spell to a crowd saps the user of that secret a little. The smarter the observers and more organized their reaction (like writing stuff down) the greater the eventual power loss. But that would be nothing compared to a university finding and displaying a book written in the wizard's own hand that describes the spell in detail.

One gets magic powers in the first place by being the only observer to a powerful and enviroment-changing* event. Then if you are ever unable to claim sole knowledge of a significant and unique idea or fact, you lose your magic. Only a few people realize this before blowing their chance to be a wizard.
