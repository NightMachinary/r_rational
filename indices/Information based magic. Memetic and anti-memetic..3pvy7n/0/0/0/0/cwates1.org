Hmm. You could make it so that the more widely known the unsolved riddle or secret is, the more power that can be gained from it. Maybe it steals processing power (or something) from the corners of people's brains, and devotes all that power to the one who knows the secret's answer. That would encourage people to pursue risky strategies.
