People get more powerful the more famous they are. This is basically the opposite of what [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer]] is saying. Instead of wizards hoarding secrets and speaking in riddles, they would be trying to spread knowledge. They would be all about trying to tell (and create) the most compelling stories they possibly could. This is the basic magic system for [[http://alexanderwales.com/shadows/][Shadows of the Limelight]].

If you want to adapt something like that to spells:

- Memetic bomb: A nascent spell gets attached to a meme of some kind. Maybe this is a piece of news, a new song, or a saying. From then on, the power of the spell that eventually gets cast will be dependent on the strength of the meme (and use up that power). Wizardly power would then be tied to which memes they had lashed their spells to, as well as how well a wizard was able to help a meme spread.
- Memetic casting: The spells that are most powerful are those which are most known. /Fireball/ is iconic, so it's powerful. /Glibness/ is unknown, so it's weak. This provides a feedback effect for casting; as a spell gets more powerful, more people will know about it, which will make it more powerful, etc.
