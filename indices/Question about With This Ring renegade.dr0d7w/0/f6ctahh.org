They start off pretty boring, but later on the divergence points become more interesting. If you're having a boring time with early chapters you can just skip them and you won't miss too much context.

The big thing you'd miss would be that renegade became a new god and took venom-buster formula. Turning him into a big gray evil alien.

Other than that, it's not too hard to pick up the renegade chapters when they actually start being interesting. They do end up each covering different ground and showing different aspects of the world.
