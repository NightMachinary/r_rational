Ah, I think I see. From the post:

  Both myself and the SI are of one mind on this matter. Joe Hamill is presently a woman. She was a man, and she is perfectly entitled to argue that she should be a man. She is perfectly entitled to state that she wants to go back to being a man. And the SI is going to aid her in realising that ambition. But at present, she is not a man. She also isn't a dog. She also isn't a wall, or a flower, or an attack helicopter, though those are perfectly fine things to be. She is plus breasts vagina minus penis testicles facial hair. She even has one of those ridiculous costumes certain comic illustrators like to draw on female characters but not on male ones.

I take it that Joe Hamill is a character?
