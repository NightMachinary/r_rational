As others have said, you certainly /can/ skip Renegade. However, you said that you're only at episode 17. At that point, Renegade is just a few snippets and has not really hit its stride.

I suggest waiting to make a decision until you've finished the first six months, episode 26. At that point there's been proper divergence and some cool Renegade scenes. If you still don't like it by then, sure, skip it.
