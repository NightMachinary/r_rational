I've completely skipped them, and am otherwise completely caught up to date. They don't interact with the main storyline at all, and you don't need to worry about them, except in that you'll be annoyed for whenever he updates Renegade instead of Paragon, especially when he does an entire Renegade arc.

Nobody recommend for me to read Renegade please. I tried to read it, for quite a few chapters, and while it was neat, Grayven is just too evil for me. Or rather, I just don't like the decisions he makes. Paul, on the other hand, is absolutely amazing, and I love his journey.

OP, you're in for a treat with Paragon.
