Respecting how someone wants to use pronouns is part of that though- Arguing that they only refer to someone's physical sex isn't respecting their gender identity.

Similarly, if someone changes their name and you refuse to call them by their new name, because you think names refer to what name a person has a birth, you're being rude.

Also, the author has explicitly referred to said character as being a woman, (despite him having identified as a man and being a cis man up until Hero dial shenanigans)
