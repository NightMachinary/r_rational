You should try reading one of the Renegade arcs, without the part before it, if you haven't yet tried that. "Stars, Crossed" is the best one, since he's in a parallel universe for the duration and minimal prior context gets involved. The full arcs are much more interesting than isolated snippets (the Paragon snippets inside Renegade arcs aren't terribly interesting either).

Renegrayven is a Large Ham, who deliberately plays the megalomaniacal supervillain for most of his time in the parallel. And he is decidely /nastier/ than Paragon, then as otherwise. But, in traditional British fashion, his tongue is planted firmly though subtly in cheek the entire time.
