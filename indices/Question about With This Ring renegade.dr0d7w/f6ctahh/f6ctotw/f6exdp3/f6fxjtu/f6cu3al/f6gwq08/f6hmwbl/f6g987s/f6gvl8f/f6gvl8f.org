I think that's actually somewhat deliberate; showcasing that just because one character variant might be labeled 'good', that doesn't necessarily make them the more interesting version. Or even the most human - there's a lot of discussion about Grayven!Paul being rather more down-to-earth and personable. Not to mention him building a family. Mainline!Paul is closer to the orange light and sees things from a slightly more stripped-down perspective. This has even been commented on in-universe.

Personally, I think Zoat is trying to put the two variants at opposite ends of an axis to compare and contrast, but what the axis actually /is/ varies a lot from chapter to chapter. And sometimes the axis spins in the opposite direction from what might be expected from a classic comic-book character - Good vs Evil, Law vs Chaos, Family vs Solo, Corps vs Rag-Tag Bunch of Misfits, Human vs Inhuman.
