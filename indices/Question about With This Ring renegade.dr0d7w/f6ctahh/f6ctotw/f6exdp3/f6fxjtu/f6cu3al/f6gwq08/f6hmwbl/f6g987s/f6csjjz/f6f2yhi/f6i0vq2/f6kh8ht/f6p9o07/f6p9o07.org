I believe Arc 30 is the first full Renegade arc. I quite enjoy the Renegade posts, so YMMV, but I think the general consensus is that Renegade is much more tolerable in full arcs (where he gets more time to be a flawed character, as opposed to a guy who gets to yell at the Justice League and kill people).

That said, if you're not enjoying Arc 30, please skip it and then try Arcs 36 and 37. Despite enjoying Renegade I've still never finished Arc 30, so don't let it turn you off him.

If 36-37 aren't your jam either, then feel free to drop him completely. He has not interacted with the main story yet, and AFAIK will not in the future. And while some of his arcs have a parallel mostly-unseen Paragon version, you can usually figure out what you missed without reading the arc.
