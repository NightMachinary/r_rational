I stopped reading with this ring a long while ago(not because it was bad, just because I had no idea where it went and by the time I found it I realized I would need to reread the whole thing or be completely lost), but I wouldn't skip the renegade chapters if I were you. I remember that the chapters do actually get better and you never know! The universes may interact at some point. Probably in an omake lol
