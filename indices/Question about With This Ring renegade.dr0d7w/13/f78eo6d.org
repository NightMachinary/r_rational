I would suggest you read the snippets of Renegade up through the first primarily-Renegade episode. (I think that was the visit to the Un-Men and their city.) If you still don't like it then, you probably aren't going to start liking it. Though you may end up going back to the Renegade archives when you run out of Paragon; daily updates are daily but it's still faster to read it than to write it.
