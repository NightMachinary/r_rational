Made it to Arc 30 and to be honest I was enjoying the Grayven stuff so far, but Arc 30 is just... boring. I'll probably skim the rest and then pick up renegade after this arc. Just not grabbing me so far.

I enjoy the more ruthless side of graven, but I feel like Voat is sometimes forced to push him into needless cruelty just to make him more different from Paul. I've enjoyed WTS so far because it seemed to focus on what a real person might do in a comic book universe, but the paragon/renegade split seems to force personality traits outside the norm of what I think a real life human might express. The whole "bash on the amazons" thing felt really forced and a poor way to advocate for change. Grayven was basically a caricature of that friend who says they aren't a bitch, they just tell it like it is.
