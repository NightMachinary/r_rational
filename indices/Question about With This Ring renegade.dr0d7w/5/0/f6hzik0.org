Yeah, Mr Zoat definitely contrasts the two on purpose. Like today's chapter, where Paragon mentioned offhand that Challenger Mountain is on the market. If you only read Paragon, that means nothing, but if you've read Renegade, it's a bit of a gut punch.

And Ghia'ta just joined the Paragon team, which is her first appearance in the Paragon timeline - but she has a long history already with the Renegade.

And when Kaldur approached Paul about how he's interacting with Venturia, it's helpful to have read Renegade's explanation of Venturia's tense relationship with Poseidonis.

If you read only Paragon, the story will still be coherent and self-consistent, you'll just be missing out on a deeper understanding of the people and events.
