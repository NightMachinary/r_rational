They are technically skippable - nothing in one universe/timeline has so far had a direct in-story effect on the other. However, a minor part of the overall WTR story is drawing attention to parallels between the universes, and how the Pauls act differently. It's not just "here's story #1 with Orange Lantern 2814, here's story #2 with Graven", but playing with the literary negative space and distance between the two characters. They're often presented as opposites, but the exact axis they're opposites along changes a lot, and does not always point in the direction you might expect. For instance, which of the two characters is more aligned with Law, and which with Chaos? Which with family, and which with working mostly alone?
