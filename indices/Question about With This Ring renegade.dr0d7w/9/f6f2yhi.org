You can totally skip them if you so desire. They have very little bearing on the main storyline except worldbuilding. And, if you change your mind in the future, you can easily read /just/ the renegade bits.

The episodes devoted to renegade only affect renegade. The only downside is that, once you catch up, you'll sometimes be left without any paragon updates while a renegade episode is being released.
