Nothing from the anime or game's stories really matter for this, so you should be okay. The main issue you might run into is that I don't often describe what each pokemon looks like in great detail: you might be okay off the brief descriptions, but you also might end up having to google new pokemon every few chapters.

Other than that you should be good, and I'm actually really interested to see what someone who isn't familiar with the source material thinks of it. Let me know if you start reading :) Reviewing the first few chapters with an outsider's eye would be very helpful.
