So, few things. First the renegade system seems a little more abusable than it should. In general I find it interesting, but they should have to sign something, or officiate their stance in some way. As of now I cannot decide wether this is a comment on the story, or on the world.which in general means you're doing a good job of writing it. I would be afraid that a ranger would just say "yes, they witnessed and went on their way"

When spoken out loud "I'd teach you and you'd teach me" Sounds worse than "I taught you and you taught me" with the same general flow to the poem, but I am in no way a poet, so keep a few grains of salt on hand.
