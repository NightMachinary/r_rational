  In what sense? The first group cares about pokemon wellbeing, the second demonizes people for using pokemon against other humans. There's little overlap there.

In the sense that if society progressed to the level that a significant number of people start caring about animal rights, a significant number of people (possibly, not the same people, but there should be an overlap) should already care about human rights and not be okay with summary executions. The chapter almost makes Leaf look like those radical eco-terrorists: she's pretty vehement about Pokemon abuse, but she's kinda just a bit queasy about summary execution of a human.

  Possibly, but keep in mind that the majority of 21st century Americans are okay with indefinite detention and torture of suspected terrorists, and we're not faced with the threat anywhere near as often as people in the pokemon world.

This is happening "out of sight, out of mind" to "evil foreigners". If it was the case that you could be executed as a terrorist by a police officer and four random people basically on the spot without even right for attorney or /habeas corpus/, there would be more outrage.

So in the end I understand that it won't happen (and I don't begrudge you for that, it's a minor point), because it would require a major restructuring of a story, and also I'm just one person, but I think what would work better if there were separate Pokemon courts that tried trainers with a simplified procedure, but still adhered to standards of courts-martial, or at least courts from /Ace Attorney/. Not this legalized lynch mob.
