  In the sense that if society progressed to the level that a significant number of people start caring about animal rights, a significant number of people (possibly, not the same people, but there should be an overlap) should already care about human rights and not be okay with summary executions.

The perspective of Renegades in culture has a lot to do with this: it's drilled into everyone's head from an early age that these are the lowest of the low: in a world where monsters threaten humanity daily, a human choosing to use monsters to kill others is an unforgivable act. Human rights are for those that do not prove themselves inhuman.

  This is happening "out of sight, out of mind" to "evil foreigners". If it was the case that you could be executed as a terrorist by a police officer and four random people basically on the spot without even right for attorney or habeas corpus, there would be more outrage.

Most Renegades are branded out of sight as well other than by those who are their potential victims, like Blue and Leaf, and who are not usually the kind of people particularly interested in giving the Renegades the benefit of the doubt. The idea that people deserve all these safeguards our society has in place for preserving innocence are basically tossed on their head for Renegades: if an accused murderer goes free, maybe they'll murder a few more people before they're caught again. Renegades command creatures that can wipe out entire towns, when directed with human intelligence.

  So in the end I understand that it won't happen (and I don't begrudge you for that, it's a minor point), because it would require a major restructuring of a story, and also I'm just one person, but I think what would work better if there were separate Pokemon courts that tried trainers with a simplified procedure, but still adhered to standards of courts-martial, or at least courts from Ace Attorney. Not this legalized lynch mob.

The legalized lynch mob is kind of an important point in the structure of society though :) I don't want their government and society to be too perfect or progressive in every field: I think living under constant siege would cause certain aspects of society to be more draconian than less, and how they treat "treason," which is what being a Renegade in such a tight-knit, everyone-helps-each-other kind of society is akin to, is one of those areas.
