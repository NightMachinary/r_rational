Red seems confused real Renegade aren't as blatantly odd and different to the average person as media has portrayed them. Amusing, and yet it makes sense such a hated and feared profession would be exaggurated by people.

Seems everyone's pretty tense after the Renegade judgement is passed too, and Red's pretty sore about the loss of two of his pokemon. Snapping at Blue due to something he thought was implied condensation when instead it was concern, after all...

Unsurprised that Red's more bothered about the dead humans than his Rattata. He knew the scientist less time-wise, but they were also the same species as him, and thus he's hardwired to care for them more. I think.

  "Think you should tell them before the news does?" Leaf asks as her ledyba crawls up her back and onto her hat.

I'm just imagining this happening, mentally picturing how big Ledyba are commonly depicted, and kinda wincing. Big bug, and all that; can understand why anime Misty is freaked about them.

  Remember Modama Town? Old Agate Village?

Checked the names on a whim, and realized the second's referencing a town from Pokemon Colosseum and XD. Those games and the region they take place in canon to this story, then? The first's an anime-exclusive kanto town, but I'm unsurprised you borrowed that considered the sheer unlikelihood of only having the number of towns and cities in the games populating Kanto.

Good explanation for the heroes obtaining fossils akin to the game progression, and I like how all three got to pick one of the canon pair. And in the case of Leaf, one you would normally obtain from a scientist at Pewter Museum.
