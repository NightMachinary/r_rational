Just to comment on the layout of your website. Would there be a way to have the content block centered on the screen too? It just feels weird having so much space to the right of the screen. It is good that it is not all negative space, but the background you have chosen just highlights the fact there is nothing there. You could fill it with a twitter roll, or separate out the search bar to be in that space. Just a few suggestions, I love your work and can't wait to read more.
