Shin Sekai Yori is really good if you like psychological horror and fantasy. Has that creepy vibe the entire time of "Something is very VERY wrong but I don't know exactly what it is." I'd put it in the top 5 horror anime series I've watched. That said, it's not really "rationalist." Just good horror.

Do yourself a favor though and ignore the manga. It's much more about fan service than story building. Which, well, I guess can be good in its own way... but doesn't hold a candle to the anime.
