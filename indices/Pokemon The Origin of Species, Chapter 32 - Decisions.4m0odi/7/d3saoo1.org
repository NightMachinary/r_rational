The poem seems good to me! (although I'm not that good at poetry myself, so don't take me too seriously!)

Were some of the lines deliberately referencing the original theme song? A bunch of the lines could be interpreted as references to the song lyrics, but the line "I'd teach you and you'd teach me" especially seems like a direct reference to /Gotta Catch 'Em All!/
