Great chapter! Reread 31 again right before it, and man, what gut punches. I feel for Red, but honestly I think I took the deaths harder than he did, and felt more like Blue when it came to witnessing for Yuuta.

Something I might have just missed or misunderstood - is Branding a physical brand? It doesn't sound like it, as it's implied that Yuuta is to be executed and not simply marked, but I was wondering if the Brand is actually something more solid than just a Kill-on-sight order.
