"Red didn't mean to imply with his comments that Yuuta wasn't a Renegade. He was just reacting automatically to potential bias or irrationality. Blue has accused him in the past of getting too much enjoyment out of being a devil's advocate to infuriating extremes, but Red never means to do it maliciously. Something in him just naturally pushes back at things that look too sure or damning."

This is something that I sympathize greatly with. It's an issue I often have, too. Regardless, this was a fantastic chapter. I really felt the tension Red felt in my gut when he made his decision.
