#+begin_quote
  When spoken out loud "I'd teach you and you'd teach me" Sounds worse than "I taught you and you taught me" with the same general flow to the poem, but I am in no way a poet, so keep a few grains of salt on hand.
#+end_quote

I was finding that line a little flow-breaking, and going from "I'd" to "I" and "you'd" to "you" definitely helps; just slightly shortens those syllables. Occurs to me that "I teach you and you teach me" would also fit, but maybe that would be a little too much of a direct quote.

Finding myself /slightly/ tripping over "Our nights" too, but that may be an issue of accent/pronunciation with "Our" being more elongated in a British accent (more like "oww-er", rather than just "are")
