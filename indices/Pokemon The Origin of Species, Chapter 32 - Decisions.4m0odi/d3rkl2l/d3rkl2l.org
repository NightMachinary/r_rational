Hey all, welcome back! A few quick notes: first, my website is up! Thanks to my patrons and their continued support, you can head over to [[http://daystareld.com][daystareld.com]] to find the whole story uploaded there, including a FAQ page, an updated team roster, and a Disqus comment system. I've also uploaded some other things there, including writing/tabletop RPG advice and some board game reviews. Hopefully I'll be able to continue adding more work soon: any and all feedback on the site design, articles, or comment system are welcome!

Second, this chapter includes the first bit of poetry I've written in years. Feedback on it would be particularly welcome, including any suggestions to improve lines or sections: I don't plan on doing much more poetry writing anytime soon, but since I'm so out of practice with it I feel the least confident in its quality.

And third, if you're looking for new rational fiction to read, I recently finally started Unsong, and am devouring it as fast as I can. Without going into spoilers, imagine if the God of the Old Testament was real, and speaking parts of his True Name (in Hebrew of course) let you cast magic spells. Then imagine corporations patented parts of the Name to monopolize their use, and were resisted by an underground coalition of Unitarian Universalist communist kabbalists. Then imagine the whole thing was written like a cross between Douglas Adams and Good Omens.

It's pretty fantastic, is what I mean to say. Head over to [[http://unsongbook.com/][unsongbook.com]] to check it out, and thanks for reading, as always!
