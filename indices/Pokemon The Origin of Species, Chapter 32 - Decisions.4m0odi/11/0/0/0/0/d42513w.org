Can I just say I enjoyed this discussion, both points being valid to an extent. I would say so far, to my knowledge, the story does not preclude the existence of anti-branding groups. They could, and very arguably /should/ exist. But I think the rationale behind the ironclad stance on renegades is sound. With monsters at the door it is almost inconceivable that man would not become somewhat monstrous in response to the incredible theat they pose.
