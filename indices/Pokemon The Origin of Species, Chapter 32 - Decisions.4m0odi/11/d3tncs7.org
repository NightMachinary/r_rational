The Renegade handling makes the judiciary system in /Ace Attorney/ seem fair and procedurally sound.

More seriously, as I said in a comment to the previous chapter, I think it's a bit inconsistent that at the same time there are "Pokemon lives matter" activists, and they also execute people without anything resembling a fair trial for "reckless Pokemon handling with malicious intent". That's not the level of America's stereotypical "being tough on crime" (years in prison for weed), that's the the level of trials at the dawn of the Soviet Union where they "disposed of the archaic capitalist notion of 'guilt'" (replacing it with the notion of "danger for society"). I think the story is going in the direction of lampshading the flawed system (unlike, e.g. /Harry Potter/ were in a supposedly "wonderful" world the judiciary system is fucked beyond belief, and not a word is said against the system as a whole), but maybe it's starting too "dark", at this point of the world's progress there should've been some reforms already.
