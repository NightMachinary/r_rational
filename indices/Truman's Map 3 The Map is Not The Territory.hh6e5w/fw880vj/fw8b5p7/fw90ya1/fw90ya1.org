Good thinking! I'm guessing They didn't make any changes (They hadn't planned to give them back at all)--I hadn't made the connection yet about the murder mysteries maybe being Their reaction to the Sequences rather than to Truman's different way of thinking directly.

I'm now imagining a spectrum of how-well-they-understand-the-Sequences-themselves, with the far end being "Time to use our best Rationalist thinking to outwit Truman who's now become a Rationalist like us!" and the near-side being "Geez, a corny self-help book about doubting everything around you is really NOT what we'd rather this guy have.". With the murder mysteries, I'm now imagining something in the middle on the lines of "So, this means he likes 'deducing' things, right? Let's set up some story arcs where he gets to deduce some things, then? --Wait, he just deduced US too HOW IS HE DOING THAT.". Speaking of which, the 'Mayor' was a nice tidbit about where his life goes... <having fun imagining>
