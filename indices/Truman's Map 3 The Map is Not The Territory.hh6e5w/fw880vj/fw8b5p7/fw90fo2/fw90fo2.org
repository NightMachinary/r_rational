This was enjoyable! Thank you very much for writing it!

If I remember correctly, the first two chapters were wholly setting up the premise, with Truman firmly in Their palms--this chapter now has the incredibly satisfying clash-between-the-masquerade-and-the-Truth that makes the original /The Truman Show/ so enjoyable. <happy>
