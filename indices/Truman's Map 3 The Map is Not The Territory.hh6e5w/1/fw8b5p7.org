There is /no/ chance that they didn't at least glance inside that book, so what are they going to do in response? Did they change the Sequences to make the book less helpful in unmasking them? Are they going to up their game, and make Seahaven seem more rational? Or are they going to gaslight Truman, and try to make rationality itself seem irrational by giving him a world that doesn't conform to rational experiment, to discredit the Sequences?
