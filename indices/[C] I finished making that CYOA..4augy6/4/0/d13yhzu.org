...I forgot to put in Paranoia. It's in now. Thanks.

  I'd be interested in seeing more what characters live there.

Depending on which side you choose you see different Allies and Sovereigns. Beyond that, well, uh, I'm sure one of these years I'll finish a book that's good enough to show. ...Hopefully this year.

  I think I may be misunderstanding the Brinksmanship Salted Earth option. Doesn't the ability to make binding precommitments defuse more ruinous geopolitical games of Chicken than it solves?
#+end_quote

It's in the Handicap section because, while it makes sense as a strategic move as long as it's telegraphed to the entire world, it can potentially go horribly wrong. Like if the enemy think you probably did leave yourself some way out of it and Deadman's Switch is in play. In the 'official' timeline Brinkmanship does not happen during the Century, but the main character of the actual books goes down that path eventually.

  I think the Altar, and the asymmetry resulting from a war in which only one side has access to it, is a particularly interesting aspect of your setting, though. I'd be interested in more on when and why they use it.
#+end_quote

At first they use it a lot. It's a fantastic advantage. Unfortunately the other side has the Tower of Souls, which after a little tweaking allows them to take any prisoner of war and costlessly kill off everyone connected to that person by a mutual emotional bond, or by blood, or by sufficient shared history (Former lovers, lifelong friend, etc). The Black also discover that the process of binding yourself with an Oath shapes your soul in a certain way, and the Tower can be made to target this as well. So the more people swear the same Oath, the more likely they lose everyone who took it. At which point they can safely use the same Oath again, until the Black capture one of the /new/ Oathbound...

The White do manage to set up a few locations with strong enough magical protection that the Tower can't reach them, and so those places end up with a /lot/ of people who have Sworn unconditional, never ending obedience to the White leaders. Outside of that, they use Oaths to make special spies, as shown in the Black placement section. A very small number of people, like those who serve the White and take the Custom Rewrite option, get to set their own Oaths, which in-world includes a lot of mental rewiring suggested by people on this subreddit.

  Generate Summary didn't seem to do anything when I clicked it, though I suspect that may be a problem with my browser rather than with the site.
#+end_quote

I hope it's your browser. During development it once stopped working for me for seemingly no reason, and to solve it I had to select all the options section by section until I found which option randomly decided not to cooperate with the Generate Summary process.

  Minmaxer!me says: The side effects from high affinities seem to incentivize spreading out your points on those and going with the specializations that don't rely as much on scaling. Fire isn't versatile enough to seem worthwhile to me, though it does lead to Forge Soulstone, which is one of the best specializations for versatility.
#+end_quote

The highest Affinity levels do basically turn you into an NPC, but level six (Worldwide Outlier) is doable if you can live with being a weirdo. Spreading your points out has the disadvantage of being pretty expensive too, but I'm glad that out of the comments I've gotten so far, one goes all in on Fire&Water and you feel drawn to broadening it out.

Soulstones do add linearly, so you can rack up a lot of power just by farming prisoners of war for a few decades. That would be unethical though so sociopaths probably wouldn't do that.

  Favourite combo
#+end_quote

Path to Victory is extremely powerful in combination with the right strategies, and I thought about making it more expensive. I decided against it because there a lot of other powerful things as well. In the 'official' timeline PtV ends up being the death of several Sovereigns, who over- or underestimate it. Now, in the official timeline characters don't get to /choose/ Prophetic powers, but I hadn't considered the Deathsight/PtV combo. That sounds really interesting. I shall have to think on it.

  With a magic system this powerful and versatile, I almost feel like there must be an obvious path to world domination, but I haven't found one.
#+end_quote

This pleases me greatly.

  The best I can come up with at the moment is defeating enemies and making them into soulstones that you use to become better at defeating enemies and making them into soulstones.
#+end_quote

Although not presented as a choice in the CYOA, one character in the world manages to steal not just the magical strength of the victim but their prophetic powers as well. Which is how they got to be one of the Sovereigns in the first place.
