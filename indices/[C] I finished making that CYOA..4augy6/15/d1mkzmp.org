This is great! Enjoyed it a lot.

My biggest issues are:\\
* Doesn't feel like the setting ought to be WWI. Everything about it except the one point where you mentioned that, felt more like medieval stasis. * Some of the elemental relationships don't make much sense. Lightning doesn't really have that much to do with healing, for instance. Healing and ressurection should have been related. etc.
