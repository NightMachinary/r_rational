It's a book (series) I'm actively writing, although the muse of sitting-down-to-actually-write comes and goes. I've written 90% of one book, but it turned out crap so I shelved it and called it practise. I'm currently writing a second one, and so far it's much better, and might actually be worth showing people when it's done.

I'm a little busy for most of the day, but I'll be back tonight. I got a lot of help myself to get this one started, so I'll happily pay it forward.
