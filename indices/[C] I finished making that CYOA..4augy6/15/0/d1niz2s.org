Thank you!

As for the setting, I will try to explain. Sorry for the length. This is set in a world I'm writing a book about, and takes place a few hundred years before the book. The technological level of the world before the Kings and Queens rise is roughly that of Rome at its apex, but with royalty/the priest class having moderate magical powers. The Kings and Queens take over a place a bit like the library of Alexandria, if the library never destroyed anything and had lots of hidden and forbidden tomes on history and dark magic. And a prison full of heretics and war criminals. The Kings and Queens get to be the leaders of the revolution because they are the most successful people alive at fighting the demons, and that usually means they eagerly experimented with magic and/or were willing to pursue forbidden 'lost' knowledge. So there you have a set of leaders who were very callous, very interested in learning, and experienced at thinking outside the box. So. There is an explosion in magical knowledge as they share (most of) their knowledge with each other, and combine and refine each others' work, as well as what they find in the library. From the library they realize that mundane technological progress has /also/ been stifled by the old kingdom, so they invest massively in developing new ways of doing things, with magic and without. They take over the old empire, and force everyone they can to become a magic user and a scholar. They basically turn Rome (the city at the center of the empire) into one giant university with tens of millions of students. So... there's an industrial revolution.

This MYC has you the player be born toward the end of the war between the Kings and Queens and the demons, the demon race is extinct and their world destroyed while you are still a teenager in a victorian era boarding school. By the time the Kings and Queens divide into two factions and start a civil world war, technology is starting to approach world war 1 levels. If you choose the Endgame, everything is shifted forward a few decades and we have world war 2 level tech.

In the book world, the world war ends with all leaders dead, all cities everywhere magically nuked, 98% of humanity dead, most children born crippled magically, and most survivors /extremely/ hostile to magic and technology. A war between people who want to stay low tech and people who want to be the new Kings and Queens and reinvent all the technology that got nuked ends with the world forcibly returned to medieval tech and only royalty allowed to use or even know magic, like before the Kings and Queens arose.

So... the books have a medieval world. Most of the world history has low tech. But the MYC takes place during a century long race from Rome to WW3. It is very likely that my view of the world as 'mostly' low tech carried over into the MYC. Thank you for pointing this out. I will have to give some thought to how to present things.

As for elements not quite fitting what falls under them... Lightning is what the people in my world call the element that lets you throw lightning bolts. In the books the characters will eventually grow rationalist and realize that the elements have bullshit inaccurate labels and are in desperate need of scienceing, but just to clear up Lightning: It would be more accurate to call it the element of Life, with electricity being the thing that's tacked on. It's still arbitrary, but there are only five elements, and they all have rather a lot of different things slapped under the same labels.

Healing and resurrection being related was part of the plan originally, and in the book world they certainly are, but I'm completely new to writing code (Remember, the code for this MYC is retrofitted, not written from scratch), and I couldn't see how to give skills prerequisites (In Affinities or prereq skills) without the whole thing being much more clunky and requiring you to go back and purchase skills from other sections before you could buy what you wanted. In the book world, there are no spells or specific 'skills' by any label. Magic is five forces of nature, and they can be scienced. There is no Fireball. There is only converting a minuscule amount of matter into heat and forcing all the energy to go in mostly one direction.
