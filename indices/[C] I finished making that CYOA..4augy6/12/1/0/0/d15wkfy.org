  When you say "rename", do you mean you gave it the same name as the old version?

Yes.

On a refreshed page, it displays one error: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'innerHTML' of null

Clicking any purchase button gives the error: Uncaught ReferenceError: points is not defined. Clicking on the join faction buttons does not produce an error and works normally. It seems to be limited to buying stuff (including handicaps).

The last version of the original script file still works, and I can copypaste stuff from your version to it, so it shouldn't be an issue.
