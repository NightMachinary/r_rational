When you say "rename", do you mean you gave it the same name as the old version?

If not, you may need to change the line in the HTML that includes the script. Currently it is:

#+begin_example
  <script src="script.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
#+end_example

You would need to change "script.js" to whatever the new filename is in your google drive directory.

If it's not a naming thing, I may have made a serious mistake somewhere. Can you open up the [[http://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/8525/how-to-open-the-javascript-console-in-different-browsers][developer console]] and see if there are any errors?
