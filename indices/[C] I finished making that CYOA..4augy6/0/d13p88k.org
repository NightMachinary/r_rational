This is incredible. Well-detailed, well-thought-out, and even convenient in distributing points with the counter!

Will edit with my build when I get a chance.

This is incredible. Well-detailed, well-thought-out, and even convenient in distributing points with the counter!

Edit: my build:

I designed this one based on my own personality, then with as much synergy and cool powers as I could cram in.

--------------

[100] Basic Control over Fire: I am not a passionate or emotional person.

[90] Moderate Potential for Air: I am quite fond of narratives and apply them to life, perhaps more than I should.

[72] High Potential for Earth: I love abstract thought and logic guides most, if not all, of my actions and beliefs. The only reason I'm not higher is that I am not "slow to change."

[62] Moderate Potential for Lightning: I am, not to brag, very charismatic. Joyful and in-the-moment, not so much.

[34] National Outlier in Water: I'm very good at seeing possibilities and manipulating. Very, very good.

[34] Rasp, the Daylight Spear: almost chose Col, but freedom sounds cool too. Maybe I can help her out on my free time.

[34] Special Operations: Just sounded cool. Plus my build lends itself to an elite fighting team.

[26] Deep Mind Reading: A) I'm good at reading people and B) it sounded really, really cool.

[16] Supreme Charisma: Like I said, I'm hard to hate.

[12] Battle Sight: Useful and cool. Especially for SpecOps.

[18] Hostages!: Sadly, I do have a family, and they are the few people I can't be so brutally honest with in real life.

[24] Bad luck!: I do seem a bit misfortunate in real life.

[18] Gaslighting: I'm a skilled liar, and I love manipulation, so I went up a level from what I think I am naturally to have fun.

[10] False Thought: I am like this already, and it seemed cool.

[6] Battle Focus I: I am now an elite ninja fighter; boo yah!

[2] Supreme Defence: To help with fighting.

[0] Supreme Offence: See above.

*TL:DR*: This is based on my own personality. I am very good at manipulation and possibilities, great at logic (though I am changeable enough I rated water higher than earth) and have charisma and subtle madness in equal measure. The plan is to go be a SpecOps agent and have fun taking down powerful mages and being something of a Jack-of-all-Trades (minus fire, of course).
