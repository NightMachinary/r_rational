I've gone to bed. I'm... finding myself doing the CYOA anyway, but if I don't finish it tonight I will get right on it tomorrow!

So far, all I can say is that it looks very promising. And also that pressing Priest selects Bard. And pressing Bard does nothing. Which if it's the same mistake I left in in mine is because you deleted the entry in the table before Priest and forgot to shift the numbers. :p

I will have meaningful feedback for you tonight or tomorrow, but I'm very glad I was able to help you get started. I was just paying it forward, and I'm really glad it helped.
