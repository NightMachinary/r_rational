Three files. html, js and css. The original files that went into the Worldbuilder CYOA are [[http://pastebin.com/uu82QFPw][style.css]], [[http://pastebin.com/iseww34z][index.html]] and [[http://pastebin.com/S2nU0Eh9][script.js]]. My versions contain a few bits and pieces of broken code and shoddy work arounds, so you can have them if you want, but I think you are probably better off starting with the originals. For me, most of the work was done in the html.

When you download the files, they will probably end up style.css*.txt* etc, so you'll have to cut off the offending .txt. Once the extensions are fixed you can just open up the html in a browser of choice and it should display like a normal website.

If you want to keep your own stuff at google drive as well, you can upload it [[http://www.labnol.org/internet/host-website-on-google-drive/28178/][here]].
