Hi Rhamni,

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/4e8ugk/i_built_a_website_where_you_can_create_your_own/][I finished making my CYOA!]] It got me really interested in HTML, CSS and JavaScript (I had barely any knowledge of the first two and had never written JavaScript before). I was looking up how to do things like crazy! And I learned /so much/. Aside from my work and studies, I basically stopped doing anything else to focus on this, building it all from the ground up, creating new code, new content, and new images.

Thank you so much for getting me off the ground with this project - couldn't have done it without your help.

Please take a look - I'm eager for your feedback.
