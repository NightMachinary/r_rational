I got it to work! Thanks so much for this, you're amazing :)

Got it to work with the 3 files you linked to. I'm working on putting together the data, then I'll adapt the html to suit it. I'll let you know how it's coming along!

One question - any idea how long do the websites that [[https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbz7Mb1OJWnFz_osp7K9G_4wesHlzyPZYOtbBFu--prJj1Hb1C83/exec][this script]] creates, stay around for?

Edit: nvm, I see I can just delete the folder from within Google Drive..
