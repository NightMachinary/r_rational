Well, I started to make "me with superpowers", but that just made me sad. Everything is broken so terribly, me-with-superpowers would struggle just to survive in that world never mind taking over / fixing it. Self-inserts probably aren't the way to go here, let's just build an insane demigod.

I had some trouble choosing my Lightning affinity. It didn't seem at first blush that being depressed and self-destructive would prevent you from having the power to heal others. But maybe I was trying too hard to make a specific character.
