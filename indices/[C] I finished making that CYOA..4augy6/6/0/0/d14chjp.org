Is Soulrape brain surgery or soul surgery? If it's the latter - which it sounds like it is - then one can Soulrape so precisely as to eliminate only the capacity to lose one's sanity or humanity. Add in some brain surgery to modulate one's control, and one has the ability to both: without losing oneself, go just as far down the path of insanity as is necessary to utilize the power of one's affinities; and bring oneself back to one's controlled self, from that precipice of insanity or inhumanity from which Soulrape has made it impossible to fall.
