  If the effect is wholly tied to psychology, then I would argue any brain surgery that gives one the ability to completely give in to their affinity, yet still bring themselves back under control when the need for using the extremes of their affinity passes

If you look under White Hand specific specializations, this is basically what Contingent Rewrite does. The main point being, /when/ the user is jacked up to maximum Affinity, there is no way to do away with the overpowered-NPCification without also taking the power away. The thing that cannot be done is to have maximum affinity /and/ be sane. Also radically altering your brain state back and forth is probably going to go wrong at /some/ point, but there is no reason in principle why you couldn't program someone to bounce around all over the place Affinitywise. Just... since they aren't themselves while at maximum Affinity, and their worldview might be significantly different, you'd have to treat them like a possibly malignant general artificial intelligence that knows it has an off switch.

Perhaps the best analogy would be the magical gene Harry thinks he's deduced in HPMOR. Something external to the user, in this case a non-thinking, mechanistic force of nature which people in this world call an Element, continuously checks the mind state of the magic user, and makes itself more and more responsive to the user depending on how well they mash with what the force has been programmed to hold as the kind of mind it should serve.
