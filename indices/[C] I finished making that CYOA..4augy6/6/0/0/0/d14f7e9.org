The soul in my world is part of the mind and resides in the brain, but persists without it. When Soulrape eliminates something from the soul, either it very easily and conveniently erases the same thing from the brain, or if you carefully remove it only from the soul, you enter a phase where the remaining soul begins to treat what was removed as false - and it begins to fade from the brain as well. The mechanism for this has nothing to do with reality and is entirely fantasy... But what it boils down to is that it's brain surgery that can take a little time to kick in.

You can use Soulrape, which I did consider naming Soulsculpt because it's not Always Evil, to burn away unhealthy things and improve a person's sanity, but you are then burning away part of what made them so strong in the first place. This may be most easily demonstrated in the case of Air: the mind has to be very unusually prone to faith/fatalism/trusting their intuition to be touched by prophetic powers or able to bring back the souls of the deceased, but the power of destiny coursing through them is not a single yes or no check. If their faith/fatalism/trust of intuition gets stronger, so will their Air magic, but the wishes of Destiny, presented to them in the form of those intuitions, tell the person what to do in more and more situations the stronger they get. Tempering the person's trust in/inclination to listen to their intuition immediately leads to a lowered Air Affinity.

You can change someone's personality, temporarily or permanently, with for example drugs for temporary changes, and that will change their Elemental strengths, but if you tone down the extremes of a person's psychological makeup, that will also affect their magic.

The best way I've found which works in retaining some control once a character goes maximum Affinity is with Oaths: They bind behaviour, but not thought (Unless the Oath is about thoughts, which yes then that can affect your Affinities). So you can be extremely emotional and strong in fire, but if you have bound yourself to act in certain ways in certain situations, that will still be reflected in your action, even if you are not capable of actively pausing to make long term plans.
