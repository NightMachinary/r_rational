This is a really cool character idea. I do have a character with both Tongue & Pen and Cascade in the official timeline, but she's messed up in the head and really evil, so she doesn't try to /fix/ things much.

Soulsculpt was wrongly coded. I've fixed the error in my main file, and it should work the next time I update the link in the OP. Thanks for spotting it.
