Build: Gotta go fast.

Lightening, Air and Water make me fast in various ways. Lightening for true speed, air for the sonic launch, and water for time control. Illusions and Real time Rewrite also let me cheat to make people think I'm fast.

Alien Focus Doubles my thinking speed, and with Healing it can go still higher.

The rest of the build is mostly there to keep me not dead in a post-apocalyptic hellhole.

What's that? Torture? I don't know what you're talking about. I didn't buy that. It wouldn't even be on theme! *innocent whistling*
