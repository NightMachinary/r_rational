Focused on building a scientist who can create nanotechnology, end entropy, eliminate scarcity as a concept; the Earth affinity is the foundation of their power. They can manipulate time and thought to do things faster, as well as create zones of sped time to aid other scientists. Ally Kodix can rid them of any sanity issues (maybe he has Soulrape); if not, super speed and a few other perks can be removed in order to get Soulrape oneself. Ally Ulmus helps keep track of the plot while the scientist and allies sequester themselves away, researching and building defenses to ensure safe continuance of research. Brain Storm and Path to Victory, as well as the Water affinity, allow them to know what paths are best to research immediately, meaning a 0% failure rate. Lightning helps with immortality and other things I haven't fully thought through, but since its negatives can be removed so easily, it's too powerful to not take. With so much power, the Salted Earth options, even Great Seal, are easily undone, although the options that lower the world population are avoided, since perfect resurrection doesn't exist.

The primary hurdle I see is keeping the scientist interested in the world, and not going off on one's own like a Transcendent from /A Fire Upon the Deep/. Ally Kodix and Lightning affinity should help with that, but it's open to interpretation. Might need a Soulrape to remove the "Other people do not exist" fault.
