This is another case of me being very stupid. I forgot to handle the case of allowing you to pick multiple things from the same table. Really sorry about my shoddy coding here.

I've updated the pastebin yet again. Now it should properly let you select multiple handicaps and the like.

I really hope that this time it works as expected. Bodes poorly for my current project if it doesn't.
