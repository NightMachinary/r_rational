Oh, I know what the problem is, I think. Pretty stupid of me, honestly.

The way I defined the initial point value was to reference the =#counter= div rather than hardcoding it, but the script loads before the counter is defined.

You should be able to fix it by changing the line:

#+begin_example
  points = parseInt(document.getElementById("counter").innerHTML);
#+end_example

to:

#+begin_example
  points = 100;
#+end_example

Or whatever you want the value to start at. I updated the pastebin with it.
