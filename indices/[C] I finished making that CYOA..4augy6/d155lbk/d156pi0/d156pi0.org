Thank you. Retrofitting the Worldbuilder is my first project in learning how to code, so there have been a few things I just worked around rather than properly solved. I think I follow along your explanation of what the bug was and how you fixed it. I'll give it a closer look tomorrow and see if I can properly learn it. I'm enjoying learning this stuff, and am surprised and delighted at how helpful people are being.
