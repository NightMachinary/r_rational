Got the error a few minutes before I posted.

The problem with the handicaps tends to be that either they're Salted Earth ones, in which I accept responsibility for way too much death and destruction for my liking, or they hinder me by making me less effective. I took the ones that looked like they wouldn't really harm me.

I did go over with Endgame on and do the whole 'take everything that I can live with, min-max for great justice' routine, but I didn't save it nor put in too much thought. If I am not constrained properly by morals or character concept or the like, just munchkining the mechanics isn't that much fun.

I recall the main concept was essentially to build an extremely socially capable mage with tons of subtle but powerful abilities aiming to manipulate my way to victory, but dropping 10 points on Contingent Rewrite that lets me, if forced into a direct confrontation, suddenly turn into a ridiculously powerful combat monster with legendary affinities in all the places that my main persona is weak at. I expect it might come as somewhat of a shock to whoever's accosting me at the time.
