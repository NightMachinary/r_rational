For some reason, the first time I was working on this it gave me more points than I should have had. Anyway, it should work now.

The idea is that, well, the Black Hand are pretty horrible and therefore I will do my utmost to assist the White Hand. If the White Hand reclaim the Tower of Souls, they will sacrifice themselves to take out the Black Hand. This leaves me pretty well-placed to make something of myself in the hopefully still reasonably intact world that remains.

Combat is not really my thing - it tends to be both dangerous and not decisive. Gathering intel and manipulating events behind enemy lines is much more important. The key to winning the war looks to be in making as much use of the neutral parties and internal divisions of the Black Hand as possible so as to fragment their power.

Had I more points, or more will to sacrifice to gain more points, I'd probably focus on getting more powerful time control and maybe mixing in some illusions and the like.
