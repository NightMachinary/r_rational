Ok so I tried to get the most powerful character I could focusing on mind control. Hours later what I ended up with is a maniac ruler of the only major remaining city on earth. Enter the God-King subsetting: Pretty much everyone left with any power is fanatically loyal to the God-King. given nearly every catastrophe possible occurred, the only places other the God-King's city with any people left would have to be clustered around people with powerful magic that can save them, given the God-King went extra hard after people such as healers who could do that... there's not many left.

The God-King being biologically immortal was alive during the century of ashes. However he saw it as the actions of petty mortals, and he used the opportunity to gather resources and prepare for "The Great Rebirth" with his acolytes. His preparations made him many enemies and consisted of some horrible (but in his eyes necessary) actions, where among other things he kidnapped massive numbers of mages from the shadows, either turning them to his cause or having his followers create soul gems out of them. In addition he deliberately wiped out survivors he didn't have use for, and he contributed to the already massive biological devastation caused by Poenna. In the end he mostly succeeded at ensuring that his worshipers were the only people left. Without further ado here are the stats:

[100] Basic Control over Air

[60] Worldwide Outlier in Lightning

[60] Elsanna, the Ice Queen (not really a sovereign anymore after all the mind control...)

[135] Rolled: Endgame

[141] Brinksmanship!

[145] Leviathan!

[151] Area Denial!

[159] Nuclear Holocaust!

[167] Dysgenic Weapons! (This is extra nasty since magically and mentally crippled are unlikely to be able to defend themselves and have the magic needed to survive in the wasteland)

[179] Deadman's Switch!

[185] Hollowed!

[193] Phoenix's Brand!

[197] Veteran! (Not much of a disadvantage when I rule the world!)

[203] Hostages! (It's not really much of a disadvantage to a psychopath)

[191] Battle Focus II

[187] Supreme Defence

[181] Integral Body (Can't be an immortal God-King without immortality!)w

[165] Real Time Rewrite

[149] Eyes of Green

[141] Leadership III

[117] Lasting Copy

[111] Impossible Speed

[103] Deep Mind Reading

[93] Supreme Charisma

[73] Healing III

[65] Illusion Magic II

[63] Psychopathy

[67] Truly Hated! (Really this applies basically anyone who isn't my follower)

[63] Ally: Blackfire Suzette (Allies + mind-control is cheaper than getting better at combat)

[51] Bullet Time

[33] High Potential for Water

[29] Low Potential for Earth

[11] High Potential for Fire

[3] Vortex of Screams

[7] Sadism! (All those who deny my divinity will suffer my wrath!)

[3] Magical Pain Immunity

[1] Superior Soulstone (In the setting this ended up making he has way more than 2 soulstones but oh well)

[0] Soulstone

As far as I know this is the best strategy world domination, if you think you have a better way I would love to hear it though. Ok so I think it's a given that 1: more points is better, and 2: world domination is easier when there's /not much world left/, so you should probably take the endgame and all those disadvantages (except for the great seal since that will make winning near impossible). Also I can't really see many ways ways to win without at least medium tier mind control. I can totally imagine another build, that splits points between mind control and seering that might actually work better, so I'm not saying this is the best possible build, however I think any world domination build will have to share some similarities.
