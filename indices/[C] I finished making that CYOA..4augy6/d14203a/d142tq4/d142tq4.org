Self destructive would be fine, but happiness is one of the things that powers Lightning. The point system I made for this CYOA certainly isn't perfect... In the book version of the world, depression is something some Lightning magicians struggle with - once they lose that spark of joy, their magic weakens... which objectively makes them less useful to those they care for/less able to do anything with their lives, which probably doesn't feel great which... etc, etc. And since Healers are the best suited to mess around with their own minds, things get a bit unpredictable.

One thing I think I haven't communicated well in the CYOA (And will try to fix) is that the issues that come with the highest Affinities aren't side effects that can be neutralized with brain surgery. The strong magic flows /from/ the very unusual/damaged personality. Issues can be managed, but never removed without a loss of magical strength.
