  You can change someone's personality, temporarily or permanently, with for example drugs for temporary changes, and that will change their Elemental strengths, but if you tone down the extremes of a person's psychological makeup, that will also affect their magic.

If the effect is wholly tied to psychology, then I would argue any brain surgery that gives one the ability to completely give in to their affinity, yet still bring themselves back under control when the need for using the extremes of their affinity passes, would be just as powerful as one without the surgery. I analogize it as brain surgery assisted method acting - instead of temporarily increasing ability, one temporarily lifts restrictions on ability, with no chance of losing one's sanity or humanity.
