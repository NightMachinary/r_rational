Interesting setting. One bug I noticed: I was unable to purchase Soulsculpt even when I purchased Soulfire.

I'm imagining that Poena is the holder of the Tower of Souls, as she seems like potentially the most useful of the Ten to clean up after the Century of Ashes and she's also the only one specifically mentioned in the Salted Earth options other than Vance, and his Great Seal cost is too high.

Tongue & Pen, Cascade and Soulsculpt are the key elements here. Given that Soulsculpting can't be reversed, Tongue & Pen shows who someone could have been and the imprint of futures that never were, and Cascade shows what changes actions now will have in the long run, this seems like the best way to change someone's mind permanently.

I wanted a character who has the raw strength to reach Poena after the rest of the Ten have been wiped from the board, and then the ability to not wipe her from existence with Soulfire, but to Soulsculpt her into Poena the Benevolent Mother, as planned by Vance.
