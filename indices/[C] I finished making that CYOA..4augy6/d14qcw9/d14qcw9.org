Why should I do everything myself? I am a god after all. Sure, you'll probably betray me, (bastards) but I'll see it coming, then burn that desire away from your soul. Now everyone is happy!

With huge affinities for water/air and the logic of earth, I understand nearly everything and I'm absolutely certain I'm the god this world needs. Tack on deep mind reading, path to victory, and an artifact for soulrape (I feel like it's cheating the point costs, but meh) I understand everyone and can sear away anything objectionable within them.

Now I just need to win people over to my cause (cleanse the world of all the /other/ crazies, usher in a new age lead by my totally-not-a-cult) then evaluate/condition them for absolute loyalty. They 'recruit' others pyramid scheme style, and pretty soon there's an army of utterly loyal, driven folks knocking on the black hand's kings' doors.

Once all this war nonsense is cleared up, we fix all of its lingering after effects, then implement the Seal with Vance to prevent this sorta thing from happening again.

Notes: I wanted to be a sociopath too, but you can only select one sanity adjustment. I'd also like to be able to reorganize the summary to make more sense, or have it listed in a more intuitive order. (all +point mods, associations, affinities, then specializations and misc stuff.)
