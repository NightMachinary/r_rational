Oooh, fun and well-balanced! A few builds:

--------------

"The Datamage" - built for research (with a powerful side of plotting) but capable in battle if the lab gets stormed (or to overthrow a leader when the time is right)

[106] Hollowed! - no particular need for a strong personality when a solid utility function and grasp of logic, math, probability and physics will do\\
[106] Basic Control over Air - get prophetic warnings from Elina instead without the mental downsides\\
[106] Basic Control over Fire - not a passionate person\\
[106] Basic Control over Lightning - not very joyous + no god complex\\
[106] Special Operations - the research division!\\
[106] Vance, the Cheater King - of course he'd appreciate a good researcher\\
[102] Ally: Elina - warnings about what experiments to do / avoid + being kept out of battle\\
[98] Read Probability - saves a lot of time on calibration and experiments + munchkinable by asking many simple questions to get complex information\\
[68] Alien Focus - use the default speed to research faster + additional speed available in case of battle / other immediate threat\\
[34] National Outlier in Earth - strong affinity for reason and physics, but not enough to cause severe interaction problems as a researcher\\
[0] National Outlier in Water - strong affinity for time, probability, and important details (helps to counteract the social issues from Earth too), but not enough to lose touch with reality

--------------

"The Immortalist" - Survive. Forever. At any cost.

[106] Hollowed! - a good reason to preserve what's left\\
[112] Hostages! - not like they care\\
[116] Paranoia! - CONSTANT VIGILANCE!\\
[116] Basic Control over Air - doesn't invite destiny to mess with them\\
[116] Basic Control over Earth - not a logician, but quite adaptable\\
[116] Basic Control over Fire - not a passionate person\\
[116] Civil Servant - stay very far from battle\\
[116] Col, the Cripple - fits with the adaptability\\
[115] Soulstone - a nice little magic boost + wringing as much as possible out of the points\\
[114] Swimming - just in case\\
[112] Exeptional Liar - don't give people a reason to attack\\
[110] Psychopathy - extreme survival drive\\
[106] Battle Sight - avoid surprise death\\
[102] Martial Arts II - advantageous in case of battle\\
[98] Supreme Defence - to get out of combat alive\\
[92] Integral Body - avoid aging\\
[82] Healing II - do their own maintenance (which is why I didn't build this using Golemization instead)\\
[72] Supreme Charisma - keep people from wanting to attack in the first place\\
[56] Real Time Rewrite - ditto\\
[34] High Potential for Water - power specializations + use understanding of probability and time to avoid danger\\
[0] National Outlier in Lightning - power specializations + keep people from wanting to fight + ability to kill in battle

--------------

"The Controller" - why be stuck with just one skill set when you can access many through mind control?

[108] Phoenix's Brand!\\
[112] Paranoia!\\
[116] Sadism!\\
[116] Basic Control over Air\\
[116] Basic Control over Earth\\
[116] Basic Control over Fire\\
[116] Basic Control over Water\\
[116] Elsanna, the Ice Queen - easy puppet\\
[108] Deep Mind Reading\\
[100] False Thought\\
[90] Supreme Charisma\\
[74] Eyes of Green\\
[58] Real Time Rewrite\\
[34] Lasting Copy\\
[0] National Outlier in Lightning

Pretty self-explanatory.

Fun exercise: try building major HPMOR characters this way.
