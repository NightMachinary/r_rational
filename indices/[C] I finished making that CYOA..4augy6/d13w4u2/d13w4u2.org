I like your setting quite a bit - I'd be interested in seeing more what characters live there. In general I think the CYOA is well made in that I do get a sense of how any character I make would fit into the setting.

Some of the Black Hand placements say "You must take the Paranoia handicap," but I don't see a handicap called Paranoia. I'm guessing it's meant to be the same as the Schizophrenia handicap, in which case one or the other should be renamed.

I think I may be misunderstanding the Brinksmanship Salted Earth option. Doesn't the ability to make binding precommitments defuse more ruinous geopolitical games of Chicken than it solves?

I think the Altar, and the asymmetry resulting from a war in which only one side has access to it, is a particularly interesting aspect of your setting, though. I'd be interested in more on when and why they use it.

Generate Summary didn't seem to do anything when I clicked it, though I suspect that may be a problem with my browser rather than with the site.

Minmaxer!me says: The side effects from high affinities seem to incentivize spreading out your points on those and going with the specializations that don't rely as much on scaling. Fire isn't versatile enough to seem worthwhile to me, though it does lead to Forge Soulstone, which is one of the best specializations for versatility.

Favourite combo: Path to Victory is impressive on it's own, but becomes /much/ more powerful applied to the right magical senses, i.e. some combination of Lightning and Water Affinities, Read Probability, and/or Death Sight. Brain Storm probably also works well with PtV.

With a magic system this powerful and versatile, I almost feel like there must be an obvious path to world domination, but I haven't found one. Lightning affinity /implicitly/ can't make you much smarter. The best I can come up with at the moment is defeating enemies and making them into soulstones that you use to become better at defeating enemies and making them into soulstones.
