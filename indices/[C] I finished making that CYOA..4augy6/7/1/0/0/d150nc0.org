Black Hand, Exuro, armed forces seems like a nice place for the world's fastest sociopath... Who also has no prophetic abilities. I think I worked around specification restrictions, and as for allies... uh... I may have min maxed away friendship in favor of more superpowers. But hey the military should be putting me with other people who are near my ludicrous level, so things will probably work out.
