Yeah the one major advantage I ended up having over Poena is that she being involved with the black hand would likely die or get screwed over by the conflict.

By never being quite enough of a nuisance until it's too late my character ends up with the only remaining bastion of civilization. Obscurity is the best defense as they say.
