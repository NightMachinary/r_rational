Where does it say that Twilight is evil for being an economist?

Anyone who has met Tyler, as I have, can attest to how kind and warm he is. It is clear from the article that he is not advocating war but presenting an argument instead about how war can force governments to make decisions that promote economic growth. Calling it evil doesn't address his empirical claim. At the same time, it is hardly sufficient to justify a war, as Tyler would be the first to tell you.
