I don't really have the time ATM to make a thorough review beyond the usual "Awesome, thanks for the past and future of this fic".

One thing I'd like to say is that you should seriously consider making the latest chapter the official last one of the fic, with the next part either the epilogue or the first chapter of the sequel, rather than extending on into a second arc of the first fic. There's quite a few readers who prefer reading completed fics, mainly due to the prevelance of dead fics.

Other than that, there's plenty of room to see side-stories featuring a pair of the post-test ponies, put into a situation where their respective tests are at odds with each other, especially considering that's the next major step in becoming more rational, learning to balance the different lessons rather than treating one of them as more important than the rest.
