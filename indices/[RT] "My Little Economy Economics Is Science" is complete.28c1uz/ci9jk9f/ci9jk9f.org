Which is interesting because I'm halfway through the next chapter.

I'll take the opportunity to ask for some reactions and comments on the story so far. I have my own complaints with some problems related to pacing, structure and flow, mostly caused by a lack of planning and forethought on my part, but does anyone else have anything to say about what aspects and parts of the story work for them and what don't?

I'll try to put some more thought into the next arc as well as come up with a more consistent and slower update schedule. Twilight still has a lot to learn.
