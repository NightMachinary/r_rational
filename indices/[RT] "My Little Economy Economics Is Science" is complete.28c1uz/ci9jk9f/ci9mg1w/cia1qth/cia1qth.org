There wasn't much economics presented in those chapters, which weren't themselves very well thought-out. Perhaps I should have had Twilight go on a monologue about how when ponies can create trust they can find ways to achieve their goals simultaneously, or how misinformation can break down cooperation. On the other hand, boring. Tough balance to strike, probably didn't find the optimal point.
