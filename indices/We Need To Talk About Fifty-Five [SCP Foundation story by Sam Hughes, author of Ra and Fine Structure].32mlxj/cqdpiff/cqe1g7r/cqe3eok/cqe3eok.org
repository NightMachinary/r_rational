Fishmonger was an early member of the wiki who constructed the first coherent meta-narrative. He wrote a few early Foundation Tales and, amazingly enough, wove details of those stories into the SCP entries. If you just looked at the entries themselves, you could track incident numbers between multiple pages and re-assemble some of the events that had befallen the Foundation as a whole. It was an incredibly effective storytelling method that made the SCP Foundation wiki /feel/ like a living document that was being used by real people.

The downside was that Fishmonger was apparently not the nicest person to noobs and ended up feeling rather proprietary towards the wiki as a whole. When things came to a head, he decided to take his extensive pile of toys and go home, tearing the core out of the wiki. It's recovered, obviously, but is intentionally designed not to have or allow a centralized canon any more.
