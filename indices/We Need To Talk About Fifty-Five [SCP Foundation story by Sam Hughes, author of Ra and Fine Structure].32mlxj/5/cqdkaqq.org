I extra-enjoyed this story and its sequel because It felt like I had read this story or one very similar before.

In fact, if the author's reading, re-submitting slight variations of the stories in a few months under a different account (with an explanation in the comments) would be a perfect. (Where "slight variation" involves things like switching character's names and whatnot)
