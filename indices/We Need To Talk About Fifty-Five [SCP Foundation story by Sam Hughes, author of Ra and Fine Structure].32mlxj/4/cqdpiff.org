At it's best, the whole of the SCP-wiki is supposed to be rational. The wiki is supposed to be rational best practices devised by very smart people who are dealing with a non-rational universe that doesn't care about them or their stupid ideas of physics. The lack of a central canon, and the desire NOT to have a good central canon after the whole Fishmonger episode, make that a little harder to find, but there are a lot of writers involved with the wiki that are as good at rational fiction as anyone here.
