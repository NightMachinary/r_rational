I don't think the Rowyna chapter is any more "outside of the human experience" than the Isaac or the Florence chapter, you're just applying a much more strictly literal lens to this chapter than you apparently did to the previous ones. The Honeypot thing is the fantasy equivalent of someone who dives so deep into the closet and represses their own desires so much that they become alien to them. Obviously, nobody in the real world has been zapped by brain magic to change their sexual orientation so that they can better assimilate into a culture that doesn't accept them as they are, but plenty of people have /acted/ like that's happened to them, so for Rowyna that's really what happens. How is that more out there than Isaac getting zapped with brain magic to literally give him a past that never existed as a metaphor for nostalgia, or Florence encrypting her own memories as a metaphor for trauma?
