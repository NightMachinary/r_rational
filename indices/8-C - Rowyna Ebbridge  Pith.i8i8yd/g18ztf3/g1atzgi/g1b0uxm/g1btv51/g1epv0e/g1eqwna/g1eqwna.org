Well, because suppressing memories or becoming deeply invested in things that have never really happened are things that can literally be experienced by people. The /process/ of getting to where Florence and Isaac are emotionally is fantastical, but the emotional experiences themselves are plausible. (Less so in Isaac's case, but still to some extent.)

Whereas no matter how you much you go into the closet and try to pretend otherwise, someone who's gay can never actually make themselves legitimately straight. It's not a possible experience.

Like I said, it's a fuzzy distinction, but that's my take on it, at least.
