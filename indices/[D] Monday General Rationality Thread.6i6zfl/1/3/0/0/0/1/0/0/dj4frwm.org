I doubt it's impossible. If fucking cellphone apps can get people addicted to unfulfilling serial monogamy and frivolous spending in the most literal sense of the word, there's obviously a reward signal there that can be hijacked for just about any purpose. We're not talking about rational actors, we're talking about facebergian bugmen. This is just one possibility, but a state that truly controlled all mass communications and did so effectively could essentially get people addicted to obedience in large enough numbers that repression for the rest wouldn't even have to come from the state. Now more than ever, the normie can be made to believe what he has to.
