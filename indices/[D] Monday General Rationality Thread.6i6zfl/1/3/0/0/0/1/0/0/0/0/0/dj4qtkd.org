Again with your failures to mentalize! Neither I nor most other people you'll have to market yourself to /have/ any desire to blah blah crush blah blah lamentation, at least not a desire capable of driving months to years of concerted group action. You're in a world where being an effective barbarian warlord is difficult and costly, so most prospective barbarians are too lazy to do it. Like, ok, I physically put the bourgeoisie /and/ tankies (my enemies personally) on barbecues and eat them. Then what?

You know what? Then I feel dirty and have to go take a years-long shower to get the Lone Power's filth off me.

/It/ is the real enemy /anyway/, so why even bother with the barbecue? I may not be good at it, but I'm at least aiming at the powers and principalities I genuinely want to overthrow on behalf of my own desires and motivations.
