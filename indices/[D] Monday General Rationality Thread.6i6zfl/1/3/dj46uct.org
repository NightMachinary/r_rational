Nationalise all media, social or otherwise, strictly censor it in favour of the official correct opinions, enact increasingly nuisance punishments for violators (e.g., user-unfriendly interfaces, access limitations and restrictions, notifying your relatives, friends and acquaintances of your politically-incorrect opinions and punishing them in proportion to their proximity to you, loss of formalised social status, monetary fines) and gamification strategies for rewarding continued and active obedience, effectively making people "fake it until they make it".
