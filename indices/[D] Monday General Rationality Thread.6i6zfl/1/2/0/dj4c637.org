No, it's being sad/angry/upset by overexposure to negative news out of proportion to how much that negative news actually impacts your life and/or reflects statistical reality. For a non-current example, things like satanic panic or "super-predators" are extreme cases. Mostly it's about people walking around being sad or angry or afraid because the multimedia landscape, and to a greater or lesser extent, societal forces, have incentives to make them that way.
