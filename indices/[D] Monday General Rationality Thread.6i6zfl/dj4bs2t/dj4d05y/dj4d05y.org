I second this request, for reasons of my wanting to get into a reasonable college.

For the little that it is worth, the most consistently academically successful person I know gave the advice of simply refusing to do anything - including sleep - until you have committed the important points of the day's materials to memory. He is not what I would call superlatively social or physically healthy, and he also has an excellent memory, but that is the best I have.
