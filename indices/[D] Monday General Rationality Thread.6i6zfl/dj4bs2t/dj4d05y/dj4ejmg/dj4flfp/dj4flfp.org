Have you considered Spaced Repetition Systems? It covers both memorizing and - to an extent - tracking progress.

For retention the trick seems to be as EY says: make the knowledge a part of you. Don't favor learning specific declarative facts, and instead favor learning trends, laws, methods etc.. Then context should give you at least much of the rest of the equation. A good example is mathematics. For reason of your being a moderator on this sub I am presuming you understand the universality of the methods of algebra, etc. Generalize from that principle.
