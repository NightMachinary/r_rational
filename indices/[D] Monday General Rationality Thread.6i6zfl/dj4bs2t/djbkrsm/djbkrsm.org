I'm not sure what you mean by overlearning but I've found that a logarithmic rehearsal schedule is effective for memorization. As a heuristic, if you have flash cards, instead of moving the card to the end after rehearsing it, move it back a number of times proportional to how confident you are that you'll remember it next time.
