Anki is very icebergian. It seems like a simple enough program but there are extensions, shared decks, etc all over the place.

For example, as well as my studies and french vocab decks, I have decks for the nations of the world (identifying them on a map, identifying their flag, their capitals). It's pretty useful/useless knowledge.

Plus it's great on a quiz night: "What do Zambia, Kazakhstan, Papua New Guinea and Moldova have in common?" (they all have birds on their flags)
