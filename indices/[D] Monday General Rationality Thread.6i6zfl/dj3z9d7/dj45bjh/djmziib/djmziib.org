Crimes don't end civilization, they don't break cities.

Plagues break cities. That's a black swan result.

I don't understand how you see mere crimes as something that would need to be weeded out on the scale of the discovery (Germ Theory etc) that wiped out all previous hygiene traditions across the world (non-plagued parts of the world, that is).
