  I don't understand how you see mere crimes as something that would need to be weeded out on the scale of the discovery (Germ Theory etc) that wiped out all previous hygiene traditions across the world (non-plagued parts of the world, that is).

I have two reasons for this: one, the chance of a black swan event is much, much smaller. You need to weight outcomes by their probabilities, otherwise you should never ever take any action since every action has a tiny chance of killing everyone on earth.

So the small decrease in the probability of a Black Swan event does not justify the blind following of traditions, which I argue greatly increases the probability of evil/self-destructive behavior.

The second reason is that there is nothing "mere" about crimes. It only looks "mere" for the people who aren't on the receiving end. Whenever an act of evil is committed, especially one that goes unpunished, everyone who so much as hears about it is stained. They now have evidence, that crime can pay. That is a corrupting influence. It's all too easy to think "X got away with major crimes! Surely I can get away with a little one! Surely it's forgivable to commit smaller ones!" And so it spreads, like a mental version of a plague, eating away at our morals and ethics instead of our physical bodies.

So yeah, crimes may not end cities or civilizations, but they can turn them into such horrible dens of evil that it honestly would have been better for them to go extinct.
