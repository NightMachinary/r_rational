This is a strawman of Taleb's views, which I cannot possibly do justice to in a single post. I do not fully agree with Taleb, but his argument is subtler than "it has survived natural selection so we might as well keep doing it." Taleb has explicitly said that he makes exceptions to his arguments for any practices that infringe on ethics. He defends religious practice mostly on a ceremonial and aesthetic basis. So, for example, fasting and prayer are good, but killing apostates is definitely bad. He is against extremism and literalism.

Your point on the trade-off between individual survival and mass replication is good, though.
