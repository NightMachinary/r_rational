  This is a strawman of Taleb's views, which I cannot possibly do justice to in a single post. I do not fully agree with Taleb, but his argument is subtler than "it has survived natural selection so we might as well keep doing it." Taleb has explicitly said that he makes exceptions to his arguments for any practices that infringe on ethics.

That is good to hear, but is still problematic, especially because *everything* "infringes on ethics" to some extent. After all, ethics includes *lies*.

For example, if you perform an action X, you either have to hide it or others will know you have performed X. If you hide it, that almost certainly will involve lying, infringing on ethics. If it's revealed, others will be curious why you perform X. Many will suspect that X has some kind of positive effect, since you are doing X and you haven't died or suffered significant harm from doing X. (Otherwise why would you still be doing X?) And so by doing X, you will be implicitly suggesting to others, that X is a good thing to do. But if you aren't sure that X is a good thing to do, then that is an implicit lie. It infringes on ethics to lead people to do something you aren't sure is good for them.

In effect, saying "obey some rule X unless it infringes on ethics" really says nothing at all, and is the kind of thing you say when you're tired of listening to people tell you how horrible rule X is yet still refuse to acknowledge that rule X is horrible. And it's utterly terrifying when I see "smart", "rational" people say stuff like this.

A few years ago, I stumbled upon a rationality website where the author went on and on about his system of ethics and how wonderful it was. And then, he had a page that said "hey guys, I know this system of ethics sometimes tells you to kill people in certain situations. You should just treat those cases as exceptions, and always obey the system unless it tells you to kill people."

...

Are you freaked out by this? Because I certainly am. Any system of ethics that tells you to kill people in some situations is almost certainly going to tell you to beat people to an inch from death in some cases, two inches in others, three inches in yet more others, and so on. Which of these are exceptions and which aren't!? And why?! The author sadly, did not explain this.
