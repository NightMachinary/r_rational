  (Mind you, there are plenty of well-considered and well-used ethical systems that say it is occasionally, under rare conditions, alright to kill people. Generally as a penalty (for some crime) ordered by a judge or jury.)

Yes I'm realizing I phrased this badly. The killing part isn't the problem. The problem is that the author is advocating a system of ethics he admits is literally fatally flawed in one particular case: the case where the system tells you to kill someone.

The problem is such flaws can never truly be contained in one special case. Flaws leak. There are plenty of ways to generalize that special case so that the flaws spread over the entire system. For example, you could consider all the situations where the system tells you to gamble on someone's life. So rather than 100% kill them, you instead put them at a 99.999% risk of death, a 99.998% risk of death, and so on. If, as the author puts it, you should only ignore the system in the special case where it tells you to kill someone, then what do you do in the 99.999% case? Go ahead and put them at risk of almost certain death?

Either you would have to keep making exceptions for all these generalizations until your original system becomes irrelevant because of all the exception rules, or you insist that we obey the system even in these generalizations. In the latter case, we end up in the weird situation where the slightest change in conditions results in a complete 180 in our decision making process, where 99.999% chance of murder is perfectly good but 100% chance of murder is absolutely bad.

Either way, the fact that there are so many problems suggests that the system is just fundamentally flawed, and that the author should stop advocating it. Yet because he still does, and the exception rules aren't made clear, the followers are going to go around gamble killing people (including innocent people) when the system tells them to and the situation doesn't neatly fall under the exception. Heck, two followers of the same system may even make opposing decisions because of the ill-explained exception rule, causing them to fight and spread more death and destruction.

Bottomline: if you know a system of ethics is so horribly flawed that you have to go around making exceptions to avoid murder fests, *maybe don't advocate that system at all.*
