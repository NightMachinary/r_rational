  Ok, I guess we could quantify the rules by making them add bias to a decision, and arrive at a decision based on the total sum of bias from different rules.
#+end_quote

Yes, precisely.

  However, I shall now argue that the bias from the tradition rule shouldn't even be a positive value.

Hmmm. To summarise your argument; you're saying, in short, that something being Tradition might have either good or bad effects, and you think that it is likely to be bad, on the whole. (Is this right?)

Let me, therefore, provide a counter-argument. The positive bias given to Tradition is not from minor positives or negatives; it is because the odds of an /extremely/ negative Black Swan event are much lower when doing something that has been done for generations.

Let me take an example. It is said that, once, long long ago, in China, there was a bit of a sparrow problem. The sparrows would come into the rice fields and eat the rice; and no matter what the farmers did, they could not keep the sparrows out of their rice.

So, they proceeded upon a program of /extermination/. Throughout the entire country, they killed all the sparrows they could find, by any and every means they had to hand (including, apparently, playing loud drums at all hours so the sparrows could not rest and just collapsed of exhaustion, sometimes mid-fllight). There were a lot of sparrows; but China also has a lot of rice farmers, and they were reasonably successful in their quest; they sharply reduced the number of sparrows.

Then winter hit, and so did the locust swarms. With no sparrows to eat the locusts, well... the result of /that/ was known as the Great Chinese Famine, and it was a pretty terrible time for all concerned.

--------------

The positive bias applied to Tradition isn't because of /minor/ positive or negative effects. It's because we know that there is a /limit/ to the severity of the possible negative effects of following Tradition. If we've been farming using a traditional method for the last hundred years, and we have not in that time had major famines, then that implies that the traditional farming methods are rather unlikely to lead to a famine next year, either. (It doesn't mean we can't improve our farming yields. It just means that if we try to do so, then we must think about the new method carefully first, maybe test it in one field before doing it on the entire farm, just in case).
