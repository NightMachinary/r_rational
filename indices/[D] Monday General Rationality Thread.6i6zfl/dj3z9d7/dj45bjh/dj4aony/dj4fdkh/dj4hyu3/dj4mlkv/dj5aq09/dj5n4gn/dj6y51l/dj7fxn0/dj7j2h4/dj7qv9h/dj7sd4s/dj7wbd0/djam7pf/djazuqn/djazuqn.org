  I don't see how this works. The principles of natural selection in this case can be summarised as "that which keeps me and my close family alive, tends to survive as tradition"; and I'm not seeing the correlation between "keeps me and my family alive" and "does something horrible" (in fact, I'd assume those two were negatively correlated, because deliberately not keeping my and my family alive is pretty horrible on its own).

  So, let me ask, then - why do you think that natural selection leads to horrible outcomes?

Did you not read [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6i6zfl/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/dj45bjh/][my first reply]] at all?

Natural Selection = Survival + *Reproduction* + a bunch of other stuff.

I.e., if a certain behavior adds enough reproduction ability, then even if it seriously hurts survival ability, natural selection will cause it to dominate the system.

You want to see why natural selection is utterly horrible? Walk into a jungle/mountain/tundra/etc. Not one of the manmade ones where we intelligently decide which species to raise. I'm talking about an actual wilderness full of wildlife, where natural selection has full reign. There you will see all kinds of animals performing behaviors that kill themselves.

You will see herbivores bashing theirs skulls against each other for the right to reproduce, even though the head is obviously an important component for survival, and many herbivores end up dying from this every year.

You will see insects performing suicide attacks EVERYWHERE, just to protect their queens. Meanwhile their queen is practically crippled, since natural selection has selected insect queens whose bodies produce so many eggs that the queen just turns into an immobile baby factory. Completely helpless and unable to do anything other than lay eggs and eat the food that is carried to her. Not exactly good for its own survival.

You will see male spiders pursue female ones so they can have sex, even though the female will EAT the male spider immediately after sex. So again, sex > survival. Incidentally, the female spiders that eat their males? Also selected by natural selection! Natural selection weighs the life of that one male spider, versus the amount of nutrition it would give the female spider's numerous eggs, and the eggs are the clear winner. This act of murder by the female spider is their natural tradition.

And, you will see all kinds of evil and depravity. Fiction often portrays humans as the most sinful creatures on the planet... these people just haven't taken biology. There are plenty of animals out there whose behaviors are far worse when put in human terms. I'm not even talking about how cats sadistically torture their food. That is plenty horrible and happens on a larger scale in the wild, but there are actually even more evil things. I'm talking about parasites. Creatures that sneak into the bodies of other creatures and slowly steal their nutrients.

Now you might be thinking, what's so evil about parasitism? Isn't it just like predators eating prey? Well it turns out, natural selection has favored a certain ability in parasites: *MIND CONTROL*. There are many parasites that can alter the behaviors of their hosts. It wasn't bad enough to eat someone from the inside out, these parasites also turn them into zombies that then proceed to perform various self-destructive actions. Or worse, actions that help the parasites infect more of their friends and family. That's right, a zombie apocalypse is a very real thing that happens in nature, thanks to natural selection. (Fortunately, human brains appear much harder to mind control. Or at least, they seem to be.)

When you walk into the wilderness and see such horrors (or just open a biology book), all the horrors chosen by natural selection, you really think it won't choose horrible things for humans? Really? Because we're so so special? Just so you know, for every one of the above behaviors, there are human ones that eerily mirror them.

Herbivores bashing their skulls against each other just so the winner can have sex? Humans have a strange phrase "all's fair in love and war", suggesting all kinds of horrible evils are allowed in the name of love, a concept that generally leads to reproduction. And there's no shortage of "romance idiots" that will act on these principles, forming everything from stalkers, rapists, adulterers, to murder suicides. Yes, strangely enough, murder suicide is a naturally selected behavior. If you can't have someone's good genes, sacrifice yourself to eliminate their genes from the gene pool, so that the people who have your genes have less competition.

Also, female spiders eating their mates to provide nutrients for their eggs? Humans have had, for a very long time, a tradition that's basically this. [[/s][Any guesses what it is?]] And I don't think I need to elaborate on the depraved behaviors of wars and religious frauds.

So yeah, that's why I think natural selection leads to horrible outcomes. Sure it also sometimes leads to good outcomes (maybe), but considering how horrible the bad outcomes can be, you really shouldn't take the risk unless you have a good reason for doing so.
