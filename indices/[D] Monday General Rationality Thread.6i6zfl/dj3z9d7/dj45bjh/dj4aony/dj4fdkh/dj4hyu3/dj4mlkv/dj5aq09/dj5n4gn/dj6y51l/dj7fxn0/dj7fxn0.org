  I think you might be mischaracterising the rule. It's not "Always do what tradition says" - at least not in my understanding of it. It is, rather, "if this is how it was traditionally done, then that fact alone should bias your decision-making in favour of the traditional solution".

Ok, I guess we could quantify the rules by making them add bias to a decision, and arrive at a decision based on the total sum of bias from different rules. In this case, our above arguments demonstrate that the size of the bias from the tradition rule should not be large, since if you can provide a good reason to not do something, that reason should overrule the tradition rule.

However, I shall now argue that the bias from the tradition rule shouldn't even be a positive value. The reason is actually precisely what you stated at the end:

  just because you can't see a reason for the tradition, doesn't mean that there isn't one, and the probable existence of that as-yet-unknown reason should be folded into your decision-making algorithm

I am in full agreement with this. Just because you can't see a reason, doesn't mean there isn't one. Now that reason could be good, but it could also be bad, given the previous arguments on natural selection. This bad reason could be more than self-harm, it could also involve hurting others. And while yes, the good reason may also involve helping others, the point is: if you don't know the reason for doing X yet do X anyway, that's essentially gambling with the wellbeing of yourself and everyone around you.

And, well this might just be my pessimism at work, but given the rules of natural selection, I can't help but think the odds are really stacked against you if X is something many people are doing. Either way, without a good reason for doing so, I don't believe we have the right to gamble with other people's wellbeing, and the Tradition reason is nowhere good enough.
