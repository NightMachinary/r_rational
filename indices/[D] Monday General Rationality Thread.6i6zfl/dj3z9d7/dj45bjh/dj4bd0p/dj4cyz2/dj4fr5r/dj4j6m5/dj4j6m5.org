  I'm kind of surprised that you would complain about [[/u/ShiranaiWakaranai]]'s post being a straw man when you're doing the same thing.
#+end_quote

Strawmanning whom? ShiranaiWakaranai? I didn't make any effort to refute that post, though. I just pointed out that Taleb's views are more sophisticated than what anyone is replying to here.

  See, the thing here is, you don't get to pick and choose what parts of religion other people (the ones that are propagating and actualizing these memes) are going to act out.
#+end_quote

True, this is a problem, and part of where I disagree with Taleb.

  Or, put another way, if you simplify the problem space to religious traditions that aren't harmful, you don't get to use that to prove that religious traditions aren't harmful.
#+end_quote

Of course, but Taleb wants to refute the sort of people who argue against the /benign/ traditions for bad reasons.
