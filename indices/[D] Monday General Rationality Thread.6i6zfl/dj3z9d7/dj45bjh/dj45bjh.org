  He defends religion, tradition, and folk wisdom on the basis of statistical validity and asymmetric payoffs. An example of his type of reasoning: if old traditions had any strongly negative effects, these effects would almost certainly have been discovered by now, and the tradition would have been weeded out. Therefore, any old traditions that survive until today must have, at worst, small, bounded negative effects, but possibly very large positive effects. Thus, adhering to them is valid in a decision-theoretic sense, because they are not likely to hurt you on average but are more amenable to large positive black swans. Alternatively, in modern medical studies and in "naive scientistic thinking", erroneous conclusions are often not known to have bounded negative effects, and so adhering to them exposes you to large negative black swans. (I think this is what he means when he casually uses one of his favorite technical words, "ergodicity," as if its meaning were obvious).

  Example: "My grandma says that if you go out in the cold, you'll catch a cold." Naive scientist: "Ridiculous! Colds are caused by viruses, not actual cold weather. Don't listen to that old wive's tale." Reality: It turns out that cold weather suppresses the immune system and makes you more likely to get sick. Lesson: just because you can't point to a chain of causation, doesn't mean you should dismiss the advice!

NO NO NO! This argument is one of my worst triggers. It's my firm belief that this is biggest reason why the world we live in is the hellhole we know today. Let me break down this argument for you, he's claiming that if everyone takes some action X, X must be positive. If it was negative, people doing X would slowly die off from the consequences of X until no one does X. That sounds plausible, but it's only half of the story.

The thing you need to realize is that for many actions X, X can not only kill you, it can also cause more people to start doing action X. There's an actual term that describes this process: natural selection.

Given any system of objects that can produce (slightly different) copies of themselves, what kinds of objects will dominate? A naive thinker would go "OH OH I KNOW: *survival of the fittest*!" and then talk about how the objects that are strongest, the objects that are healthiest, the objects that take the least self-harming actions, would dominate the system over time. Oh happy happy world.

The truth is, the phrase "*survival of the fittest*" may have been the single worst scientific marketing blunder in the history of science. And that's saying something since they make other kinds of shitty blunders like "global warming" all the time. Descriptions of scientific phenomena that give laypeople ideas that are completely off the mark. For example, the layperson that hears global warming thinks "oh no the earth is getting hotter everywhere", when actually its the average temperature that is getting hotter, and some places may actually become colder. And so you end up with politicians throwing snowballs around claiming that debunks global warming. *facepalm*.

The same thing is happening here. Fittest, does *not* mean the best at surviving. That is part of it, but a much much larger part of it is best at *reproducing*. Frankly, if there's a way to trade half your lifespan for several times more children, natural selection would welcome it with open arms. For example: an impotent human with the healthiest habits in the world will be removed from the system in a generation. Meanwhile, all kinds of rapists, adulterers, playboys, gigolos, prostitutes and what not continue to linger in the system, even if they have a whole host of behaviors that tend to harm themselves. In a sense, rape and adultery ARE traditions. They are actions that a significant fraction of the population do and have been doing for eons past, and will likely continue to do generations into the future.

Are these actions positive? Do they help you survive? Hell freaking no. They are crimes, so you get caught by police and punished, and such punishments tend to reduce your lifespan significantly. And even if there are no police, these actions still earn people's hatred, and may then cause you to be murdered in your sleep. But they help produce children. Children with your genes. And while yes, environmental factors can easily cause the child to abandon the way of the rapist or the adulterer (so you certainly shouldn't demand children be hanged for the sins of their parents), they now have a genetic push towards them, as well as a push from every idiot that says "TRADITIONS ARE ALWAYS GOOD". And so rapists and adulterers continue to make up a significant fraction of the population. It's the miracle of natural selection! Woohoo (sarcasm)!

Now you might be thinking, "well okay, I'll just stay away from the traditions that involve having sex then. Surely they must be all good for survival now?" Still wrong. Because you can be a gene protector even without having sex. Consider racism. Racism was (and probably still is in many places) quite literally a tradition. A whole set of traditions even. Traditions you might not even think are associated with racism, yet have racist effects. Racism, from a natural selection point of view, is extremely good. When you oppress and kill people who don't have your genes, people who do have your genes have less competition for resources. But is racism good for you on a personal level? No. Racism prompts you to fight. Fighting involves risk to life and limb. You could easily get yourself killed or permanently crippled in these fights. Yet it is still everywhere because of natural selection.

Natural selection rejoices in making suicidal idiots for its cause. Kind of like bees really. There are bees that don't reproduce at all, and basically perform suicide attacks on any creature that attacks their hive. You know, suicide attacks: bad for personal survival, good for gene survival! And these suicidal bees are everywhere. Truly a great tradition (sarcasm)!

And the worst part is, actions can reproduce in ways other than genes. Memes are a thing. You see this happening in real life all the time: successful people go around writing books about the actions they took to become successful, and people follow those actions to try and also become successful. In a sense, religious wars are the meme version of racism. If you oppress and kill the people who don't have your memes, people with your memes have less competition. Natural selection and tradition prompts you to be the suicidal bee, sacrificing your personal wellbeing (along with the wellbeing of people who don't have your memes), for the sake for the people who do have your memes.

Frankly natural selection just loves evil and self-harm. There's just so much stuff you can do for your genes/memes by being evil and suicidal that it's the overwhelming favorite of natural selection. Hence reality being the hellhole that it is today.

So the next time you see a tradition, or something everyone else is doing. Stop for a moment and think: do I know the logic behind these actions? Can I point to a chain of causation? Otherwise, there's a significant chance that chain of causation is some kind of suicidal evil that protects/generates genes/memes.
