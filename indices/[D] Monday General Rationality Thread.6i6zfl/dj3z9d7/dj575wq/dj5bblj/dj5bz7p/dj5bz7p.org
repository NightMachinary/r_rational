  a myth you tell yourself to motivate good behaviors.
#+end_quote

How do you differentiate between the myths that motivate good behavior and those that motivate bad behavior? All myths claim that their mandated behavior is good.

If you are able to differentiate between good and bad based on something other than what religion tells you, then what do you need religion for?

How does adding a layer of myths improve anything?
