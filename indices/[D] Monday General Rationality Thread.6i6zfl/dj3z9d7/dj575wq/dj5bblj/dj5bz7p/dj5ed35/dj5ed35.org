  How do you differentiate between the myths that motivate good behavior and those that motivate bad behavior?
#+end_quote

There's good in the sense of ethics, and then there's good in the sense of health. We can differentiate good ethics purely on principle, but it is harder to get powerful enough statistical evidence for health, in which case we default to antifragility analysis.

  How does adding a layer of myths improve anything?
#+end_quote

Presumably because it is better at motivating "healthy" behaviors than anything else. Abstract reason is not as emotionally appealing as a vivid myth.

Though I would argue that having epistemically true beliefs is good as a matter of ethics and long-term strategy, and therefore there is an ethical imperative to work around this motivation problem.
