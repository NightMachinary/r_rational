I am not familiar with Taleb, but only commenting on the arguments as presented in your post.

#+begin_quote
  He considers erudition a virtue [...]
#+end_quote

I do agree that knowledge is important.

#+begin_quote
  (Example of when thinking "linearly" doesn't apply: the minority rule).
#+end_quote

I read the linked article, and found it devoid of insight, but rather a collection of anecdotes. Some seemed quite forced, compounded by the fact that it tried to argue multiple theses depending on the previous ones. The chain of logic went from obvious statements to false ones quite nicely.

#+begin_quote
  If old traditions had any strongly negative effects, these effects would almost certainly have been discovered by now, and the tradition would have been weeded out.
#+end_quote

I do not agree with this argument at all. The length of time something has been around for is not a strong indicator of usefulness. Many traditions (e.g. not washing your hands) have survived for thousands of years, yet abolishing them has yielded the most substantial improvement's in quality of life. (Also note, that this argument is not falsifiable by presenting some currently ongoing tradition.)

For any tradition to be continued, it is only necessary for public belief to support its continuation. This is a weak indicator of any actual effects, but due to the huge influence of cognitive biases not a strong indicator. The process which produces the best predictions of reality (that are available to us) is called science (by definition). Things, with potentially huge downsides, you need to investigate carefully (/including/ a variety of sources, like historical data) and apply error bars generously. And after you have done so, and the results are in, /you update your probabilities and move on/.

#+begin_quote
  Alternatively, in modern medical studies and in "naive scientist thinking", erroneous conclusions are often not known to have bounded negative effects, and so adhering to them exposes you to large negative black swans.
#+end_quote

Traditions are not known "to have bounded negative effects", only to have had bounded negative affects in the past (even that statement is generous). Everything changes over time, and even knowledge that hold true for a long time may become outdated. It is, of course, possible to extrapolate from previously collected data in a reliable fashion. This is also called science.

#+begin_quote
  Example: "My grandma says that if you go out in the cold, you'll catch a cold." Naive scientist: "Ridiculous! Colds are caused by viruses, not actual cold weather. Don't listen to that old wive's tale."
#+end_quote

Actual scientist: "Let me do a study on this and get back to you."

#+begin_quote
  Reality: It turns out that cold weather suppresses the immune system and makes you more likely to get sick.
#+end_quote

Actual scientist: "You're welcome."

This is (obviously) arguing a straw-man, of course you should not be na√Øve.

#+begin_quote
  Scientists: "Fat is bad for you! Cut it out of your diet!"
#+end_quote

Somehow I doubt that there were many scientists expressing that sentiment. (Feel free to drop the link to any paper you might have cited this from, however.)

As far as I know, the evidence points in the direction of a balanced diet having no significant disadvantages (for an average person). Claims in the media tend to be exaggerated. As there is evidence that having a balanced diet has no significant disadvantages, and there is a lack of evidence for any change having advantages, being conservative regarding your nutrition is only rational (without any appeal to tradition).

#+begin_quote
  For the same sorts of reasons, Taleb defends religious traditions and is a practicing Christian, even though he seems to view the existence of God as an irrelevant question. He simply believes in belief as an opaque but valid strategy that has survived the test of time. [...]

  #+begin_quote
    Some unrigorous journalists who make a living attacking religion typically discuss "rationality" without getting what rationality means in its the decision-theoretic sense (the only definition that can be consistent). I can show that it is rational to "believe" in the supernatural if it leads to an increase in payoff. Rationality is NOT belief, it only correlates to belief, sometimes very weakly (in the tails).
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

I agree with the sentiment expressed in the quote. Rational actions, by definition, are the one with the highest payoff. Neither the practice nor the belief of religion is necessarily incompatible with a belief in rationality. However, I find it unlikely that the /methods/ of religion (a part of the beliefs) are effective (i.e. compatible with a belief in rationality).

#+begin_quote
  The argument is that these advanced techniques, combined with the mass replication and planting of such crops, amounts to applying an uncertain treatment uniformly across a population, and thus results in a catastrophic single point of failure.
#+end_quote

The logic depends on these techniques, which have been studied extensively, being more uncertain than traditional agriculture in a changing environment. I see no reason to believe that more advanced techniques are somehow more dangerous, but also able to---coincidentally---hide this fact under investigation.

#+begin_quote
  The fact that nothing bad has happened with GMOs in the past is not good statistical evidence, according to Taleb, that nothing bad will happen in the future.
#+end_quote

The fact that nothing bad has happened with traditional agriculture in the past is not good statistical evidence that nothing bad will happen in the future. Scientific research, however, is good evidence.

#+begin_quote
  There being no good evidence against current GMOs is secondary to the "precautionary principle," that we should not do things in black swan territory that could result in global catastrophes if we are wrong [...]
#+end_quote

Doing nothing may also lead to disaster. There are no safe choices.

#+begin_quote
  Taleb also strongly advocates that people should put their "skin in the game." In rationalist-speak, he means that you should bet on your beliefs, and be willing to take a hit if you are wrong.
#+end_quote

This is excellent advice.
