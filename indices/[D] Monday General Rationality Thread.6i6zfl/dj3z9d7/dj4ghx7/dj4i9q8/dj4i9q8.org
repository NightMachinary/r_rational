  I am not familiar with Taleb, but only commenting on the arguments as presented in your post.
#+end_quote

Maybe I should have asked people not to comment unless they had read all of Taleb's books, plus his personal website and facebook posts. Not that your comment is bad (it isn't), but a lot of the stuff that people are bringing up is addressed very thoroughly in his writing. I assumed that more people here would have read Taleb on the general principle of reading lots of different viewpoints, so that they would be on the same page as me, but either I was mistaken or those people are not commenting.

  I read the linked article, and found it devoid of insight, but rather a collection of anecdotes
#+end_quote

Yeah, that's one of the things that really frustrates me about Taleb. His arguments are filled with disjointed, half-baked examples.

  The length of time something has been around for is not a strong indicator of usefulness.
#+end_quote

Eh, sort of. See the other comments here addressing this.

  Actual scientist: "Let me do a study on this and get back to you."
#+end_quote

Taleb would defend the actual scientist here. But I have seen plenty of people who think they are smart act like the naive scientist.

  Doing nothing may also lead to disaster. There are no safe choices.

Simulated Nassim Taleb replies: "That's like saying that even regular driving carries a risk of death, so I might as well drunk-drive! It completely misses the point of /asymmetric/ risk! Traditional agriculture does not end the world with any serious probability, because if it did, we would already be dead (this is the principle of ergodicity). GMOs, on the other hand, have not been tested for long enough to rule-out fat-tails."
