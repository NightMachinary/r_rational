What do you mean by "conservative with your diet"?

Are you saying there has been a valid, optimal diet recommendation this last century?

The newest dietary guidelines limited added sugar intake to 10% of daily caloric intake. So not even a full soda.

Fat has been banned for a while, with carbs the only alternative. But now high-glycemic index carbs are being vilified.

I'm not sure how we can ignore the heavy-handed influence on the market that Science has enjoyed this last century.

Wether it be a false recommendation of safety, a lack of warning, or a false warning, "science" and /science/ does not have clearly, presently, valid conclusions all the time. There is no alternative to "conservatively" examining the hell out of the expressed theories; *I don't think there exists a conservative middle ground to safely navigate.*
