  What do you mean by "conservative with your diet"?
#+end_quote

I meant that a rational person with a balanced diet should not spend much time optimizing further. (This obviously does not apply to persons with a medical condition.)

  The newest dietary guidelines limited added sugar intake to 10% of daily caloric intake. So not even a full soda.
#+end_quote

According to my back-on-the-envelope calculation that recommendation would evaluate to 2.17 cans of Cola for an active, 30 year old male, per day. That aside, I do not see your problem with that recommendation.

  Fat has been banned for a while, with carbs the only alternative. But now high-glycemic index carbs are being vilified.

Please provide a source.

  I'm not sure how we can ignore the heavy-handed influence on the market that Science has enjoyed this last century.
#+end_quote

Science gains credibility because it works. It provides increasingly accurate descriptions of reality. Facts are often able to influence a market. This is good, and I don't think you are arguing against /that/.

Notice, however, that it is beneficial for a product to /appear/ as if based on scientific evidence, even if the actual science does not warrant the underlying conclusions. In general, scientists are very careful in their statements (they have to be, otherwise they would not pass peer-review), and claims tend to be exaggerated by other parties. Additionally, what you are calling Science consists of numerous independent research groups, distributed all over the planet. The coordination necessary for the 'heavy-handed influence' you imply simply does not exist.

  Wether it be a false recommendation of safety, a lack of warning, or a false warning, "science" and /science/ does not have clearly, presently, valid conclusions all the time.
#+end_quote

Please provide sources to the examples you are referring to.

Are you saying that science is not infallible? That is obviously true, but also misleading. It is self-correcting, highly accurate and the best tool we have.

#+begin_quote
  There is no alternative to "conservatively" examining the hell out of the expressed theories; I don't think there exists a conservative middle ground to safely navigate.
#+end_quote

I am not sure what exactly your point is. As long as there are multiple competing theories and there is an actual scientific debate, you might want to hold out on making substantial changes. Instead, adopt recommendations based on the scientific consensus, which changes very rarely.
