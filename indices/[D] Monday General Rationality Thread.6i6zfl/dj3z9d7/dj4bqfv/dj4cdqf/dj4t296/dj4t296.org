Well, here are some additional possible angles of criticism, besides what ShiranaiWakaranai has said higher.

1.1) (this one can be seen as a follow-up to ShiranaiWakaranai's comment) if he can criticize Dawkins for “not understanding probability”, then Dawkins can criticise him for not understanding evolution and the core idea of memetics. Especially since these concepts serve as pretty good counter-arguments against what you've described in your original comment (unless he does address this somewhere else, and you didn't include it due to space limitations).

1.2)

#+begin_quote
  any old traditions that survive until today must have, at worst, small, bounded negative effects,
#+end_quote

Unless the negative effects are such that they can't easily be traced back to their source. Or ones that are so overwhelming that we can't even notice them and imagine an alternative society where they don't exist. Or ones that the old traditions themselves are presenting as not negative effects at all, and maybe even as positive ones.

#+begin_quote
  but possibly very large positive effects
#+end_quote

As ShiranaiWakaranai's said, this doesn't necessarily follow from the previous statement.

1.3)

  "My grandma says that if you go out in the cold, you'll catch a cold." Naive scientist: "Ridiculous! Colds are caused by viruses, not actual cold weather. Don't listen to that old wive's tale." Reality: It turns out that cold weather suppresses the immune system and makes you more likely to get sick.
#+end_quote

What is omitted from here is that once the naive scientist finally figures out exactly how are the cold and the viral infections related, they update their advice to be more accurate and helpful. Meanwhile, if you ask the grandma /why/ it is that you'll catch a cold if you go out in the cold, she'll likely be unable to provide a deeper explanation (due to various reasons, including the limited amount of information that can be passed through generations as traditions and common sense). This lack of deeper insight, among other things, is also bad because it can easily be hijacked by third parties if they give plausible-enough sounding explanations. Best case scenario, this will be the naive scientist themselves (prior to updating their understanding of the link between cold and infections), and worst case scenario it will be someone who's motivated in the hijacking because of nefarious self-interest (e.g. a politician pandering to the crowd, a cult member, etc).

1.4)

#+begin_quote
  Things that have endured for a long time are, by probability, likely to endure - otherwise they would have died out already. It is hard to see The Odyssey, The Bible, The Iliad and similar works being forgotten, whereas last year's bestseller is unlikely to be remembered in 1000 years.

Thinking About the Present As If It Were the Past/]] --- haven't read it yet, but I think it's relevant here. The point being that “it is hard to see The Bible being forgotten” because it both had a better (earlier) opportunity to get itself established in the public awareness /and/ is designed to be propagating itself throughout the generations. Imagine a society where people have to wait for the children to become adults before they can be talking with them about religions or classical literature --- all the “endurance” of these memes would greatly suffer in such a world. Facebook is a shitty social media platform, but it's hard to get rid of it, because it had the opportunity to garner a very large userbase for itself.

  He defends religion, tradition, and folk wisdom on the basis of statistical validity and asymmetric payoffs. [...] Alternatively, in modern medical studies and in "naive scientistic thinking", erroneous conclusions are often not known to have bounded negative effects, and so adhering to them exposes you to large negative black swans.
#+end_quote

This looks like an example of false dichotomy: it is possible to both get rid of the inefficient [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncoding_DNA#Junk_DNA][(and\or placebo)]] traditionalist rituals /and/ minimise the risks of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quackery_involving_radioactive_substances][unknown negative effects]] from new scientific discoveries (e.g. through tighter regulations, more thorough research on the technologies before they are released to open market, addressing the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis][replication crisis,]] etc).

3.1)

#+begin_quote
  Religion is a prime example of the 'antifragile'.
#+end_quote

What if we-as-a-civilisation have reached the point where the current flavours of widespread religions are soon to lose their “antifragile” property, like it has already happened with greek mythology, etc? In other words, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalcy_bias][just because the Abrahamic religions have managed to survive for so long, doesn't mean that they won't decline in popularity and perish on their own some time soon.]]

3.2) If he supports traditional religious rituals at least in some manner because they're “antifragile”, doesn't that make his argument into an example of circular reasoning?

p.s. A person can have a high IQ and\or erudition and /still/ manage to hold to false beliefs and inconsistent worldview. E.g. if the operating system itself is buggy, it doesn't matter how powerful is the machine it's running on, it will still pop out errors.

p.p.s. I feel like /there are/ some very good notions among all the stuff you've described mr. Taleb saying, but they have to be dug out of all the faulty reasoning and burnished, much like some ideas that the ancient philosophers had to share.
