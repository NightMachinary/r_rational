  Unless the negative effects are such that they can't easily be traced back to their source. Or ones that are so overwhelming that we can't even notice them and imagine an alternative society where they don't exist. Or ones that the old traditions themselves are presenting as not negative effects at all, and maybe even as positive ones.

In all of these cases, the negative effects in question:

- are not extinction-level
- do not result in a society significantly worse than our current society

Those are the bounds by which the potential negative effects seem to be bound. Yes, there may be some tradition out there with /massive/ negative effects which will become obvious once that tradition is discontinued - but society has existed with those negative effects for so long already, that it doesn't seem they're going to make society worse if continued for a bit.

So, yeah, I can see where the idea that traditions should have bounded negative effects comes from, and it seems sensible.
