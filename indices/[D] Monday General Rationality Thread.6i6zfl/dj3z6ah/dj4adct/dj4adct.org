I would say it's more enabled than created by the media. There's a reason that clickbait exists, and it's that human brains are primed for it. Same with "if it bleeds, it leads", which has been a guiding principle of yellow journalism for a long time. Changing the human brain is (mostly) right out, unless you're a world-class writer/thinker who can sway people away from negativity, or you want to muck around in gray matter, which isn't technically feasible.

Large companies like Facebook, Reddit, and Google are entirely capable of doing sentiment analysis and directing people away from the things that make them angry, upset, sad, etc. They actually do this, to a limited extent, but there are some rightful (and wrongful) free speech and bias concerns. It's more difficult to figure out which things make people angry/upset/sad for the right reasons, whatever those are, and to steer them away from things like righteous indignation or political action, but it's probably doable. If people knew (or found out) you would have to worry about evasion, which would be a whole problem by itself. I don't think it's really the right way to go because of the pushback it would get.

A better method is probably just a change in the cultural zeitgeist so that people focus themselves on spreading positivity and warmth in the world, but I sort of doubt that's going to happen unless it can gain some countercultural traction. You see it a little bit in the "wholesome" subreddits, I guess.
