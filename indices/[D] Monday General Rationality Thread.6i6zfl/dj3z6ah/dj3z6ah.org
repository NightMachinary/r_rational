I've recently read a number of articles/posts/stuff which proclaim a general despair of the "culture war", "social media", "mainstream media", etc. One thing which can be agreed on, is that this problem is created an enabled by modern communications technology, whether you consider that the Internet, TV, radio, or printing press.

For the sake of assume this /is/ is a technological problem (as opposed to an alien brain parasite), and that there /is/ a technological solution to said problem. What does this solution look like? I suppose mass wireheading would solve it, but that's the most brute-force approach. Actually, no, the most brute-force solution is planetary extinction via de-orbited celestial body. We should try to come up with a somewhat less harmful solution. Our victory condition is a sufficient reduction in perceived negativity that people don't feel compelled to blog about public negativity.

A few ideas to get started:

You could ban media which exceeds some arbitrary limit of negativity. This would require control of media to enforce said ban, so that's out.

You could genetically modify people to be happier (CRISPR?) bit that would take multiple generations to achieve the necessary scale.

You could create Social_Media_But_Better which has active or passive countermeasures against increasing negativity. More feasibly, invent such tech and get an existing media company to buy and integrate it.
