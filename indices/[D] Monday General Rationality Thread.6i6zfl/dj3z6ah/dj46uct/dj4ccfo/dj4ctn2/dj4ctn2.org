If you're the dominant military and economic power, this can easily be combined with economic, military and cultural imperialism to ensure your ideology is the government-sponsored norm worldwide, willingly or otherwise, or near enough so that the outliers can be branded as "rogue states" and subjected to crippling sanctions and targetted killings by superior military technology to which they have zero forceful or judicial recourse. This, in turn, may result in asymmetric warfare attempts from those countries, which you can label as terrorism to further delegitimise them, their ideology, and anyone who subverts yours.
