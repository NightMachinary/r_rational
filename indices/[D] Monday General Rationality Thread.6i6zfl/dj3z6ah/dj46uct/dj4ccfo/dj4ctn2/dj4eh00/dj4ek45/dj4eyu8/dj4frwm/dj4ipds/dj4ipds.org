I guess I have three actual objections here:

- I really, sincerely don't expect it to work.

- I really, sincerely expect it to blow up in the face of anyone who tried it. I really don't think you can make people suppress their own needs and desires to such an extent.

- It just seems kinda boring. Ultimate sociological control -- for what? What /could/ I indoctrinate people into that I actually want or need to? How does this make the world a more enjoyable place to live, especially for me, the Emperor of Mankind ;-)?
