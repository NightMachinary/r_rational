Put here because original comment was too long:

*Taleb the Libertarian Anti-Transhumanist*

Taleb's political views are somewhat difficult to figure out. (Actually a lot of his personal beliefs are difficult to figure out, either because he forms no beliefs out of epistemic humility, or because he explicitly considers it a virtue to be opaque, to the great frustration of every rationalist who has tried to understand him. See his cryptic April 30th facebook post, [[https://www.facebook.com/nntaleb/?fref=nf]["Never explain why something is important"]]. Notice how he stays true to this advice regarding the advice itself.). As far as I can tell, he is not a Trump supporter (because he voted third-party according to at least one interview), but he considers a lot of Trump's policies as a step in the right direction due to axing blanket legislation that acts as a single point of failure and a black swan attractor. Taleb's nonchalance in the presence of Trump is due to the fact that he (rightly) considers most news stories as noise with no signal which ultimately won't affect anything. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKW0LbeiWio][See this interview]]. He ignores the way Trump talks and claims that just looking at actions, he is not much different than other politicians (really, Taleb???). He despises Hillary Clinton, not only because he doesn't like her policies, but apparently because he considers her as utterly devoid of morality and skin in the game. He dislikes labelling himself, but I would guess that he is mostly a libertarian, believing that small local governments and redundant economies are more robust (and "antifragile") than large governments.

Toy example of a globalistic over-optimization that leads to non-redundancy and fragility: Country A has a comparative advantage in food production and country B has a comparative advantage in machine production. So B produces all the farming equipment and A produces all the food, the two countries trade, everyone is happy. Whoops, country A's regime collapsed in a brutal civil war - now everyone in B starves to death because they have no redundant farming economy of their own. But country C depended entirely on B for mining equipment, so their economy collapses too, and so on. The errors propagate until the whole world economy collapses. Lesson: interdependent globalism without local error-absorption barriers is a ticking time-bomb.

I expect Taleb would dislike the rationalist community because he would consider us to be over-optimizers who have fallen prey to overconfidence bias, who are unaware of asymmetric payoffs, and who apply linear statistical thinking where it doesn't work. In other words, he would denounce us for talking like we're high-and-mighty empiricists while being too lazy to carry out actual experiments or learn the ultra-advanced theoretical statistics necessary to properly understand the data we have received.

If Taleb delved further into the rationalist community, he would likely commend some of our people on their willingness to bet on their beliefs and on their approach to scientific rigor, for rationalists have a philosophy closer to his own beliefs than he realizes. But he would still strongly condemn transhumanism. This is because he views risk-taking as a virtue and an inseparable part of life, and he views transhumanism as wanting to remove all risk from existence. If there is no /real/ risk of death, then nothing is exciting anymore! Transhumanism just makes everything fragile and removes a critical aspect of the environment that we evolved to flourish in, or so he would argue.

The most frustrating thing I find about Taleb (aside from his unnecessary combativeness) is that he can be very difficult to understand when he is making an argument. Sometimes he gives examples without explanation, simply saying that the general principle of the example should be clear. Other times he doesn't even give the whole example, but makes cryptic references and allows the reader to fill in the details. I wonder if he does all this on purpose - I remember him saying something in Antifragile about how you learn more from teachers who are hard to understand, simply because you are forced to pay more attention. It took me a while to comprehend his worldview, but I think I've accurately represented it.
