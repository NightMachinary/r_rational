  I only saw others addressing the ethics of traditional behaviors. Mind dropping a quote?

You're right, the other comments aren't that related this particular issue. Let me respond here.

/Simulated Nassim Taleb/ replies:

The long-term survival of a practice is evidence that there are no (probable, fat-tailed) terminal or absorbing states. Here we model the evolution of a practice as a Markov chain with possible absorbing states, where in reality, an absorbing state corresponds to anything that ends the practice. This could be total extinction, the deaths of the practitioners, or just something like the societal recognition that the practice has a bad effect. The case of hand-washing is an example of this last effect, where unsanitary practices hit the absorbing barrier of falsification. A "bounded" negative effect is any bad effect that is not an absorbing state in the chain. Certainly, bad practices can remain for a long time due to belief, but /really bad/ practices tend to be falsified with time. The great contribution of science is that it strongly improved our ability to discover and falsify bad practices.

In general, in the case of fat-tailed distributions, the fact that something has happened in the past is not good evidence that it won't happen in the future. The is the /Black Swan/ problem, which I wrote a whole book about! Alternatively, you only need /one/ example of something happening to falsify it! This leads us to the principle of /via negativa/: traditional practices that are /negative/, that is, tell you /not/ to do something, are generally more trustworthy than /positive/ practices. This is because at worst, not doing a particular thing is usually neutral, and at best, that particular tradition arose in opposition to previous falsified practice. So, for example, if your grandma tells you not to go out in the cold, it might be superstition, or it might be because people noticed a legitimate black swan problem with the opposite advice.

  Applied to your metaphor: "There is no point in wearing a seat belt! I drove around for decades without one, and I'm fine!

/Simulated Nassim Taleb/ replies:

This is precisely backwards with regards to the GMO problem. Transgenic GMO advocates are telling us to /take off/ the seatbelt after wearing it for years, because car crashes don't happen that often anyway. Here, the "seatbelt" is local, incremental, bounded modification. Traditional cross-breeding practices are strongly unlikely to propagate errors globally (this practice has occurred for thousands of years!). Whereas GMOs correspond to large, global modifications, serious black swan territory without local absorption barriers for errors!

I don't necessary agree with how far (simulated) Nassim Taleb takes his conclusions. Regarding the assumptions you list at the end, the most important one is the ergodicity of earth and human culture as a system. I think Taleb would argue that these complex systems tend to be ergodic over thousands of years as a rule, but I would want to see more evidence of this. Regarding the 100 years assumption: Taleb would say that 100 years is not long at all, and that modern agriculture is probably /already/ very fragile. Regarding the third assumption, Taleb would say you don't need to /deploy/ anything, just analyze the systemic properties of the practice.
