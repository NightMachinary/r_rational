  Maybe I should have asked people not to comment unless they had read all of Taleb's books, plus his personal website and facebook posts.
#+end_quote

That would be an unreasonable burden on the commenters and is unlikely to yield more useful comments. I am willing to spent a few hours reading an opinion I find flawed, but after some time there just is no expected utility in it. (At some point the probability of me being unable to understand the argument drops too low, compared to the probability of the author's argument being flawed. That is just a general heuristic.)

Also beware of being in an echo chamber; people who have read all his books are likely to agree with him.

  Eh, sort of. See the other comments here addressing this.

I only saw others addressing the ethics of traditional behaviors. Mind dropping a quote?

  Simulated Nassim Taleb replies: "That's like saying that even regular driving carries a risk of death, so I might as well drunk-drive! It completely misses the point of asymmetric risk!
#+end_quote

This is backwards. The point was /not/, that in an absence of safe choices the most dangerous one was preferable. But that risks have to be assessed and the assumption of a risk-free alternative does not hold.

Applied to your metaphor: "There is no point in wearing a seat belt! I drove around for decades without one, and I'm fine! This means that not wearing a seat belt does not kill me with serious probability, since I would have been long dead by now. But who knows what might happen if I put it on? After all, it could cut me, maybe trap me inside the car, or provide a false sense of security. No, driving without is perfectly safe and will always be."

  Traditional agriculture does not end the world with any serious probability, because if it did, we would already be dead (this is the principle of ergodicity).
#+end_quote

Citing [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodicity][Wikipedia]]: "In probability theory, an ergodic dynamical system is one that, broadly speaking, has the same behavior averaged over time as averaged over the space of all the system's states in its phase space."

This is a simplifying assumption (when applied to the system earth), that does not hold in reality. (Just look at a graph of surface temperatures.)

As I understand the concept (and please correct me if I am wrong) the argument goes like this: When a system is ergodic, a measurement of a probability over a long period of time automatically gives the probability of that behavior in a random state. Meaning that any tradition is automatically safe, since it has previously exhibited a probability of extinction in the vicinity of 0.

In a mathematical sense, this is a correct deduction. But please note (some of) the implicit assumptions:

- The earth is an ergodic system.
- 100 years is a long time (the time we have been doing traditional agriculture without it causing an extinction).
- The only way to measure extinction-level risk of technologies is by employing these technologies on a large scale.
