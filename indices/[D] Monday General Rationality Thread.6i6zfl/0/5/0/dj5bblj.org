I mean, I /agree/ with this sentiment. But Taleb doesn't really think that religion has epistemic content anyway; he even compares believing in God to believing in Santa Claus in one of the links. He considers religious belief as something different altogether, a /non-epistemic/ mode of thinking, a myth you tell yourself to motivate good behaviors. This is, of course, an extremely alien mode of thinking to most people on [[/r/rational]], including myself, and I don't really agree, but was using it as example of how he applies his decision theory.

/Sigh/ maybe I should have stuck with Taleb's stuff about quantitative finance.
