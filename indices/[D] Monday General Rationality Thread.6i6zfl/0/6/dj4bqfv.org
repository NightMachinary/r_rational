  What I would like is for the rationalist community to spend some serious time considering what Taleb has to say, and either integrating his techniques into their practices or giving a technical explanation of why they are wrong.

Wouldn't this mean that any analysis or criticism regarding his views would have to come from people who have proven to understand statistics --- and mathematics in general --- without having strayed off into [[/r/badmathematics/]] territory? And the arguments themselves would have to be based on stat\math related concepts, so essentially they'd be made by and for people who know their math?

And if that's the case, then I guess the ending request in your comment should also be to /first/ prove that the commenter knows their math or go learn it (“BRB!”) and only /afterwards/ make their opinions known regarding this mr. Taleb's stances, in this discussion tree (or any future ones related to it).
