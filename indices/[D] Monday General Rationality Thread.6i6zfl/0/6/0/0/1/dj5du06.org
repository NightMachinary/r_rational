Good responses in general, though I don't know enough to assess how they stack up to Taleb's technical arguments. I'll just say one or two things.

1.2) See my responses to suyjuris about survivability and "boundedness"

1.3) /Simulated Nassim Taleb/ replies: Complex systems generally do not have discoverable causal pathways; that is, the causal complex behind any specific phenomenon is often not going to be captured in any quickly describable or statistically testable way. Thus, we must evaluate decision-making in such settings empirically, without resorting to explanation (which only introduces model error). By all means, refute old wisdom with empirical evidence, and if you can find /strong/ evidence for a causal pathway, great. But otherwise, don't pretend you understand the phenomenon, or that describing a plausible-sounding causal mechanism automatically makes you smart.

2) Sure

3.1) Interesting. [/Simulated Nassim Taleb/ replies: Bodily evolution is slow, on the timescales of hundreds of thousands to millions of years. Therefore, it is not likely that the basic antifragile health benefits of religious practices (at least, the /via negativa/ practices), which are tailored to the complex system of the human body, have changed over so short a period of time as thousands of years.] Is simulated Taleb's argument misleading? Perhaps.

3.2) I.e., they're traditional because they're antifragile, but we know they're antifragile because they're traditional? /That/ is circular, though the actual argument is just traditional ==> antifragile, I think.

  p.s. A person can have a high IQ and\or erudition and still manage to hold to false beliefs and inconsistent worldview.

Of course, though strong indicators of intelligence should at least give us pause.

  p.p.s. I feel like there are some very good notions among all the stuff you've described

I recommend reading Taleb, even if you disagree with him, because he has some extremely useful thinking tools that I've never seen anywhere else. His ideas exposed me to complex systems theory and fat-tailed analysis, which I had never seen anyone address before, apparently because those topics are just hard to work with in the real world due to not providing answers as satisfying as neat thin-tailed analysis.
