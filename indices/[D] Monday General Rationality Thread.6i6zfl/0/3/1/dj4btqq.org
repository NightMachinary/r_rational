  I don't think he does a good job of taking the ideas and criticisms of others into account.
#+end_quote

Agreed. He makes himself almost unapproachable in this regard, at least online. Dissenters in the comments sections of his facebook posts are ridiculed.

#+begin_quote
  So, is it rational to discount the arguments of conspiracy theorists on no other basis than that mistrust?
#+end_quote

I don't think Taleb should be put in the same bucket as conspiracy theorists. Also, your question has an equal and opposite, namely: Is it rational to trust the arguments of someone established to be a strong rationalist even if you don't fully understand them?

#+begin_quote
  I think the answer has to be that the sources of these theories aren't trustworthy enough to support their extraordinary claims.
#+end_quote

Taleb doesn't care about epistemology so much as he cares about decision-making, and the interesting thing is that his main arguments tend to mirror the idea of distrusting theories that can't produce extraordinary evidence. Namely, he argues that under many cases of real-world uncertainty, your "default" behavior should be tradition and well-established heuristics, and you should only depart from these if you have a very strong reason.
