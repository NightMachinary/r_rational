#+begin_quote
  is it rational to always accept an argument that you can't fault, even if you suspect that the source of the argument is biased or untrustworthy?
#+end_quote

The /always/ part is a trivial no. If a hostile superintelligence puts forward an argument I can't fault in, I try my best to behave as if that damned thing had never spoken to me. Even changing my behavior in the opposite direction from where the argument points is most likely letting the interlocutor manipulate me. This also applies well below "superintelligence" to people who just happen to have cached arguments I've never heard before.

Arguments /just are/ social manipulation. That is their chief function. That's /why/ the discipline of logic, and thence mathematics, evolved separately from rhetoric.
