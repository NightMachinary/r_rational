So, here's a question that I think is very relevant to Taleb: is it rational to always accept an argument that you can't fault, even if you suspect that the source of the argument is biased or untrustworthy? I don't think that's a question with an obvious answer, but I'd argue no.

Suppose you Googled a well-established conspiracy theory- 9/11 truthers, UFOs, whatever. You'd almost certainly encounter arguments and apparent evidence that you couldn't immediately debunk based on first-hand knowledge. You could, of course, also Google facts and articles to debunk those claims- but if you consider only the facts and reasoning presented and not the trustworthiness of sources, doing so would appear to be motivated reasoning. These conspiracy theories are built up from decades of motivated reasoning, so why should using the same method yourself produce better results?

I think the answer has to be that the sources of these theories aren't trustworthy enough to support their extraordinary claims. We know that the people who come up with these kinds of theories tend to rely on fact-gathering and rhetorical methods that introduce an enormous amount of bias; we know that their arguments are usually contradicted by more trustworthy sources; and we know that they're often not all that rational.

So, is it rational to discount the arguments of conspiracy theorists on no other basis than that mistrust? Maybe in a perfect world, we'd all have the time to independently test the arguments that can be tested, and the education to judge the arguments that can't. In a world with limited time, in which we encounter vastly more claims than we can independently verify, however, I think that mistrust can be a valid reason for disbelief.

Nassim Taleb appears, at least to me, to be an extremely intelligent pathological narcissist. He's made a lot of extraordinary arguments, a small number of which I can find fault with, but most of which I can't. I think he's my intellectual superior, in both education and intellect, but I don't find him trustworthy. I know from experience that people who behave like he does have problems with self-delusion, and I don't think he does a good job of taking the ideas and criticisms of others into account.

Is that mistrust sufficient reason to dismiss his arguments, even when I can't personally fault them? Maybe not entirely- he's not some rocker-adjacent conspiracy theorist, and he could turn out to be right about everything- but I think it's sufficient reason to be extremely skeptical.
