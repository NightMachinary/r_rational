I apologize for that, I did not mean to imply prostitution was in any way evil like rape. I put it there as an example of self-harming behavior. Offering sex services is like painting a huge target mark on yourself for sexual violence, and that can have serious effects on your health and wellbeing. It is really not a good action to take for your personal survival unless all your other options are worse.
