I'm kind of surprised that you would complain about [[/u/ShiranaiWakaranai]]'s post being a straw man when you're doing the same thing.

See, the thing here is, you don't get to pick and choose what parts of religion other people (the ones that are propagating and actualizing these memes) are going to act out. So, sure, there's lots of things in religion that are ethically neutral or good but they're inextricably bound in with the evil and self-harming stuff.

Or, put another way, if you simplify the problem space to religious traditions that aren't harmful, you don't get to use that to prove that religious traditions aren't harmful. Because you still have the harmful ones as proof that "old traditions with string negative effects" aren't "weeded out".

And you don't need a simulation to test it, you can observe it in the real world.
