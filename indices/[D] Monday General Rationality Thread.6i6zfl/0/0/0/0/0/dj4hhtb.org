Let me put it another way. In every decision, you can do one of two things: 1) Keep doing what you've been doing, or 2) Do something else. Taleb says you should have a strong bias in favor of (1), /unless/ there is a strong reason for (2). The set of strong reasons for (2) includes ethical violations caused by doing (1). Taleb backs up his arguments with lots of math about complex systems and stochastic processes. The thing is, I don't know enough of this type of math to tell how much he is BSing (and I majored in math!)

  Are you freaked out by this?

Yeah, sort of, because the system sounds too ad-hoc to work.

  Any system of ethics that tells you to kill people in some situations is almost certainly going to tell you to beat people to an inch from death in some cases, two inches in others, three inches in yet more others, and so on.

This is also true of basically any plausible system of ethics, though.
