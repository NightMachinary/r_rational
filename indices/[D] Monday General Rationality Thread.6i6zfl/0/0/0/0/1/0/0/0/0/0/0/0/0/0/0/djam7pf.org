  Blindly not follow it. Just use the time you would have spent on activity X to instead analyze/research activity X. This will almost always be better than blindly doing X.
#+end_quote

So, you'd tear down Chesterton's Fence?

I guess that's your choice; though, personally, I'd recommend keeping doing X until you have an actual reason to stop (reason being, some traditions are there for /very good reasons/).

#+begin_quote
  First, I assume this means you have found good reasons for performing either the tradition or Y, otherwise as in case 1, you should just not do either of them.
#+end_quote

I am assuming that Y is the best possible thing that you could be doing if you were not following the tradition (if there is something better, then substitute it for Y).

#+begin_quote
  You should probably do both tradition X and alternative task Y (or have some people do X while others do Y), that way if either method fails, at least you got the backup.
#+end_quote

This is sensible. Where both are possible, I do agree that this sort of experimental approach is good. Sometimes, of course, it's not possible.

#+begin_quote
  Going back to the farmers vs sparrows example, a thorough analysis would have first experimented with only killing the sparrows in a small area, and only gradually performing this sparrow extermination task on a wider scale after confirming that there are no bad effects in smaller experiments.
#+end_quote

This is, unfortunately, a case where the experimental approach is not really going to help much. Both locusts and sparrows are very mobile - you'd have to desparrow a very /large/ area to prevent the sparrows around the edge of the area from doing quite a lot of damage to locusts passing through the area in any case.

But none of this is the main point of contention.

#+begin_quote
  My point here is that given any arbitrary tradition, even if you have not been able to show that it has such negative effects, there is still a significant chance that it does due to the principles of natural selection.
#+end_quote

This, here, is the main point of contention.

I don't see how this works. The principles of natural selection in this case can be summarised as "that which keeps me and my close family alive, tends to survive as tradition"; and I'm not seeing the correlation between "keeps me and my family alive" and "does something horrible" (in fact, I'd assume those two were negatively correlated, because deliberately not keeping my and my family alive is pretty horrible on its own).

So, let me ask, then - why do you think that natural selection leads to horrible outcomes?
