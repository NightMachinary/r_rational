Well, naturally, there /are/ survival strategies that are zero-sum or even negative-sum - that allow one person to survive at the expense of other people. (And yes, such negative-sum survival traditions should be ended, once identified).

I must disagree with you on one minor (and somewhat tangential) point here. The oxygen catastrophe was a classic Black Swan; not because it wasn't obvious, but because it was not foreseen. (Admittedly, this was more because natural selection is incapable of foresight than anything else, but nonetheless).

Climate change is a different story. The negative effects of climate change /have/ been foreseen.

An excellent point, but there is one problem - while the ten dead people don't say anything, there are still *ten dead bodies* there for a competent researcher to uncover.

It is important to keep this bias in mind when studying traditions to see whether or not a given tradition is good or bad. But it does not prevent a bad tradition from being notices and identified as bad by a competent researcher. (Yes, a competent researcher needs to go to those dark, shadowy corners and find out why people are hiding in them).

  So if you ask me to show you how the average tradition has negative virtue, I probably can't.

This, I believe, is the crux of our disagreement. We are agreed that a tradition with positive virtue should be continued, and a tradition with negative virtue ended. We simply disagree on what value is best ascribed to a tradition whose total virtue, on first glance, appears neither positive nor negative. I'm inclined to think positive, you're inclined to think negative, and neither of us can prove our guess.
