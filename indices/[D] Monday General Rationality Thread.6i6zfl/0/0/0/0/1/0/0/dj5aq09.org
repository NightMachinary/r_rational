  Take the example given by [[/u/LieGroupE8]], prayer. When you pray according to some religion X, and other people see you praying according to X, that's an advertisement for religion X. They may then become curious about your prayer activities, look up X, and then join X as well. And if X turns out to have terrible self-harming religious practices, those people may get hurt. Now that's not exactly your responsibility per se, since you didn't explicitly tell them to join X, but you must admit your prayer activities did give them a push in that direction. So to some extent, its ethically questionable to pray according to X when you're not sure whether X is good or bad, especially when your main argument for supporting prayers to X it is just that lots of other people are also praying according to X.

If I'm praying according to X, then I am (presumably) already following X, including all the self-harming practices. That is, I /already/ think it's a good idea to follow X.

Now, I could be wrong. It's possible that it's not a good idea to follow X and I am in some was misled or deluded. But... then I don't know that. I still think it's a good idea to follow X. If I am misled or deluded to that extent, then anything that I could do may be leading someone down the wrong path. (In fact, since I think that X is the right path, I'll likely be doing a lot more than just praying to try to encourage others to follow it, too)

There are two ways to handle this dilemma:

1. Regularly examine and re-evaluate my own choices. Be willing to change my mind in public, and to seriously consider arguments against my current path.

2. Become a hermit, lest I accidentally persuade someone to do something I only think is a good idea.

I don't really see any other options...
