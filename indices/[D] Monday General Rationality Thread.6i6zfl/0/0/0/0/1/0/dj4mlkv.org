  You can choose to give them explanations, but you may as well decide that it's none of their business and refuse to give answers.

Ok, I guess you could avoid hurting anyone by avoiding interaction with anyone, going into the wilderness and becoming a hermit or something, but if you continue to live among other humans, it's really inevitable that someone will eventually discover you doing X and start suspecting that doing X is a good thing. And while yes, it's not really your responsibility if people start copying you and end up hurting themselves, you have to admit your actions can influence the wellbeing of others in a negative way as a result. It's an ethical gray area.

Take the example given by [[/u/LieGroupE8]], prayer. When you pray according to some religion X, and other people see you praying according to X, that's an advertisement for religion X. They may then become curious about your prayer activities, look up X, and then join X as well. And if X turns out to have terrible self-harming religious practices, those people may get hurt. Now that's not exactly your responsibility per se, since you didn't explicitly tell them to join X, but you must admit your prayer activities did give them a push in that direction. So to some extent, its ethically questionable to pray according to X when you're not sure whether X is good or bad, especially when your main argument for supporting prayers to X it is just that lots of other people are also praying according to X.

  Same with this. I don't know what the mentioned person was arguing in favour of, but just because his ethics allows (or even dictates) murder in specific cases doesn't mean that it'll automatically degrade into a slippery slope of human right abuse in general.

Erm, I guess I explained this badly since both replies I got were missing the point I was trying to make. The problem isn't that the system dictates murder. If your system of ethics says you should kill all murderers, that's okay with me. I don't really agree with capital punishment, but it doesn't freak me out, and its a consistent ethical system that makes sense.

The problem here is how the author says always obey the system unless it tells you to kill someone (in which case you're supposed to ignore the system and don't kill that someone). In saying that, the author is basically admitting that his system has a fundamental flaw and is utterly wrong in situations where it tells you to kill. Yet despite this major flaw, we are still expected to obey this system in all other cases, including cases that are extremely similar: like if the system tells you to beat a man to an inch from death or beat a man until he has a 99.999% chance of dying instead of 100%, it sounds like you should go ahead and obey the system.

The complete 180 in the decision making process over the slightest difference in conditions makes no sense to me, it sounds like the 99.999% chance should still be horrible and you still shouldn't obey the system in this case. But then that would also apply for the 99.998% chance, and so on, so you get, at best, a gradual slope of system exceptions: i.e., the more it tells you to hurt people, the more you shouldn't obey it.

But then by induction, the author's entire system of ethics becomes irrelevant, the only important part becomes the exceptions: avoid actions in proportion to how much they hurt people. The fact that the author advertises the original flawed system throughout the website as if its perfectly good and demands everyone obey it, while the horribly important exception is only in one small webpage so hidden away that I can't even find it anymore, freaks me out because it suggests the author is still going to ask for obedience to a system he knows is fundamentally flawed.

And a similar situation is happening here: the rule given is "Traditions are good!" and I suspect the exception rule is only ever given once we start pointing out how horrible it is ethically. And even then, it just goes ok ignore that particular case, and doesn't delve into all the generalizations of that case and how the system should still be fundamentally broken to various extents in those cases.
