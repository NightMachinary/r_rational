I think you might be mischaracterising the rule. It's not "Always do what tradition says" - at least not in my understanding of it. It is, rather, "if this is how it was traditionally done, then that fact alone should /bias/ your decision-making in favour of the traditional solution".

Nothing in there says that that bias should, on its own, be enough to counter other, relevant factors. (And we could probably have quite a debate about the size of that bias).

So no, you should not be *blindly* following tradition. But if tradition says to do X, then you should not stop doing X /unless/ you can provide a good reason (enough to overcome the Tradition Bias) for stopping doing X. (It's basically the same argument as Chesterton's Fence, just phrased differently; just because you can't /see/ a reason for the tradition, doesn't mean that there /isn't/ one, and the probable existence of that as-yet-unknown reason should be folded into your decision-making algorithm).
