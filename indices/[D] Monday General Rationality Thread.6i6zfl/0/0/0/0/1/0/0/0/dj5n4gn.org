  There are two ways to handle this dilemma: Regularly examine and re-evaluate my own choices. Be willing to change my mind in public, and to seriously consider arguments against my current path.

Yes, that's the whole point of this discussion. We started off by discussing the virtues of choosing to follow the Tradition Rule: "Old things that are done by lots of people are good to do".

I pointed out that natural selection means there are plenty of old things that are done by lots of people that are outright suicidal and evil. At which point I was told that there's an exception to the rule: if it infringes on ethics, don't do it.

So we have the revised Tradition Rule: "Old things that are done by lots of people are good to do, unless they infringe on ethics."

I was then told, that under this rule, praying and fasting are good things because they are old things that are done by lots of people and don't appear to infringe on ethics. Therefore, according to the revised Tradition Rule, you should pray because lots of other people are doing it. So *not* because you follow X, and *not* because you think it's a good idea to follow X. You are praying to X *only* because you know lots of other people are doing it, because it's a tradition.

So my last post was saying that that too could be considered an infringement on ethics. Which is why the end result is that the Tradition Rule has to be revised again, to make more exceptions in all kinds of generalizations of ethically infringing cases, to the point where it becomes utterly irrelevant because by induction, you derive that you should just do things in accordance to how little they infringe on ethics, regardless of how old it is or how many other people are doing it.

In other words, you *should* regularly examine and re-evaluate your own choices, *not just blindly follow whatever tradition tells you*. If you can't see the logic behind a tradition, then even if it doesn't appear to infringe on ethics, keep thinking, because it might still be doing so in some way that's not apparently visible.
