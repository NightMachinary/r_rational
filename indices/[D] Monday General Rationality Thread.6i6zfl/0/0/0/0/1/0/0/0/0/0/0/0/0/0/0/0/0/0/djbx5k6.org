  I will contend that survival, in the group sense, is a virtue; and thus that the total virtue of traditions involving survival is a net positive.

I got bad news for you. Survival traditions aren't clean either. I mean, this should be quite obvious, but there are plenty of selfish/evil behaviors that help your survival. Or the survival of your family. For example, parents that resort to burglary/robbery so they can feed their children is naturally selected, because it increases the children's survival. For example, racism is naturally selected (among whichever race has the majority), because it increases the survival of people of the same race (sure some will die fighting the minorities, but strength in numbers means overall this is a winning strategy for your race genes).

In fact, there was once a survival behavior that almost wiped out all life on Earth. A long time ago, everyone was just tired and lethargic, floating around and just slowly drinking nutrients to stay alive and reproduce. There wasn't a lot of food or methods to use that food, so people just didn't have the energy to really do stuff. Then one day, by some lucky mutation, someone gained a biological process that generates huge amounts of energy, in exchange for producing a tiny amount of poison gas.

This biological process quickly became the favorite of natural selection. After all, huge amounts of energy means healthier people that can use that energy to repair damage to their bodies. It means stronger people, since they have more energy to push things around. It means faster people since they can use that energy to move themselves around. It was essentially a massive boost to every aspect of every organism that gained the genes needed to perform this biological process.

And so that one someone quickly became two. And four. And eight. And then spread all over the world. Now remember the part about the poison gas? Natural selection doesn't really care about that, after all, the poison affects everyone equally. Or rather, it actually affects the poison producers less, since the poison producers are getting massive amounts of energy which they can then use to heal their wounds and run away from the areas they poisoned. And so there kept being more and more people that produce poison gas.

And eventually, the entire Earth was covered in poison gas and pretty much everyone died. (Other than the lucky few that were in isolated caves or had lucky poison resistance genes or something.) Can you guess the name of this poison-gas-producing biological process? [[#s][It's]]. That's right, we are still surrounded by these poison gas producers, and our ancient ancestors were one of the lucky few that had adapted to the poison gas [[#s][called]]. You can read more about it [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Oxygenation_Event][here]].

The fun part? This wasn't even a Black Swan event. It's poison gas. It's obviously poisonous! Poison kills, there was nothing unexpected about it. But natural selection went for it anyway because the poison problem was too long-term for natural selection to care, until it was too late.

Now you might be thinking, what does all that have to do with humanity? That's just a biological process, not a conscious behavioral decision. Well... if you believe in Climate Change, there's something happening *right now* that eerily parallels this story. Someone discovered you could gain massive amounts of energy from burning coal/oil/gas/etc, though that also produces gas in the process. That someone got filthy rich, and so gained a massive boost to his survival. By the principles of natural selection, tons of people started copying that someone and also became filthy rich. Burning coal/oil/gas/etc became a tradition that massively boosts survival, at the cost of producing gases. So now the atmosphere is filling up with those gases, gases that (as far as I know) most climate change scientists believe will kill us all if we don't stop producing so much of it.

Unless we artificially use our brains and consciously choose to stop this tradition, natural selection ensures it will continue to dominate the system until we all die from climate change. (Well almost all, because once again, the people who practice coal/oil/gas/etc burning are getting flithy rich, and that money can be used to run away from areas of the world that turn into hell from climate change, so those guys will mostly survive. Have I mentioned natural selection is like anti-karma?)

Then again, we will probably all die from AI first.

Anyway, that's not the point. The point is, survival traditions? Not safe either.

  Therefore, I contend that the average virtue over all traditions - which is equal to the expected virtue of a randomly selected tradition - is a positive value.
#+end_quote

I contend that the average virtue over all traditions *that we do not see good reasons for continuing* is negative. Hence I advocate the abandonment of all traditions until you figure out why they are good, if they are.

However, I realize that this will be hard to prove. I could go on and on about all the horrible things that have happened because of natural selection. I could talk about how many traditions are more subtle than rape and murder and could indirectly help the more evil traditions despite looking as innocent as sending children on a field trip. But if you claim that these are just outliers and not a pervasive pattern of natural selection, there's nothing I can do to prove that they are.

So instead I'll talk about why I can't prove this: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias][Survivorship bias]]. The reason why whenever an optimist tells a pessimist "But I see no bad things in my life! Show me all the bad things!", the pessimist then repeatedly bashes his head against the wall.

What is this survivorship bias? Well, pick a random tradition X. Now go around asking people "How has X impacted your life?" There may be a lot of different responses, but not one of them will be "I died because of tradition X". That is survivorship bias. If X was good for 10 people, and killed another 10 people, the only people who answer your survey are the 10 that X was good for, because the other 10 are dead and dead people can't talk. So when you tally your survey results: "Oh look! everyone loves X! X is awesome!"

And that's the essence of the problem: Bad things, by their very nature, are hidden. The victims of bad things are often too dead, too crippled (physically, mentally, socially, financially, etc), or too oppressed to talk about the bad things or even know what bad thing hurt them. The culprits of bad things are often going to hide the fact that they did bad things. The witnesses of bad things will often cower in fear and hope no one notices. And so whenever you take a sample of anything, especially your life experiences, survivorship bias means you're likely to get a completely underwhelming representation of the amount of badness in the actual population.

So if you ask me to show you how the average tradition has negative virtue, I probably can't. I certainly can't go survey all the people that have died from terrible traditions. And I sure as heck won't walk up to the evil people that have benefited from evil or evil-enabling traditions and ask them to admit their crimes. I like living. All I can do is keep bashing my head on the wall, and hope that I can convince at least one more person to think things through carefully before performing potentially murderous traditions.
