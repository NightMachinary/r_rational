  I guess I should clarify something here: when I say don't blindly follow traditions, I don't mean you should then blindly try something new. I just mean stop doing whatever tradition you're doing until you figure out a good reason why you should do it.
#+end_quote

An excellent principle, if you have the time to carefully reason out everything before you do it.

Let's consider a couple of hypotheticals here:

1: Tradition dictates that you complete activity X at the same time every day. You've recently run across this argument, and have decided to thoroughly question all your traditions. However, the time for Activity X is five minutes from now; you cannot complete an analysis in that time. Is it better to blindly follow, or blindly not follow the tradition? Assume that the tradition carries no /immediately/ obvious positive or negative effects.

2: You have thoroughly analysed a certain tradition, as compared to alternative task Y. Your analysis shows no expected difference in the desirability of the result. Should you stick to the traditional way, or try the new way instead?

3: As (2), but this time the analysis shows that the new way is /very slightly/ better than the old. Should you stick to the traditional way, or try the new way instead?

  Also, when you say there's a limit on the negative effects on tradition, that is true. But that limit is only the incredibly weak reassurance that if tradition X was going to kill us all, it just seems odd that it hasn't yet.
#+end_quote

Yes, exactly.

#+begin_quote
  The limit does not prevent the tradition from eventually still killing us all (for example, the tradition of waging war with more and more powerful weapons would almost certainly kill us all if we continued it). It also does not prevent the tradition from causing severe harm to a minority of individuals (for example, ritual human sacrifice traditions, or racism traditions). Nor does it prevent the tradition from hurting the group as a whole in ways other than death. It could for example, corrupt the whole group into becoming more evil, committing more human rights atrocities left and right and being completely happy with it. Considering the principles of natural selection discussed earlier, it actually seems quite likely that many traditions will include such negative effects.
#+end_quote

True. And if any tradition can be /shown to have/ such negative effects, then it should be abandoned. Those are all reasons which, /if applicable/, should easily outweigh the Tradition Bias.
