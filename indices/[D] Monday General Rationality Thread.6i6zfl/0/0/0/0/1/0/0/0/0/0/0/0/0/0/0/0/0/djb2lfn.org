I did read your first reply, but I don't think I understood it properly at the time.

I think I have a significantly better understanding now, thanks.

To summarise the main point, as I understand it; survival is not the only reason that traditions survive, reproduction (i.e. having a large family) is also a factor, and some things done in the name of reproduction are pretty horrible.

Very well, then. Let us broadly consider traditions as falling in one of two groups. One group is traditions which make it more likely that the people following these traditions will survive. The second group is those traditions that make it more likely that the people following the tradition will have lots of descendants.

This divide is important, because a lot of my points about tradition apply mostly to the /first/ group, while your point about negative reproduction behaviours only applies to the /second/ group of traditions.

I will contend that survival, in the group sense, is a virtue; and thus that the total virtue of traditions involving survival is a net positive. The reproductive traditions, on the other hand, I expect to have somewhat random virtue - some positive (like birdsong), some negative (you've given plenty of examples). Perhaps the total virtue, summed across all the reproductive traditions, is negative - but either way, I expect the total (positive or negative) magnitude of the virtue to be significantly lower than for the survival traditions.

Therefore, I contend that the /average/ virtue over all traditions - which is equal to the /expected/ virtue of a randomly selected tradition - is a positive value. Thus, a tradition should be considered to have a selection bias in its favour proportional to this expected virtue.

But, having seen your argument, I will add a caveat. If the tradition is inspected, and found to be of the reproductive type, then its selection bias must drop significantly. (Some traditions will fall under both types; but many will fall under only one, so that if a tradition has no clear survival utility but does have a clear reproductive utility, then it is reasonable to consider that it may very well not have survival utility at all).
