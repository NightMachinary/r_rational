  1: Tradition dictates that you complete activity X at the same time every day. You've recently run across this argument, and have decided to thoroughly question all your traditions. However, the time for Activity X is five minutes from now; you cannot complete an analysis in that time. Is it better to blindly follow, or blindly not follow the tradition? Assume that the tradition carries no immediately obvious positive or negative effects.
#+end_quote

Blindly not follow it. Just use the time you would have spent on activity X to instead analyze/research activity X. This will almost always be better than blindly doing X.

#+begin_quote
  2: You have thoroughly analysed a certain tradition, as compared to alternative task Y. Your analysis shows no expected difference in the desirability of the result. Should you stick to the traditional way, or try the new way instead?
#+end_quote

First, I assume this means you have found good reasons for performing either the tradition or Y, otherwise as in case 1, you should just not do either of them. In this case, assuming your analysis is really thorough (with experiments and everything), I don't feel strongly either way. You should probably do both tradition X and alternative task Y (or have some people do X while others do Y), that way if either method fails, at least you got the backup. Although the viability of this method really depends on what X and Y are.

  3: As (2), but this time the analysis shows that the new way is very slightly better than the old. Should you stick to the traditional way, or try the new way instead?
#+end_quote

Then I would very slightly be more in favor of performing alternative task Y, but still not really feel strongly either way. But again, this assumes the analysis has been really thorough, and that you have good reasons for doing tradition X or alternative task Y.

Going back to the farmers vs sparrows example, a thorough analysis would have first experimented with only killing the sparrows in a small area, and only gradually performing this sparrow extermination task on a wider scale after confirming that there are no bad effects in smaller experiments.

#+begin_quote
  True. And if any tradition can be shown to have such negative effects, then it should be abandoned. Those are all reasons which, if applicable, should easily outweigh the Tradition Bias.
#+end_quote

My point here is that given any arbitrary tradition, even if you have not been able to show that it has such negative effects, there is still a significant chance that it does due to the principles of natural selection. This is not something you can just ignore and say /"oh I don't know if I'm doing something horrible, but I'm just going to do it anyway until someone shows me that it is horrible!"/

If a tradition X has no good reason to be continued, *don't* wait until someone can prove it is horrible, abandon it right away because it could be horrible, the chances are *not negligible*, and people could end up seriously hurt if you continue blindly following it.
