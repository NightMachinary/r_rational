I guess I should clarify something here: when I say don't blindly follow traditions, I don't mean you should then blindly try something new. I just mean stop doing whatever tradition you're doing until you figure out a good reason why you should do it.

Blindly trying new things is also dangerous, as your example well proves. Since the farmers did not properly understand the role of sparrows in the ecosystem, but blindly went ahead and killed them all anyway, they paid the price for it.

In other words, you should never blindly do anything, whether that thing is old or new. Only do things if you have good reasons for doing them. Not because other people are also doing said things or because they are traditions.

Also, when you say there's a limit on the negative effects on tradition, that is true. But that limit is only the incredibly weak reassurance that if tradition X was going to kill us all, it just seems odd that it hasn't yet. The limit does not prevent the tradition from eventually still killing us all (for example, the tradition of waging war with more and more powerful weapons would almost certainly kill us all if we continued it). It also does not prevent the tradition from causing severe harm to a minority of individuals (for example, ritual human sacrifice traditions, or racism traditions). Nor does it prevent the tradition from hurting the group as a whole in ways other than death. It could for example, corrupt the whole group into becoming more evil, committing more human rights atrocities left and right and being completely happy with it. Considering the principles of natural selection discussed earlier, it actually seems quite likely that many traditions will include such negative effects.

So I'm inclined to believe that given an arbitrary tradition X, if you can't think of a good reason for doing X, X is probably mired in all kinds of evil and self-harm so you should stop doing X.
