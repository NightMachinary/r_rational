  if you perform an action X, you either have to hide it or others will know you have performed X. If you hide it, that almost certainly will involve lying, infringing on ethics
#+end_quote

That's a pretty far-fetched statement. If you decide to be hiding some of your actions and reasons behind them it doesn't automatically (or “almost certainly”) mean that you're lying. You're not obliged to be explaining your actions to some random people --- or any people at all, really. You can /choose/ to give them explanations, but you may as well decide that it's none of their business and refuse to give answers.

  And then, he had a page that said "hey guys, I know this system of ethics sometimes tells you to kill people in certain situations. You should just treat those cases as exceptions, and always obey the system unless it tells you to kill people." [...] Are you freaked out by this? Because I certainly am. Any system of ethics that tells you to kill people in some situations is almost certainly going to tell you to beat people to an inch from death in some cases, two inches in others, three inches in yet more others, and so on.

Same with this. I don't know what the mentioned person was arguing in favour of, but just because his ethics allows (or even dictates) murder in specific cases doesn't mean that it'll automatically degrade into a slippery slope of human right abuse in general.

There are many real-world scenarios (e.g. limited choice of actions against someone who's about to kill a hostage or trigger a bomb, etc) where killing someone would be the more ethical thing to do (compared to inaction, for instance).

Maybe if this ethics system was being applied to some nearly omnipotent creature that could stop time and just fix things, murder would never be an acceptable choice (in systems where murder by itself is deemed bad, at least). But since we can neither predict everything nor prevent it all in non-violent manner, we have to make do with what we have, including justifiable homicide in some cases.

Also, I feel like I'm misinterpreting your comment in general, so apologies if that's the case.
