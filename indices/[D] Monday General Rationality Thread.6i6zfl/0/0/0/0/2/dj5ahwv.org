  For example, if you perform an action X, you either have to hide it or others will know you have performed X. If you hide it, that almost certainly will involve lying, infringing on ethics. If it's revealed, others will be curious why you perform X. Many will suspect that X has some kind of positive effect, since you are doing X and you haven't died or suffered significant harm from doing X.

Not necessarily. Let us say that X is juggling.

I might be juggling in order to receive praise from fellow humans, or in an attempt to impress a person of opposite gender. I might do so in order to show off my coordination or my hours of practice. I might do so simply because I enjoy it.

But I don't think that would necessarily suggest to the average person that he should learn to juggle. He may see it as a neutral activity, or an activity whose benefits are not worth the cost for himself.

  A few years ago, I stumbled upon a rationality website where the author went on and on about his system of ethics and how wonderful it was. And then, he had a page that said "hey guys, I know this system of ethics sometimes tells you to kill people in certain situations. You should just treat those cases as exceptions, and always obey the system unless it tells you to kill people."

So, the author has two ethical systems; and the one that says "never kill" overrides the one he described in so much detail. It is possible that his wonderful system of ethics needs a little adjustment.

(Mind you, there are plenty of well-considered and well-used ethical systems that say it is occasionally, under rare conditions, alright to kill people. Generally as a penalty (for some crime) ordered by a judge or jury.)
