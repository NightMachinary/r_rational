  Edit: What I really want to know here is: of those of you who are familiar with Taleb's technical approach to decision theory and how he applies this to the real world, is his decision theory 1) Basically correct, 2) Frequently correct but mis-applied sometimes, or 3) basically incorrect?

I think you have answered this question yourself pretty well. He is basically correct but only in some cases, because he has a strong bias towards not doing new things. For example, when he promotes caution in doing things like genetic modification, that's great. Caution is always good. And he does correctly point out several dangers in scientific research like spurious correlations that are just the result of random chance, which is always important to watch out for. Yet he doesn't promote that same caution for old things, like greenhouse gases and climate change, because burning coal and what not is what we have already been doing for years, its old!

Which is strange because if he was born about hundred years ago, back before we started burning up all the coal and oil and what not, his old-things-good ideology would almost certainly make him promote the same extreme caution against dumping strange chemicals into the air as he now promotes against dumping strange genes into plants.

The bias towards doing whatever old thing we're doing now instead of some new thing doesn't really make sense to me, because whatever old thing we're doing now was a new thing at some point in the (usually quite recent) past, and, by his own argument, the fact that this previously new thing hasn't catastrophically killed us all yet is no proof that it won't do so in the future.
