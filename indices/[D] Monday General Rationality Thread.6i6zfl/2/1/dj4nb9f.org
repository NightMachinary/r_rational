I use anki flash cards for all my classes, after each lecture I make them up. I get mixed results: very good recall for multiple choice questions (like, I can almost get the slides word-for-word), but writing long, detailed answers is a lot harder as rote memorisation doesn't help with synthesis.

However, there are some things it's perfect for: doctors who have to learn the names of all the bones in the hand and things like that.
