  Have you considered Spaced Repetition Systems? It covers both memorizing and - to an extent - tracking progress.

I've heard of them but not tried them. Lemme go look them up more thoroughly, thank you.

  For retention the trick seems to be as EY says: make the knowledge a part of you. Don't favor learning specific declarative facts, and instead favor learning trends, laws, methods etc..

The funny thing is, I'm /good/ at learning laws and methods. I'm really, /really/ good at internalizing the "feel" or concept to something. The trouble is to do that with sufficiently exact strings of symbols that I can just rattle off the actual formal content of the concept, since I can already "feel" the concept.

(Seriously, once a concept has been mapped to proprioceptive and motor imaginations, it /doesn't/ go away. Sensorimotor intuition is /really solid/ in our brains, and translating things into that space /works/.)

For example, despite not having used it since... high school, I /almost/ remembered the exact quadratic formula. I can /almost/ entirely remember beginning calculus. Vector-matrix multiplication is still totally there. Matrix-matrix multiplication is there once I remember that the second matrix is treated as column vectors, the first as a row-matrix. Row reduction on matrices needed a lookup just now.

But I'm not sure I've ever had it under deliberate control what got committed to which extent, with how much formal content versus how much intuitive content.

  For reason of your being a moderator on this sub I am presuming you understand the universality of the methods of algebra, etc.

I can't tell if you mean elementary algebra or Universal Algebra ;-).
