  committed the important points of the day's materials to memory

I feel like your person left out the operational part of the advice. How do you commit things to memory? How do you /know/ you've committed them to memory in a long-term way?

My particular thing is that I want to be able to retain and use the material long after I take the course, since core material often comes up again and again in different contexts -- and there's a lot of it.
