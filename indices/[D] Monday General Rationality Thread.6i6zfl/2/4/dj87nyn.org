I've been thinking about this. In principle, it seems like it should be pretty straightforward.

1. Convert the book to a number. This could be a sequence of ASCII codes, with escape characters to LaTex as needed.
2. Checksum the number so you can verify you have the right number in the future.
3. Memorize the entire number. Since human memory can hold tons of stuff as long as it's in story/vivid imagery form, you just need to turn the number into a long detailed story with lots of vivid imagery.
4. Decode the number back to text when you want to peruse it. Use the checksum to make sure you are doing it accurately.
5. Learn to lucid dream. Spend 8 hours every night reading the book(s).
6. Speed up your time perception in the dreaming phase as much as possible so you can study for years on end in a matter of weeks.
