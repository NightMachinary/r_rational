If you want to talk audience counterplay, there's always [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchrodingersGun][Schrodinger's Gun]]. It's mainly used in tabletop games, but long form TV series use it as well. When The Master was killed and cremated on Doctor Who, there was a shot of someone reaching in and grabbing his ring from the ashes. Russell T Davies didn't even know who that person was going to end up having been, he just wanted to leave a hanging plot thread for later use.
