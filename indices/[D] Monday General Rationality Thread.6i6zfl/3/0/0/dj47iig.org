I've observed myself noticing Chekhov's guns before, and then almost entirely forgetting them soon afterwards as I follow the rest of the story. The true value of a Chekhov's gun is in how easy it is to, when the plot moves to another scene, let the gun slip to the level of remembered factoid, at which point the use of it in act 3 not only comes by surprise just as if it came out of nowhere, but has /bonus/ thrill due to the connection to the first act.

Intellectually, the reader can review what's happened and conclude the gun's going to be used, but when you're immersed in the story it's really hard to keep that in mind in the moment as you approach where it's used, so it works out just fine.
