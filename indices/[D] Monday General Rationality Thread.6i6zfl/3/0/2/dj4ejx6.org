  So authors are in a way encouraged to leave unfired guns and red herrings laying around, but that undercuts the tightness of the plot.

These two (red herrings, unfired guns) differ. By way of example Percy skulking around in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a red herring but not an unfired Chekov's Gun. Act 3 finds the gun fired, the snag sewn: he has a girlfriend.

Things that draw our attention, but are not part of the main plot, can be either distractors that go nowhere and mean nothing (unfired guns), or part of some other story strand (red herrings). Red herrings need not undercut the tightness of the plot. Side stories may add to the main narrative by imparting context and nuance.

Both can generate surprise, an unsureness as to how the story will unravel, but be careful not to overwhelm your reader with detail.
