What I find really interesting is that there's some counter play with the audience. The author doesn't introduce a gun in the first act unless it will be fired in the third act, but since the audience knows that then the gun firing in the third act becomes less unexpected/thrilling. So authors are in a way encouraged to leave unfired guns and red herrings laying around, but that undercuts the tightness of the plot.
