It's always a shame when these stories go on indefinite hiatus like that. Even if the author comes back to it their style changed over time, they got worse from not writing at all, or they just don't remember the plan in detail and have to make up something new, which screws with the prior foreshadowing.

I also forgot the details by then so it feels like I came in in the middle.
