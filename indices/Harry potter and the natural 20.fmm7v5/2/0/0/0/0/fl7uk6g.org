That's a fair argument, I do see your point. I think there is also an element of gross failure to roleplay in munchkinning, ie they engage in “wildly unrealistic behaviour” in pursuit of goals that should and could never occur to a /person/ raised in the world of the game, with its cultural assumptions and background knowledge. Juniper is an explicit self-insert with Earth, gamer, cultural assumptions and explicit GM-imposed goals in the form of the Quest Text.
