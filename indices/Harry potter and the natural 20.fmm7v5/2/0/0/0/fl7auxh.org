I disagree. Muchkinning is much more starkly depicted in the Two Year Emperor, with the main character trying to set up mechanisms a la Peasant Railgun. What goes on in Worth the Candle is the much less game-ruining Optimization. Metagaming is a core part of Worth the Candle, but it doesn't rely in the insanity that was DnD 3.x's "Mechanics = Physics". The system in Worth the Candle is explicitly based on degrees of abstraction and GM permissiveness.
