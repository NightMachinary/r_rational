Just to clarify, The Two Year Emperor uses similar munchkining of the rules. Worth the Candle is another LitRPG story that I recommend, and I think is generally better than The Two Year Emperor, but there's not so much munckinning. Mostly because the main character doesn't know the rules very well, and they (mostly) don't even apply for everyone else.
