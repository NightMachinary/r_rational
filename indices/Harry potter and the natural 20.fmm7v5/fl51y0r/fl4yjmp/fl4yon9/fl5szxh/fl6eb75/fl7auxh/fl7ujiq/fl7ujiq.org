I guess what I mean is that in Harry Potter and the Natural 20, it involves flagrant rule abuse. Like using a tower shield for invisibility on the basis that it grants full cover, so nobody can see you or anything you're carrying. The Two Year Emperor generally isn't quite as extreme, but it still uses rules to be vastly more powerful than intended, like using automatically resetting magical traps for things besides traps.

Worth the Candle seems to have this sort of thing less. Mostly because the rules generally only apply to Juniper, and he doesn't actually know what they are. The only flagrant rule abuses I can think of were on accident.
