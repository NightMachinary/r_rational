The classic story of D&D characters being aware of the rules and abusing them horribly is from 1986: [[http://www.rogermwilcox.com/ADnD/IUDC1.html][The Intercontinental Union of Disgusting Characters]]. The first edition rules were not particularly well written (the [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheIntercontinentalUnionOfDisgustingCharacters][TV Tropes page]] mentions 'loopholes big enough to drive a siege engine through') but I remember it being a fun romp.
