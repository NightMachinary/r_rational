[[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/HarryPotterAndTheMunchkins][Harry Potter and the Munchkins]] comes to mind, though it's not actually D&D rules, and also it was never completed.

Edit: There's also [[https://www.nuklearpower.com/8-bit-theater/][8-Bit Theater]]. I never got through the beginning, but the later comics I read are pretty good. Red Mage believes he's in a tabletop RPG, and often uses that knowledge to mess with the rules. Though he's actually in a videogame.
