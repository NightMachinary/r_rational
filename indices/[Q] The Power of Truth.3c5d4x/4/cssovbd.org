You're asking how to achieve godhood with a perfect binary oracle?

Firstly, check stuff like "there is a God", "this is a computer simulation", "time-travel to the past is possible". Oh, and "FAI, as conceived of by MIRI, is possible and desirable."

After that, binary searches are probably the way to go; I'd use a dictionary, or maybe a list of the [[https://xkcd.com/1133][ten hundred most common words]]. "Is the answer to my question in the first half? Is it in the first half of the first half? Is it in the first half of the second half of the first half?"

The /ideal/ way to do this would be to assign binary codes to each word, and maybe even have a program automatically print out the "answers" you're going to test. But the main thing is the binary; "The first digit of the code for the first word in the answer to my question is 1; the second digit of the code for the first word in the answer to my question is 1", etc. can all be tested simultaneously.

Given that ... questions. I'd go for "what is the correct ethical theory", or some slightly better-worded version of that, first. Then maybe some stuff to make money (you could solve some well-known unsolved problems and make money off that, or just ask for the words to email to rich people that would make them give you their money), then I guess you should go on to "what is the shortest program that generates an FAI?" Maybe ask for the Theory of Everything and a way to unify all nations on Earth under you or some other benevolent ruler, as well.
