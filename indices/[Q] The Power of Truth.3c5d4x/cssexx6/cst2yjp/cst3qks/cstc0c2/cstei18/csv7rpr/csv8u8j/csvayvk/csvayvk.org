There's no such thing as Colorless green dreams (or ideas), which is what makes the sentence nonsense, but that's exactly what makes the statement true in my first order logic interpretation.

In other words, nonsense does not appear to preclude a truth value by my understanding, and I don't see Chomsky disagreeing. I haven't read most of his work of course, so I don't have much more than the linked article to go on.
