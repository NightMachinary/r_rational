I don't know. That depends on the system of logic it uses. Perhaps the universe uses some kind of transcendental paraconsistent logic.

I think I may have actually invented the equivalence of each statement asserting its own truth back when I was looking for approaches to the Liar's Paradox. I'm not sure I'm quite that creative, so I might be suffering from cryptomnesia. It makes sense though, and it seems to work. By DeMorgan, =P': P' ^ ~P= -> =~P': ~P' v P'=, which is true by the excluded middle. So if you consider every statement to assert its own truth, asserting its own falsity results in contradiction, and all is right with the world. I'm not sure why I abandoned that line of thought. It's entirely possible that there is a higher level at which this system is subject to the Liar's Paradox.
