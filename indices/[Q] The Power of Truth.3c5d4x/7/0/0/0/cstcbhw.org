Reality may not speak English, but people do. If the statements that people make are meaningful, then it is possible for them to correspond with reality. If you are skeptical of this, then you are a universal skeptic. I doubt that you are really that skeptical though. As Hume noted, most skeptics exit rooms through doors rather than windows; they also avoid being hit by cars.

As for truth being subjective, that depends on what is meant by subjective. There are two reasonable meanings of subjective in which you might mean. The first is that truth is understood by subjects (people). The second is different people believe different things are true. The problem is that neither definition is a problem. The first simply states the obvious. The second is not a problem since I was speaking of truth rather than belief. I might believe that something is true, but whether my belief is correct or not is a matter of truth.

If you still have an objection, you might try stating it with more words. As is, it sounds either simplistically wrong or obviously mistaken.
