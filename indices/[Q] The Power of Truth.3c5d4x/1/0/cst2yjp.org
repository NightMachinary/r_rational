Indeterminate statements are, I assume, neither true nor false. They are not true and will show up as such. If you mean statements that are vague or ambiguous, then they will show up as true if all reasonable variations of their meaning are true and false otherwise.

I didn't think of the best person to reveal this to but it seems like a good question to ask.
