What about indeterminate statements?

You've just created a perfect oracle. You can use it to generate the answer to any question that has a knowable answer expressible in a finite number of symbols, including creating working software to solve any computable problem in any instruction code.

And I don't even have to be able to think up the solutions.

First step, don't reveal it until I've gotten it to tell me who the best person to reveal the power to. I don't want to end up in a basement cell in Fort Meade.

Second step, create the Singularity.
