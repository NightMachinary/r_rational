My bad, I read that the deck plates were oriented parallel to the engines and read the two-pronged spaceship, and thought that it sounded like a Trek ship.

  The starship wasn't certainly of any classical Cylon designs. It was completely different, and sleek looking, with unfamiliar weapon mounts sticking out of it and holes where missiles could come out of. There were two nacelles sticking out towards the rear that he couldn't figure out the purpose of. Whatever it was, it wasn't certainly a landing or launch bay. The design was all wrong.

  The magnetic lock on her marines.was still active, and that they were in a skyscrapper configuration. Specifically, the light was on, but there was no artificial gravity. Lastly, the floors was oriented parallel to the thrust of the engines. That way, the feets would be on the floor, and not the other way around.

This piece is contradictory. In a skyscraper configuration, the plane of the decks is perpendicular to the thrust of the engines.
