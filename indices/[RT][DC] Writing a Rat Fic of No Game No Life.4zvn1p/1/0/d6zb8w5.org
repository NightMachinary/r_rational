eh but the thing is, in a world dominated by games in such a way, wouldn't everybody be as good as the siblings are? Wouldn't education consist, to a large extent, at learning how to play games, including possible donkey space strategies? I mean, even if what we see from the show is a stale meta, that's just because they're facing the siblings. If the elves wanted to go against the more powerful fl√ºgel, they would also need to use inventive tactics. My point is that no one seems to be reacting rationally to a game based world, but that if they did, humans would have on chance, so I'm trying to come up with a good buff that doesn't wreck the story but still allows for some mortal competition.
