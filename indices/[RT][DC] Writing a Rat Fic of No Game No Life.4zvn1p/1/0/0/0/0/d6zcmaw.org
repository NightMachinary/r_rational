Would that change anything? People are irrational they are willing to work for dozens of hours a week for money but ask them to think about money for a hour and they freeze up, being good at games may solve 100% of problems in that world but being good with money can solve ~50% in ours (more if you consider politics as being money related, looking at you toilet paper/condom shortages in venezuela) people still don't care; is it really a difference in kind rather then scale?
