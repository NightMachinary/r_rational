  How could you write a rational version of this story that still allows human to compete with magic wielders? Perhaps by giving them some kind of brain based super power that helps them actually out think the other races, or something like that? As if the entire species had an evil dark side, a la HPMOR?

that part of the story is already rational; the other races lack an element of pure hail mary plays and seem to underestimate chaos when faced with unexpected positioning from the opponent.

Maybe you could expand on that; clarify that the games between the races tend to have formed a stale meta and the sibling are just experts at "donkey space" and win by dragging it into it over and over, which is kinda what they do in the show but there are some times such a thing happens by chance("you must agree to play a game with rules we choose that /plot device/ no one rembers the rules after they lose"; oh right the siblings are good at this game anyway because macguffins)
