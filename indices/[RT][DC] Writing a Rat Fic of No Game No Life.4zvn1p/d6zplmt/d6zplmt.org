The main characters in the story are essentially the One Punch Man characters of their Universe. There's no one that can stop them. That said, there are some inconsistencies in the rules, but I think the overall neglect are the character's irrationalities in their betting styles. Certainly, the world situation can be setup to end in the same situation it was in, as others are talking about.

It's definitely something I'd like to see explored more, except from the bottom up style. How do you, as a non-plot-armor character, munchkin the rules of the system into your favor as a non-magical human?
