I was thinking about making a post like this after I watched it. It's so utterly perfect for rational fiction, if they didn't ruin it by making it wrong in just about every way.

『　　』 bet everything on every game and always won. That is a /terrible/ strategy. If they're always winning, the games aren't hard enough. They should play harder games with lower stakes. Also, I've checked some of those games. For example, when they're betting on if more men or women will walk past, unless there's a totally unreasonable majority of men the probability of getting more women is too high for the stakes they bet at.

It annoyed me that someone who lived her whole life in that universe could have no understanding of basic game theory. When Sora made that modified tic-tac-toe bet with Steph, she should have immediately removed a row and column and found that it was equivalent to evens or odds.

The bet with Jibril went terribly. 『　　』's offer for if they won was good enough for Jibril on its own. They could have made a bet that was the same either way or something like that.

It would be interesting to have something where 『　　』 loses, and then "cheats" by making the other person keep it a secret or something, so 『　　』 could keep the perfect record. Like, they mention that Sora and Shiro can lose, but 『　　』 can't, so maybe they claim it's 『　　』 when they win but not when they lose. Or one of them leaves when it appears they might lose, so it doesn't count as a loss for 『　　』.

At one point 『　　』 forced people to not file false reports or something like that by playing a game where the loser can't do that, and telling them to throw the game. I would have just made winning and losing have the same condition or played the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_game][zero game]] or both. That simplifies things a bit, and makes it so it can be used more generally. For example, you can force people not to cheat on games.

  Perhaps by giving them some kind of brain based super power that helps them actually out think the other races, or something like that?

Yes. It's called rationality. That's the point of these stories. Although realistically magic shouldn't help them much, given that both sides have to agree a match is fair.
