Yes, as it is very rare that someone would come up to you on the street and say "Lets compete in a contest of how well each of us know how to handle money!", and if they won that half an hour contest, they got you house. In our world, knowledge of money is more a long term, subtle investment for most people, and people tend to ignore stuff that is useful in the long term. For example, unless you are a stock broker or something, learning how to manage your finances and invest will most likely make you significantly richer next year, not tomorrow.

But in this world, being bad at games could have instant, life changing consequences. Being good at games can have instant, life changing consequences. The best gamer in your species could literally sell you all into slavery (betting the race piece and losing) and there would be nothing you could do unless you could beat them at a game and take their title. In that kind of world, where gaming is both self-defence, politics, economics and, it seems, a large part of crime (muggers challenging people to games), not learning a lot about games is a lot different than people in our world not studying up on money.

Being great at money in our world is (for the average worker) like being a sighted man in a world where everyone is wearing bad glasses, and your place in life is how well you can pick ripe fruit from nearby low hanging trees. Most will get by just fine without perfect sight, but you will do significantly better in the long run as you stockpile more fruit.

Being the best gamer in this world is like being an ultra buff guy in a world where everyone can life max 5 kilos, there are no weapons, they have to all fight you 1 v 1, can't refuse to fight you, and winning can get you anything they are willing to bet.
