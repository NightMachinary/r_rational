Ah but in this world of games, if someone wants to mug you, they challenge you to a game. If you want to hold any position of power, you have to achieve it through games and hold it via games (as at least in the anime, it is not explained how refusing a game works, or even if you're really allowed to do that). Being good games appears to, in this world, give you unlimited political and financial power, if you can beat your opponents. Meanwhile money is only useful if you have it, and cannot always be used to directly beat your opponents. For example, if you want to be president, you campaign, and money helps, but having more money than you're opponent won't be the end all cause of your victory. In No Game No Life, if you want to be king, you play games, and whether or not you win is the only reason for your ascension to royalty.
