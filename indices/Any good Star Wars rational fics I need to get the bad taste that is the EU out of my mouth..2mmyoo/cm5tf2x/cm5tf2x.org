A somewhat rational fic is Conquest at [[http://www.stardestroyer.net/Empire/Fanfic/Conquest/index.html]] as a Star Trek vs Star Wars novel.

It's somewhat biased towards an (IMO) overpowered Empire. While not strictly rational fiction as we know it, the story does a pretty thorough job pitting the two franchises against each other, both exploiting each other's strengths and weaknesses, though the SW side conveniently has fewer weaknesses.
