Though I'm fairly sure that you've read them, since they're entryway books, I do want to mention that the Thrawn trilogy is the most rational of the EU books. You can tell that actual thought went into strategy and tactics. They're /far/ from perfect, but I consider them the best of the bunch.

I know of no rational take on Star Wars. It's a universe that's fairly ripe for it in some ways (in that it's a universe/plot in need of fixing) and terrible in others (a lot is left very vague, and it would be hard to make the universe consistent, especially if EU is considered canon).
