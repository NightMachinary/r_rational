  I feel like researching the Force would be the major focus of a rational!Star Wars fic

I would actually like to see a deconstruction of this. Anakin or whoever our rational Jedi is wants to research it, but the Jedi archives have most of his ideas already tested with inconclusive results. The danger of the dark side makes his other experiment ideas too dangerous. Our rationalist then has to rely on Bayesian probability estimates using the existing body of knowledge about the force because there are issues making the force hard to study (the dark side, plus the Force not following reductionist rules, etc.).

Actually, in general, I would be interested in the state of the scientific method in a galaxy in which technology and science have stagnated at such an advanced level. If all the basic research has been done, it may be a matter of archiving and sharing data effectively versus trying to recreate research some other scientists already did a millenia ago.
