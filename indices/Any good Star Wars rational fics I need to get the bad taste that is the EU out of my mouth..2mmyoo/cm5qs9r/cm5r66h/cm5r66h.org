Honestly I would like to go back to the basics on the force and just start over, I felt like Star Wars really got caught up in this Naruto style labeling of everything to do with the force ever and I'd like to go back to a time when the force was more vague and pervasive than the solidified form it had in the EU or even in the prequels and just go on from the info we get in the original three movies.
