The big problem with ditching canon is that people don't tend to like divergence. Star Wars fanfic will most likely be read by people who like Star Wars, and if you change the things that they consider fundamental to the universe, they'll complain (or more likely, just close the tab and not read again). This is true even if you're up-front about the fact that the fic you're writing takes place somewhere that's only tangentially related to canon.

A second problem is that if you're going to be rebuilding Star Wars from the ground up, there's a strong argument for just making your own unique space opera (and people will ask you why you're not doing that).

I've written a few pieces of fanfic that diverge strongly from the source material, and have gotten these types of complaints.
