I really am ok with the precog aspect, as it fits with the idea of true power as knowledge trumps brute force and with precognition that goes double.

I can appreciate the idea of Dark side having more physical power in relation to Light side but I still think physical power is overplayed outside of personal conflicts or rather to say conflicts between individuals. I really imagine that the power of the precog is not to see full events but to just be in tune with the force which guides force-users to smaller events which have larger over-reaching effects.

The light side users are generally more direct-action, they interfere with events as they happen, scoring victories and bringing the universe in alignment with the light. Whereas the dark side users, there being smaller numbers of them (like the sith rule of two for example) are generally working behind the scenes Palpatine style analyzing the greater structure of causality and having a better feel of the big picture as to allow their actions to hold more weight.

An event like the accidental death might seem a little important to a normal lightside user, something that will turn the timestream surrounding the subject of the accident more Light. The dark side user however, can see down the line further and realize that saving that person now makes said person the critical link in some much bigger development when it would have been someone else had the person died.

If the Sith were able to be essentially tap the force to allow them to see through Chaos theory, they would both be extremely powerful and nigh undetectable by anyone except maybe the best of the Jedi, and that would be a Master who had even caught on that there was something wrong in the first place, as the Sith's influence will undoubtedly pass as the natural order of events to all but the most keen Jedi.

It is in keeping with the idea of the Sith being few in number and powerful, and their near-legendary status by virtue of being effectively a myth to the general population, most Jedi's included.

I really should read Worm, that's on my to-do list.
