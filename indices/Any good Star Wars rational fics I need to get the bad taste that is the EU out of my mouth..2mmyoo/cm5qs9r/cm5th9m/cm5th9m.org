  Droids. Artificially created intelligence. So much more to explore there.

More than Gungans or Ewoks or Midichlorians or what have you, placement and treatment of droids is my number one pet peeve about Star Wars. When they aren't part of the scenery, or tools that do what they need to (except when they can't, for plot) all their characterization is through slapstick comedy.

Note: I haven't yet read any EU, only seen the movies, both Clone Wars series+, and the Star Wars Holiday Special, to my eternal chagrin+.
