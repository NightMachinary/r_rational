I'm only being halfway snarky. There are a ton of things that I'd love to read, and a ton more that I'd love to write, but the difference in time commitment is immense. /Metropolitan Man/ is 80K words, and took me (as a lower bound) 65 hours to write. It can be read in a handful of hours - maybe less.

I would /love/ to write my own version of Star Wars ([[http://www.reddit.com/r/AskScienceFiction/comments/2cp4qg/luke_and_leia_are_switched_at_birth_he_becomes/cjhs5e3?context=3][see here]]), but to write even a novella length treatment would take so much time and effort, and there are so many things that I would rather be spending that time and effort on.

A lot of time on this subreddit I see people putting in requests, or suggestions for how a thing should be written, but not actually writing. And while I think that's sort of regrettable, since I would much rather read a well-done treatment of the subject than theorycrafting about how to do a treatment of the subject, I get that the reason that it happens so often is the amount of time and effort involved in writing compared to the time and effort involved in reading.
