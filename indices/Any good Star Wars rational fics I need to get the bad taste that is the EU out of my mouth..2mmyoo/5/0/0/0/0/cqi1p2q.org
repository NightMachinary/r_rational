Hm...

The biggest time investment (at least for me) is in plotting and worldbuilding and outlining. OTOH once I have an outline, I can pump out up to 1,500 words an hour.

Taking that in mind, and the subreddit's love for, as you say, theorycrafting, I wonder if there's any potential in crowdsourcing the world and outline and then another person (I'm happy to volunteer myself) doing the actual pounding out of words.

What do you think-- stupid beyond belief, or worth trying?
