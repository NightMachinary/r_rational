  Top tier light side abilities require faith/trust in the force, reducing your epistemic accuracy but granting amazing insight and precognition. Top tier dark side abilities have a lot of raw physical power but ultimately cause the user to become mentally unbalanced to lose sight of their values.

I've always thought that the Force makes the most sense if you suppose that being a Force sensitive tends to drive a person insane. That's the reason decent Force sensitives can be tempted by the idea of becoming sadistic overlords. It's why the Jedi Order teaches extreme self-control, and trains Force sensitives to suppress all emotion, including love.

The Jedi Order, according to this theory, wasn't founded to protect society through the use of the Force, it was founded to protect society from Force sensitives. The culture of asceticism, the constant self-sacrifice, the training of very young Force sensitives- these were all meant as ways of helping Force sensitives maintain sanity. Even the idea of a separate light and dark side was invented as a way of giving Force sensitives a tangible thing to resist, since they can't ignore their link to the Force entirely.

The reason people like Palpatine and Anakin became a new generation of Sith was because the Jedi had forgotten their original purpose. For a long time, they'd been devoting their resources to accumulating political power and political responsibility instead of focusing their efforts on finding and training Force sensitives.
