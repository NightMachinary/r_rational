  I've always thought that the Force makes the most sense if you suppose that being a Force sensitive tends to drive a person insane.

I really think it would be an interesting conflict for our rational character to need to use a dark side technique to accomplish a really important goal, one worthwhile enough that the risk of going insane is a good trade-off. You could do a Wildbow type deal were you portray everything from the main character's perspective, even as they go insane.

  It's why the Jedi Order teaches extreme self-control, and trains Force sensitives to suppress all emotion, including love.

I also think it would be really interesting to cover the history of the Jedi Order, when they were first laying down their rules and developing their training techniques. They attempt to study a phenomena, the Force, which doesn't obey any of the precepts of a reductionist paradigm, and which actively corrupts users that try to bend it to their will.
