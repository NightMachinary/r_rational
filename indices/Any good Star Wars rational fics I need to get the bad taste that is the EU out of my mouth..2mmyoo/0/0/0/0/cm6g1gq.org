  I also think it would be really interesting to cover the history of the Jedi Order

The very early history of the Star Wars universe has always seemed like a setting where some very interesting stories could be told.

The way I'd write it would be to have the first, most powerful Dark Jedi emerge in an early spacefaring society. They'd be able to shield their bodies from bullets and pull jet fighters from the sky, and they'd wage a merciless war of domination against all of the nations of their world. That war would see the first energy blasters invented as anti-Jedi weapons- force users only being able to deflect material projectiles- though the invention would come far too late.

In the following Dark Jedi-ruled age, the history of the galaxy would be lost, and the energy weapons that had been created to fight the Dark Jedi would become their tool. With any threat of rival force-users kept in check by the countless blaster-armed soldiers of the Dark Jedi, no one could pose a credible challenge.

That would change with the invention of the lightsaber. It's inventor, a genius lacking any Force sensitivity, would nevertheless recognize it's significance. They would found a Light Jedi Order in secret, a prototype for the Jedi Order later founded on Tython. They would recruit Force sensitives and train them in both a method for maintaining their sanity and a Force technique for deflecting blaster fire with the lightsaber. The blaster-equipped armies of the Dark Jedi made obsolete, the Light Jedi would finally bring a new order to the galaxy, and found what would later become the Galactic Republic.
