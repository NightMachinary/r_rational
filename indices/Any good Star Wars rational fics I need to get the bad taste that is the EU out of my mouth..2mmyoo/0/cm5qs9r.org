I feel like the whole Jedi precognition angle is heavily underused. In Worm, thinker powers totally dominate at the highest level. I would really enjoy a fic that shows just how much effort Palpatine had to put into coming up with a plan to mess up their precog and out maneuver the entire Jedi council. Palpatine could be rewritten as a tragic anti-hero who succeeded in his instrumental goals, but failed in his terminal goals as he went mad with power from over using the dark side.

Other fun angles I would want to see:

- Dealing with instrumentally useful powers that adversely affect your epistemic rationality or your values. Top tier light side abilities require faith/trust in the force, reducing your epistemic accuracy but granting amazing insight and precognition. Top tier dark side abilities have a lot of raw physical power but ultimately cause the user to become mentally unbalanced to lose sight of their values.

- Clever use of force precognition by the characters and to explain in universe characteristics. Why do they have human fighter pilots instead of all droids? Force precognition exists at a low level in most sapient beings, giving an advantage over droid systems. Jedi using their force precognition to be in the right place at the right time to mediate conflicts, thus explaining how mere thousands of them can keep peace in a galactic empire (this is hinted at in the novelizations I think but not fully explored).

- Droids. Artificially created intelligence. So much more to explore there.

I would consider writing such myself, even with my lack of experience, however I haven't read any of the EU or even the novelizations of the movies so I wouldn't be able to do a good job with that stuff.
