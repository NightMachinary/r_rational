I like the idea that [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2b0img/star_wars_rational_take/cj1o4ji][midichlorians are a /result/ of being force sensitive, not a /cause/]]. As in, midichlorians grow or concentrate in people who are force sensitive. I would read the /fuck/ out of a story that followed a [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2b0img/star_wars_rational_take/cj0rycv][rational!Skywalker]] through the Clone Wars as he struggled with the slavery of sapients (both droids and humans), Jedi mind control, the difference between the Light and Dark Sides, and finally the almost-certainly-artificial origin of the Force (Celesials as UFAIs) ...

Damn, maybe I should write it.
