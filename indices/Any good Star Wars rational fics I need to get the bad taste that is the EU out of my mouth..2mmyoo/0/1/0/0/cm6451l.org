I feel like researching the Force would be the major focus of a rational!Star Wars fic, just as researching magic is for Harry Potter, researching Sakuradite for Code Geass, researching Spiral Energy for Tengen Toppa, etc.. Reclassify the Jedi Order as an order of researchers and scientists rather than peace-keepers.

Additionally, I read on this subreddit at some point a theory on the Force that I rather liked. To paraphrase: "There is only the Dark Side of the Force, and the Light Side is just people strong-willed enough to take advantage of it without being corrupted."

Edited note: I haven't actually seen a rational!Code Geass fic. I'm intending to write one, though, and that would focus on Sakuradite.
