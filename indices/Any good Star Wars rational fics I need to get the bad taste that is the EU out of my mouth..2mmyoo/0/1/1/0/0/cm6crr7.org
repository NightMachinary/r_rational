  I hate that the force became something so driect and really kind of uninspired instead of pervasive and indirect; when the force was considered a greater power than the death star and that actually meant something besides that a Jedi could just physically blow up a planet with his mind.

Precog, used well, is super OP. Seeing the exact time and place to to fire and having supernatural reflexes to pull it off is a lot more powerful than raw physical powers. A rationalist should really appreciate the value of mental abilities over physical ones in terms of maximizing their capacity to actualize desired results. Hence why I brought up Worm, because thinker powers are extremely powerful. The most powerful parahuman isn't Eidolon, but rather Contessa.

Another idea I had is to have an dichotomy between dark and light side of the force in how they use its power. Dark side bends it to their will and thus have more raw physical power and the ability to force the future they want (EU blowing up star destroyer type stuff). Light side lets the force guide them and thus they have subtler physical powers but they can guide the future more gently. A rationalist fic could really play up this dichotomy, and a rationalist character would really appreciate and minmax precog.
