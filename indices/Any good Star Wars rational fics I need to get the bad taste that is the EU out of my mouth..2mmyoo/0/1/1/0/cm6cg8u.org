I mean, I think of HPMOR as divergent just because it doesn't view magic throught the same lens as the original, that's what makes it good. The whole point of a Rational Star Wars fic to me would be to take a different approach to the force as defined in the movies and avoid the generic anime style cut and divisions the force turned into.

I wouldn't want to see a rational fic that adheres to the portions of the EU which exist for little rational reason. I hate that the force became something so driect and really kind of uninspired instead of pervasive and indirect; when the force was considered a greater power than the death star and that actually meant something besides that a Jedi could just physically blow up a planet with his mind. Apparently in the EU there was no idea that this comparison could be taken in any other way than the most literal way possible and we ended up with Jedis who could pull Star Destroyers out of the sky and a bad guy who can make black holes with his mind.

God forbid that anyone have the idea that maybe the force is more powerful than a giant laser because saying that the death star is more powerful than the force is like trying to say that a bullet is more powerful than water. You can kill a person with a bullet, but water has shaped the course of civilization and scored the earth through erosion in such a way no measly piece of metal could ever do.

But no, we couldn't have the idea of the force as something pervasive and immutable, something ordinary weapons could never touch by virtue of its timelessness, we got something that we could apparently only relate to if we turned it into magic ninjitsu and had characters be able to perform greater more powerful feats over time as the only way to advance the universe, as opposed to you know, having a real story and not requiring insane levels of power creep to keep things interesting.

I really wanted the EU to be Cowboy Bebop, but instead I feel like I got Bleach instead. But I am an irrationally bitter asshole when it comes to the direction Star Wars went in so take what I say with a grain of salt.
