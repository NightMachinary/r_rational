Building a human level AI as a child in a universe where there are millions or billions or more human AIs running around already doesn't seem like as much of an accomplishment as it might otherwise. I mean, I could 'build' an operating system comprised of millions of lines of code by downloading the source code and compiling it, and I don't think that reflects super-well on my skill as a programmer - and the equivalent for making human level AIs in Star Wars may not be much more complicated (and indeed may be rather simpler). If "build an AI" is "download the code for generating a protocol droid personality and hit OK past a couple EULAs then maybe set some sliders for personality" that makes a lot more sense with Anakin's portrayal and personality in the rest of the series.

Notice how Anakin made a human droid that was /exactly the same body plan and size and functionality and everything as existing protocol droids/ - like, he was not exactly putting a new robot together from scratch starting with a pile of servos and some scrap metal with zero plans, the end result looks instead a lot like Anakin 'built' his robot in the same way I 'built' a desktop PC by plugging together standard parts that were built to be removable and plugged together. If I was told an eight year old "built a computer" by managing to plug tab a into obviously-tab-a-shaped-slot-a and so forth, I would be only slightly impressed.

That said, making Anakin into an actual genius instead of a stupid little kid would have a lot of potential for making a prequel trilogy SW more interesting. Excise stuff like the immortal line, "From my point of view the Jedi are evil!" and insert some actual analysis and maybe even actual reasons or motivations to join the dark side of the force...
