It's worth trying. I guess my advice would be to be on lookout for someone with opposite strengths - someone who is good (or just efficient) at outlines and plotting but bad (or just inefficient) at writing prose, and be ready to pull them into one-on-one collaboration. My experience has been that two people working in close contact with each other tend to produce better/faster work. There's a reason that you see a lot of books that are written collaboratively are written by two people and not three.

Successful crowdsourcing is hard though, especially if you don't have a ready supply of interested people. It might be better to just make an open call for a singular collaborator.
