I guess it depends on how difficult the AI building kits are to use.

If it was just moving some sliders then hitting "Go!", then yes. Not very impressive.

But if they require you to design a virtual connectome from scratch or write complicated bits of software for each aspect of the personality which the kit then connects together into a functioning AI, then it's a lot /more/ impressive.

Since not everyone in starwars has a droid butler, and Anakin is too poor to buy a super expensive kit that's out of most peoples price range, I can only assume that the answer leans at least somewhat towards the latter.
