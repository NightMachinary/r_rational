So, I'm wondering if the goblin was actually aiming at the fae, or if it was just a lucky hit. Or a "lucky" hit, with the shot being nudged along by Fate when the fae decided to just start raining arrows on Cat from beyond her ability to retaliate when she had yet to start her main fight for the battle.
