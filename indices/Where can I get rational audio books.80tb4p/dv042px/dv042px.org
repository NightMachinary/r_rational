A trick I've adopted because I'm still to lazy to organize my own podcast of fiction I want to listen to: I use a text to speech engine if there isn't or won't be a podcast of the story. That said I started playing with listening to robo-text and getting all of the context clues from words not toe of voice in 99 or 00. It takes about six month to a year to get used to it, but once it becomes comfortable you can listen to anything from research papers (do your first and second reading not your hard nth deep read) on it to Time Braid.
