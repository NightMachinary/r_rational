I do this too. I have been using Ivona Reader - it's amazing, especially once you find a good voice pack that sounds natural to you (VW Paul is soo good) I ended up using it for everything from my textbooks, powerpoints and of course ebooks. On android there is a handy little app called PDF to Speech that wasn't bad either - it supports more than Pdfs despite the name.
