"Mass Market" titles, like The Martian, would have audiobooks. Fanfiction and niche titles (like.... Crystal Society or whatever) less so as you seem to have experienced.

I'd go on the TVtropes mohs scale of science fiction hardness page and look at the stuff listed in the "hardness 9" section, and see what you can find audiobooks of. Audible is the go-to location for audiobooks.
