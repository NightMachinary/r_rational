I didn't actually downvote you; that was just my first impulse, which I suppressed.

The reason why I might have done so is because there is not much difference between an audiobook and a podcast, so your post came across as a petty complaint about the HPMOR podcast... and furthermore, one that didn't do a very good job at specifying just exactly what your complaint actually was, or what you would consider an improvement.
