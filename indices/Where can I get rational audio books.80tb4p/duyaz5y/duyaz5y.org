I'm not sure I understand your problem, so I'm going to think about it carefully and present possibilities... instead of going with my first impulse, which was to downvote you for laziness and silently move on.

A single audiobook is somewhat more convenient than hundreds of downloads for a large series, but for a short series, it's not a big deal. If you want to listen to them on your music player of choice, you can just make a playlist out of the handful of files, and you're basically there. For that matter, many audiobooks that you can download are broken into chapters in terms of file format, which is approximately the same as the podcast format.

Since you're specifically referring to the HPMOR podcast, I suppose it might be a little better to have a miniseries as a single continuous audio, instead of having the intro-outtro thing around each episode, so that's one thing that someone might conveniently do to simplify your life. I haven't seen those particular files in that particular format either... but what you're asking is not a particularly difficult sort of audio editing. If it's /that/ important to you, I'd suggest downloading some audio editing software and doing the job yourself, reading a few tutorials if necessary.
