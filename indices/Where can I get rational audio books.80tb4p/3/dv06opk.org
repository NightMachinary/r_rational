  Then there's several stories in the HPMOR podcast (Mmm, 3 Worlds Collide, The Study of Anglophysics :) ), but they're broken into episodes, where's the audio book?

In the specific case of HPMOR, I did a google search for 'HPMOR podcast' and the first thing that came up with [[http://www.hpmorpodcast.com/?page_id=56][this page]] which seems to have all of the episodes compiled into several larger audiobook files, so rejoice, for the audiobook you seek is readily available.

In the general case, a podcast is basically a collection of MP3 files distributed through an RSS feed. An audiobook can be distributed as MP3 file(s) or, alternatively, an M4B, which is an audio file that can contain multiple "chapters" (hence how hundreds of MP3 files can be condensed into a small handful of M4B's). Most modern audiobook and podcast players have the ability to remember where you left off regardless of file format (by simply storing that information in the app settings, rather than in the audio file itself), so at a certain point, the distinction between "podcast" and "audiobook" basically just comes down to distribution, as the end result is "I have a bunch of audio files that I want to listen to" (and at that point, how exactly you acquired them is less material).

When you say, "I get that there's a podcast, but where's the audio book?" I'm not sure I really understand the nature of the problem you're experiencing. If your issue is "I don't know how to listen to this audio file in a way where I can easily pause and resume my progress," I think the solution would be to simply get a modern podcast or audiobook app with a pause/play function. If your issue is "downloading 50 different podcast episodes from an RSS feed seems like a huge pain," my suggestion would be to find a podcast app with a "download all episodes" function, which seems like it would be a fairly common feature (it's included in Pocketcasts, which is my podcast app of choice). I think that the developers of most podcast players are cognizant of the fact that "I want to download this podcast's entire history and listen to all of the episodes in order" is a fairly common use case, and consequently I would expect most podcast players to have a feature that makes this easier. (Stitcher might be an exception to this, since Stitcher's business model is based around getting you to listen to ads, and serving you ads requires that you have an internet connection, so allowing you to easily download large collections of episodes for offline listening is counter to this goal. This is just one reason among many that I don't recommend using Stitcher.)
