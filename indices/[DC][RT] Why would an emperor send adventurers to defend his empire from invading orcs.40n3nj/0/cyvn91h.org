These reasons are not very convincing:

"Just" upgraded equipment. A +1 greatsword costs as much as 470 longspears, and the ratio gets more extreme with genuinely good equipment. An army is cheaper.

There's some truth to this. Sending many adventuring bands to their deaths is less bad for your reputation than getting large hunks of your army killed. But it's not a big difference. Soldiers are replaceable too.

  The Army is Busy / Politics
#+end_quote

These arguments apply equally well to dispatching a regiment or a band of subsidized murderhobos. We're looking for a /comparative/ advantage.

To somebody. Murderhobos are /much/ more likely to overthrow you than an army is. Some do it for power; others for the good of the country. An army has those motives as well, but it would have a huge co-ordination problem to solve first. And it's easier to keep an eye on it and see if coup sentiments are rising.

So what's the real reason?

There are threats an army can't handle. Maybe the orcs are being led by a dragon or a high-level druid. An army isn't going to do much good against those. A band of murderhobos /might/ level up enough in the journey that they can. In a world of DR and area-effect spells, quality trumps quantity.
