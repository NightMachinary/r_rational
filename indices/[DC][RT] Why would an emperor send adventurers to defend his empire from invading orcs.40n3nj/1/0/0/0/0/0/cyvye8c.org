Yeah. Personally in campaigns with levels, I have a judgement that for an average place, no one is above level 3- an average soldier might be 1, 1/100 might be level 2, 1/1000 might be level 3, 1/10000 might be level 4, 1/100,000 might be level 5. You need to start adding in planar forces and magical lifespans and such to get higher levels generally, and when I want my players to face a greater threat I bring in elves, demons, angels, centuries old mages. Consider say, a single guard. They might have to successfully kill 10 goblins to level up. That's going to be far beyond most guards, not many are going to be that lucky. Tends to make my players feel much more awesome to get that far.

Your artisan sounds very awesome and powerful, and I hope they find fun conflicts for their flying carrier.
