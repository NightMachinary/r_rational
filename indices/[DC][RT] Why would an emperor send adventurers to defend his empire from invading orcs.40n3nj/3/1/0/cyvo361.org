I think that reinforces my point more than defeats it, I've played and read many fantasy worlds and their use of Empire to liven up the name of their in universe nations is not unusual, but it tends not to actually make much of an impact on size. It's obviously not a huge deal but compare to this, and you're moving out of the Middle Ages and into Renaissance.

Like I said, if it's not based on medieval Europe then it's fine, the number just surprised me is all, it's much more comparable as you say to the vast numbers China could bring to force.
