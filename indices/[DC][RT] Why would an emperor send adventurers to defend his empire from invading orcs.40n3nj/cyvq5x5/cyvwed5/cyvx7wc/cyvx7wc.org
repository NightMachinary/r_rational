Acccctually, as a necessary consequence of the [[http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/other-rules/settlements][Settlement]] rules in Pathfinder/3.5, any settlement with more than 25,000 people has at least one spellcaster capable of casting 8th level spells, meaning an at minimum 15th level character.

Look at any Pathfinder book describing the world of Golarion, and you'll see many high level characters and monsters in each country and area.

In D&D worlds, Authority Equals Asskicking is a law of reality. Most Emperors are going to be mid to high teens level, or else they would have been killed and replaced by someone who actually is.
