We had to talk him down. He was under some mistaken impressions that we were the harbingers of the apocalypse, as we had been framed for some large-scale destruction (Someone inadvertently set off what was basically a nuke in a major town and blamed us for it). Plus one of our main foes right now is the Chosen of Nyarlathotep, who is a god of trickery among other things. Our Divination spells have been backfiring or giving false information, some of the things we discovered are impossible to spread to the general population as there is a world-wide 'Taboo' on mentioning them (turns out a relatively new God is in cahoots with Nyarlathotep, and we were tricked into freeing him from a time freeze). And assorted other things a god-like entity can do to troll mortals even with the Divine Cold War rules against directly squashing us in play.

We had to go through a long subquest to sever ourselves from Fate to remove the ability for Nyarlathotep to screw with our minds and views, and right now nothing is certain.

So, some of my manufacturing base is building a nonmagical Oracle device to answer our divination type questions without being fucked over by Nyarlathotep's portfolio.
