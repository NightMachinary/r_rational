We have 2 Mythic Ranks, as we are the chosen of the Gods in this homebrew world (My own character being the chosen of the God of Innovation and Invention), so we tend to fight things that are obscenely powerful. The previous fight was with a metamind of 8 mid teen leveled psions. Before that there was a 17th level character, a thunder behemoth (mini-tarrasque), the previous champion of my god (who built similarly crazy things, including an enormous missile and laser laden robot suit), and dark shades of /every foe a particular character killed throughout the entire campaign/, who we had to fight all at once.

I think we mentioned in the last session that we are basically playing Exalted at this point.
