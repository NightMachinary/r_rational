/tl;dr:/

1. *Murder hobos want little in return for success.* They aren't requesting that the Emperor properly arm, train, feed, and pay them. They want acknowledgement, upgraded equipment, and lump-sum cash to take care of the job themselves.

2. *Murder hobos are a dime a dozen.* What, did the party honestly believe they were the only self-proclaimed heroes to band together and fight back against the Orkish menace? They were the only survivors, the only ones to pick up swords and fight? Volunteers always appear when the world presents a lucrative murdering opportunity--and here was a murdering opportunity. So disposable. And so many people waiting in line to die!

3. *The army is busy.* The Emperor has to think big. And, in thinking big, he's thinking about his heartland, where he grows the food to feed the overly perfumed population of his core cities. The frontier brings him nothing. His cities, everything. The Emperor isn't going to burn his armies on something as tedious as the frontier when he has volunteers standing in line to defend it and die on the cheap. No, he's going to unleash his dark armies on his neighboring nation-states and take them, instead. Orks, after all, don't pay that much in taxes. Elves, well... Elves do.

4. *Politics.* Who speaks in Court for the peaceful peasant villages of the frontier? Maybe a lower level aristocrat owns those lands. Maybe no one owns those lands and the villages are a collective community of tiny oligarchies. Maybe they are voiceless and hope and pray that murder hobos will defend them from the rampaging Ork Hordes of the east. The Emperor must balance all the voices of the various factions who swirl around him at Court. If no one insists the overrun frontier is more important than, say, the Emperor's plans to invade the Elves and take their lands, he sends no army.

5. *Murder-hobo investment pays dividends.* For the sake of argument, the murder-hobo investment in some cash and equipment pays out. A princess gives them medals and proclaims them heroes. YAY! For a pitiful investment, the Empire gets to flip the frontier into a stable strip of Empire. They weren't expecting to do so--but, hey, now it's here! Sure, it's far from the Capital City and inconvenient to tax--but any tax is greater than zero tax. /Now/ we send out the army to stabilize and build the edifices of government.

/Consequences of murder-hobo failure:/ The outcome depends on what the Orks want. If they simply want better land, the consequences are long-term obnoxious but not Empire-ending. The Orks overrun the eastern frontier, declare themselves their own tiny nation-state, and are eventually made a satellite of the Empire through trade and culture. But if the Orks want raw conquest, the Empire has a real problem on its hands...
