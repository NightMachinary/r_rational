You would imagine so but I assumed not from the complete lack of mention of any of those other implications as far as I could tell apart from the Emperor dealing with multiple "hero parties" and the unusually large army it is an otherwise par for the course world. For a start I can't imagine orc incursions being a thing that could be dealt with by a handful of level one characters in a world where magic is taken to it's conclusion. Nor a classic army being a thing really.
