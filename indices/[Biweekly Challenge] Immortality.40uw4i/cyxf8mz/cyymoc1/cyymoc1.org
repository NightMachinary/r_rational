This story confuses me a bit. I don't understand, how is our protagonist immortal? I get that he built some machine that would kill him rapidly. I just....don't really understand how his consciousness persisted. Scratch that, I understand very little. /Period/. Author, mind giving me an abbreviated, layman's version of what's going on? :P
