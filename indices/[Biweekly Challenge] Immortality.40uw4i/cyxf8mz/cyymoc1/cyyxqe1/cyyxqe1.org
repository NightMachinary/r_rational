Suppose you set up a device so that after a quantum event, there is a 1/2 chance of you being killed.

In the multiple worlds interpretation, both (you being killed, and you not being killed) happen.

Then (the living you) runs the experiment again. The dead you does nothing... he's dead. After this experiment, two of y'all (that's the correct plural form of "you" right?) have died (the death from the first experiment, and the death from the second experiment). Only one out of the three of y'all have lived (the one who survived the first and second experiment).

It continues from there.... Each time you run the experiment, there is another universe where you die, and another universe where you live. This happens /regardless of how many times you run the experiment./ So, even if you run it 1000 times, and your "probability of surviving" is only 1/2^{1000} , you're still guaranteed to survive (as well as die a 1000 times in different universes).

There will /always/ be someone who survives the experiment, and from their perspective, they're un-killable.

It's like "The Prestige." Every time he makes a clone, he has an equal chance of being the drowning clone, or being the transported clone, but /there's always a transported clone who doesn't drown./ The transported clone /feels/ like they're invincible (or really lucky), but there was no other option. Their existence was inevitable.
