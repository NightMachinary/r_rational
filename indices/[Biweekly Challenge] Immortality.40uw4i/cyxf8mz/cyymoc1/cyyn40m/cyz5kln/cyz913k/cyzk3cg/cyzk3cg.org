I see what you're getting at, I'm still at a loss as to how their memory of said events is preserved during these changes in perspective. As he said, the protagonist doesn't survive being shot by a shotgun on an overpass. Hence he "wakes up" in a coma world. I get how we are essentially world skipping. I just don't understand how our protagonist retains his memories, as that's a physical component of us.
