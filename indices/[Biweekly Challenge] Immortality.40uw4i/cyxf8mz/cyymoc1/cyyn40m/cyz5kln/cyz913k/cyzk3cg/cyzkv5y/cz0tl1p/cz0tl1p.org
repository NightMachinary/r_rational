'If you're still alive, then you're alive in a reality where you didn't die'--in the coma version, the coma dream must match the protagonist's experiences up until that point, but why does the level above match your dreamed past to such a degree? Looking at it slightly differently, if you have a three-level state where you go into a coma in reality, you have a coma dream, and then within that you have a second coma-dream which mirrors reality, then why should the middle-layer coma dream mirror reality as well rather than being something completely different?

From yet another direction--if it's a coma dream anyway, then given the unlikelihood of a suicide attempt actually freeing you from your coma, then why not 'you survived stabbing yourself because it's a coma dream, you're still dreaming, and the metal knife just bent like rubber in your dreamworld'? <thinking about the consistent propensity for death of the protagonist's loved one>

(<contemplates Yudkowsky's 'The Finale of the Ultimate Meta Mega Crossover' (regarding breaking upwards) and Greg Egan's 'Permutation City' (minds persisting through random dust)>)

(Without the coma break option, I note that the endeavour would be subjectively ended by unsurvivable things, similarly to natural lifespan if attempted a number of centuries before a bypass could be acquired... though who's to say whether some incredibly improbable universes out there have benevolent AIs spontaneously forming from random pair creation and rushing to save people's lives...)
