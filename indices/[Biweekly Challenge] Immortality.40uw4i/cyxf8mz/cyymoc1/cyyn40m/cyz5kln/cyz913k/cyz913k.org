Well, let me ask you to brainstorm some ways that one's subjective experience might exist after a suicide attempt. N.B. that isn't, strictly speaking, the same as /living/.

By saying a coma is more likely that directly surviving the attempt, what I mean by that is that there are more universes in which our protagonist was in a coma (truly, literally, not a fauxma) than in which (s)he survives.

Does that make any more sense?
