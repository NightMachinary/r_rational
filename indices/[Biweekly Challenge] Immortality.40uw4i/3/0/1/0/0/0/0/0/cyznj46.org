Until this comment, I didn't understand your story at all. It took me this long because this is the first time you've mentioned /dreaming/, which is the missing piece I needed. I had no idea why you thought comas were relevant to anything! (I still don't, actually. Why aren't normal dreams sufficient?)

When I first read it, I interpreted it as though they attempted suicide resulting in brain damage that left them in a coma, such that when they recover... they still attempted suicide. And I had no idea what they were talking about with "wiping the slate clean", except that apparently it worked anyway? The train/car discrepancy just read like nonsense.

This may be due to my own thoughts on quantum immortality. I think that brain damage is obviously the most likely outcome of most quantum-failed suicides. I never thought that in the story, that might not be true, which may not be your fault.
