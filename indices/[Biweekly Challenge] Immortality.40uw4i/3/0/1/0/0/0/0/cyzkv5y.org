Ignore all quantum whatever and ignore many worlds for a moment, and let's talk about one totally mundane timeline. Imagine a universe in which the protagonist's life continues as it did before, say, they build the machine. Then at some point they get into a car crash, enter a coma, forget about the crash, and proceed to build an insane, delusional quantum killbox. They fantasize (within the coma) that they are immortal, the events of the story happen, suicide attempts are made and fail (within the coma), then eventually, after one of the attempts, they wake up. None of it really happened since the crash; they've been lying in a hospital bed. They retain their memories because why wouldn't they? After waking up from a coma, the internal events you experience might lose focus and become blurry, but it's implied that the narrator is losing their grip on reality and losing count of the number of breaks.

Does it seem to you that this is a possible and self-consistent chain of events?

If so, then in the logic of this story, that's sufficient for there to be a timeline in which it happens. That means waking up from a coma is one conceivable way to survive a suicide attempt, in the framework of quantum immortality.
