  "Let me ask you a question. How many neurons are there in the human brain?"

  "Uhh. Ten billion?"

  "Close. Eighty-six billion, but let's round that to a hundred. Ten to the eleven. And how many different ways are there to network those neurons?"

  My head began to spin. "I have no fucking idea. Wait, it's a graph problem, right? A hundred billion nodes, and each node can connect to any other. So for every pair of nodes, you have two possibilities, so it's...two to the power of a hundred billion choose two?"

  "Yup. About two to the two-hundred ten. And that's what's stored on there."

You've dropped an exponent somewhere. A hundred billion nodes, 10^{11}. Square that for the number of connections - so, 10^{22} connections. And each one can be on or off, so we need 10^{22} bits /to store a single brain/.

Storing every possible and impossible brain is actually closer to 2^{10^{22}} bits.
