The password concept is fundamentally flawed. If it is randomly generated, then there will be brains in the collection for every single outcome of the random generation, because it contains all brains that ever could be. If it is not randomly generated, at best it's a stand-in for life experience questions, and at worst, it's dummy information because of human's inability to be random.

To specify one exact brain among all possible brains, you need exactly the information the brain contains. Passwords replace some of that information, but say little or nothing about the part you care about. (What is said is, for example, 'chose to memorise an x length password').
