Thanks, that's a fascinating article. I think it's more complicated than just being a Luddite. But then, so were the Luddites themselves in the first place. They weren't smashing machines because they just hated machines, they were smashing the machines their bosses were using to oppress and impoverish them.

There's definitely something to that speculation in the article, "My best guess is that he was somewhat tired of hearing us engineering geeks rave about Snow Crash as a grand vision for the future. That may have something to do with Snow Crash being a dystopian vision." Snow Crash isn't Star Trek, it's not supposed to be something to look forward to, not something to actively try to create. And Stephenson's spent most of his adult life watching his darkest predictions for the world come true.
