The world of Snow Crash is messed up, but there's technology in Snow Crash that evokes a good deal of hopefulness. And what's messed up about the world of Snow Crash appeals to some people with terrible visions.

On the other hand, if you'll permit some speculation.... there's also a lot in Star Trek that's messed up. The way they treat AIs is horrifying. Data is a thing, not a person. They have much more effective AI technology than they admit if it's so easy to generate AI in the holodecks. It's like the big computer systems are at the verge of awareness or even over the edge and only held in check by “safety protocols” and it's some big secret nobody's willing to admit.

On the gripping hand, William Gibson doesn't see the world of Neuromancer as a dystopia.
