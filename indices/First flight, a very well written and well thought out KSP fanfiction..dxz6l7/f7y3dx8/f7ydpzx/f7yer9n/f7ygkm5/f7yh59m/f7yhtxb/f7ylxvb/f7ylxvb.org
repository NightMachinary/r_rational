In 1985 I was already looking forward to today. My favorite SF novels predicted the Internet, in various forms. I got into the always-online thing as soon as I could, even if that meant a Palm VII and you could only access special "WAP-enabled" websites.

This quote from an interview is telling:

  The Gargoyles in Snow Crash are kind of in a different category from the Metaverse users, because they're using what we would now call an augmented-reality device. But I think we sort of are there already with smartphones. The real question isn't whether it's going to happen but how artfully it's going to be done, and can we make it better than it is now? More social, more elegant, and just more conducive to healthy society, healthy interactions? The practice of going around hunched over a rectangle in your hand is completely normal now, and when I see somebody in a car or walking down the street hundreds of feet away, I can tell that they're texting just by their posture. We all can. It's what we've turned into because of the particular way that we're connected through technology. I'd like to think it can get better than what we have now.
