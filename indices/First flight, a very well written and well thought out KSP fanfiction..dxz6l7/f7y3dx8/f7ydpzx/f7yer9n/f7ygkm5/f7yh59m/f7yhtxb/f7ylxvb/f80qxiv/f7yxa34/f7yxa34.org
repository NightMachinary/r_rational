I honestly agree with that quote and not sure it means a particular dislike of smartphones though I can see how it could be evidence for that in a wider context. I think that the amount of technology is more of an opportunity than a problem but I also think that the culture surrounding it is flawed and often tech allows us to enable bad habits because of how we use it. I think governments should put more money into researching how to fit tech into a healthy lifestyle or build one around technology.
