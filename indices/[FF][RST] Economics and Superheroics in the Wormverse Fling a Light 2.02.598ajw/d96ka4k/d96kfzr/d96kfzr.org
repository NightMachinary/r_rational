If she won right off the bat, what would I put at the end? One of the issues with the serial format is that the resolution isn't just 200 pages and a binge-reading session away, so it can get a bit frustrating. Some people go too far in the other direction and have their protagonists win win win the entire time, but that sacrifices the story's structure and longevity for short-term zanyness. I hope to strike a balance in the future, but for now I'm going for structure over everything and damning the consequences.
