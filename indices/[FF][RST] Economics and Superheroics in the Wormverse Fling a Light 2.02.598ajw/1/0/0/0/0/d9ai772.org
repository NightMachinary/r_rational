In alt-universe, there have been a scant few Worm fics where the protagonist didn't quickly prove even more OP than canon Taylor.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10898446/1/Weaver-Nine][Weaver Nine]]: Taylor and Jack Slash swap places at birth. Wonderful, but likely dead ;_;

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/h-mayhem-worm.27201/][H+ Mayhem]]: follows an OC, OP tinker that also has crippling personal flaws which thankfully show up before the wish-fullfillment has a chance to get boring. On hiatus near its ending, maybe not dead.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11626470/1/Crime-and-Commitment][Crime and Commitment]]: Taylor and the Undersiders keep their independence. Taylor's powers are stronger than canon but she faces OC enemies. Ongoing.

*cough* [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11454142/1/Fling-a-Light][Fling a Light]]

...and that's all I can think of (plus a few that are bad for other reasons), Worm or otherwise. Not a long list. And I can't think of ANY crossover-possession or self-insert that didn't fall into a boring snowball of success.
