YAY! Another update!

So does this mean we can expect more frequent updates or was this a stroke of good luck?

Anywhat, this last chapters seem neatly written, I haven't felt any obvious grammatical and writing errors, and story progression seems good.

Might be a good idea for Tesseract INC to work on their PR, maybe transport some basic goods or people for free, really show what her power is good for and why getting her company more resources is a good idea.
