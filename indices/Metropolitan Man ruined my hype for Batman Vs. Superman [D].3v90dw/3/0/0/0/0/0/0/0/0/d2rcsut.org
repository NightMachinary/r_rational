  Due to the popularity of 1632 early on and the mass of Fan Fic Eric Flint has had to institute guidelines on the population of Grantville and the makeup of its residents as of the Ring of Fire. He's got it down to a list of every person in small town including their associations to everyone in the series. To use one of these persons in a story requires the approval of Flint or more likely Grantville Gazette editors Huff and Goodlett. However Flint is not opposed to these short stories upsetting his plan, and instead would like to use them to enrich the series, and perhaps take it in a new direction.

So I was wrong to say fanfiction "of any kind," but to me something isn't really fanfic if the original author has to sign off on it. For example, the Star Wars expanded universe novels shouldn't be equivocated with the "actual" fanfic of Star Wars that exists. Not because of quality reasons or anything, just to reduce confusion.
