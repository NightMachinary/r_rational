PLCD leverages time-travel in strategic planning. The primary advantage of PLCD is acausal reinforcement. The original term was "Preston-Logan Cannon", which is defined as "the gun I'm going to buy/build and aim at you once I get back to my time machine after this battle."

The tactics were developed in 1988 by Bill Preston and Theodore Logan of San Dimas, California. Their version of the doctrine involved stable time-loops which allowed for acausal trade with their future selves. It also required them, at one point, to reinforce an enemy - but that was done in order to lull their less-savvy opponent into a false sense of complacency in order to not endanger bystanders.

/Branches/ uses an iterated timeline cosmology. This opens up a much wider variety of tactics, but requires the sacrifice of hypothetical and alternative timelines in order to secure their resources and information.
