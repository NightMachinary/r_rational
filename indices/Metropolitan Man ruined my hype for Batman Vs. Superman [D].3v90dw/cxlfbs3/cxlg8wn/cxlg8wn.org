I think one thing may be just the nature of film: it's an extremely emotional medium. Batman can't be driven by cold calculation. Lex can't be driven by calculation. Batman must be motivated by visible anger- something you can see on the actor's face. Lex has to be motivated by greed. In fact, I'd put money on him literally being told to his face in the movie that he is greedy.
