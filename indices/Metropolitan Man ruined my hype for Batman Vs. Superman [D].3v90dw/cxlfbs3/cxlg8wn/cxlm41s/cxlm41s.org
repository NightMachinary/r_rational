Just because film is an emotional medium doesn't mean that the characters have to be driven by simple emotions. We could have seen this from Batman's point of view, the destruction wrought by Superman even as he battled Zod. The casual, offhand, collateral damage. We see and understand his fear. Then he has to be pleasant to the existential threat, whilst planning his defeat.

Of course this would mean that you'd have to completely change the genre from comic book beat'em up to character driven thriller. You might have one big fight at the end for the movie's sake with batman going through a mad scramble of more and more desperate gambles. But you don't want to fail to take out the planet-killer.

(Thinking out loud) Though I guess you could have Superman untouched and merciful at the end if the fight (now in the middle of the movie). If you wanted to try and get as close to canon situations at the end, Bruce and Lex may have originally been working together (with separate cell structures in case one is compromised) but when their last ditch efforts prove fruitless, Bruce realises that it's better to have the Superman on your side, while Lex doubles down and can't handle the risk he poses. Bruce gets proved right as the world needs Supes to protect against some huge alien attack, just as Lex attacks again (unfortunate timing) and Batman has to take care of one problem while Supes deals with the other. The movie is not so much about Superman as it is about how Bruce and Lex react to him, Supes is the force-of-nature from Greek play. This way we get to focus on the human emotions rather than whatever Superman feels.
