Angular momentum is not conserved. The astronauts navigating the ship head-first reach out to the walls and push towards their legs, which would add energy to their rotation in a "leaning-back" direction. The weightless center transitioning to the centrifugal spokes was very cool, though I bet if they actually showed the transition, they would ignore Coriolis forces.

The ridiculous-definition video chat has no interface and Cisco is branded in the upper right corner of the screen.

Pictures from Sojourner are constructed on the screen as jumbled overlapping views into the actual image that are then reassembled. This was particularly pointless; the next one actually had some use in pacing of the scene.

The hex editor Johansen uses to examine the non-image sent to the ship does not include an ASCII view, when an ASCII pane is a virtual standard, in every hex editor since Adam. She is able to identify it as "not an image file" simply looking at the hex. Then, when the plaintext file is opened (how can she open it without knowing what it is?), it types itself out on screen with formatting.

The spacewalk to put the bomb on the lock door would at least involve a tether and carabiner, instead of the 6DOF thriller-level intensity that was displayed (a dive straight into the spinning spokes of the grav ring?). I don't think a spacewalk would have been necessary at all.

The Iron Man scene was created for the movie wholesale (it was mentioned as a /joke/), and would be fatally dangerous as Watney admits in the book. Angular momentum is not conserved during this stunt either; he punches a hole in the glove of his suit and holds it out to his side, and does not turn into a whirling dervish as would actually happen. Torque has been beaten bloody and bruised in this movie.

Lewis, the /Commander,/ would not risk herself personally to retrieve Watney when she needs to be coordinating the operation over radio. Beck was the one who tethered out to Watney in the book.

When Watney and Lewis are getting wrapped in the tether, pulling each other closer as though they were trying to kiss through their helmets (I ship it), AM is similarly not conserved, as their rotation should speed up when their distance decreases.

And finally...

THERE IS NO SOUND IN SPACE! Silent space in exterior shots and the limited ambient sound inside your helmet in POV shots is such a nice effect, but no.
