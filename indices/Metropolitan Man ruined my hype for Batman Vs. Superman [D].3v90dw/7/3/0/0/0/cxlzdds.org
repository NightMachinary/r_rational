Because I get enjoyment out of it, and can also spend time with others who get enjoyment out of it. I enjoy consuming media, and if I were to hold to harsh standards of rationality then the amount of media I could happily consume would be far less than the number of hours in a year that I would prefer to consume media.

I already feel like I've seen most of the good films extant, and many of the good TV shows. Further narrowing my criteria would ensure I definitely couldn't watch things as much as I like to given the rate that new things are produced that would satisfy said standards.
