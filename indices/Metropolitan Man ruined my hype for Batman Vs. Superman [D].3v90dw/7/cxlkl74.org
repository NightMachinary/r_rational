In every single movie where there's a chance of "Ruined Forever", i just adjust my expectations to "Lower than a snake's balls". If it's better than that, since i'm expecting so little i end up /much/ more satisfied than if i expected "Rational Fic: The Movie", because there is no such thing, even the best movies will fall well short of that (or am i missing some movie that doesn't? lemme know). Adjust your expectations and if you can, go into No Brain Mode, and just enjoy the visuals and explosions, and if the plot is even passable you'll have a blast.
