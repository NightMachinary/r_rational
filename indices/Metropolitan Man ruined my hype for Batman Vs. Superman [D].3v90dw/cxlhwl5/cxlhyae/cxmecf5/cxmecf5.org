See, I that's an etymology error, since [Roko's] was the identifier of the concept, not the concept itself.

The [Basilisk] part was what you are making reference to, so something like "the Hype Basilisk" might be more appropriate.

Assuming, of course, that we want to use Basilisk as the class name for the general concept of "The most rational path is to avoid knowledge of this".
