His point is that it's foolish to rely on force measures when the thing you are trying to out-force has no clear, defined limits, and is also housed in a packaging you, realistically, won't be able to duplicate without running the risk of creating something you couldn't control.

Superman carries the ability to exert forces exceeding the destructive potential of most nuclear weaponry, while also being as fast as sound (at minimum) and human sized AND flight capable. Trying to outforce something like that, outside of the realm of fictional convention is catastrophically idiotic and doomed to fail. The available data of what Superman could do should've led any sensible person to the conclusion that we should be very nice to our altruistic boy-in-blue overlord.

Edit: In addition, creating anything biological (specifically something with its own evolving thought directives aka the ability to make its own decisions) that could come close to matching Superman's force is idiotic. There's no way to guarantee the compliance of a being you design to out-adapt anything in its way. The biological structure of such a thing would mean that you should discard any non-magical mind control schemes. And if you don't trust the alien who saved the world and killed his own people to protect your race, and who has never shown any ill will towards humanity, why would you trust your little test tube, aggression driven doomsday baby?

And displaying the force countermeasures indicates your hostility to a being that could find you and kill you almost instantaneously. Hence making it a dumb idea, outright, unless you had absolute faith in Superman's unwillingness to harm you. And, again, it's stupid to rely on that, when he closely resembles a human, with human ways of thinking, enough that you could never say for sure that he would spare you after your attempts to murder him.
