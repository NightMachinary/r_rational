The existence of a strategic measure does not mean the reliance on that measure. Nor that no other strategic measures.

Theres little point to your language quibble: I dont need to know if 80000N crushes Superman or 80001N as long as I know that Superman will be crushed by any weight larger than 9000kg. Explicitly in the prior movie we see a Kryptonian die and the existence of a phantom zone gun. This also establishes the need for these weapons. Other Kryptonians might invade.

And I have no idea where this is coming from "replicating his force delivery potential in the form of a biological weapon you can't feasiblly control is stupid. " You're easily accepting of a man shooting lasers out his eye but suspicious of his opponent having control over his own created weapon?

It's possible that the Doomsday thing turns on Lex, if a little lazy writing, but who knows. We don't know the parameters of this world. We must await more information.
