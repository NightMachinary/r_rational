I haven't seen the trailers. I'm going off of what can be inferred from the Man of Steel movie, and also what was mentioned in the above comments, as far as the reference to the suped up batsuit and Doomsday. Those are force measures. So, assuming OP is correct on those two details, that's what my commenting is centered around.

Also don't take what i said out of context. I said he has

#+begin_quote
  no clear, defined limits
#+end_quote

Which he doesn't, as of the Man of Steel movie. And i never said his abilities can't be duplicated; i said replicating his force delivery potential in the form of a biological weapon you can't feasiblly control is *stupid.*

Edit: typed this up on my iPhone in my Google Chrome browser, which doesn't support Swiftkey, so I'm forced to use the default keyboard without any autocorrect or auto capitalization. So apologies for my many typos.
