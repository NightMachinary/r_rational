The argument appears weak:

1. Building force measures doesn't stop the building of thought measures. Strategies can be complimentary and reinforcing.

2. Tools can be used in different ways. Doomsday could be used as a distraction or to transfer a virus to Superman weakening him.

3. Defence is just as important as offence. It's not clear that simply disregarding that you are up against someone who could punch a hole through your torso is a "smart" decision.

You could be right. But, not neccessarily.
