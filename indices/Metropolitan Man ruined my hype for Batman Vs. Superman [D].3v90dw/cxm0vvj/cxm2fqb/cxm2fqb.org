It is heavily implied in the 3 min trailer. Biggest evidence, to me, is when Luthor says, "If man won't kill God, the devil will do it" overlaid with footage of General Zod's corpse being revealed and a bunch of standard electric, sciencey shit.

Edit: also, MM Luthor's force ending was force along the line of doing surgery with a scalpel vs. a mallet. In the end, it was Luthor's many contingencies that gave him the window with which to apply said force. As opposed to the open combat type setting chosen by batman and luthor in the new VS movie
