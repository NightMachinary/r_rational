I'm not much of a fan of BTT, but I'm not much of a fan of the actual movies in the first place. Sarah Connor Chronicles was my jam, and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5652260/1/Becoming-John-Connor][Becoming John Connor]] (long-form lead-up to Judgement Day) and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6685763/1/Detour][Detour]] (phenomenally written prologue and first chapter, abandoned) were my favorite fics. Both use the context of the series, so if you're not familiar, maybe watch it? :)
