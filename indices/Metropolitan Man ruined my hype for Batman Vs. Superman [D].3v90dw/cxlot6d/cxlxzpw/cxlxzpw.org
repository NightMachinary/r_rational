I want to rewrite Genisys at some point. It had a number of ideas that I really liked (Sarah Connor being raised by a terminator, Kyle going back in time to save a woman that ends up being more badass than him, Skynet trying to assimilate humanity into its design in order to cover its weaknesses). It just failed at a lot of the things it was trying to do.
