Oh, that's specifically /because/ it gets promoted to canon lol. Anyone can write any story they write and throw it on fanfiction.net, but if they want to have the prestige that comes with the author saying it's "real", then they have to abide by the "bible" of the series.

But this was only because there were so many people writing stories that if every one of them created OCs, you'd end up with a small mining town that had a population of millions. These restrictions weren't in place in the beginning when the Gazette was first published.
