If you haven't already seriously considered trying to get Branches into the hands of whoever looks at Terminator scripts, I would devote at least an hour a week for maybe a couple months figuring out how to make that happen. Have you ever written a screenplay before? They're surprisingly fun (in my experience), and stranger things have happened (the movie being made about the modern army being dropped into Roman times from that Reddit post comes to mind).
