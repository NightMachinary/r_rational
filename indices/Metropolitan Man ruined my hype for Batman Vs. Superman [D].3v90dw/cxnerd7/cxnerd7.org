  That is, the power balance will be changed and /the side that can punch harder will win./

This is one of the reasons that I've always hated kryptonite. If the weakest Superman stories are something like, "Look how hard Superman can punch! Can he punch hard enough to destroy that thing? Between Superman and the villain, who is the harder puncher?" then kryptonite is just "Look at this drama that happens when Superman can't punch so hard anymore!" Basically, a failure mode for Superman stories is that they're about Superman being strong, and the solution to that is to take away his strength, which you do with kryptonite. So kryptonite usually indicates a weak story, because it's about punching things instead of better questions (like a vigilante's place in a system of law and order, or how to be good, or the need to balance altruistic sacrifice against personal fulfillment).
