Agreed. Testing needs to happen. It's somewhat difficult to do that covertly, without endangering potential lives though. Unless you can nail down where Superman spends his "off" time. And even then, it's difficult. Like how would you set up such a scenario where Superman would be in close proximity to several tons of TnT without endangering anyone, or him seeing through (almost literally) the attempt?
