Really, the first thing that you should do is gather data and run tests in order to see whether Superman /does/ have limits. That's mostly what the first third of /Metropolitan Man/ is about, and it's a pretty classic Lex Luthor plot because it allows the writer to tie an opening scene of heroism into the larger conflict. (Superman saves the crew of a space shuttle, Lex Luthor is seen maniacally wringing his hands in the background.)

It's one thing to have anecdotal evidence that Superman can shrug off a shotgun blast to the chest, but that doesn't mean that he couldn't be killed by several tons of TNT exploding in his face. I can think of a number of superheroes who have much more reachable limits than Superman, especially if you take into account the possibility that there are a number of ways to pretend that you're strong enough to shrug off gunfire.
