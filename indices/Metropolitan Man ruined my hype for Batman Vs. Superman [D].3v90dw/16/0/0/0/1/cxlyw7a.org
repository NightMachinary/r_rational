  His point is that it's foolish to rely on force measures when the thing you are trying to out-force has no clear, defined limits, and is also housed in a packaging you, realistically, won't be able to duplicate without running the risk of creating something you couldn't control.

Can you expand on how we know they rely on their force measures?

Even your other points - that they know their opponent has no upper limit to his strength or durability; that his biological/technical abilities can't be duplicated - dont seem strong to me.

Where are you getting your assumptions from? Are these points in trailers?
