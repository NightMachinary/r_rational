Fine. We can accept that, as it's a fictional world fully dictated by the writers, it's more than possible Luthor will have perfect control over his creation. But, assuming this Doomsday is similar at ALL to the other iterations, it's designed to adapt to anything that injures/kills it. Hence why I find the idea of someone being able to control it fairly unlikely. That's also the result of seeing this sort of trope in movies too many times, where someone creates something that ends up being too strong/too out of control and it has to be stopped.

I accept Superman's existence because he /exists/. Were I part of the movie's world, before I heard of him, I would've rejected the very thought of a human shaped being able to do these kinds of things, as that isn't consistent with anything we've learnt about the laws of physics in the world, which the Superman movieverse resembles in most ways, minus a few extra aliens.
