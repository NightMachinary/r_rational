Oh yes, i was forced to realize this a long time ago since i'm an anime fan, there's so damn much being released all the time that even if i watched it full time with a magical Netflix-like service that had absolutely every single series/movie/OVA i couldn't possibly catch up, and the sort of peace that comes after accepting it was surprising at the time. Still there's once in a while a few things released that you just /have to/ watch, like in this case Dawn of Justice, even if it sucks you just have to because of what it is.
