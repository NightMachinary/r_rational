Oh, well, I read the book and felt the same about the portrayal of the world's reaction. Don't get me wrong, a man stuck and surviving on another planet will generate lots of media interest, especially initially. I just don't think it would've lasted, especially once the cost of retrieving Mark Watney started escalating into the tens of millions. I can't see any reasonable, large entity investing that much in one human being's life, sad as that may sound.
