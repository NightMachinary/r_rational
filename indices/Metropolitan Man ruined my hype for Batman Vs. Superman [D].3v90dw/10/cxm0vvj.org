Obviously, I haven't seen the movie yet, but it seems likely that this could be explained as point-in-time difference. In MM, Luthor's endgame was still force -- make a Kryptonite bullet, shoot Superman in the face after weakening him. In BvS, the endgame is kill him with armor. The difference is that MM focuses on the investigation, whereas BvS (presumably) starts after the investigation is over. Which is reasonable, since the very first thing that Batman always does when a new hero shows up is figure out how to put them down if it becomes necessary.

The story is based on an actual comic. In it, an old Batman uses various distractions to get Superman so distracted that Green Arrow can shoot him with a Kryptonite arrow. The missile, the tank, the armor -- they aren't meant to beat him, they're meant to get him in position and distracted enough not to hear Ollie getting set up and/or dodge the shot. I'm sure Batman took some satisfaction in kicking Superman around, but it was still fundamentally a distraction.

The trailer I saw had Doomsday showing up, but didn't say that Luthor built him. Is that confirmed elsewhere?
