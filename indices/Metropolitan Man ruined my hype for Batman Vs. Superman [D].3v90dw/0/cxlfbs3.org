The truly shameful thing is that they had two sensible paths they could have chosen. Either take the Metropolitan Man route, and write something that /isn't/ dumb, or knowingly, openly write something dumb, something where your brain can tune out while some neat nonsense action scenes play. And instead they chose to do the latter dressed up as the former, and, as is often the case, the refusal to specialize causes efficiency to hit rock bottom.
