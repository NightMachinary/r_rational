Movie Ozy plan is actually kinda better than the original comic book plan IMO. Less convoluted, comick-y, 70-year-ish tentacle monster invasion-y... That the presented enemy is (fundamentally) human reinforces the other message of the movie about the trouble humans have with coordination among themselfes.

Though as to your argument of "not well set up" - well its been a bit but the tentacle monsters arent set up at all either IIRC, and there is some foreshadowing in the movie.
