I never had hope for this movie. I was going to go watch it anyways, expecting a depressing slide into mind-numbing boredom as I watched poorly written action and character development.

I never thought to compare it to Metropolitian Man. Now I'll have such a comparison in my head. Forever. So thank you. For freeing me.
