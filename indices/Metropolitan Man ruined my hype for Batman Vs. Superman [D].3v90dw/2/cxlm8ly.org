  Metropolitan Man ruined my hype for Batman Vs. Superman
#+end_quote

I think the formula can be expanded to

[the best from what much larger online communities have to offer] ruins [work of a much smaller group of professional writers]

- Tvtropes makes it hard to ignore how repetitive and poorly written general flicks are;
- SCP makes most of horror films look boring;
- the best of fanfics make the canon scripts look underwhelming.

The effect worsens when the producers are being lazy or afraid to create something new. Both Batman's and Superman's frenchises are 80 years old by now, they should be sent to a [[http://imgur.com/lc0EJUm][retirement home for fictional characters,]] not get new blockbusters every several years.
