There's a saying that translates into English like “to make candy out of crap”, meaning to make something good from bad-quality source material.

Nolan has been working miracles with the initially bad source material that's the Batman franchise. But I think the series that he's essentially been working with for half of his career would've been [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_%28film%29][much greater]] if the filming industry had better working patterns for discovering successful, yet original long-lasting ideas instead of repeatedly falling back to older ones (e.g. Spider-Man and X-Men are only 20 years younger).
