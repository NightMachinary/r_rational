Book by Greg Egan. It's got some flaws in how there's not really a solid overarching story, just a bunch of little slice of life episodes about a character, but that's fairly common in his work, he can jump from idea to idea a lot.

The specific scene they're talking about is freely readable here [[http://www.gregegan.net/DIASPORA/01/Orphanogenesis.html]]
