Part 2

#+begin_quote
  Link heard a low rumbling noise coming from nowhere in particular. He turned around to see guardrails rise up around the pit. Also, a stone door now blocked the entrance to the room from whence he came.
#+end_quote

It's a boss room!!!

#+begin_quote
  “/Aaaah!/” Link remarked, grabbing the left switch again. It wouldn't budge. He definitely didn't panic as he tried the right one a second time.
#+end_quote

Yes, Link is far too smooth to panic, unlike us.

#+begin_quote
  As he traced around the north edge of the pit, two vaguely humanoid figures came into view---a pair of skeletons still half-buried in a mound of sand.
#+end_quote

Eeek! Mini-Boss!

#+begin_quote
  Exploring the rest of the pit,
#+end_quote

LINK DON'T TURN YOUR BACK ON THE MINI-BOSS!!!

#+begin_quote
  he found several small indentations along the floor, each less than two feet deep. There were six in total; each of them uniquely shaped---each the bottom half of one of the perfect solids: sphere, tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, icosahedron.

  Was it a puzzle? If so, Link had no idea what he was supposed to do to solve it.
#+end_quote

...Link even my 2-year old can solve this puzzle. You just take the blocks and put them into the indent with the right shape.

#+begin_quote
  Better safe than sorry. Heart thumping in his chest, Link rushed the skeletons, stomping their skulls into pieces and breaking a few of the other bones for good measure.
#+end_quote

No boss?

#+begin_quote
  Link hefted it in his hand. It was almost identical to the blue one from earlier.Blue gemstone: blue-runed door. Red gemstone...? Was it really that easy?
#+end_quote

This dungeon is so easy even my two-year old could do it.

#+begin_quote
  “So let me get this straight,” Grenja said. “For who knows how long---possibly /thousands/ of years---the Lightsworn can't manage to kill a giant worm monster. Then one day, big G-man just waltzes on in here and gives it what-for.
#+end_quote

My nickname is canon!!!

#+begin_quote
  “Seriously?” Koja let out a long sigh from a few paces behind. “Grenja, you are never allowed to question my naming of things /ever again/.”
#+end_quote

I hate you.

#+begin_quote
  At the center of the room was a pedestal with a small ornate box, trimmed in blue. A skeleton in tattered rags lay near its base.
#+end_quote

Eh, just another skeleton to desecrate, no big deal.

#+begin_quote
  ...Was that it? Seriously? Was /that/ supposed to be a challenge?
#+end_quote

Remember, Link. This is a dungeon for two-year old---

#+begin_quote
  The once dormant bones began to shake and rattle. Black smoke clung tightly to them, inhabiting and animating the previously lifeless body.
#+end_quote

AAAAH!!! STALFOS!!!

#+begin_quote
  /Another/ wind tunnel? Link wasn't about to get sucked in this time.
#+end_quote

If it hadn't been for me, and another guy, Link would have been sucked in again.

#+begin_quote
  Huffing, Link stood over the remains of his re-dead enemies. Blood oozed from a nasty cut on his forearm, and he was pretty sure he had exhausted his magic reserves.
#+end_quote

On a more serious note, we screwed up this fight. Stalfos are apparently capable of independent thought and coordinate with each other... Hey, um, didn't Zelda have a dream about a horde of Stalfos?

#+begin_quote
  “...I should go,” Link said, turning to leave.
#+end_quote

I got that reference.

#+begin_quote
  Link chased the rabbit through a branching hallway into a long, narrow room, then into a shorter hallway and then into another smaller room with many entrances and exits and then up a ramp and into another long room and then back again to the /other/ room and then back to the branching hallway and then...
#+end_quote

Let's turn on some appropriate [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK6TXMsvgQg][music]]

#+begin_quote
  He'd have to map the place out and think of something clever...
#+end_quote

*Gets out popcorn*

#+begin_quote
  The rabbit chittered and squeaked loudly in the next room over as if to mock him.
#+end_quote

Snnrk

#+begin_quote
  Link fished out a bag of shiny pebbles from his pack, then took a step forward. The rabbit's ear twitched and it crouched like it was about to hop away. Link stopped.“Was that a yes?”“Squeak squeak.”Link waited for a good minute before extending the bag and------The rabbit turned and hopped off.
#+end_quote

Lol

#+begin_quote
  Link took aim, carefully lining up the shot---/Clink!/ It harmlessly glanced off the rabbit's side.

  /SQUEAK!/
#+end_quote

/pfft/

#+begin_quote
  “Just wait, you little shit,” he muttered, pausing for a short breather. “I have just the plan for--- wait, where are you going? No... nonono---”/Click! Fuzz./Link fell forward onto his hands and knees as the block dematerialized. He punched the ground over and over as inarticulate cries of anguish escaped him.
#+end_quote

Aren't puzzles fun?

#+begin_quote
  Link cackled like a madman as he held the blue gemstone high in the air above his head.
#+end_quote

Let's get Link another therapist.

#+begin_quote
  /Seriously?!/ How many more trials did he have to go through? Wasn't the rabbit enough??
#+end_quote

Eh, the rabbit was probably the boss so it's just another Stalfos or two.

#+begin_quote
  the room was filled with large bones. Gargantuan, oversized bones that looked like they belonged to a creature from a storybook.
#+end_quote

Ok, a lot of Stalfos.

#+begin_quote
  At the center of the room, sitting inside a pentagonal-shaped recess was... a shiny, semi-circular object?
#+end_quote

LOOOT!!!

#+begin_quote
  In front of him stood a towering skeletal abomination. A... skeletal Hinox? A /Stalnox/!?
#+end_quote

We were panicking so much here someone, who most definitely wasn't me, did a prompt to have Link let the Stalnox hit him.

#+begin_quote
  Link half-stumbled into base camp from the west, trailing puddles of water. Koja sat by herself on the stairs, tending to her nails. Ryn was lying sprawled out on a bedroll, staring up at the ceiling. Grenja was doing pushups near the entrance.
#+end_quote

I think the Sheikah might need therapists too.

#+begin_quote
  “What the fick, man?” Grenja darted over. “Stal-/children/?” He paced around, lifting Link's arm. “Did they bite you? Are you infected?!”
#+end_quote

Grenja, evidence.

#+begin_quote
  “/I do not want to talk about the rabbit/,” Link said, trying and failing to keep the tension out of his voice.
#+end_quote

Lightsworn rule #1. Do not talk about the rabbit.

#+begin_quote
  “Wait---hold up,” Koja called out from behind. “Remind me, why'd you need the block again?”Link stopped and pivoted. “To solve the puzzle?” he answered.
#+end_quote

Yes, the toddler puzzle.

#+begin_quote
  “The chest behind the iron bars with an ominous sandstorm pit nearby, containing a puzzle that is almost certainly a trap?” Koja clarified.
#+end_quote

Well yes, but there's---

#+begin_quote
  “And have you thought to avoid the trap by just /breaking through the bars/?”“Yeah, of course,” Link said. “That was the first...” He trailed off as his thoughts caught up to him. He glanced down to the transfabrulator on his belt.

  No other way too...
#+end_quote

Oh.
