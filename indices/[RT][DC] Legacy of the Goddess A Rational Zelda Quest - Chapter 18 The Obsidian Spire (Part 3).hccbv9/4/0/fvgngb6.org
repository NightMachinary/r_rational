Some good stuff here!

First I just want to say I really appreciate having a player such as you so dedicated and engaged with the quest. Please don't take any of this as more than "constructive criticism" -- just trying to prod ya'll towards more productive paths and/or provide more usable and actionable information in plans.

A few points:

#+begin_quote
  Have Fi conduct scans to see if Link's essence has changed.
#+end_quote

What /precisely/ are you trying to accomplish or find out here? I'm not saying it won't be fruitful to try this, but you're likely to get more out of it if you specify to Fi what you're looking for and why.

In absence of additional information or extenuating circumstances (the silvery egg right after marking Link was one such circumstance), telling Fi to "do scans" is going to result in her pumping VP into a thing and seeing what happens. She can also spend time observing and try to detect when things are giving off significant (i.e. - more than trace) quantities of magic, but there isn't anything /unique/ about her ability in that regard, and the result is going to be "it's magic" or "I don't think it's magic."

I realize some of that might be new info (or at least not explicitly stated before), but in general Fi isn't a magic-oracle or a magitechnobabble omnitool. Due to the nature of Marks, she will be able to tell you conclusively that /something/ changed with Link's essence after he drank the water, but that doesn't mean she knows what result of the change will be or how it will manifest.

#+begin_quote
  Explain marks to the council.
#+end_quote

You'll have to do more legwork here and specify what exactly it is you know about marks and what all you want to convey. Also, is there anyone in particular you want to share this with, or literally "the entire council?" There are the main figures that Zelda herself usually interacts with (Lensa, Nyllara, Adresin, Taetus, Wymar), but keep in mind there are a few dozen nobles and other elected officials that comprise the full body.

#+begin_quote
  Discuss marking council members, as well as allies from other species, e.g. goron, zora, etc. to help secure an alliance and gain intelligence and long-distance messaging capabilities.
#+end_quote

"Discuss" to what ends? What are you trying to accomplish? "Help secure an alliance and gain intelligence and long-distance messaging capabilities" is incredibly nebulous. What should the end state of this discussion be? Or is this just a general "see if the NPCs have ideas?"

(Not that I want to discourage you from asking NPCs for ideas -- that's completely fine and could lead to interesting things. Just note that if we're doing most of the legwork and have to spend a significant amount of time modeling and simming background NPCs it's probably going to result in less VP rewards. That /could/ but is not guaranteed to be offset by "interestingness of worldbuilding.")

#+begin_quote
  Make a public speech
#+end_quote

Going to need more than that.

The subject matter listed is good, but if you want there to be a /public speech/ written on screen, you'll at least have to outline it. So she's gathering allies, taking war to the enemy, and expressing confidence in her chosen reagent. That's all good, but /how do you intend to have that resonate with the people she's addressing?/ That is the bulk of the work here, and it's wholly omitted in this bullet point.

Note: There was a similar bullet point in the chapter 5 plan that was similarly frustrating. Again, it's fine to leave the details of the speech up to Zelda (/let qms fill it out), but as written I can't do much with it without substantial work.

#+begin_quote
  If possible, spin up propaganda to emphasize the heroic role that Zelda and Link are taking, likening them to heroic figures of the past that proved to be the salvation of Hyrule.
#+end_quote

Good idea, but again, suggestions or specific ideas to try would be helpful.

#+begin_quote
  Note: Need to find out if VP was spent on Empower research during the dungeon crawl; if so, will amend this or remove based on results.
#+end_quote

There was not time for this during the dungeon crawl.

#+begin_quote
  Spend 50 VP on general scans on Zelda and the fragments when they are not obviously in use to develop baseline data for them.
#+end_quote

I don't know if this was written onscreen or as a bullet point anywhere, but one of the first things Zelda had Fi try was dumping VP into the triforce fragments. It doesn't work. They also can't be imbued.

Note: As part of the next update that includes research, I intend to have a Zelda journal entry cataloging all the things that were previously Fi-posts and/or IC forum/reddit posts to consolidate.

#+begin_quote
  general scans running scans scanning
#+end_quote

--------------

General feedback:

While overall well-written and comprehensive, this plan is unacceptably long. I would greatly appreciate if you could pick out 3-4 elements of it you want most to focus on.

Keep in mind timelines (previous updates have all been at most a few days), how long you expect the items to take to explore in-universe, how much of chapter you expect it to take to address, and how much detail you want us to go into. Those are the most relevant criteria as to what gets written and what doesn't. Generally I like to aim for >5k words per chapter and <10k words. The content of this plan is like 5 or more chapters' worth of material.

General bullet points to get balls rolling like "continue to X location" or "send a message" or "arrange a meeting for X" are fine to include.
