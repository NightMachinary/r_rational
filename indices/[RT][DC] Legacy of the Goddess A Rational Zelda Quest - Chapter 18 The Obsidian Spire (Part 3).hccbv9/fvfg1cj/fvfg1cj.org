EDIT: This plan is cancelled as a result of QM feedback; a reduced-scope replacement plan will be created shortly.

[Plan: Magitech Mysteries]

[Next Steps: Link]

- Head off to hunt ghosts.
- Have Fi conduct scans to see if Link's essence has changed.
- Attempt to see if you have new abilities, especially in regards to wind magic.
- Test if you can make yourself float or fly.
- Test to see if you have stronger wind blast capabilities.
- Test if you can imbue your sword with wind.
- Practice Invigorate + Sword Move combo that you were previously advised to practice.

/Transfabrulator Research/:

- Spend up to 100 VP researching the transfabrulator.
- Perform active scans while Link practices with the item.
- Attempt to study how individual functions work, such as conjuring and projecting objects.
- Attempt to discern how it recharges after use, and if that self-recharging function could be emulated.
- Attempt to scan to learn what type of power (VP, mana, etc.) powers the item.
- Attempt to discern if it may be possible to recharge the transfabrulator manually with magic or VP, but do not attempt to do it yet.

/Courage Fragment Research/:

- Spend up to 50 VP on performing scans on Link's courage fragment. Attempt to discern if it is currently recharging, and if so, if how long it may take to recharge after each use.
- Attempt to discern the type of magic used in the fragment (e.g. green, void, a mix, etc.)
- Attempt to discern if it may be possible to recharge the fragment manually with magic or VP, but do not attempt to do it.

/Book Research/:

- Have Link briefly skim over the books with Fi to determine their general subject matter. If any of them have information that may be immediately relevant (e.g. material on fragments, Demise, Lightsworn, any form of magic that or magic item that is presently unable to be replicated, etc.), have Link go through high priority sections with Fi translating.
- If there's lots of relevant information, consider sending a sheikah or two to deliver the books to the Last Bastion to drop them off with a trusted sheikah agent for immediate delivery to Zelda. (If this occurs, then have the sheikah return to meet up with Link + remaining sheikah afterward.)

[Next Steps: Zelda]

- Zelda heads back to to check in on the kingdom and resume her rulership for the time being.
- Get updated on the current situation. Assess regent candidates. Assess possible candidates for holding power fragments.
- Explain marks to the council.
- Discuss marking council members, as well as allies from other species, e.g. goron, zora, etc. to help secure an alliance and gain intelligence and long-distance messaging capabilities.
- Make a public speech to raise morale before leaving her kingdom again, both to raise support for the regent and to clarify that she is not abandoning the kingdom - she is gathering allies (like the gerudo and zora) and taking the war to the enemy.
- If possible, spin up propaganda to emphasize the heroic role that Zelda and Link are taking, likening them to heroic figures of the past that proved to be the salvation of Hyrule.

*Taken from [[/u/Mathematicae]]:*

- Meet with Vestele personally, because of the sensitive nature, to have the seekers review what sort of sacrifices and boons the Fae usually demanded/gave. Ganondorf is probably using it for more power, so we want info on how he could use it to benefit himself. Additionally, Fi might be able to replicate what the Fae did with VP.
- Get some language training in Gerudo speech, mostly so Fi can listen in and be capable of translating the language. If we can have Zelda and Fi relay translations for the dungeon crew if need be that would be nice too.
- When possible, she begins working on research projects. See research projects section below.

*Research Ideas:*

While traveling, Zelda will attempt any of the following projects that she personally feels, based on her magical expertise, have any reasonable likelihood of success. She will employ reasonable safety precautions, such as putting Luck spells up before testing anything potentially dangerous, Foretelling right beforehand if applicable, and having a healer nearby (but outside of any predicted potential blast radius). If applicable, she may have someone else physically do any dangerous components of the testing and stand nearby to do the healing herself.

/Rod/Imbue Research/:

- Attempt to draw on Blue Burst and Blue Imbue at the same time with the intent of creating an ice rod.
- If this does not work, attempt to mix a Blue Burst with a Green Imbue and see what happens.
- Attempt to imbue an item with all three colors of magic at once in a sufficient quantity that it would normally cause the item to glow and reach the state of conceptual improvement. See what happens.
- If none of the previous methods have caused the creation of a new form of item, but also have not caused anything dangerous to occur, attempt a triple color imbue + Blue Burst on the same item if it is physically possible to do so.
- If we manage to get a triple imbued item, but it doesn't seem to do anything different than a normal imbued item, attempt to power it with up to 50 VP to see if that does anything.
- If we manage to get an item to hold both an imbue and a burst, but that doesn't make it into an elemental rod, attempt to power it with up to 50 VP.
- If none of the mixed imbues work, attempt to power a normal imbued item with up to 50 VP and see if that does anything.
- If any of the tests seem like they are noticeably working toward successfully making something like an ice rod, spend up to 500 VP to make a functional ice rod.

/Empower Research/:

- Note: Need to find out if VP was spent on Empower research during the dungeon crawl; if so, will amend this or remove based on results.
- Spend up to 50 VP attempting to research the Empowerment function that was used on Zelda with the intent of learning how to create a scaling version of the effect with variable power output.
- Utilize any data that Fi has available from pre-empowerment Zelda, during empowerment Zelda, post-empowerment Zelda, and other baseline scans of Hyleans in this research process.
- Also utilize information from other forms of temporary magic transfer, e.g. siphon, and similar abilities such as Marking, Imbue Object, and Invigorate.
- *Intended magic goal:* /Scaleable Empowerment/ - This empowers the target, temporarily granting them a tremendous increase in ability by suffusing them with old magic. The level of improvement scales with VP expended, with a minimum expenditure of 100 VP and no upper limit. This lasts a variable duration based on the VP expended in this process.

/Triforce Research/:

- Spend 50 VP on general scans on Zelda and the fragments when they are not obviously in use to develop baseline data for them.
- Spend up to 50 VP running scans on Zelda and her fragments while Zelda is sleeping, attempting to discern any changes in Zelda's mental and spiritual state that may be linked to the wisdom fragments activating and giving her prophetic dreams.
- Spend another 10 VP scanning Zelda when she casts Fortelling to see if there are any similarities.

*Fi Memory Projects:*

Defer this to a future update or ignore entirely if the QMs do not feel it is appropriate to include in this update.

- Ask Fi if Marking someone who speaks another language would give Fi an easier time comprehending that language.
- If Fi consents and believes there is any possibility of success, attempt to use Healing magic to restore Fi's lost memories. If this does not work or seem viable to Fi/Zelda, discuss if it may be possible to restore Fi's lost memories through other means, such as direct applications of VP.
