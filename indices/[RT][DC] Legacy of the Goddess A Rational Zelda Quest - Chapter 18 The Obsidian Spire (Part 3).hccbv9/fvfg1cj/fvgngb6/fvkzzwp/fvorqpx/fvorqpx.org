  We haven't broken the conlang, so we don't really know what Fi has already told us about essence. This is largely player-side.

  The description of Research Magic /does/ make it come across like Fi is a magitechnobabble tool.

  In specific, this line:

  "Fi attempts to engineer a modulated attunement matrix to convert raw Void Power into Magic Power and channel it towards a useful purpose"

  If Fi is not supposed to be a magitechnobabble tool, I would like to request a description for Research Magic that provides us with a bit more context of what Fi is and is not capable of doing with her scans. Currently, I think the open-ended nature of the description of Research Magic is a large part of why we, as players, have routinely had difficulty writing up magic research requests in ways that make sense to the QMs and/or provide the players with desirable results.

A few points:

(1) The character of the player interface has changed considerably since we started. As with Legacy, Fi threatened to overwhelm the story, and her involvement often sidelined the actual characters. This was a mistake, and I have since issued a retcon to correct it. As a result, everything written in the original SV thread (including Fi's infoposts) is no longer canon. The only canon material is what has been written in the "Story" section on the website. That said, some of the stuff that was previously included as footnotes/Fi-posts will be written in as Zelda journal entries very soon, likely the next chapter.

--------------

(2) Fi's posts with language-gibberish are /intended/ to be opaque. The intent of the language-gibberish was firstly to add flair and interestingness to the setting, and secondly (mostly with Fi) to hide seams of the interface. Sometimes we use Fi as a convenient way to provide additional context or IC information in-universe. That doesn't mean you get to query her for arbitrary information or worldbuilding details, and pushing in that direction will result in running into non-answers and gibberish responses.

More explicitly: You aren't going to break the conlang and learn anything new. You're of course welcome to try (not like I could stop you), but I am very confident you will not succeed. This is by design. With the system I wanted something that would output the same language-gibberish given the same input, and would even have some features of languages, but that would be completely infeasible to reverse-engineer. In this way it is more akin to a fancy hash than an actual translation to a conlang.

--------------

(3) With Fi, we did not create or find an actual sentient magitech construct to base her on, nor do we know in detail how one would function. Aside from being woefully incomplete, any attempt to systematize Fi would be riddled with holes that would be exploited to death and cause the world to explode in a flash of munchkinry overnight. As a result, her interface with the world is ill-defined.

That isn't to say "anything goes"; far from it. Other elements (i.e. magic) are very well defined. Fi interacts with those elements, and while /her interaction with them/ will be abstractified and glossed over, this does not mean she is capable of doing anything unique, that wouldn't be in-principle possible for some other entity in-universe to do.

That actually works as a general rule: unless it's in-principle possible for other entities in-universe to do a thing, Fi can't do it either. Further, everything she /is/ capable of will be constrained to (a) making sense given the conceit that she exists in the first place, and (b) will, to the best of our ability, not generate plotholes or inconsistencies.

Put another way: if we write her being able to detect hormonal changes and stress-response activation, then yes you can use her as a crude lie-detector. But that doesn't work in reverse; you can't use her ill-defined nature to foist new capabilities on her.

No "scanning."

(4) As for "[difficulties] writing up magic research requests in ways that make sense to the QMs and/or provide the players with desirable results":

There is no "tooltip" for research. The post you reference was only ever meant as a fun way to provide information to players. It was flawed in a number of ways, and yes also misleading. Mea culpa. It has since been retconed.

I've said this before, but you will get further with research if you cease treating it like an ability to be invoked and more like a scientific undertaking that requires work, intelligence, and active engagement to make progress on. Make "doing research" a focus of your plans (i.e. - a dedicated undertaking by your characters), rather than a footnote to be maybe considered while engaging in more demanding tasks (like trekking through the desert), and you will see results.

Put another way, "research is not a free action."

Hope this helps and/or clears things up.

Unfortunately, I'm not looking to enter a protracted discussion on any of these points -- there just isn't enough time in the day. As such, feel free to discuss but I won't be responding any further in this thread.
