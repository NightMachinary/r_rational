  If possible, spin up propaganda to emphasize the heroic role that Zelda and Link are taking, likening them to heroic figures of the past that proved to be the salvation of Hyrule.

One suggestion I have there is that Zelda discovered how to initiate people into the Lightsworn order and did so for Link. It's at least close enough to the truth for government propaganda.

Lightsworn seem to be greatly revered, so it might be very beneficial for morale to publicly announce that Zelda discovered how to initiate new members and the Queen's champion was initiated into the order.
