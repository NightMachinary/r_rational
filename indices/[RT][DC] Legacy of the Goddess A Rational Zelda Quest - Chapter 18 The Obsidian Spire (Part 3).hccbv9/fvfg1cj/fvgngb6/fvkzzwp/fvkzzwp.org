  First I just want to say I really appreciate having a player such as you so dedicated and engaged with the quest. Please don't take any of this as more than "constructive criticism" -- just trying to prod ya'll towards more productive paths and/or provide more usable and actionable information in plans.
#+end_quote

Oh, sure! You're welcome, and I actually appreciate the criticism - it helps me get a better idea of what you're looking for in a plan, which is extremely helpful. Thank you.

#+begin_quote
  What precisely are you trying to accomplish or find out here? I'm not saying it won't be fruitful to try this, but you're likely to get more out of it if you specify to Fi what you're looking for and why.
#+end_quote

Sure! I wasn't very specific because we don't really understand much about Fi's scans, both because we haven't broken her conlang and because they're deliberately abstracted.

My intent was something like:

- General goal: Determine if there are measurable components of Link's essence changes that correspond directly to affinities, Lightsworn status, and specific Lightsworn powers.
- The end-goal for the above information is to figure out if these metrics can be used to measure these characteristics in individual people, and later influence those metrics in some way.
- For example, let's say that Link has five essence attributes that are being measured: A, B, C, D, and E. When Fi conducts her scans from before and after Link getting his lightsworn status, we observe (hypothetically) that A through D increase from 5 to 10. We also observe that after drinking the water from this particular dungeon, D increases again, from 10 to 20. We can speculate that "D" may have a relationship (but not necessarily a causal relationship) with any new abilities Link acquired in the dungeon.
- My expectation is that the reality of things like affinities may be more complex than a single measurable stat, but this is generally the type of thing I'm looking for. If it's multi-variable or non-numeric, that's all still good to know as players.

That said, your following lines appear to imply that this is not a valid test method.

#+begin_quote
  I realize some of that might be new info (or at least not explicitly stated before), but in general Fi isn't a magic-oracle or a magitechnobabble omnitool. Due to the nature of Marks, she will be able to tell you conclusively that something changed with Link's essence after he drank the water, but that doesn't mean she knows what result of the change will be or how it will manifest.
#+end_quote

The reason for my confusion here comes down to two main factors:

- We haven't broken the conlang, so we don't really know what Fi has already told us about essence. This is largely player-side.
- The description of Research Magic /does/ make it come across like Fi is a magitechnobabble tool.

In specific, this line:

#+begin_quote
  Fi attempts to engineer a modulated attunement matrix to convert raw Void Power into Magic Power and channel it towards a useful purpose.
#+end_quote

If Fi is not supposed to be a magitechnobabble tool, I would like to request a description for Research Magic that provides us with a bit more context of what Fi is and is not capable of doing with her scans. Currently, I think the open-ended nature of the description of Research Magic is a large part of why we, as players, have routinely had difficulty writing up magic research requests in ways that make sense to the QMs and/or provide the players with desirable results.

#+begin_quote
  You'll have to do more legwork here and specify what exactly it is you know about marks and what all you want to convey. Also, is there anyone in particular you want to share this with, or literally "the entire council?" There are the main figures that Zelda herself usually interacts with (Lensa, Nyllara, Adresin, Taetus, Wymar), but keep in mind there are a few dozen nobles and other elected officials that comprise the full body.
#+end_quote

Good clarification, thank you. Will revise.

#+begin_quote
  "Discuss" to what ends? What are you trying to accomplish? "Help secure an alliance and gain intelligence and long-distance messaging capabilities" is incredibly nebulous. What should the end state of this discussion be? Or is this just a general "see if the NPCs have ideas?"
#+end_quote

Understood, will clarify or cut.

#+begin_quote
  Going to need more than that.
#+end_quote

Sounds good, will clarify or cut.

#+begin_quote
  There was not time for this during the dungeon crawl.
#+end_quote

Okay, great, thank you.

#+begin_quote
  I don't know if this was written onscreen or as a bullet point anywhere, but one of the first things Zelda had Fi try was dumping VP into the triforce fragments. It doesn't work. They also can't be imbued.

  Note: As part of the next update that includes research, I intend to have a Zelda journal entry cataloging all the things that were previously Fi-posts and/or IC forum/reddit posts to consolidate.
#+end_quote

These are both super good notes, thank you. Appreciate this very much.

#+end_quote

Would something like, "Have Fi scan to attempt to get metrics for improvements on affinities and specific Lightsworn powers" be possible and useful?

#+begin_quote
  While overall well-written and comprehensive, this plan is unacceptably long. I would greatly appreciate if you could pick out 3-4 elements of it you want most to focus on.
#+end_quote

Understood. Will do.

Thank you for the detailed feedback!
