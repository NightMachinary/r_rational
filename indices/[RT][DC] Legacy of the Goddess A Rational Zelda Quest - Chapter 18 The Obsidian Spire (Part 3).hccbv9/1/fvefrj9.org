And so ends the Spire saga!

You can assume Link & Fi updated Zelda regarding everything. Zelda is currently en route back to Hyrule.

*What do you do next?*

- Head towards the location Link saw in the vision ASAP! Go fight some ghosts!!

- So /about/ that Ja'bu situation...

- [X] Do /all/ the research

- Go directly back to Castletown and make sure it hasn't collapsed in a pile of flaming rubble since Zelda's been gone

- Have Zelda visit with the troops near the front to improve morale

- Followup on Triforce pieces? Gorons? Vesyrn? Golvara? Lost Woods?

- Other (write-in)

Your previous VP total was 2679.

Following the Obsidian Spire dungeon crawl, Fi is left with 963 VP and 972 stored magic.

(Most of this was updated in realtime but not itemized, and included converting VP to magic, stamina restores, several ethereal and intangible avatars, and telepathic communications.)

Chapters 16-18 spanned 2 days. During that time, you earned 54 VP from Zelda and 164 VP from Link.

You have earned 125 additional VP per day in place of the usual incentive bonus. Total = 250.

Link's spiritual awakening generated 8988 VP.

*You currently have 10419 VP.*
