Reaction post for all three updates incoming. I was a participant in the live session, so I get partial blame for stupid stuff Link does. I also get partial credit for smart stuff Link does, which I will be more than happy to point out!

#+begin_quote
  The Shifting Sands proved to be less of a challenge than Link anticipated.
#+end_quote

Way to tempt fate Link. If you die it's not our fault. (It totally will be our fault)

#+begin_quote
  “/Mother Above/,” Koja muttered off to Link's side. “You weren't kidding. That thing is /huge/.”
#+end_quote

Strangely enough, no one made a dirty joke here.

#+begin_quote
  “An ancient structure built---probably by the Goddesses themselves---to seal away an otherworldly evil from beyond the Void,” Grenja said with confidence. “Obviously.”
#+end_quote

I don't think we have enough evidence to support that claim, Grenja.

#+begin_quote
  Murals on the walls depicting the Holy Mother and her Lightsworn armies had been defaced.
#+end_quote

Zelda would be horrified at the defacing of ancient artifacts

#+begin_quote
  “Zelda says Shesan has no pertinent information regarding the runes,”
#+end_quote

How shocking /s

#+begin_quote
  “Yes, Master,” Ryn said, imitating Fi with a clumsy pirouette. Link let out a snort of laughter despite himself, and the others had a good chuckle too. Fi twirled in mid-air, as if to show her how it was properly done.

  “That kind of relationship, huh?” Koja said.
#+end_quote

Let the dirty jokes begin!

#+begin_quote
  “Fi, notice anything unusual?” he asked.

  “Yes, Master. Towards the center of the room lies the remains of an improbably large annelidoid creature. Also, the ceiling is unusually luminous.”
#+end_quote

You need to work on your phrasing, Link

#+begin_quote
  “I understand your confusion,” Fi said. “Allow me to clarify..."
#+end_quote

That was not a good clarification Fi. Here, let me show you how it's done. ‘This is not a good research project.'

#+begin_quote
  “Maybe we should take some physical samples too?” Ryn suggested. “Might help. For research, I mean.”
#+end_quote

Poor phrasing is something you two have in common.

#+begin_quote
  Link sighed. So much for that. “So, uh. What about the ceiling?” he asked.
#+end_quote

Link, phrasing.

#+begin_quote
  “To clarify: the light is significantly dimmer than that of the sky. It is however the same color as the sky. Precisely so, in a way that is difficult to describe in your language using terms you understand.”
#+end_quote

So this means the light is the actual sunlight. And the ceiling is enchanted to somehow let the sunlight through, but dimmer. Wait! Did we find the great hall for Lightsworn! Hogwarts?

#+begin_quote
  “How can you even touch that thing? Holy Mother Above---it's /ficking hot!/”

  “Err... no it isn't?” Link examined the gem again, rubbing his hand over the surface. It was uniformly cool to the touch, and hadn't changed in any way---even where Grenja touched it.
#+end_quote

I don't recall this happening during the live session. We should have Fi run some tests on it, although my guess is that it's because of Link's---

#+begin_quote
  “Must be his magical Lightsworn powers,” Koja said confidently.
#+end_quote

Yeah, that.

#+begin_quote
  “I guess that would explain why no one else has taken it yet,” Ryn said.

  “Hey, /you/ managed, didn't you?” Koja said, giving her a nudge. “What do you think, Ryn? Wanna give it another go?”
#+end_quote

/sigh/

#+begin_quote
  “Koja---” Ryn rolled her eyes, placing a hand on her hip. “That's not even a good joke. Look, if you're going to tease me about ficking his brains out, at least---”

  “---/Girls!/” Grenja chided. “Come on! We're better than this!”
#+end_quote

Grenja, evidence.

#+begin_quote
  Link cleared his throat. “Maybe we should try the blue-runed wall?”

  “Oh yeah,” Koja said cattily. “I bet you're just /dying/ to slide your gem into that socket.”
#+end_quote

Oh, Hylia when will it stop?

#+begin_quote
  The gem leapt from his hand and snapped into place with an audible /click/. The blue runes flashed and disappeared as the gem pulsed and spun in a half-turn clockwise. An echoing rumble, and the wall raised upward into the ceiling.
#+end_quote

ARRRGH! Priceless ancient artifact lost! I mean it was apparently just a door key, but it was a really cool door key. Or a really /hot/ doorkey for non-Lightsworn.

#+begin_quote
  “Seriously, what even is this place?” Ryn asked rhetorically.
#+end_quote

Grenja, evi---

#+begin_quote
  A resounding /vwoom!/ echoed from behind. Link spun. A shimmering golden barrier stood between him and the others.
#+end_quote

And this where we first started panicking.

#+begin_quote
  “Master,” Fi said from the other side, “I regret to inform you that due to potent magical interference, my assistance will be limited in this area. I will still be capable of observation and direct telepathic communication, but I will be unable to manifest an avatar or channel my other abilities while you are within. I recommend proceeding with a greater degree of caution.”
#+end_quote

Fi? Could you do an ELI5 again?

#+begin_quote
  “Oh... um... hmm...” Grenja articulated, poking at the barrier. “Hey, uh, Link? It won't let me through.”
#+end_quote

Never mind Fi, Grenja's got it.

#+begin_quote
  “Hey, don't sweat it,” Grenja said with a big grin. “You're the singular most badass guy in the kingdom, Link. You got this!”
#+end_quote

...You and Link are both getting remedial training in not tempting fate. Also, Grenja, evidence.

#+begin_quote
  Link looked to her quizzically. “How do you know that?”

  “Because you didn't hear what I just sent you telepathically.”

  “Oh.”

  Koja snickered.
#+end_quote

Care to share your dirty joke with the class Koja? Please don't.

#+begin_quote
  “Why does what still work?” Grenja asked.

  “My sword?” Link waved it around.

  Grenja stared at him incredulously for a moment before his face went pale. “Oh, fick. Fick!”
#+end_quote

Another dirty joke in 3....2...

#+begin_quote
  “No, you /dolt/,” Koja said, rolling her eyes. “I can't heal scrambled brains. And his brains aren't scrambled. He means---why's it still imbued?”
#+end_quote

Koja! that was the perfect--- I mean, excellent point we should investigate this after Link finishing looting. Speaking of, we still haven't moved out of the vestibule. I'm also very impressed at your restr---

#+begin_quote
  “Wait, why's Ryn imbuing /your/ sword?”

  “Isn't it obvious?” Koja said. “It's because she's imbuing his /other/---”
#+end_quote

Never mind.

#+begin_quote
  “Apologies,” Fi said. “It was not my intention to upset you. I will continue to observe from a more socially appropriate distance.” She floated about six feet away and continued to peer down at him.
#+end_quote

Obligatory social distancing joke.

#+begin_quote
  Link decided to press on ahead.
#+end_quote

And there was much rejoicing. By the QMs, because we finally got on with it.

#+begin_quote
  The door was now open.
#+end_quote

5,000 words just to open a couple doors. The poor QMs.
