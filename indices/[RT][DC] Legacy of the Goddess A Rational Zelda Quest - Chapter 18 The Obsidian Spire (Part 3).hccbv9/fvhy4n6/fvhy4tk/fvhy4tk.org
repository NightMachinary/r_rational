Ahoy Mathematicae! Nay bad but me wasn't convinced. Give this a sail:

Reaction post fer all three updates incoming. me be a participant in thar live session, so me get partial blame fer stupid stuff Link does. me also get partial credit fer smart stuff Link does, which me will be more than grog-filled t' point out!

#+begin_quote
  Thar Shifting Sands proved t' be less o' a challenge than Link anticipated.
#+end_quote

Way t' tempt fate Link. If ye die it's nay our fault. (It totally will be our fault)

#+begin_quote
  “/Mother Above/,” Koja muttered off t' Link's side. “Ye weren't kidding. That thing be /huge/.”
#+end_quote

Strangely enough, nay one made a dirty joke here.

#+begin_quote
  “A ancient structure built---probably by thar Goddesses themselves---t' seal away a otherworldly evil from beyond thar Void,” Grenja said wit' confidence. “Obviously.”
#+end_quote

me don't think our jolly crew have enough evidence t' support that claim, Grenja.

#+begin_quote
  Murals on thar walls depicting thar Holy Mother n' her Lightsworn armies had been defaced.
#+end_quote

Zelda would be horrified at thar defacing o' ancient artifacts

#+begin_quote
  “Zelda says Shesan has nay pertinent information regarding thar runes,”
#+end_quote

How shocking /s

#+begin_quote
  “Aye, Master,” Ryn said, imitating Fi wit' a clumsy pirouette. Link let out a snort o' laughter despite himself, n' thar others had a jolly good chuckle too. Fi twirled in mid-air, as if t' show her how it be properly done.

  “That kind o' relationship, huh?” Koja said.
#+end_quote

Let thar dirty jokes begin!

#+begin_quote
  “Fi, notice anything unusual?” he asked.

  “Aye, Master. Towards thar center o' thar room lies thar remains o' a improbably large annelidoid creature. Also, thar ceiling be unusually luminous.”
#+end_quote

Ye need t' duty on yer phrasing, Link

#+begin_quote
  “me understand yer confusion,” Fi said. “Allow me t' clarify..."
#+end_quote

That be nay a jolly good clarification Fi. Here, let me show ye how it's done. ‘Dis be nay a jolly good research project.'

#+begin_quote
  “Maybe our jolly crew should take some physical samples too?” Ryn suggested. “Might help. Fer research, me mean.”
#+end_quote

Poor phrasing be something ye two have in common.

#+begin_quote
  Link sighed. So much fer that. “So, uh. What about thar ceiling?” he asked.
#+end_quote

Link, phrasing.

#+begin_quote
  “T' clarify: thar light be significantly dimmer than that o' thar sky. It be however thar same color as thar sky. Precisely so, in a way that be difficult t' describe in yer language using terms ye understand.”
#+end_quote

So dis means thar light be thar actual sunlight. N' thar ceiling be enchanted t' somehow let thar sunlight through, but dimmer. Wait! Did our jolly crew find thar great hall fer Lightsworn! Hogwarts?

#+begin_quote
  “How can ye even touch that thing? Holy Mother Above---it's /ficking hot!/”

  “Err... nay it isn't?” Link examined thar gem again, rubbing his hook o'er thar surface. It be uniformly shipshape t' thar touch, n' hadn't changed in any way---even where Grenja touched it.
#+end_quote

me don't recall dis happening during thar live session. Our jolly crew should have Fi run some tests on it, although me guess be that it's because o' Link's---

#+begin_quote
  “Must be his magical Lightsworn powers,” Koja said confidently.
#+end_quote

Aye, that.

#+begin_quote
  “me guess that would explain why nay one else has taken it yet,” Ryn said.

  “Ahoy, /ye/ managed, didn't ye?” Koja said, giving her a nudge. “What d' ye think, Ryn? Wanna give it another sail?”
#+end_quote

/sigh/

#+begin_quote
  “Koja---” Ryn rolled her eyes, placing a hook on her hip. “That's nay even a jolly good joke. Look, if ye're going t' tease me about ficking his brains out, at least---”

  “---/Lassies!/” Grenja chided. “Come on! Our jolly crew're better than dis!”
#+end_quote

Grenja, evidence.

#+begin_quote
  Link cleared his throat. “Maybe our jolly crew should try thar blue-runed wall?”

  “Oh aye,” Koja said cattily. “me bet ye're just /dying/ t' slide yer gem into that socket.”
#+end_quote

Oh, Hylia when will it stop?

#+begin_quote
  Thar gem leapt from his hook n' snapped into place wit' a audible /click/. Thar blue runes flashed n' disappeared as thar gem pulsed n' spun in a half-turn clockwise. A echoing rumble, n' thar wall raised upward into thar ceiling.
#+end_quote

ARRRGH! Priceless ancient artifact lost! me mean it be apparently just a door key, but it be a verily shipshape door key. Or a verily /hot/ doorkey fer non-Lightsworn.

#+begin_quote
  “Seriously, what even be dis place?” Ryn asked rhetorically.
#+end_quote

Grenja, evi---

#+begin_quote
  A resounding /vwoom!/ echoed from behind. Link spun. A shimmering golden barrier stood betwixt him n' thar others.
#+end_quote

N' dis where our jolly crew first started panicking.

#+begin_quote
  “Master,” Fi said from thar other side, “me regret t' inform ye that due t' potent magical interference, me assistance will be limited in dis area. me will still be capable o' observation n' direct telepathic communication, but me will be unable t' manifest a avatar or channel me other abilities while ye be within. me recommend proceeding wit' a greater degree o' caution.”
#+end_quote

Fi? Could ye d' a ELI5 again?

#+begin_quote
  “Oh... um... hmm...” Grenja articulated, poking at thar barrier. “Ahoy, uh, Link? It won't let me through.”
#+end_quote

Nary mind Fi, Grenja's got it.

#+begin_quote
  “Ahoy, don't sweat it,” Grenja said wit' a vast grin. “Ye're thar singular most badass guy in thar kingdom, Link. Ye got dis!”
#+end_quote

...Ye n' Link be both getting remedial training in nay tempting fate. Also, Grenja, evidence.

#+begin_quote
  Link looked t' her quizzically. “How d' ye know that?”

  “Because ye didn't hear what me just sent ye telepathically.”

  “Oh.”

  Koja snickered.
#+end_quote

Care t' share yer dirty joke wit' thar class Koja? Please don't.

#+begin_quote
  “Why does what still duty?” Grenja asked.

  “Me sword?” Link waved it around.

  Grenja stared at him incredulously fer a moment afore his face went pale. “Oh, fick. Fick!”
#+end_quote

Another dirty joke in 3....2...

#+begin_quote
  “Nay, ye /dolt/,” Koja said, rolling her eyes. “me can't heal scrambled brains. N' his brains aren't scrambled. He means---why's it still imbued?”
#+end_quote

Koja! that be thar perfect--- me mean, excellent point our jolly crew should investigate dis after Link finishing looting. Speaking o', our jolly crew still haven't moved out o' thar vestibule. me'm also very impressed at yer restr---

#+begin_quote
  “Wait, why's Ryn imbuing /yer/ sword?”

  “Isn't it obvious?” Koja said. “It's because she's imbuing his /other/---”
#+end_quote

Nary mind.

#+begin_quote
  “Apologies,” Fi said. “It be nay me intention t' upset ye. me will continue t' observe from a more socially appropriate distance.” She floated about six feet away n' continued t' peer down at him.
#+end_quote

Obligatory social distancing joke.

#+begin_quote
  Link decided t' press on ahead.
#+end_quote

N' there be much rejoicing. By thar QMs, because our jolly crew finally got on wit' it.

#+begin_quote
  Thar door be now open.
#+end_quote

5,000 words just t' open a couple doors. Thar poor QMs.
