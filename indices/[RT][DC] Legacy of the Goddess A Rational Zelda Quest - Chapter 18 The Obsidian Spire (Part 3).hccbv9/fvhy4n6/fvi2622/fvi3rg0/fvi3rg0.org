Part 3

#+begin_quote
  The kneeling warrior wielded a gleaming sword with a blue hilt---a sword that glowed with a holy light, surpassed only by the radiance of the Mother Goddess.
#+end_quote

Heh, Shesan was wroooong!!!

#+begin_quote
  two warriors stood back-to-back, facing away towards either side of a branching path. One wore robes and their hands glowed with magic. The other wore armor and brandished a sword.
#+end_quote

Sword lightsworn or mage lightsworn. Gee, I wonder which one Link is? /s On a more serious note, the third mural has some serious plot significance too. Here, let me dig up the description from our dungeon run.

#+begin_quote
  /The mural on the floor is very similar thematically to the one in the previous room. Hylia stands at the center surrounded by glowing figures wearing flowing robes. The figures have their arms outstretched, and a multicolored sphere separates them from the darkness at the edges./
#+end_quote

Remember that barrier we saw in Shesan's vision? Looks like the mage Lightsworn were involved in creating/maintaining it. Anyways, back to funny comments

#+begin_quote
  Was he ready?
#+end_quote

Link, you're a Link. Ready is your middle name.

#+begin_quote
  Surely the threats ahead wouldn't be /that/ dire. How bad could they be? Nothing else in this place had proved to be all that dangerous...
#+end_quote

You just had to think that.

#+begin_quote
  Link's longsword was among the finest quality in the kingdom, but it was certainly not a mythical blade capable of banishing evil to the depths of the Void. Would the /Sword of Evil's Bane/ be required to proceed?
#+end_quote

...Link, stop setting off so many death flags!

#+begin_quote
  He was probably overthinking it.
#+end_quote

YES! Go slay some monsters! Stop. Thinking.

#+begin_quote
  “Just in case you /are/ still listening,” he muttered. “In case you do have a hand in this still... I could really use some help right about now.”

  Fi appeared at his side. “I would be happy to help, Master. What is it you need assistance with?”
#+end_quote

Hylia is there anything you /can/ do to help us? “Well gosh, Link, I could give you my amazing magical construct. Do you think that would help?”

#+begin_quote
  Link grinned. Why had he ever doubted?
#+end_quote

Excellent, we have our Link back.

#+begin_quote
  A small handheld device that ꡢꡌꡟꡱꡗꡔꡧꡙ→Ⱑꡙꡖꡃꡗꡌꡜꡃ꡶ꡔ and ꡧꡌ꡴ꡃꡙ꡷ꡟꡔ꡴ꡧꡗꡙ→ꡙꡖꡃꡗꡌꡜꡃ꡶ꡔꡙ.
#+end_quote

Is this an instruction manual? In Fi conlang? The crypotography guys are gonna have a field day.

#+begin_quote
  Runes all along the rocks lit up with an eerie green glow. The ground rumbled and Link nearly lost his footing. The pile /moved/, boulders shifting over one another as they rose up into the air.
#+end_quote

Time for some boss [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2vaSlpliEs][music]]!

#+begin_quote
  Link could barely believe what he saw. Before him stood a /Stone Talus/---a mythical creature of living rock!
#+end_quote

Meh, they're easy. Just pepper it with bombs from the sheikah slate.... Oh. Well, you're doomed Link.

#+begin_quote
  The Stone Talus reared back. All too late, Link realized it held a boulder in its left hand.

  His stomach sunk to his feet. He turned and---
#+end_quote

No....

#+begin_quote
  “Fi... tell Zelda... tell her I...”

  The darkness took him.
#+end_quote

NOOOO!!! He died to the first boss?!

#+begin_quote
  Link snatched the transfabrulator from his belt and spun, creating a block off to the side. Several tons of certain death filled his vision, the mass growing larger with every passing thought. He pointed and squeezed.
#+end_quote

Courage fragment, you're the best fragment type ever.

#+begin_quote
  A blast of air sent Link stumbling back. He struggled to stay on his feet. Ahead, the Stone Talus writhed in agony amid a cloud of shimmering dust. Glowing spiderweb cracks radiated from a missing chunk at its right shoulder---its entire arm had been obliterated.
#+end_quote

Now that's the Link action I signed up for!

#+begin_quote
  Link barely had a chance to register the event; an enormous aracha burst from the ground, skittering over the sand with frightening speed and kicking up a trail of dust in its wake.
#+end_quote

Ugh, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRhnEnnpHJY][Spiders]].

#+begin_quote
  Link smacked himself. It wasn't /courage/ that he lacked, but /wisdom/.
#+end_quote

Speaking of wisdom, have you thought about reapplying luck?

#+begin_quote
  He couldn't very well choose to give up on his ideals, could he?
#+end_quote

Well you could, but then you'd probably lose that OP Courage fragment.

#+begin_quote
  “Goddess Above,” he whispered, feeling once more the conviction burning within. “I /will/ be your champion.”
#+end_quote

That's the spirit. Now go kill that last boss! And reapply luck.

#+begin_quote
  If he wasn't looking for it, he might have missed it. On the far side of the room, two mounds of dirt shifted.
#+end_quote

Great. A duo boss.

#+begin_quote
  ...How did they know where he was?
#+end_quote

Tremor sense.

#+begin_quote
  The worm-creature jerked and twitched violently, but its thrashing grew weaker with every attack until at last it fell still.
#+end_quote

Yay! Link's not dead!

#+begin_quote
  Please place the transfabrulator upon the altar so that it may be used to test the next candidate, then proceed ahead to receive your blessing.'”
#+end_quote

No, no we're here to /get/ loot not give it away.

#+begin_quote
  A large basin stood at the center of the platform, filled with shimmering, sky blue water.
#+end_quote

My Cosmere senses are tingling.

#+begin_quote
  Huh? He lifted it in and out of the water. It wouldn't fill. Not only was the waterskin empty, but it was still bone dry.
#+end_quote

Is this a perpendicularity? Fi! We need to do some science on this ‘water'.

#+begin_quote
  He bent forward and cupped his hands, taking in a mouthful. It was ice cold, but in a nice way. It had to be the best, most refreshing water he'd ever tasted.
#+end_quote

...Link you just resolved to be wiser and here you are ingesting unknown substances.

#+begin_quote
  Link grunted. “Uhhhh---/hrk./ Maybe that wasn't the best idea.”
#+end_quote

Yes, maybe next time think that /before/ you do the dumb thing. In fact, I have a simple acronym for you to remember. WWZD. What Would Zelda Do. Except, Zelda's a drug addict so maybe that's not a great acronym.

#+begin_quote
  Above, a rift in the sky opened to an endless golden expanse. Around him, the lake flowed outward from a single island at its center, cascading over the edges of a great structure in five tiers of luminous waterfalls.
#+end_quote

Pretty

#+begin_quote
  “Be brave, my child,” Hylia said sadly, her fingers brushing over his. “Go forth, and defend the realm.”
#+end_quote

Good thing we brought 3 Sheikah. That way Link can go fourth!

#+begin_quote
  “Aww yeah, new mission!” Grenja shouted, pumping his hand in the air. “Time to kill us some ghosts!”
#+end_quote

No, no we're supposed to free them from their prison, move on to the afterlife or something not kill them. Also, they're already dead.

#+begin_quote
  “Right now, I need a good, long nap.”
#+end_quote

After writing this I need one too, Link.
