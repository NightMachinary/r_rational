Also why would you spin it down at all? Engine is central, so it has to contend with less g anyways; put your fuel lines in the middle... Reduce material stress, I guess. Idk how much g a station practically needs to get places. Can't imagine it's that high. I'd just keep it spinning and speed it up over a day or two.
