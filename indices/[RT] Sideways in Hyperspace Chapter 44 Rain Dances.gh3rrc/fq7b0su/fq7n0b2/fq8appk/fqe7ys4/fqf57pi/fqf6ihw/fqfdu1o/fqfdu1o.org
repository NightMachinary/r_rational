Total goes as sqrt-sum-squares, so for moderate forward accelerations, the increase in total gravity is very small; probably ignorably so.

For instance, to accelerate from Ceres orbit to solar excape velocity only takes about two hours at 1 m/s/s... this acceleration only increases the percieved gravity by 1 percent.

If even that amount of increase in gravity is unacceptable, you can alternatively opt to save 99 percent of the spindown time.
