And no, you can't do any sort of conservation of energy shenanigans with magic. It operates under an equivalent exchange system that's so good at calculating value that you'll never win^{*}. The only wide-scale economic use of magic is hedge funds observing the costs of magic abilities to extract information about arbitrage opportunities. They'll pay you about twice minimum wage to repeatedly transforming while hooked up to various sensors.

^{*} Climbing onto a lever and transforming into a heavy animal costs a number of calories that depends on how efficient of a generator that lever is hooked up to and how expensive the food you eat is. Your magic is safe from this for personal use because it's powered by a witch owing you a favor, but that's not an infinite power source.
