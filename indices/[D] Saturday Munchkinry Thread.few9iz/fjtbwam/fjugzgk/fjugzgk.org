Can I choose a human? Specifically, a nerdy wimpy unattractive human teenager?

A random 10-year old is not likely to understand that humans are animals, and more unlikely to say that humans are the favorite animal. Humans are not religiously significant since they are the worshipers, not the worshipees. (There are religious gods that look human, but they aren't really human so I don't think they count? At best, they are hybrid demigods, with the genes of gods.) Finally, a nerdy wimpy unattractive human teenager is not particularly cool, and likely to letdown the attractive stranger. So I expect the nausea levels to be low.

Now the question is, does this let me achieve immortality? Or at least buy me a lot more lifespan? After all, I can wait until I'm old, then transform into this teenager.
