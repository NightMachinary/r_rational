I'm a little late to the thread, but I think how much you've expanded your life span depends on a few things. Does the transformed body age normally? What happens to your "original" body while transformed? If you live as the teenager long enough that you age into your mid-20's, return to your original form, then transform back into the teenager, are you still in your 20's, or are you a teenager again?

If the transformed body doesn't age (as one /may/ assume since the specific transformation includes "teenager" as part of the description), then you can just stay a teenager for eternity (assuming that your "original" body doesn't continue aging in some way /or/ that when the original body dies from old age, that the transformed body is not affected until your try to un-transform).

Or if the original only ages when you're in that body, and returning that form and then transforming again makes you a teenager again, then you would end up with a life span of (your normal lifespan * average time you spend transformed before "refreshing" the transformation) / how much your original body ages when you "refresh" the transformation.
