Just a general pick that I think would maximize threat and safety. Large mammals are too cool to be picked. Small mammals are safe but pose little threat. Poisonous/Venomous things that pose a lethal threat would probably be too cool to be picked. Carnivorous birds with sharp claws are also too cool.

Wasp: Terrifying insect.

Small target. Anything that can threaten your human form will usually not pose the same threat to your wasp form, and vice versa.

Can fly. Increases mobility, ability to flee, and ability to engage.

Can hide or move through tiny spaces. Very useful, especially since you can fly.

Can cause an extremely large amount of pain with a sting. If physical conflict occurs, then mind-numbing levels of pain will help you a lot.
