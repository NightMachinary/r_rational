This is probably stretching it too far, but you program a machine to hire people to do certain jobs, based on how much power it receives. Then whatever amount of energy it takes to perform the power generating process, is equivalent to your expected profit from the job. You personally can't gain anything from that, but your friends who can also profit from it, can then invest in the job that gives you more profit.
