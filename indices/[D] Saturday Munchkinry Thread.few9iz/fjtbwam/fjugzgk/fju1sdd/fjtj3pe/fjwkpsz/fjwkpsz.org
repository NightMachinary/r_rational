Thought of some more radical options:

- The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turritopsis_dohrnii][Immortal Jellyfish]]. Could choosing this give you immortality, provided you could create and maintain a suitable aquatic environment for yourself after transformation and never change back? Nausea may or may not be a problem depending on which rules have precedent over the others. If the "pick a specific unknown version" rule takes precedence, then since jellyfish are well known, and not particularly cool in general, the nausea levels should be fine. On the other hand, if the "obscure animals" rule takes precedence, most people who know of the immortal jellyfish find it very very cool since its immortal, so the nausea levels will be devastating.
- Pick any animal that reproduces by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragmentation_(reproduction][fragmentation]]). Now when you transform, can you split up your body into separate bodies that are all you, then transform back to have multiple copies of you? Meaning free and easy self-cloning? This option is also pretty safe in terms of nausea, since many animals that do this are worms, which are icky and uncool.
