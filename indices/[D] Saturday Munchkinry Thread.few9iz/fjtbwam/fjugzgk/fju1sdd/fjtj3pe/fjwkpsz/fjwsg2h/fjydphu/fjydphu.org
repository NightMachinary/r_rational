The fragmentation idea has many problems. First, do you have any control over your fragments? Given that most animals aren't capable of human level thought, your consciousness is likely disembodied and has a connection to your animal's nervous system. If you reproduce while a worm, your consciousness may be detached, and remain disembodied forever, or simply cease to exist.

Even if you can control all your fragments, when you reproduce by fragmentation, it's likely that when you turn back to human form, you will simply be left in pieces. There would be no single worm to replace with a human, the original worm no longer existing.

At this point it is unclear what would happen if you turned back into a worm before your brain died from oxygen deprivation, assuming your brain was even in one piece. The first possibility is you'd transform back into multiple worms, in which case you'd have a permanent transformation into a conscious colony of worms.

Alternately, you might just transform into a single worm, in pieces of a similar proportion to your human form. If your worm can regenerate from said pieces, you might be alright, but you'd still be stuck in the form of a sentient worm colony.
