Immortality is a pretty good hack! You'd have to be a jellyfish though. I guess you need to build yourself a tank and a jellyfish-operable computer, and live most of your life online. Probably ration your human lifetime in case your care/maintenance workers do something sketchy? It's a lot like being paralyzed, but you live forever.

I'm going to assume cloning yourself using worm magic goes all Sorcerer's Apprentice in record time.
