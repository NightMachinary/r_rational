I may have asked this before, but recent events have made my old answer obsolete.

A witch owes you a favor and will grant you the ability to transform into the animal of your choice. However, there's a drawback: you'll experience headaches and nausea proportionate to how cool the animal is. It's known that picking a tiger or falcon will make you pass out from nausea, while picking a blobfish or tapeworm will have no side effects.

It's hard to exactly pin down how cool an animal is, but there are some guidelines. If it's at all likely to be a random ten year old's favorite animal, you're treading on dangerous ground. Any animal that's been religiously significant to any culture is sketchy. If you go to a bar and try to impress an attractive stranger with your transformation ability, and revealing which animal you can transform into is a letdown, that's a good sign. Obscure animals are dicey because their coolness is primarily determined by people who've heard of them, who tend to be animal nerds. The "pick a specific unknown version of a more generally known animal" ploy does not work - a Taita Falcon is still a falcon.

This takes place in the modern world. Everyone knows magic exists, but it's rare and doesn't have any radical culture-warping effects.

What's the best animal to choose?
