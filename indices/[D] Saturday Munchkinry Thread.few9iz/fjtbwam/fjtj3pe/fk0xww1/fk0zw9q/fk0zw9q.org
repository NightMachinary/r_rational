They take a bunch of people who can do magic, try to get them to do the kind of things that [[/r/rational]] usually comes up with, and observe the costs of the magic / ask the users how hard it was. Like you get the guy who can turn into a hippo to stand on a lever, transform, and report how hard that is a few times, then you record the difference between the times where the lever is hooked up to a generator and those where it isn't, then you compare that to the usual differences, then you compare that to the experiments with leprechaun gold in the room next over, then you use this to adjust your fund's positions on power generation vs gold.

It's just an extended joke about magic being so good at computing equivalent value to prevent itself from being exploited that its ability to compute equivalent value is worth exploiting.

Is there actually a way to turn that into an oracle?
