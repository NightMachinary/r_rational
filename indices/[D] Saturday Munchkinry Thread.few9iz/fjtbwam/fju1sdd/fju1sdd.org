Common bird, such as a pigeon. You can fly now, but still have pretty good vision. Kids that like birds will choose parrots, owls, predator birds, etc.

City Rat. You can fit through small gaps and have a strong sense of smell. You can chew through things. Too common to be cool by most metrics.

Wasp. Scorpions and spiders are scary and cool to some kids, but I think the vast majority will agree that wasps are fucking terrifying and uncool. Best choice might be Paper Wasp.
