If you find an efficient way to burn tomatoes, you can get up to 136kw of power out of the wand.

I thought you might be able to use the immovable rod to mount the tomato wand very high and drop tomatoes into a turbine to harvest their energy, but tomatoes are pretty light and it's just not that much. It's roughly one watt per meter (mgh, mass ~0.1kg and g ~10m/s/s so they cancel out), so you'd need to mount it 136km high before it outperforms burning tomatoes. And of course they're not going to fall neatly to where you want them to through the atmosphere.

Best bet is space travel. You've got a source of not only food (though it's tomatoes, ugh) and power, but also just organic molecules in general. There's probably a way to get oxygen out of a tomato. And you can use an immovable rod for propulsion.
