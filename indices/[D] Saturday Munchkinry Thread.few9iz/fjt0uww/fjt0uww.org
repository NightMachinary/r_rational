From my roommates:

You have a traditional immovable rod, with a button that triggers its immovability, which is relative to the local gravity well (planet, usually).

You also have a wand that produces one whole tomato per second when desired.

Ignoring all the ways you could munchkin the immovable rod on its own, what else could you accomplish with the addition of the tomato wand?
