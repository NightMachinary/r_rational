Assuming that the tomatoes are identical to each other, it could potentially be very useful in scientific research. One of the difficulties in experiments is trying to set a constant baseline for each trial, so having an entire tomato being identical regardless of other factors could be invaluable to biological research. The standardised tomato could become the new petri dish.

In the same line, it could also become an easily measurable fundamental constant - you could then redefine units of measurement against this one, and have, for example, a kilogram being exactly 1.124 Matos.

You can also look at how the tomatoes are spawned. If they expand outwards from a point, can you use it to crack open rocks? If it replaces air, can you use it to destroy gasses? Etc.

And if you want to use it in conjunction with the immovable rod... I have no idea. Maybe skewer the tomatoes with it and roast them over a fire.
