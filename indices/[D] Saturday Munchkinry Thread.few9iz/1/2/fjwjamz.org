This could be used as a pretty nifty bomb. If you launch both into space, have them orbit the Sun for 1,000 years, desire for tomatoes to be created constantly for 1,000 years, then activate the rod to cease motion, and then deactivate it, the now planet-sized tomato (about 1.6 million km in radius) will accelerate down. If you choose where you accelerate it to, you could get it to accelerate down and hit the Earth, killing everyone.

On a related note, in 1,000 years you could also just have a tomato sized planet... so if you ever wanted that, you could do it.

There's probably a way you could play with momentum with the tomato wand. Say you're going very fast, like 99% of c. Then you start creating tomatoes for 1,000 years. Now you have a tomato planet going 99% of c, which has a greater momentum and kinetic energy than you had originally.

On second thought, the first part wouldn't work too well. The tomatoes would be going so fast that they'd probably just break through the wand, and only the wand would fall to the Earth. We'd then just be left with a tomato planet.

If we found a way to extract usable carbon from tomatoes, then we'd have a useful source of useful carbon.

If you're able to get the wand in someone's nose, ear, or mouth, then you could likely kill them. Even if you stabbed them with the wand, if you put a tomato in there, the wound would get pretty big.

Ooo! Take the immovable rod, if it is able to also bestow immovability to things around it, or we can warp it in some way, we can surround the tomato wand with immovable substance, then desire for the wand to produce tomatoes. The smaller the enclosure the better. Keep this going for a significant length of time, then heat it up. Now we have a high-pressured tomato bomb, we can trigger with the push of a button. 1000 years would be preferable, but in only 1 year, we'd have something with the mass equivalent of a tomato planet with 1/6th the radius of the Earth in an enclosed area. I'm sure if you opened this, it'd be the worst disaster in the history of the planet. Whether or not any countries would believe your feat, and be willing to negotiate for you not to open it is a different question.

If we left the rod going for a year, its total mass produced would be about 3.6 million kg, assuming .115kg per tomato. We could burn this for fuel, however the amount of CO2 released would be enormous, and disastrous for the environment. If we are able to build a chamber able to withstand an enormous amount of pressure without breaking, we'd probably be able to generate enough thrust to enter Earth's orbit. It'd also allow us to generate free rocket fuel. This is where the momentum thing comes in. Generate a crap tone of tomatoes, launch them off the rocket. Now you're going faster than you were before.

*Final conclusion: Use the tomato wand to create a highly pressured tank filled with tomatoes. Put that tank on a rocket, and get into orbit, now we have a free source of fuel to the rest of the universe. This technically doesn't require the use of the immovable rod, and potential issues could be the lack of a way to easily take the wand out of the tank, or the potential damage the wand could undergo inside of the tank. The former could be fixed by simply placing the wand fully inside the tank, and making the openings small enough that the wand can't fall out, and numerous enough that the wand can't block the exit. We still have the issue of potential damage done to the wand.*

EDIT: we could also just have a mechanism to throw the tomatoes overboard for acceleration. This produces less thrust, but is also less susceptible to failures that could result in unleashing a sixth-of-a-planet-sized-glob-of-pressurized-tomatoes bomb into your ship.

EDIT2: I'm sure engineers could figure out a way to make the wand removable, through some sort of fancy plug system.
