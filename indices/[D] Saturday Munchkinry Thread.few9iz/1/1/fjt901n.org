Well, heat death is no longer a concern, so that's nice.

You can use the immovable rod to get into geosynch easily, but I'm not sure how to use it with a tomato wand in any relevant manner. The tomatoes are made too slowly to change what gravity well the rod is anchored to. I suppose you might be able to do things with lagrange points, but we can already do those things with mundane technology.

The tomato wand could be used to very slowly accelerate the death of a star by adding mass. This is also the most convenient means of transforming tomatoes into heavy elements.

If you staple the wand to the rod, you could drop them just above the event horizon of a black hole, press the button, and then inject mass into the black hole from a perfectly safe platform. Biggest problem with this is the possible destruction of the wand through extreme temperatures in the accretion disk, so this might just be a bad idea.

Over a very, very long period the wand could be used to make artificial black holes. I once determined that the schwartzchild radius of a cubic lightyear of just about anything except interstellar void is significantly smaller than a cubic lightyear. This is yet another means of transforming tomatoes into exotic elements.
