Hook it up to a wheel, with the button sticking out perpendicular to the wheel. Opposite the rod, set up a ramp thing that presses the button for part of the wheel cycle and not the other part. Power the wheel. During the immobile part of the cycle, the attached vehicle moves relative to the rod, and during the other part the rod moves relative to the vehicle (or they both move relative to the center of the mass but the vehicle is heavier so whatever). Now you have something that basically works like a wheel on the ground, but it works in the air, or space, or whatever.

It's good for takeoff and landing, but in deep space this probably isn't as efficient as a tomato to hydrocarbon fueled rocket.
