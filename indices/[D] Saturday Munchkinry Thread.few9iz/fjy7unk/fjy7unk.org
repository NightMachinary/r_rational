You are a 15 year old peasant girl in a secondary world fantasy that is equivalent in technology to around 14th century England (Late Middle Ages). The known world is about the size of continental Europe, and is politically and culturally similar, though the specifics of religion are different.

Magic has been inert for thousands of years, but it is widely accepted to have once been a potent force in the world.

Your mother, an alchemist, is blinded in an experiment moments after potency begins slowly returning to magic. The specific way in which she was blinded triggers a phenomenon called “Awestrike” -- where the blinded person momentarily glimpses the current state of the universe. The experience is overwhelming and momentary, with much of the gained knowledge being forgotten as a dream melts away upon waking. A person cannot experience this twice.

Your mother cannot remember the details but she convinces you that in around 500 years an existential threat to humanity will arise. She says that the only chance for survival when that day comes is if the threat meets with a united humanity that has one of her descendants in a position of power.

Around the same time, you discover that if you maintain eye contact with someone (you can clearly see their retinas and they can see yours) while you issue a command with intention -- they are magically compelled to complete that command. You learn from your mother that all your descendants will also have this power. A command can only be superseded by a more recent command.

Your goal is to have a unified humanity in 500 years, with one of your descendants in a position of power.

You will not live an abnormally long life. You have no knowledge of what strange technologies or magics will emerge in the future.

You can compel people to follow your orders if you issue the order while maintaining clear eye contact, and all of your descendants will also have this power.

Nobody else has this power, though people are aware that such things could be possible with magic.

*What is your plan to maximize the likelihood of that future and what difficulties do you anticipate?*
