Mind control and 500 years of prep time seems like way more than enough to accomplish the goal. The biggest problem I foresee is just making sure that your conspiracy survives 500 years, which hereditary mind control can solve too. Second biggest problem is suspicion about your hereditary mind control abilities leading to a witch hunt.

You need a carefully phrased command for your descendants that tells them to go along with the plan, never issue a command that supersedes this command, give this same command to all their descendants at birth up until the deadline, and have lots of kids. And, you know, communicates the reason for all of this as nicely as possible so people aren't straining to resist it.

Then you probably "seduce" (mind control) a noble for power, have as many kids as possible, and get them married into other influential families, preferably far-flung ones. All your descendants are bound to play along with the plan, so they can form a regular old network of nepotism and favoritism to get each other into positions of power, with no ability to turn into factions against each other. After a generation or two the extended family will have enough power that everyone can lay off the mind control almost entirely in favor of nepotism enforced by that from-birth command. You probably enforce discretion with this ability as part of the command.
