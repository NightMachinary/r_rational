  Of all the parts of the story so far, if mind control has been used on him, this is when it seems most likely to me.

Cheers for the clarification, appreciated!

We were writing him bi, FWIW, but probably isn't very clear.

Might be something to consider for the rest of the story, as my coauthor is bi herself and bi erasure blah blah blah, so we wrote some other stuff to affirm "yes, he also thinks women are cute", but we should definitely make sure we indicate that he thinks men-who-aren't-William are cute, too.
