Thanks, once again! That was all very validating :)

  Hey, I appreciate author interaction, and I can tell you're struggling to work out whether you have an audience on the subreddit or not. I would feel this way too if my work lacked audience feedback in the form of commenting on a forum specifically used for commenting.
#+end_quote

Ehh, I'm OK with it, honestly. I've seen, once or twice, stories get hit with "wtf is this doing here", so I know that if people thought it wasn't appropriate it'd be jumped on. Though sometimes I wonder if the average straight man's inability to stomach seeing men being affectionate with each other means that nobody has actually read it and they just assume that it's probably okay ;)

#+begin_quote
  For what it's worth, I think this subreddit is extremely vocal if something does not fit in. I would take [[https://i.imgur.com/DNk5pbo.png][your average number of upvotes]] as a very direct sign that your story is well-liked here.
#+end_quote

I try not to read too much into upvotes but I am of course happy that it's got a good ratio and every time I get a kudos on AO3 I get a little rush :)

  [people fill in the blanks in vampire stories and] they all follow roughly the same tropes.
#+end_quote

Oh, right you are. I honestly didn't think of that. That... explains a lot. And our departures from vampire tropes aren't huge (though, our vampires drink through their lungs! it Just Makes Sense! and, you didn't hear it from me, but silver doesn't bother them at all - I actually had "kill my darlings" and cut out a really nice scene where William gives Red a silver dagger to defend himself from other vampires because he was nervous, but I realized that if anything bad happened, Red having a silver dagger is only going to make things worse, not better, so it's a pity)

  If you find the time, I strongly recommend reading the Parasol Protectorate series. I read it a long time ago and your story reminded me of it a bit. (Keywords vampire, feudalism, weird power interactions)
#+end_quote

Oh dang, it looks like a long series! I'll have to give it a pass because I've just marie-kondo'd my bookshelf and all my unread books are going to be read this year Or Else. (one a week. beeminder. let's do it.)

#+begin_quote
  If you want to be different, you have to scream how it's different, otherwise typical vampire lore will fill the holes.
#+end_quote

Ugh, I kind of avoided doing that because I didn't want it to be all about MY VAMPIRES ARE DIFFERENT GUYS, I just wanted it to feel natural. Like, Red is smart but uneducated (the encyclopaedia set is partially a gimme so that way we can get away with writing him as being more educated than he is), but we don't really consider he's the sort of guy who is going to like, munchkin everything, ask William how his stuff works, etc. He's overall pretty trusting.

  To give a go at your discussion questions:

*heart eyes*

  Elodia's actions seem pretty typical for a powermonger like the barons that swapped fealty from the first Earl of Pembroke to King John. She's young and wants to claw at power, and a King halfway across the world might be a good target.
#+end_quote

Especially when she's suspecting that he might be especially attached to something in Ajaccio and might be able to have that used to leverage something :)

  Nobody who has sucked at the breast of a regent for >100 years is gonna turncoat for some schmuck and his sweet tea. There's a game afoot. I wouldn't be surprised if a vampire can see through the eyes of a thrall.
#+end_quote

Lucia's main motivations is that she wants to be made a vampire.

OH MY GOD I WON'T WRITE ANY MORE BECAUSE YOU JUST GAVE ME A PLOT LIGHTNING BOLT, LIKE A FULL ON FUCKING LIGHTNING BOLT, I have what I think is a pretty damn awesome idea for the arc we want to write for volume 2, it is fucking perfect. I'm going to talk it to my coauthor now and if it sticks I'd love to name a character after you.

#+begin_quote
  People in love do stupid things, but it is extremely weird that he suddenly had gay love feelings for someone he just met.
#+end_quote

I like to think we made the "falling in love" part reasonably realistic, but if you think it seemed sudden we'll take that on board if we ever revise old chapters.

#+begin_quote
  Given that we know mind control is being used on him, the scope of it is sorta confusing. If you can mindfuck someone into obedience or love, why not make him dress the way you want? (This is a question I want answered in text and not Word of God).
#+end_quote

I am part-way writing a new scene for the next chapter that will make it very clear. After all, if you just found out your boyfriend can use mind control, you'd want some evidence, right? :)

That said: let's assume William has no mind control powers whatsoever. How could he possibly prove that?

Really, he does, but they're limited sufficiently to avoid munckinry IMO: so how could he possibly prove that (say) he can make you dance the charleston, but he couldn't make you kill your own mother? The only way I can think of to do that is to order them to dance the charleston, they do; then order them to kill their own mother and they find themselves able to resist. But how do they know the second order was with the power "activated", so it really didn't work, as opposed to having left the power on and the power not working for that?

  I think I have you beat on the wall of text front.
#+end_quote

I love it, thank you.
