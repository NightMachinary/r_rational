Hey, I appreciate author interaction, and I can tell you're struggling to work out whether you have an audience on the subreddit or not. I would feel this way too if my work lacked audience feedback in the form of commenting on a forum specifically used for commenting.

For what it's worth, I think this subreddit is extremely vocal if something does not fit in. I would take [[https://i.imgur.com/DNk5pbo.png][your average number of upvotes]] as a very direct sign that your story is well-liked here.

I do not think you expect answers to your first set of questions, but I'm going to propose something that resolves some of them and also addresses your later point about Pride and Prejudice and English class. In English class, you had no context for family embarassment because Pride and Prejudice is set in 1790 and you have no experience of 18th century culture - you also were presumably not in the habit of reading other books in 18th century culture.

Not to play devil's advocate for a straw man I'm constructing as I type, but we are in a media landscape filled with vampires (hell, Dracula was just adapted again for the thousandth time). Questions like "why do they have kings and dukes?" is answered by True Blood, vampires minimising harm (money+gift giving instead of writing) is well-tested by many vampire novels. Old ones exist in every vampire fiction and they all follow roughly the same tropes.

If you find the time, I strongly recommend reading the Parasol Protectorate series. I read it a long time ago and your story reminded me of it a bit. (Keywords vampire, feudalism, weird power interactions)

You have established some vampire themes, and we, the readers, are contextualising your vampires to other vampire lore. If you want to be different, you have to scream how it's different, otherwise typical vampire lore will fill the holes.

I picked up this story because I like rational fiction and I like vampires and I am extremely gay, I'm getting what I'm coming for, I'm not coming for a mystery.

To give a go at your discussion questions:

#+begin_quote
  What do you think Elodia's agenda is? Is she visiting William because it's socially expected, does she just want to be friendly, or is she trying something?
#+end_quote

Elodia's actions seem pretty typical for a powermonger like the barons that swapped fealty from the first Earl of Pembroke to King John. She's young and wants to claw at power, and a King halfway across the world might be a good target.

#+begin_quote
  What do you think the non-Lucia janissaries' deals are? (this is the subject of the next interlude)
#+end_quote

If this question was posed by anyone other than the story's author, I'd've said that it was explained in-universe. It's transactionary, it feels good so why not.

#+begin_quote
  What is Lucia's deal? Is she on Red's side, or is she trying to get Red to embarrass William because it will work out well for Elodia/Lucia?
#+end_quote

Nobody who has sucked at the breast of a regent for >100 years is gonna turncoat for some schmuck and his sweet tea. There's a game afoot. I wouldn't be surprised if a vampire can see through the eyes of a thrall.

#+begin_quote
  What do you think Red should do now he's got credible intel that vampires have mind control powers? What do you think he will do?
#+end_quote

People in love do stupid things, but it is extremely weird that he suddenly had gay love feelings for someone he just met. Given that we know mind control is being used on him, the scope of it is sorta confusing. If you can mindfuck someone into obedience or love, why not make him dress the way you want? (This is a question I want answered in text and not Word of God).

I think I have you beat on the wall of text front.
