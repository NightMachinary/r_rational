I appreciate the feedback, and I am sorry that the story isn't providing that. There's a lot of foreshadowing and hints, but you're right, nothing very substantial that invites speculation.

To an attentive reader the mind control remark isn't a surprise, but it creates suspense as to what Red will do with this information, or is that poorly executed?

If it helps, in three chapters something rather inexplicable will happen, and that's what this vampire visitor and ritual is building up to.

Would love some examples of stories that leave dangling threads, and the threads themselves. Will give me something to aim for!
