Hey! thanks again for the compliments and the comment, I really appreciate you taking the time to comment essentially "I am enjoying this but am not especially compelled to comment".

I've gone and written this rather... long response, because I can't do anything without rambling, like, a lot. Sorry!

tl;dr: As an author eager for feedback, I'm not so much interested in predictions but reactions. What do you like/dislike about the story and the characters' decisions? What are you taking away from it? My ultimate authorial wet dream would be the super detailed feedback tk17studios gets on the A:tR updates with people quoting lines they like, but I am not delusional enough to think I "deserve" that. I've thrown some discussion questions at the very end of this post, if you'd find them interesting.

At first I was thrown a bit of a loop by it, like, "does this mean my story isn't Rational? Does it not belong here?" and then I realised (thanks to [[/u/callmesalticidae]] 's help) that this story is not a puzzle. There's not a murderer who you can pinpoint by reading closely. There's plenty of foreshadowing - I'll point some out next chapter when it comes up (feel free to look for an event that happens in the first few chapters that is described in a kind of strange way) - and the worldbuilding is consistent and thought out, and you can probably work out the more secret motivations of some of the non-viewpoint characters (though Cassius will probably surprise you in 2025 if I ever manage get to write Volume Three).

Here's a list of things, just off the top of my head, that are important in the worldbuilding, and have real explanations, but aren't expanded on in the story (as it's written now).

- How does this whole vampire "feudal" system work? William is a King, and so is that Cassius guy, but how does Elodia, as a Duchess, fit in? Like is this just some sort of sexism or are there rankings? How many levels does it go? What is each person's "role" in society?
- Why do vampires have this weird, precise gifting language? Does it actually have any benefit?
- Why don't vampires like to touch money?
- Why was William so surprised that he talked about Venice? Is it a secret? Why?
- What's this about "old ones"?
- What are the limitations (if any) of the vampire ability to do mind control?
- Have we seen William do mind control to Red?

I remember when I read Pride and Prejudice in English class, the teacher explained a whole bunch of things (the various "shame on the family" things that one character did that don't seem that shameful to modern readers, how the upper class didn't have jobs because they made money from rent on their states, the ways that they were and were not allowed to communicate, etc). Jane Austen didn't explain any of this because it wasn't super relevant to her story (and, more to the point, she assumed everyone had a working knowledge of all this), and I guess that's where a lot of the vampire stuff comes for mine. I've started, tentatively, working on an appendix (that is written in-universe in the present day by another character), that will expand things. But IDK.

But this isn't a mystery. Nobody reads Jane Austen in order to predict how it's going to end or munchkin Victorian etiquette; they read it because they enjoy the setting and they enjoy finding out how it ends.

In earlier chapters I used to post "discussion questions", but people didn't respond so I gave up. I'll start doing it again, since it's probably a good idea in general (maybe I'll post them to AO3 in the endnotes, too). Here's what I have for this chapter?

SO, discussion questions:

- What do you think Elodia's agenda is? Is she visiting William because it's socially expected, does she just want to be friendly, or is she trying something?
- What do you think the non-Lucia janissaries' deals are? (this is the subject of the next interlude)
- What is Lucia's deal? Is she on Red's side, or is she trying to get Red to embarrass William because it will work out well for Elodia/Lucia?
- What do you think Red should do now he's got credible intel that vampires have mind control powers? What do you think he /will/ do?
