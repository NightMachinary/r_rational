  I like to think we made the "falling in love" part reasonably realistic, but if you think it seemed sudden we'll take that on board if we ever revise old chapters.

Of all the parts of the story so far, if mind control has been used on him, this is when it seems most likely to me. He notes several times how much he liked his gay adventures despite his complete lack of interest in men before then.

Dude's been in the army, if he was gonna be interested in guys, it had ample opportunity to happen before now and it just didn't.

I guess the biting ecstasy could be considered mind control.
