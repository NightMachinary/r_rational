Trust me, I'm all in for a gay vampire story. I'm in it for the long run. My suggestion as an uninformed reader who has never published anything in his life is: Try and make secret vampire business that suggests more than it tells.

The reader knows that some secret vampire business involved heretic priests, but we don't know why, so dangle some information for the reader to latch onto without telling the characters much.
