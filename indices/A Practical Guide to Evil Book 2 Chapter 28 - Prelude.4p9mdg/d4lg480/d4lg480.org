I just caught up to this chapter after starting last week. I've been finding this story very good. The best I could compare it to is Worm with the "good to be bad" mantra. So far I like the pacing of this much better as it doesn't feel like it is marching from one world ending crisis to the next. I also like how the Name system allows the story to get cheeky with clich√©s.

At this point in the story I appreciate how Cat isn't immune to permanent consequences of bad decisions. My favorite part though, was the arrow that killed the Hero a few chapters back. That was just gold.
