You know, I wonder if it is possible to knock Heiress out, tie her up, magically put her to sleep, drain her blood and replace it with some sort of antifreeze(without killing her), after which put her on ice somewhere up north, so as to completely seal off the Heiress Name(since the current keeper isn't yet dead)
