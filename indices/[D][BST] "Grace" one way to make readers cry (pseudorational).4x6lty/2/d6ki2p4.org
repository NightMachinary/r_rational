I liked the example from The Hatchet best. First, because I'd never looked at the scenario in that way before. Second, because although the moved plane offered Brian opportunity, it was very subtle, and he had to continue working and planning to take advantage of it, even though in the meantime he would suffer the absence of his shelter fully.

Been a while since I've thought about those books, but they were great. Those, Jack London, My Side of the Mountain, The Swiss Family Robinson, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, and some parts of The Boxcar Children, are all great outdoorsy books from my childhood that I think have been a good influence on me. I miss that time.
