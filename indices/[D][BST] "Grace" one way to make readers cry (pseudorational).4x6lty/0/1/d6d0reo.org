Let's see, Pixar movies with a "you-tried-everything-you-could-but-not-enough" moments...

- Multiples times in Wall-E, the climax is basically made of these moments.

- The first Toy Story, when Woody realizes he can light up the fuse with Buzz' helmet.

- A Bug's life, I guess, after the fake bird fails.

- Toy Story 3, the dump scene.
