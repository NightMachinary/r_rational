Inside Out, Bing Bong realizes Joy can escape the memory dump as long as he stays behind. Up, Carl decides to lighten his house to follow Russell (this scene parallels a scene much closer to the beginning, with Carl taking off in the first place).

Huh, both of these scenes are a bit of a twist on the grace concept - rather than a coincidence giving the characters the ability to do everything they initially set out to do, the characters see and take a new path that sacrifices a lesser goal for a greater one. Though the opportunity is external, the characters must actively assent to the sacrifice and accept the loss of the lesser goal.
