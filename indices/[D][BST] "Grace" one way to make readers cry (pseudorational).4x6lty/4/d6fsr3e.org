Well I'll be the dissenting voice here and say I don't get it. I don't remember feeling particularly emotional for Dash in that moment. Pact (by wildbow) had an almost innumerable amount of times where I think grace would be the word to use (perhaps I'm misunderstanding it) and again I don't remember having any strong grace like feelings that would bring me to tears.
