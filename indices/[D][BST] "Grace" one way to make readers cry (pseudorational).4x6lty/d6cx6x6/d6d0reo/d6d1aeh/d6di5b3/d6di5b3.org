Grace helps those who help themselves.

I think the most effective rational way to write grace is to return to something the audience has already discounted. Some object a character still has reappears with a new purpose. Some character, conventionally unable to help, returns. An important feature - inherent to the location or situation, but previously prevented - is now available because the terrain or pre-existing rules have changed.

Aristotle's "unexpected /and/ inevitable" applies, but so long as the surprise comes from within and is sufficiently foreshadowed, then there's no /ex machina/. That's why sacrifice is so effective: It contains a lot of the easiest options for an audience to discount. Destroying a crucial tool, surrendering life or limb, betraying a trust, or abandoning a secondary goal are all surprising things to have occur.

For maximum impact, the first sacrifice is just the signal that the protagonists have tried absolutely everything. It fails, hard, and we have a moment to reflect on that additional pain. The /second/ sacrifice is grace.

Suspense isn't about whether or not the hero succeeds, it's about what that success is going to cost.
