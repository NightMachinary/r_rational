I really think a better example is in the dump in toy story 3. I've seen a fan edit that just played the credits at that point with a slowed down "you've got a friend in me" playing, and it was heartwretching. But put in a REDACTED, and... They're still at the dump, they still need to find a way home, but now they have a chance. The story isn't over.
