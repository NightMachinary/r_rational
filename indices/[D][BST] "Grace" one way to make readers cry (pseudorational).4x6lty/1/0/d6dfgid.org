This article actually makes the grace moment in The Alloy of Law kind of meta. When Wax is about to fail he actually sees a vision of his god in the smoke, which then fades to reveal the tools he needs to give him a chance. I still need to read the next book.

SPOILERS FOR MISTBORN BELOW

It even makes sense why God operates that way since the entire plot of Mistborn came about because of intervention by gods, so the new God has a policy of subtle interference when necessary. One of the tenets of his religion is to not worship him, for goodness sake!
