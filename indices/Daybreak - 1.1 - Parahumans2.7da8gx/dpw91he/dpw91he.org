I don't recall seeing a post about this here yet (if there has been one, feel free to delete this one) but, for those of you who don't know (which included me about an hour ago) the sequel to Worm, known as Ward, is in production! It's been going for a little while now apparently but it was a sort of prequel/Parahumans online type thing. But chapter 1.2 was posted a few days ago and, as I understand it, Wildbow will be updating the story regularly on a Thu/Sat/Tue schedule.

I was a big fan of Worm, am currently reading Twig (hard to get through for me as super heroes are more my speed than the more sciency biologically grimdark world of Twig) and am super excited to be reading Ward! :D
