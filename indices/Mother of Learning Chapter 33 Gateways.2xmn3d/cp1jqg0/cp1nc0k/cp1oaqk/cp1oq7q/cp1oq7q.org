There is the classic "high fantasy" problem in stories like this.

You, the reader, only get pointed at the really interesting magic stuff, not the magical stoves in every home and such. So someone growing up with that in the story sees something old and not as good, it sorta kinda makes sense that they don't go "AH HA! The next MacGuffin is that ancient magical artifact! That one, right THERE!" Even if that ultimately isn't true, because it likely /is/ simply a MacGuffin and not the actual ultimate goal, it makes sense that they should see it like we do: lit in a giant neon glow.

But the characters must see stuff like that all the time. Older magical stoves that just weren't as good, simply littering junk shops or museums.

But still. In context, literally /ancient magical stoves/ discarded in piles under the city should be* the sort of thing twigging him that something weird is going on with them. That's how even real life works. I'm calling either authorial blindness or looming plot. Or a character flaw I missed.
