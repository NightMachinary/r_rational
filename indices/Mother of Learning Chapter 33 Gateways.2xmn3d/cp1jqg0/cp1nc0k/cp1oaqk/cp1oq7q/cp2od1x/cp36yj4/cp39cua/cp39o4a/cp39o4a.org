Thanks for that, and thanks to [[/u/nobody103]] for being awesome.

That is something I hadn't really considered- he is just one wizard. The Sovereign Gates and the other ones are centuries old, all the obvious low hanging fruit of how to activate them or find them has likely been tried, he had no reason to believe he would perform better than hundreds of other mages.

It's the sort of rationality that Eliezer mentioned- if your main is doing something else no one else has done they better have a damn good reason for no one else trying it. And I guess he knows lots of others have tried to do stuff with the gates.

While I understand his leeriness of engaging in debates, I do appreciate when he talks to us. Engagement and learning more about the story is very fun.
