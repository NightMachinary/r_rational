Here's the author's take from a PM on fictionpress (quoted with permission):

#+begin_quote
  Yeah, from Zorian's perspective the gates are a neat little mystery that he has no reason focus on at the moment. They're far from the only mystery scattered through the world, and he is still heavily under impression of the evens of 'Soulkill' and focused on making sure it can never happen again. The gates do not help with that, they have no obvious link to the time loop, and they appear to be objects that have stumped more capable mages for centuries so what the hell could /he/ do about it?

He's also leery of engaging in debates as an author, which seems very reasonable to me.
