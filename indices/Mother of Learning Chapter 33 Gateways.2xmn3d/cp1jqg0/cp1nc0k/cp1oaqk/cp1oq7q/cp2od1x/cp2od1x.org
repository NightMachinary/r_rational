I don't know, I think what you're saying explains Zorian's relative lack of interest sufficiently. He /did/ follow up on it enough to research more when he has the opportunity.

To be perfectly honest, personally I didn't mark the teleport gates as ridiculously important except in the same way as the sad cat sitting around on the bridge when Zorian didn't fish out the bicycle in early chapters - it will certainly be important later, and it merits research, but that's mostly meta-knowledge.

Zorian's in the middle of something, and I don't expect him to drop everything to chase a small clue. Hell - his combat training will directly contribute to being able to visit the gate under Cyoria.

Although personally my attention was more on the Sovereign gate and how it sounds /precisely/ how the time-loop situation could be described to other people (as opposed to loopers).
