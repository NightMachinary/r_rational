Yeah. Zorian is rightfully very cautious. Makes a lot of sense for him to focus on becoming good at combat rather than trying to solve the big mysteries and find the source of an invading army. I mean, he could try the good old scry and die techniques, he might succeed, but it'd be very risky.

Plus, psychologically, it's all very scary for him. Red Robes could murder him and his family at any time if he found him. It's a lot of mental effort to go confront all of that, especially when he rationally knows it could be a very bad idea.
