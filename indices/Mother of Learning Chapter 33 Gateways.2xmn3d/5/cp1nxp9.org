I did love the history lesson. Beautifully written, amusing, made the world much more real.

The priest's no selling of his teleport wards also amused me much.

It also explains even further the earlier Zoltan vampire/ Quatach Ichl debate where the vampire was a prominent member of society. Many houses converted their leadership to undead for immortality and as such those houses have likely continued to claim to be the true houes in Ulquaan Ibasa.
