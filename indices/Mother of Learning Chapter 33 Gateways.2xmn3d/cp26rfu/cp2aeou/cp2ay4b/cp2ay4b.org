Not exactly soul merge spells, but we don't actually know what soul alteration magic was used on Zach and Zorian: maybe the lich intended to damage their souls together out of efficiency, but the time loop spell made it go awry by cancelling it early due to Zach's death and causing the soul melding to occur.

Since people aren't dropping dead all over the place in each successive restart (Red Robe should be permanently killing off everyone of any importance in each invasion to make it a cakewalk when the time loop ends), I think RR is lying about it killing them permanently: he probably knows it's a temporary thing, and did it to disable them for the next restart so he could confront the third time traveler (Zorian), knowing he would go to the spiders to warn them in the new iteration.
