Finally got around to reading this story, so I can post in updates! \o/!

Does anyone else find it suspicious that the person Zorian happened to get asked to steal "trade secrets" from is likely heavily involved in the invasion? If Gurey doesn't end up being some undercover intelligence agent or something, I'm going to cry shenanigans unless there's a merchant in practically every town and city that's connected to the secret plot.

Also, this was probably mentioned in earlier posts, but if we're getting pseudo-confirmation that souls can't be killed, then that confirms my hypothesis that what happened to the spiders is probably what happened to Zach, and they'll all come back in one of the restarts, feeling disoriented and sick at first.
