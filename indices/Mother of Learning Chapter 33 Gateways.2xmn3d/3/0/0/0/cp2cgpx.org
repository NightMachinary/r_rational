I've been assuming that Red Robe knows more about the time loop (whether they're an original time looper or stole that knowledge from Zach), which would make it more likely that as a necromancer they would be able to use it for something sophisticated. But I'll admit that since we've seen temporary soul damage before, so that's another possibility.

Edit: I guess that I'm just more taken with the other theories because I like how strong it makes Zorian's adversary... for plot reasons I think it makes a better story compared to essentially losing your allies for a few turns instead of having permanent consequences while simultaneously revealing how powerful the opposition is. Maybe not the most objective logic.
