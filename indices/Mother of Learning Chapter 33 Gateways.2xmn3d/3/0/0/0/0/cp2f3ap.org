Don't get me wrong, it absolutely makes the stakes shoot straight up: it was an emotional hammerblow to have all the spiders get killed off for good. There just seems to be weak evidence now for RR having lied or been wrong, and the part of me that wants the spiders to not be dead is happy to acknowledge that evidence, even if it's not for objectively valid reasons either :)
