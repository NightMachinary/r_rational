What exactly is your theory- that the spiders were the victims of soul merge spells like Zach was (where the damage was foreign bits of soul)? I ask because I'm not sure what you're referring to.

My own personal theories are that the only things that would render non-time travelers essentially mindless at the beginning of each restart are: (1) some mechanism that ejects their souls from the time loop, (2) the purple spell actually attaches a marker to their souls like Zorian's, but also damages them (any other form of soul damage wouldn't be moved back in time, according to my model of the time loop).
