I'm not usually one to read "romance," especially slash, but the quality of the writing is impressive, much better than average even when taking into account the fact that works from authors in the rational community are already typically somewhat better than average. The worldbuilding with the vampire culture and the nonverbal communication is also very well done, seems natural and well-integrated in a way that makes the world feel believable in a way where other stories focused on worldbuilding feel forced.
