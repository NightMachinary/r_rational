Our update schedule is going to be one chapter a month with a one-page interlude halfway in between. Some of the interludes will advance the plot or provide foreshadowing; some will explore interesting ideas; some will just be cute little scenes we wanted to write but couldn't fit elsewhere.

This one gives a look into vampire society and behaviour.

Chapter 2 is going through a final round of edits and will be released on Easter weekend.
