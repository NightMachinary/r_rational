I should say that I /can/ enjoy romance a hell of a lot, it's just that like 99% of it fails to resonate with me (maybe because I don't want to fall in love with and kiss attractive people, haha). I love passionate emotion and I love intense affection between characters, so when romance is good it's really good. I have high hopes for this being one of the times I enjoy it!

Even if I don't end up enjoying the romantic stuff itself, I know I'll still enjoy the story for the the characters and worldbuilding. The various ways vampires do romance sound really interesting, especially the "one person in two bodies" kind--will we be seeing examples of these in the story?
