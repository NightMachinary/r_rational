Not a big romance person usually, but I like this a lot so far. The exploration of vampire culture via the opera and everything surrounding it drew me in right away. The idea that having a human lover might become a status symbol because of the time investment required is pretty clever--I'm guessing relationships between two vampires require much less frequent interaction than a mortal would expect?

Another thing I really like is that we get a sense of what motivates William right off the bat, and that he's almost immediately in active pursuit of a goal. That's a major factor in how easily I can get invested in a character.

I also like that we're immediately shown his appreciation for the opera, to the point of greatly admiring a specific librettist and considering the event a "treat." Sometimes rational protagonists can come across more like value-maximizing AI than real people. From the opera scene, I could tell right away that William isn't that kind of protagonist.
