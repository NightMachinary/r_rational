I think everyone likes romance more than they'd care to admit, even to themselves - last year when we were writing it "full tilt", I listened to a great podcast episode that covered romance as a genre and it really solidified for me what I like about it, and all that. At the end of the day, most everyone wants to fall in love with and kiss attractive people, so it's funny that most people don't want to read about it.

(And, well, I'll admit I don't read much romance either. Or vampire novels. My coauthor actually had to make me re-do one of the scenes because as written it was basically identical to a scene from Twilight...)

  I'm guessing relationships between two vampires require much less frequent interaction than a mortal would expect?

It depends on the vampires; there's a lot of variation because vampires come from all the cultures of the Earth, while at the same time having their own culture. It ranges between extremes: two vampires who are married and fiercely monogamous/loyal to one another even though they live on different continents and see each other once a century (but exchange frequent letters), to a pair who literally do not leave one another's side for anything, spending every moment of their unlife together until they kind of become one person in two bodies.
