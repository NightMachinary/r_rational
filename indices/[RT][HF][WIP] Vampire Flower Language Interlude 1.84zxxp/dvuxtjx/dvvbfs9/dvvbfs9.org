Wow! A lot of questions! Thank you. I will do my best to dance the thin line between answering them and keeping some mystery!

  Why the slow update schedule when you've said that you have all/most of the story already written?
#+end_quote

Written is one thing; edited is another. You might notice I say "we" a lot - it's because this story is written by two people working together. Which is /great/ when you have writer's block, but when you need a final pass of edits in a chapter, to work out some minor detail about a character or interaction, etc, it requires two people to have the time, be available, etc. Based on experience, with the runway we have, one chapter a month is doable for us and /even then/ I fear that the final chapters won't be ready in time. The accountability will help, I hope!

  Why do vampires have such a elaborate social customs when such customs tend to develop out of mating displays? [...] Maybe they are doing status signalling like humans would? If so, then why and how?
#+end_quote

Something along those lines; it's also a signal of self-control. Notice how William, when he's upset, starts using the 'sign language' instead of speaking?

  I suspect that we are only following the equivalent of vampire nobility rather than a typical vampire since it would be very odd if all humans develop similarly neurotic-like impulses when turning into a vampire.
#+end_quote

You are right, though all vampires have designs on nobility and so emulate it. This whole story is three volumes, two of which haven't been written yet, and we're hoping to get into that sort of stuff in the third especially. (I'd say the second is going to be short, but I thought this one would be half the length it is, and it's still not finished...)

  I loved the bit about Red being a deserter and what that [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/81wqs3/rthfwip_vampire_flower_language_chapter_1_an/dv6tg48/][implied]].

Thank you so much for the compliments, I hope you continue to enjoy the story despite the waits!
