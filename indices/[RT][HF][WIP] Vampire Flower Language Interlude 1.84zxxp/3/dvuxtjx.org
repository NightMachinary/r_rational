I just read this chapter and now I'm wondering about several things.

Why the slow update schedule when you've said that you have all/most of the story already written?

Why do vampires have such a elaborate social customs when such customs tend to develop out of mating displays? If animals do anything that seem like pointless energy waste, that's usually a way to signal ability as a mate aka peacocks with huge tails. But vampires are immortal and don't /need/ to have children and if they retained that desire /anyway/ after turning, then they should be acting towards humans who they could be viewing as their 'child' instead of other vampires. So I doubt they are 'performing' out of a reproductive desire. Maybe they are doing status signalling like humans would? If so, then why and how?

Status signalling matters when you can get something out of a higher status. But what do vampires earn with a high influence with other vampires? Humans do it mainly for authority, money, fame, and/or prestige. Vampires don't seem to find it difficult to earn money, so that only leaves authority, fame, and prestige. It would mean very different things depending on which of the three the vampires wanted.

Finally, are all vampires like William? It would be somewhat odd if all vampires were as well off as William with the time and energy to spend on learning elaborate skills like he does. I suspect that we are only following the equivalent of vampire nobility rather than a typical vampire since it would be very odd if all humans develop similarly neurotic-like impulses when turning into a vampire.

PS As you probably can tell, this is a really great, well-written story if it gets me thinking about all of the implications. I loved the bit about Red being a deserter and what that [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/81wqs3/rthfwip_vampire_flower_language_chapter_1_an/dv6tg48/][implied]].
