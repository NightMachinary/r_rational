One of the main problems with physics is even if we discover the "Theory of Everything" we still won't understand everything. My favourite example of this is: we don't model the behaviour of aeroplanes by calculating every atom in the air, we treat the air as a fluid. The article points out this problem.

What the article does not do is convince me in any way that their method is useful or even correct.

  We are hoping to persuade the scientific community that this is a worthwhile approach by showing that it can solve problems that could not be solved before. That is what we're up to now.

I felt that their description of constructor theory was very lacking and didn't have the feel of an aha moment. Then again maybe Newton's Laws, Einstein's Relativity etc. feel like aha because I know that they're correct (for a given value of correct).

If the explanation was clearer or if they had new results I'd be interested, for now I am doubtful it will lead to anything, I await results.
