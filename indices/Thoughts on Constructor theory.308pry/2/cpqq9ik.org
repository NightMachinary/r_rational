I am distrustful of a new way to explain things that is not well explained. It's not like there's a law that whatever constructor theory does has to also work on itself, but absent an explanation of why not, I'm left wondering.

I like the idea of approaching the explanation of science as a thing that could be improved upon. The basic calculus explanation of kinematics - integrate acceleration twice, name the constants, done - is something that wasn't available to Newton. The modern syntax for writing all these equations is much easier than Newton's too, and came much later. I just learned about the [[http://su3su2u1.tumblr.com/post/107024697433/more-classical-physics-of-paths][path integral version of this]], which is completely inside out from high school physics, and that's interesting. I think new versions of this sort of explanation are possible - still rigorous mathematics, but perhaps describing the system in terms of a different part of it, and maybe using something outside of what we currently think of mathematical notation.

Categorizing things in terms of what is possible is interesting. I don't think doing it qualitatively gets anywhere - that just becomes a massive list of examples. I think I'd be looking for something like an inequality. For example, f(0) is a comet's purely elliptical, stable orbit. f(x) is the set of all possible paths the comet could take if x energy was applied to it at any point in its orbit. Compare f(x) to e(0), Earth's orbit, and solve for the lowest x where there's a collision. The formal versions of all of these constructs would be very interesting.

I don't know if I'd use a system like that if I was going to try to tackle "does quantum chromodynamics lead to elephants." I think I would be looking for a formalized way to deal with what kinds of abstractions are allowed from more fundamental laws of physics. For things like Newton vs Einstein, we can just plug "v << c" into all the equations and get Newtonian mechanics back out. We're not actually sure exactly how the latest versions of the standard model lead to atoms with a few shells of orbiting electrons, but by the time we scale up to chemistry that approximation is almost always good enough. Why does that work? What's the "v << c" equivalent here, when we're dealing with something that has this many moving parts? Again, I think that's an interesting tool to look for.
