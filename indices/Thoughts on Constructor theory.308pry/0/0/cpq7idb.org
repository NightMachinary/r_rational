Notes:

- I also feel that their understanding of scientific opinion of evolution may be lacking (a typical physicist, thinks they know all other fields), but being a physics student myself I'm not sure.

- I also believe that we have a reasonable description of quantum thermodynamics including the second law so I'm not certain about that section. But I'm not an expert in that area.
