Praes can kinda be safely put on the backburner for now, for a few reaons.

The Legions-in-Exile are stationed by the Blessed isle to prevent an invasion, and all of Malicia's spies are about to be outed thanks to Scribe (who kinda let the earlier round of assassinations happen, through inaction). So Malicia can't strike out by invasion or assassination.

Praes is also very much not in a fight shape. They lost the warlock, two of their largest cities, the goblins are rebelling, and the Highlords are no longer as afraid of Malicia without Black and most of his legions to keep them in line. She can't get arms/munitions from the goblins or count on the dwarves since they have an agreement with Cat not to do business with any nation at war with Callow.

Malicia still has a couple WMDs lying around in the Tower, but if she starts using those against Callow she's kinda screwed because it'll put her as the greater of two evils in Cat's story. Not to mention they're running out of food (in her last POV chapter she mentions having to open the imperial granaries to feed people, or there'll be a revolt) and destroying Callow means they can't take over their food production.
