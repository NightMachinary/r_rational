The problem is, Cordelia is practically revered by her government at the moment, Rozalas potential supporters are all gone, and Royals herself seems to be of the opinion that Cordelia has got it handled. If Rozala doesn't become the main general of the Procter forces in the north, that would be dumb, but she does not have the support to do anything apart from military matters so being in charge of the nation would just limit her ability to act.
