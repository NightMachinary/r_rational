Man it still would be soooo easy for Cat to place Princess Rozala at the head of Procer. I mean yeah it would go against most of her morals and probably lead to her downfall but Gods would it be nice for the leader of Procer to be completely and utterly focused on stopping the Dead King. It's probably not going to happen, but man can you imagine?
