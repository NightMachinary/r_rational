Is it just me or is there no way Callow should be able to wage war against the Dead King?

Like, the drow, definitely, they have their back against the wall here. And Catherine could probably act as a general, coordinate the drow with the other alliance forces. She could maybe even spare a few shock troops.

But the bulk of her troops, and most of the Woe? They need to get back to Callow /soon/. The last time Catherine & co stayed on campaign for an extended period, Malicia had half their government assassinated. Their granaries are already running on fumes, and they're about to support the entire Proceran war effort. Any sabotage attempt by the Empire will leave Callow starving.

So with that in mind, I really don't see how Cat could afford to be fighting on two fronts.
