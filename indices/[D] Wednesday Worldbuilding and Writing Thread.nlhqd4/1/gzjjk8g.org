The thing I'm writing backstory for (aka The Thing I'll Probably Never Actually Write) involves, at one point, the main character getting transported to a San Francisco that has never had human habitation. (Also, it's an Earth without global warming.)

Does anyone know of good sources for what the greater SF Bay Area would look like in that kind of scenario? I'm a lay person but vaguely able to follow the more technical ecological models by virtue of scientists in the family, but I prefer not to unless needed.
