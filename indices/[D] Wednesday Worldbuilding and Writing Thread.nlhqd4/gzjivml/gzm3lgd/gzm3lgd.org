I think it'd work to think through the different ways that a group of multiversal nations can interact, select all the ones that are distinct enough to be interesting (being more picky the less the story as a whole is about this), then back-fit the nations mentioned in the story to be enough to cover every relationship you selected. It doesn't really matter how many multiverses/nations are in the setting as a whole, since a story is only going to be able to cover the ones you found interesting. And the conveying a sense of complexity to the reader is going to rely on how structurally distinct the situations you describe are, more than how many total moving parts there are.

Going through all the axes I can think of that this would vary by:

- Under the realist model of international relations, states are normally under a state of international anarchy, except in some cases where there's a single hegemonic power (the US recently), or two (the US versus the USSR). What model describes the current state for this subset of nations? Is the nation the hegemon or along for the ride?
- Is this nation weak or strong relative to its neighbors and rivals?
- Is the relationship in question between two neighboring nations on the same Earth, two of the same nation on parallel Earths, a nation and the parallel of one that it also has a relationship with, or a parallel nation where its same-Earth counterpart is irrelevant? For the parallel ones, are these different from their counterparts?
- Innumerable friend-of-friend-of-enemy permutations.
- Nations may band together to form trade organizations and other intergovernmental organizations. Are they on the same Earth, different, between redundant copies of the same nation on parallel earths?
- Does the nation in question actually go along with the international community's plans?
- Nations aren't actually real things that make decisions, they borrow the decision-making of the people with power within the nation. Are the nation's internal power structures actually in alignment on the issue in question? It's plausible for any of formal government, ceremonial government, the actual bureaucrats who make up the government, the police, the military, trade organizations, unions, powerful companies or industries, whoever controls the media, political parties, and religious organizations, to end up running contrary to one another.

There's about 5000 permutations of the above questions without digging into the really picky ones.

And finally, a situation as complex as multiversal politics is going to be beyond any person or organization's ability to keep track of. There's always room for a radical upheaval because of something that happened between two nations you've never thought about before. So I'd recommend pulling that, at least once.
