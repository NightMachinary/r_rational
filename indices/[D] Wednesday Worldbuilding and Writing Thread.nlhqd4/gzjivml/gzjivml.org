One of the big problems with a multiverse, at least from a writing perspective, is that you wouldn't expect it to be Earth 1 and Earth 2 entering into negotiations or relations with each other, at least not if they had more than a single portal or trading spot that was well within a single powerful country's borders. The organizational level for governments, at least on this Earth, isn't on the world level, it's on the nation-state level, and why wouldn't that continue if there was more than one world?

From a writing perspective, this makes things a lot more difficult, because everything gets a lot more complicated, even if you're dealing with only two Earths. The United States 1 has relations with United States 2 /and also/ all the nations of its own Earth /and also/ all the nations of the other Earth. By adding a second Earth, you've exponentially increased the number of relationships between nations you, as an author, have to deal with.

I've tried sketching out multiverse stories a bit in the past, and what really draws me to them is that level of complexity. Limiting the scope to a single person or handful of people who can move between Earths is, therefore, not really what I want to do, even if that's the obvious solution.

At some level, full interface between all these nations would just be impossible, so some higher level of cooperation or organization would need to happen, at least if you started adding in more Earths with their own nations. In Jet Li's /The One/, there are ~125 Earths, and at that point, you'd need an entire army of ambassadors, lawyers, etc. to handle them all, more than most nations would be equipped to deal with or track. Clumping up, either by having rating or advisory agencies, or by nations entering into unions or clusters with each other, seems like it would be natural.

It's a thorny problem though, and I'm looking for, possibly, some insight or advice on how best to do it, with a view to writing a story that's at least a little bit about interuniversal relationships, intrigue, border control, and crunchy stuff like that, hopefully without needing a thirty page exposition dump that bores readers to tears, and hopefully without driving myself down an unending research or worldbuilding hole.
