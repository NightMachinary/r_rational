Well, considering it's alternate universes... what about the answer being "All of them"? Each earth has its own different concept of what a nation state is, and how to group others. There's some very rare earths that in response to an outside larger context managed to unite, or at least group for the purpose of cross universe coordination, and are dealt with as just "Earth 1" etc. There are some that are just utter chaos and insist to try to do it the naive way with armies of diplomats. There's a group of ~20 earths that diverged after these alternates were known of, and the governments managed to not split so there's a single "United states" with a single president but 20 copies of each territory and person, acros them, and each country has it's own entity like that. There's that one empire that started as a single nation on a single earth, conquered territory on a few other earths, used the resources from that to conquer the rest of it's own earth, and by now controls several other earths. There are some earths that try to limit multiverse interaction, and lump all organizations on all other earths together into a single entity equivalent to a single nation state on that one earth. There are anarchist earths where the concept of a nation state was never invented. There are earths that diverged so long ago that none of their nationstates correspond in any way to any found on any other earth. There are earths that had no humans when contact was established, and a hundred thousand different organizations from all kind of different earths are opening their own portal to it and trying to lay claim to it and it's biodiversity resources. Some group up in big loose alliances, like the EU, acros multiple world but still considered distinct states. Some treat other earths as if they were simulations, only there to steal intellectual property from. etc.
