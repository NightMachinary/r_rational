I think an interesting way of dealing with the porosity problem would be introducing a (possibly externalizable) negative consequence for the use of portals. E.g., perhaps there is a very low (but non-zero) chance of a Destabilization Event every time a portal is used. More portals means a correspondingly linear increase in chance of a DE, and the damage caused by the DE scales geometrically with the size of the collapsed portal.

This means that countries willing to take bigger risks get bigger rewards and get ahead in the interuniversal marketplace, but also either the populace pays for the costs of the destruction, or else that cost is externalized somehow (e.g. governments paying (or invading) third world nations for real estate which will all eventually become unusable and uninhabitable as DEZs stack up.) If portal locations all line up 1:1, the omnipresent threat of DEs complicates the real estate issue further, because the resulting DEZ will take real estate off the board on both Earths.

What I'd naively expect to see evolve from this is a centralized governing entity made up of those nation-states and corporations who found the most convenient ways to externalize the costs of DEs to move resources around better than their competitors.

Also the Internet, after some panicking to resolve address and namespace collisions, should settle back down to being the Internet again, and the Internet should just be one functional interuniversal internet. As long as there are valid routes advertised, one should be able to access google.com.earth1, google.com.earth29, etc.
