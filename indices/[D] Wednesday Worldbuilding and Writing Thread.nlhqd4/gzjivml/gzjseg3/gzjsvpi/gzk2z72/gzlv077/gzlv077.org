What /does/ Lesotho think of Liberia? Do they have any diplomatic relations? Does it /matter/ to the day-to-day lives of people in Egypt?

And those are all on the same continent.

I suspect that most inter-universal international dialogue will be at a kind of long distance - especially at first. If the universes are /close/, then Egypt #1 is not going to have much trade (at least at first) with Egypt #2, simply because they have the same surpluses and needs. In fact, they might wind up very quickly in fierce /competition/ with each other, trying to steal away each other's trading partners.

America #1 might decide that it likes England #2, where Candidate X won the election, a lot more than England #1, where Candidate Y won; and they might start... /nudging/ things in the direction of Candidate X winning the next election.

It also strikes me that if there are /enough/ parallel worlds, then there may well be a world where the Monster Raving Loony Party won an election in England...
