I feel like it depends on how accessible inter-world communication is. In Gate (LN/manga/anime), only Japan has access to the portal, at least initially. It gives them quite the negotiation advantage versus their peers in their own world, and allows for smaller scale diplomacy (e.g. other countries deal only through Japan, and thus lack direct diplomatic connections with the other world). It also raises the interesting question regarding how the rest of the world would tolerate such a monopoly, and whether sanctions would be levvied against her (possibly pointless if the otherworldly connections are strong enough for Japan to stand alone) or if she'd even be declared war upon.

Is it even obvious that people would cluster/ally with other countries in the same dimension? If portals are plentiful, I would expect America #1 to join with America #2 rather than with China #1. Assuming they really are parallel univerises, the Americas would have much more in common with each other. Depending on how well they mesh, it could even be possible for a union of Americas #1-99 to attempt to conquer the multiverse one dimension at a time; multiverse portals would certainly facilitate a mutual pooling of resources literally orders of times greater than we can in the real world. Even a mere 1% of such a coalitions GDP could accomplish huge things, if put to some common cause.
