I would also recommend [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_Without_Us][The World Without Us]], or at least a look into the distribution of Pleistocene fauna in North America. A world where San Francisco has never had human habitation is most likely a world where North America was never colonized by Europeans or Palaeo-Americans, which has huge implications for the survival of Ice Age megafauna.
