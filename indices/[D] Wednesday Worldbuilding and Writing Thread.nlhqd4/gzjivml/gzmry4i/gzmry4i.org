Not a direct answer, but the show Counterpart on Amazon Prime gets into some detail imagining the international/interdimensional border authority and quarantining, drawing on, I imagine, the Cold War era East/West boundary. It offers a perspective on an aspect of parallel worlds that is more often glossed over and seems close to what you're interested in.
