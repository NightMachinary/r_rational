Take #1: porous borders, single source of population. This is the Stephen Baxter (+terry pratchett?) Long Earth series. Physical boundaries are easily bypassed by shifting a few Earths over and walking around there. People rarely bother to go very far out because they are spreading out from Earth. It's frontier, and there's not much reason to keep going. I could envision the this turning into a more sparsely settles, feudal or corporate hierarchy hundreds of years down the line, where your Earth-1 counterpart is much less important to you than your other Earth-N and N+-1 counterparts who bother to come over. This allows for long chains of relations where no one polity has to track many relationships (unless they're very close to the home earth).

Idea #2: Porous borders between separately developed Earths. I suspect nations would change radically in this scenario. The implied high mobility makes this very different from our real world age of colonization since you can just pop back to the home islands or wherever when you get bored. Seems incredibly chaotic to write---perhaps it would work as an episodic setting? In /Rick and Morty/ or /Doctor Who,/ the staggering complexity of the cosmos gets visited in tiny slices (usually). You get callbacks and old enemies but also get to duck in to a separate polity, and they're always populated by a bunch of different aliens and governments.

Idea #3: contact choke point. Either one nation got portals first and snowballed into one-world domination, or a corporation restricts it, or it requires government-scale energy expenditure. Then it's reasonable to have a chilling effect on how much contact is done. This might be analogous to hard sci fi with slow space travel like an actual light speed limit. Getting to another earth requires navigating a buraeuacracy and paying the right fees, so less people bother making one hop, let alone worrying about what their neighbor's neighbor's neighbor is doing. I think sufficient expense or restriction of access would get the most Real World scenario. Most countries in our Earth don't have a consulate in every other nation, do they? They talk to their neighbors and their historical rivals and the local superpower. I could see something similar for a multiverse.
