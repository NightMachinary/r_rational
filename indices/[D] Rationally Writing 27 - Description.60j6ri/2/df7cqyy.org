There is one character introduction I read quite a while ago in a captivating book called /The Raw Shark Texts/. I can't speak about the book as a whole, since I didn't get very far into it before losing it while moving apartments, but here is the description of the main character's therapist:

#+begin_quote
  Dr Randle was more like an electrical storm or some complicated particle reaction than a person. A large clashing event of a woman whose frizzy hack job of white-brown hair hummed against a big noisy blouse which, in turn, strobed in protest against her tartan skirt. She had strontium grey eyes which crackled away to themselves behind baggy lids. She made the air feel doomy, faintly radioactive. You half expected your ears to pop.

I love it because it's essentially a rundown of physical appearance, but done in a way that is fun to read. It's also woven into descriptions of her and her actions that come later in the same passage:

#+begin_quote
  "Right then." She thunderclapped her hands.
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  She leaned forward, big blotchy forearms on big tartan knees.

The description is a bit wacky, so I'm not sure how much place it has in rational fiction, but it grabbed my attention to the point that it's one of my strongest memories from that book. I loved how it weaves her personality and presence into more mundane descriptions of her physical appearance. I think most mediocre writers would find a way of saying "here's what she's wearing. By the way, she's also eccentric."
