Yeah, I've definitely been trying to put a critical eye toward how much of our episodes are spent slipping into "two dudes talking" and how much is spent on "substance." At the very least, our "two dudes talking" is still about books and writing in general, but I'd still like to make it a bit crunchier.

The previous episode on RPGs was a bit off the mark there, but I'm glad this one is more focused.

As for rational writing vs regular writing, that's another thing that we don't always bring up, but to be fair some of the topics really don't have much to say on the distinction. Description is one of them, I think.

Thanks for the feedback, and for listening!
