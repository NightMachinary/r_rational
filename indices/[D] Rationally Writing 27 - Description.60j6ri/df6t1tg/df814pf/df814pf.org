I apologize for not being more proactive with my feedback, but I have felt for a while now that episodes more focussed on the writing techniques are vastly more interesting.\\
Sometimes there are all these different relevant examples you mention that I might not have read and/or not care about that fill up the majority of the time. I don't /mind/ hearing your opinions on different works but personally I'm here for a discussion about writing and not about written works if that makes sense. I understand the use of examples obviously, but it feels like you lose track sometimes maybe?\\
Also while not always applicable I would prefer a more explicit mentioning of how rational works use the subject. For example do rational writers use more or less descriptions? Would there be more focus on thoughts and dialogue to express information? As rational writers your writing advice implies the context for rational works, but it can sound more as how things are done in general. And if what you are saying isn't about objectively good writing and only from a rational point of view, it would still be interesting to shortly mention other styles.

To more specifically answer the feedback question, I would say this episode was indeed one of the better ones and the next topic also sounds interesting.
