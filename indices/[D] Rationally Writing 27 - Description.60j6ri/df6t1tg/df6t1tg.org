Hey everyone, this week we explore the differences between good description and bad description, and analyze examples of descriptions from novels.

I think this might be one of my favorites so far, from a perspective of how focused the discussion is on (hopefully) useful aspects. Curious to know if others feel the same way, so any feedback is welcome!

Before we start, we'd like to thank [[https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php][Scrivener]] for sponsoring the show. Scrivener is a writing app that I've been using for about four years now. I've written four novels and two novellas with it, along with half a dozen works-in-progress. After a long time of trying various word processing and writing programs, Scrivener is the best that I've found.

The organizing power of Scrivener makes it easy to wrangle a story with dozens of unique characters and multiple interwoven plots, which combines with a fast and intuitive interface that makes character dossiers and chapter outlines just a key command away. Adding to this is a powerful export suite that allows for a Scrivener file to be turned into a wide variety of digital formats with just a few clicks.

If you want to try it out, they offer a free 30-day trial, and if you decide to buy it and help support the show, you can use the code RATIONALLY during the month of March to get 20% off. Hope you find it useful!
