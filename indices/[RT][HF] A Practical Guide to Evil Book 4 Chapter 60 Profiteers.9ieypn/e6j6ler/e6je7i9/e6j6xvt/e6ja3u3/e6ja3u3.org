Since Refuge is considered a Kingdom Under protectorate, I'd be surprised if they attempted to separate Archer from her bow. Ranger clearly has a deal with them and this would likely extend to her pupil's and gifts from Ranger.

Given they've paid Callow enough to raise an army >>> non dread empire palace and also forgone profits for 5 years with the Crusade, I don't think they'll baulk at the bow - no artefact can be worth the simple economies of scale.
