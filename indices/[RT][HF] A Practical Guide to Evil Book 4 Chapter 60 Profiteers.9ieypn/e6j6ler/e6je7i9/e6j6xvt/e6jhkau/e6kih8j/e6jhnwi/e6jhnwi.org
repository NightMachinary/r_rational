Personally, I would have asked for:

1) Callow can buy Dwarf weapons at 10% discount for 5 years with right of resale

2) Everyone else gets price hike: 2.5x current price for at least 5 years

3) Anyone at war with Callow can eat 10x price for the next 5 years

time limit not announced until it is over.

â€‹

Then proceed to be an arms merchant, selling dwarf weapon to other countries at 2x price.
