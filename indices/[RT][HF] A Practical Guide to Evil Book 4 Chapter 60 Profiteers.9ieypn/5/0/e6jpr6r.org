She kinda achieved that by proxy since:

​

The Dwarves aren't going to be selling to anyone else (Price has technically increased 10x fold, as any surfacepower with stockpiles of Dwarfish weaponry will note that the supply has been cut off).

​

Cat is the only one who can buy Dwarfish weaponry (which will quickly depreciate, as not every weapons maker will get the memo in time to stop current production lines. Suddenly there's a sudden stockpile of weapons with no buyers, except Callow. That stockpile is bound to be massive, since the Dwarves were planning the 14th expansion to take a century and be extremely costly in dwarfpower and weaponry. Suddenly the war ends in about 2 weeks with relatively no causalities, all those weapons will just be sitting around, doing nothing. Price has effectively 0.75x modifier.)

​

I kinda want to see Cord's face when Cat shows up with a stockpile of Dwarven weaponry right after the embargo goes into effect. Double points if the phrase "Just as planned" is used.
