Is it just me, or is it a little weird how easily Cat can break past the language barrier and have smooth, nuanced negotiations with people who would have had no reason to learn her language? Like, I can give the Seeker a pass, since he's described as a traveler. But how is the Herald that fluent? He explicitly has had no contact with the surface for over a century. His Miezan should be awkward and academic, he should be missing neologisms and tripping Cat up with his weird accent. Same thing for the drows, with the added malus that Cat hasn't had much practice in Chantant. (also it's a ridiculously painful language)

Also, while I'm nitpicking, is a weapon ban going to hamper the crusade that much? The troops are already mobilized, they've probably bought all the weapons they need.
