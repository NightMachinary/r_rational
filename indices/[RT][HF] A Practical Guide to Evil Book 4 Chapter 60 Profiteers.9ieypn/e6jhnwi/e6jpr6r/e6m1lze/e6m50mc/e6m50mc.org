Ok, so lets look at the players that have the resources and means of moving Dwarfish weaponry. Gnomes will not be considered because they have a defined role in "Technological Gatekeepers" and this would be several deviations from the norm.

Places AT WAR with Callow, thus disqualified (and have to pay massive markup from other powers):

Procer

Ashur

Levant

​

Neutral* Powers, we can evaluate on case per case:

Dead King - Is in alliance with Praes, and is actively planning on invading Procer. Nessy, like Black, doesn't seem to be in the business of fighting "fair" or giving his opponents advantages. *Won't Sell*

Mercantis - The moment they figure out what is going on, which is instantously since the annoucment is being exported via them, they are the ones who will immediately start price gouging. *Will Sell at +2x markup (probs 10x)*

League of Cities - Heirarch is making a point of being no friend to "Wicked Foreign Despots", so he isn't going to sell on principle, and the rest of the league will follow his example. Even then, Tyrant is probably going to invade someone, so he's probably going to be in the buyers market too. *Won't Sell, will create demand.*

Gigantes - It's been firmly established that the Giants will never do anything to help Procer. Also, Magicks is their thing, so they likely won't have large stockpiles lying around. *Won't/Can't Sell.*

Praes* - Tricky, Malica may try to contain Nessy by funding/supplying Procer soldiers to die on that front, but she is no friend to Hasenbach, and it seems unlikely they would even have the diplomatic channels to discuss such a thing (Malica had to send a delegation to Keter, who is a sort of ally, its less likely there is a mode of communication between Praes-Procer)

The thing that ultimately kills this supply is logistics. How can Malica even get weapons (in significant numbers) westward?

- Mercantis probably would outright buy then markup the weapons.
- All major naval powers are at war with her. Cordelia cannot weather the political fallout from making treaty with the enemy.
- Northern land route would require going through the Golden Bloom (LOL, no), or an extremely slow and costly route through the Everdark either Keter (if she somehow get Nessy to sign on, probably won't) or Chain of Hunger which is even farther logistics wise.
- Southern land route would require going through Waning Woods (Probably not happening) or going through Free City territory, which Tyrant may not let go through, or Heirarch outright ban.

*Can't Sell, even if it wanted to*

​

Friendly Powers, unlikely to sell weapons to Hasenbach:

Callow - Cat can either leverage this into forcing Hasenbach to sign the Liesse Accords, Pay a massive surcharge to fund Callow through the Crusade, or just let Procer burn (unlikely to let it completely let it burn down to ashes, but probably let fry on a skillet for a while). *Will Sell under Heavy Conditions (might as well be 10x markup)*
