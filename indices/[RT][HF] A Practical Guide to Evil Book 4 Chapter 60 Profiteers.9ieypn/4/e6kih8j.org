This was easily my favorite chapter since 38 (the start of the murder plot in Keter).

I can't praise EE enough (or the dwarves, in universe) for the elegance of the sudra ritual. It's a perfect way to ensure the meal and negotiations don't interrupt each other, since letting the sudra seep is the perfect time to talk, and drinking it ends both the meal and the negotiations. It also managed to convey that the dwarves were invested, since Cat is one of less than 12 humans /ever/ to taste it served right, and even Balasi, a close friend of an important dwarven Named, reveres the drink. That's a lot of storytelling to fit in a bottle of booze.

I wonder about these bits:

  “She is more monster than woman now,” Balasi said. “She devoured the Twilight Sages, it is said, and made them into the first of the Night. She has only grown since: her hand is on every knife, her lips wet with every red bite.”

  " Yet if someone killed the Priestess of Night,” I said. “The Gloom would end.

This description of the Sve sounds, to me, a lot like the Deoraithe gestalt, just with more of a guiding will to it. It also says a couple of important things about the Night--first, that it had nothing to do with the Drow Empire's original success, and second, that it's apparently some sort of sorcerous construct, not something that was just around, like the fae. That could be /really/ useful, as a means of training and education (though I doubt, for narrative reasons, that they'll get that kind of boost.)

The second bit implies, at least by Cat's understanding, that the Sve is either inseparable from, or actively sustaining the Gloom. Especially with Cat's earlier observation that the Gloom seemed very much like a domain, it's a bit concerning for the upcoming battle.
