Hey! Thanks for leaving an opinion, I appreciate you taking the time.

What are you specifically not liking? The fact I comment at all, the fact that I don't use spoiler tags, or is it when I talk about future chapters being good or having a/the climax?

Or is it my golden retriever puppy level of excitement for everything I've ever done, which I'm sure isn't to everyone's taste?
