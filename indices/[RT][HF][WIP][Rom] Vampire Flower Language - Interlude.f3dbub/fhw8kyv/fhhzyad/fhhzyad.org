This is just a real quickie about the janissaries (vampire servants) and why they do what they do. No "discussion questions" this time, no feedback sought: this is just a "hey, new content posted" notification.

RE the janissaries: I really wanted to make sure they were all distinct, rather than a formless blob of "plot". So we have:

- Victor, who has no time for any of this shit. Today he'd be the one sharing memes about how millennials only know how to twerk and be bisexual, while still needing them every time he lost the facebook icon by accidentally moving it to the second screen of his iphone. Now I guess he's whining that the greatest generation only knows how to buy war bonds and make clothing out of flour bags?
- Odette is just here for the wrong reasons. She's trying to impress someone; it doesn't seem to be working. She's destined to be one of the janissaries who ends up in a bad way.
- Jacques and Florence Rigal are part of what is a pretty common arrangement for vampires who don't want to be pestered finding a new janissary every 40 or 50 years when the old one dies: just get the family to present you with new candidates. Their craft is never specified but I imagine it being some sort of wood-working/furniture making.

This is about as much focus as they have (there is, I believe, a bechdel-test passing conversation next chapter), so enjoy this bonus, completely irrelevant information that I may declare non-canon if for some reason Odette's reasons for being a janissary become plot important in an idea we have in the future.

ANYWAY, HYPE FOR NEXT CHAPTER

Next chapter is relatively short (about half the length of other chapters) BUT IT IS THE CLIMAX. It is GOOD. My editor basically said she got chills. And the interlude after it is *italian chef kissing fingers* perfect. I'll post them together for this reason (probably with 24 hour cool off).
