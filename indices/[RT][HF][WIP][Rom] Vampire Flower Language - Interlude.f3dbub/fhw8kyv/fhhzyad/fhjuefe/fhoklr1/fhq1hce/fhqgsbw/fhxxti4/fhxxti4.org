All good. I'll try to do some sort of balance between putting stuff behind spoilers / "DISCUSSION QUESTION" gates. It's really wonderful to know people care, so feel free to order me around like your willing servant! :)

Yeah, I believe in death of the author, so I'm sorry I wasn't dead for you like I should have been. Until such time as the text contradicts something, every interpretation is canon as far as I'm concerned. (We-the-author-team have been known to ship, like, a lot. Though you'll pull *my* OTPs out of my cold dead fingers).
