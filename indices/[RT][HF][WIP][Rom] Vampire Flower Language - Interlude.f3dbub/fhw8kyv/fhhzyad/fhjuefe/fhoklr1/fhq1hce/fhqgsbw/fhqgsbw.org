Anticipating future chapters contents. We've had interactions in the past where you've disclosed future information too. It's fine, it just lowers my hype for future chapters.

Last chapter you asked me whether I think William had done mind control on Red, which I hadn't seriously considered outside of the specific instance where I thought it was likely and, though I recognise in that context I was providing authorial feedback, you gave me the answer as to how I was wrong. I'm not bothered exactly, I just prefer to avoid a trend.

Edit: To be clear, I don't think it's important to avoid ALL spoilers, but I do think you would benefit from not posting spoilers unless it benefits the story or the reader. I was happy to help at the time, but would like to avoid information about upcoming plot points (even knowledge that the plot points are short or perfect)
