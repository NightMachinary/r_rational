I'm going to try and take apart your second example, best I can. Step one would be to do some statistics to find out what some percentile's value is, eg., what score is better than 90%, 95%, or 99% of the expected players. This means you /should/, in a world with perfect statistics, win about that percent of the time. Your goal will be to reach whatever margin that is. Say, for instance, the 95% is $500, your goal is to reach that and then stop because you then have a 95% chance at winning, or so. There is an optimization to be done, how likely is it to reach that goal vs how much does it improve your victory odds. You are 100% sure you can get to $100, but that's the 50% (example, all numbers complete conjecture), $200 you can get with 50% odds (roulette and bet on odds, close enough to 50), but would put you in the 75%, which drastically increases your chance of winning.

These bets are off when it comes to poker. If you are good at poker (or the card game of your choice) you increase the %victory. Hypothetical poker whiz could get $200 80% the time, allowing his optimization equation shoot him up the percentiles, as his victories are easier and he has less risk to these higher victory chances. This also changes your paradigm, you are forced to likewise compete upwards, or else he would take it.

Finally, the buzzer beater strategy. If you made the $500 you planned but you see someone with $900 going to cache her chips, you can't win with that $500. This is the strategy I think has the most promise. You trade off a guaranteed loss for a 50/50 chance at winning by making one last bet (given that $900 is the best). If you know the score to beat, find the best odds to top it and do it. Even a 1/4 chance to quadruple your chips at last second to overcome the person with $1900 is a good bet because all failures are equal failures here.

There is probably all sorts of gamey prisoners dilemma you can do here, hiding chips, displaying lots to force others to take high-risk bets, pooling with another player for split payoffs, but I haven't the slightest on how to start.

TL/DR: Guess how much you think the winner will make, find the best odds to get just above that. This isn't chip optimization, this is optimizing for one more chip than the next best.
