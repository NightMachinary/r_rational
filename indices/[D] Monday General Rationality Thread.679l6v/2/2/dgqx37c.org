It's relatively easy to do this out for the game Memory if you (ironically) assume perfect recall of revealed cards. Sometimes deliberately turning over a previous card is a good idea because it denies your opponent more information. The optimal strategy when you want to maximize expected score is different from the optimal strategy when you want to maximize probability of having a higher score than your opponent. Just do out a simple dynamic programming thing in your favorite programming language.
