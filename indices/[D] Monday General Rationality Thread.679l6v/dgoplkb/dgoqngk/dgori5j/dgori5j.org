I've always looked upon the "fixed point" theory as more of a "normalisation" theory. You can, of course, get used to nearly anything, whether that be suddenly being confined to a wheelchair or winning the lottery. But all things being equal, I imagine it is entirely possible to change your overall quality of life---I'm quite confident that a hypothetical man would have an overall cheerier life if he were fully able than if he was confined to a wheelchair halfway through his life. Even just imagining day-to-day life; one will have periodic thoughts of "if only this hadn't befallen me, x activity would be possible or far easier," which won't happen to someone fully able. This seems to suggest that the disability does negatively impact the life to some degree.

But perhaps I'm talking in circles and begging the question.

Also, I'm sorry to hear that you suffered through depression, but it seems that you're doing better now---at least I hope that's the case. If you don't mind me asking, despite the fact that you say a period of your life was not worth living, are you glad that you lived it, even if only so that you are still alive today?
