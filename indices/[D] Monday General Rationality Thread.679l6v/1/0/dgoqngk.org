As long term sufferer from depressions, thats a very easy point to imagine. A big chunk of early 2010s were not worth having lived.

Also cluster headaches - migraines so strong, people with them regularly suicide.

As for being crippled; in the LW memesphere there was for the longest time the notion of "fixed point of happiness", eg even if you were suddenly paralyzed your happiness would soon return to "not too bad" - but then there was some retraction to that, so I dont know what the current state of affairs is.
