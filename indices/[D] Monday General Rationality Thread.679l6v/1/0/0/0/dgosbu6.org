  are you glad that you lived it, even if only so that you are still alive today?

Thats a very typical question I get, usually from people who dont have any depressive tendecies at all. I am not glad I lived it, even though I am happy to exist nowadays.

In a hypothetical time travel scenario I'd gladly erase current me with a more well adjusted one, thats not as scarred and scared as current me. Compared to say, a broken bone or somesuch, a long term depressed spell will leave mental scars.

Does that answer your question?
