I think for me there's a distinction between choosing suicide in the moment, and choosing suicide after careful deliberation. For the latter, it would just mean that the set of plausible futures that involve me dying better fulfill my preferences than the set of plausible futures that don't (maybe with some amount of risk aversion or optimism to reflect uncertainty in my ability to predict the future and reason about what I /really/ want). A decent chunk of my values point to my own pleasure and lack of pain, the joy I feel learning or adventuring or (or living, laughing, loving ;]), so if those were irrevocably barred to me and the rest of my values were unaffected in their probability of satisfaction, I might choose death (especially if /living/ were barred, haha). Likewise, if some other values were better satisfied by my death as to overwhelm the rest (i.e. I'm hale and hearty here) -- if I could heroically sacrifice myself to save those I care about, or something -- then I might choose to die there too.

If I anticipated a great deal of short-term pain and suffering, however, I might wish to precommit to /not/ dying, e.g. via physical restraint. Given freedom of action, however, I might still wish commit suicide in the moment, because the pain will have warped my past values into "stop the pain at all costs" (i.e. it would be my revealed preference). I'd rather be tortured for a minute (followed by full recovery) than die, but during that minute I might still beg for death (if fiction is any judge).

As for where these two points lie (the reasoned point at which I might choose death to spare myself pain and suffering, and the in-the-moment point), IDK, really. If I were rapidly and inevitably degrading from some horrible disease with a fast approaching horizon, I'd probably opt for euthanasia, but if I could expect recovery with some low probability, I'm not sure where that would have to be. Likewise I'm not sure how much pain I'd have to endure to say "yes, I'd rather die than endure that", both in-the-moment and beforehand. I do have what seems to be an abnormally high "happiness set point" and "will to life", though. Hopefully these decisions are never demanded of me!

TBH, I hear about this "life worth living" thing a lot, mostly with respect to entities that can't explicitly reason through and vocalize the decision themselves (e.g. non-human wild animals), and it's always confused me. In some cases I think it's obvious, but in most I do not, especially given how uncertain I am regarding my own preferences. It's also tied into tricky problems of population ethics, though, which I'm also quite uncertain about.
