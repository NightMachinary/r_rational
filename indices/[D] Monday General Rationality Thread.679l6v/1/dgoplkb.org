What with the recent "Unicorn Frappiccino" fiasco, I've heard a lot of references to Harry Potter's Unicorn Blood. Specifically, the line goes, "...you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips." This made me wonder, what is the line you would draw that would make life no longer worth living?

I don't want to die, and living forever sounds pretty good, but if through the ages I were eventually reduced to a blind, deaf husk, unable to move and in constant pain, I would prefer to end my own suffering than sit in an empty void of agony.

But this is an extreme example. Do you agree with the sentiment? Is there anything that you imagine would make you decide life was no longer worth living?
