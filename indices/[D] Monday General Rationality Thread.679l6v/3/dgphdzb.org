I've found manipulating my context has been very helpful for getting me to work harder. For some reason (which I know is well-studied in the literature) being on my computer at home is much less productive than on a laptop in a public library. It's such a silly simple thing but driving 10 minutes to the local university and hopping on a computer there makes me much more productive.

Today's a public holiday though so I'm not going to be able to do that. Going to have to try and self-focus! Wish me luck.
