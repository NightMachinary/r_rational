Hmmm. It looks good in theory, but a suitably crafty President (or other official) can get around large parts of it by naming a scapegoat.

"Say, Joe, did I hear you just say you wanted to wiretap our entire country?"

"What? I never -"

"Horrible idea. I object profusely, but you make excellent arguments. Thomas! We're wiretapping everybody. Joe's idea, so he loses all his privacy. Make it so, people!"

Or, if that fails, a suitably crafty person can avoid the consequences by being the power /behind/ the throne, not taking on the throne himself.
