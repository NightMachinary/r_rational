Good point! It would need to be something self-imposed, in most cases, else it's not clear who the "those directing them" are, if they exist at all. It would be more a standard you hold yourself to, like the Operative at the end (consider also Fisher's aide -- just put the codes in someone you want dead anyway!).

I guess you can have something about the penalties trickling up the chain of command -- if Joe's acting on behalf of somebody's authority, then they should also "suffer" the consequences. And if the first person in the dialogue has no authority over Joe, then they couldn't order him to do anything. OFC there could still be hidden command structures.

For sufficiently high positions, I guess it would be good if they weren't beholden to anybody, or to the nation's public, or only something. The person on the throne could then rid themselves of the powers behind it... but then enforcing the penalties would be difficult. But then I guess the behind-powers could kidnap those close to the on-power in secret, or something. Checks and balances are pretty tenuous!
