I hear you, but I also don't want to supply readers with a version that's crappy or full of grammar errors. Once its in .epub form, I can't edit it further unless I go back in and completely remake the .epub, and that doesn't do anything for the people who already downloaded it. That's all I mean about wanting it to be polished first.

Fall of Oso will be getting an epub version as I edit it. I'm going through chapter by chapter and I'll be adding links to pdf and epub versions when I get that done.

Songs for the Revolution will probably start coming out before the .epub versions of Fall of Oso though, since I'm putting that a bit on the backburner right now. Songs for the Revolution will feature pdf and epub versions available on initial posting, I just need to complete the editing first.

If you're interested in helping edit, I can convert the first few chapters of SftR to epub and throw them at you.

Also, i have no idea how to patreon.
