Unlimited Blade Works / HPMOR crossover fanfic.

Rin summons caster-class HJPEV using her family's invisibility cloak heirloom, certain that she's going to win easily with the best servant. But it turns out Kirei Kotomine still has his caster servant from the last Holy Grail war, a terrifying intelligent wizard just as empty inside as he is, and they've had 10 years to prepare.

(admittedly, I'm not sure how this would work without Kotomine & Quirrell winning in like 5 minutes)
