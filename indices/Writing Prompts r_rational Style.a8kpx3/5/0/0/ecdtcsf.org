Not 11 year old Harry, 110 year old Harry outfitted with all the magitech enhancements he can think of with 100 years to think about it and access to the philosopher's stone, as well as time to learn all the spells a normal wizard might. 10 years might not be enough to make it last longer than 5 minutes the other way.
