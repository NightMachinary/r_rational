Yeah, this is another obvious problem. I imagine to start with, we'd buff kirei's intellect to be on par with quirrell so that (i) they can tolerate each other and (ii) kirei uses a well worded command spell or his knowledge of how servant contracts work to avoid dying immediately and (iii) they can come to be allies of some sort. I think it could work if you have kirei as a quirrell-level master of fate/stay night-lore (which quirrell himself is a novice in).

Of course, ultimately the motivation is "I think this pairing is cute"
