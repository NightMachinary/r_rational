"What else can you do?"

Minnie poured some milk foam into a cat.

Harry scrambled back unthinkingly, backpedalling so fast that he tripped over a stray sack of coffee beans and landed hard on his bottom with a /thwack/. His hands came down to catch himself without quite reaching properly, and there was a warning twinge in his shoulder as the weight came down unbraced.

At once the small image of a tabby cat swirled back into just so much cream and coffee. "I'm sorry, Mr. Potter," said the barista, sounding sincere, though the corners of her lips were twitching upwards. "I should have warned you."

Harry was breathing in short gasps. His voice came out choked. "You can't DO that!"

"It's only a latte," said Minnie. "Caff√® latte, to be exact."

"You poured microfoam into a cat! A /SMALL/ cat! You violated Conservation of Milk! That's not just an arbitrary rule, it's implied by the foam of the espresso! Rejecting it destroys emulsion and then you get milk texturing! And cats are COMPLICATED! A human mind can't just visualise a whole cat's anatomy and, and all the cat cuteness, and what about the /wittle itty bitty whiskers?/ How can you go on /drinking/ if you've got a cute little kitty you'd destroy /every time you took a sip?/

Minnie's lips were twitching harder now. "Practice."

"Practice /isn't enough/ to do that! You'd have to be a god!"

Minnie blinked. "That's the first time I've ever been called /that/."
