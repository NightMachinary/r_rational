Time is bent into a loop that repeats over and over. It will last for a total of 10,000 years.

It normally only lasts an hour, but it can be extended by one second every time you die before reaching the end of the current iteration of the loop. For example, if you die 60 times, then all future loops will last for one hour and one minute.

The goal is to survive to the end with your mind intact.
