For #1, learn stacking techniques, make a cheap deck full of beatsticks/removal (or burn, if it's legal - I don't think it would be, since at 4000 Life Points, -800/1000 spells break the game), the win enough prizes to collect an array of best cards.DEK (around the time, it would've been Chaos Control - with Crush Card Virus added in, since it was legal in the anime). I could see cards like Messenger of Peace or Wave-Motion Cannon being more prevalent, since not every deck runs the silver bullet S/T removal that's essential for getting around those cards.

There was a season in the anime where destruction cards weren't legal. Duel Links metagame shows that in absence of reliable destruction, attack nullifiers (like Windstorm of Etaqua, Enemy Controller) become better.

The anime decks tend to be terrible, with tribute monsters and highly specific underwhelming support everywhere, so a deck like that would sweep shop.

Seguing into more of a ratfic YGO premise...

Depends if you want to either produce an in-universe reason spoiler lists don't exist (making to harder to determine/find what are the "best cards" - given its a much more competitive game in the anime, you could have Governments putting a ban on spoiler lists, or Illustrous Illusions redacting them for going against the spirit of the game), or develop your own metagame (which I think is probably more fun from a creator POV and a reader one, to be honest. You just establish a baseline with whatever real life/Duel Links format you found the most interesting, and include/design decks around that power level).

Or alternatively, since YGO was and always has been a broken mess of a game (part of the allure, really), you could have them play something like Exceed, BattleCON, Innovation instead, but then that's more of a ratfic gaming fic rather than a YGO one (...which does it with YGO's original premise of "any games", so... *shrug*).
