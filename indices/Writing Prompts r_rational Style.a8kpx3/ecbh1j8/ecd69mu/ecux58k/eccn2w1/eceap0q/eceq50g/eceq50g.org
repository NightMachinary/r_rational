  All pokemon are sentient after all, and you have been transported to the world of pokemon in Ghetsis's body.

Daily reminder that N did nothing wrong.

The problem with nearly all "serious" pokemon stories is that you have to overhaul a /lot/ of the setting to have it be vaguely consistent, and end up with the shounen problem of "why don't the high level Pokemon curbstomp the low level Pokemon". It'd probably be less of a problem in this, since N having Zekrom/Rashiram and be unbeatable is a feature and having to politic you way into freeing Pokemon instead of pseudorational "we train in the mountains for 5 years straight and overthrow the government".
