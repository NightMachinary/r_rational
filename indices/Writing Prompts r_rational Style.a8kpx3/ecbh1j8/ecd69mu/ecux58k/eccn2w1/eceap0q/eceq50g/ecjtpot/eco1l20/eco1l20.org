Yeah. Agreed. Part of the reason that I haven't written one myself is because trading card games are too complicated to depict realistically if you're not familiar with them. And if you don't like the game, then trying to write matches can be a huge pain. Which is sad because I had some good ideas for yugioh fic. I mean, I suppose you could replace duel monsters with magic the gathering or something. But then that messes with the ancient egyptian world building, I think. A large part of the premise of yugioh is that the pharaoh has lost his memories and is playing a cursed/enchanted trading card game that reenacts/mimics the battles of his past, after a fashion. And if you use magic the gathering you would need to explain why they are battling using cards instead of fighting like normal planeswalkers. Maybe in the story it could be a cursed game, but it reenacts battles of the past which are integral to the culture of the plane it takes place on, but which has been lost to time. Not sure how that would work.

Although to be fair, too many of the duel monsters in season 1 are medieval fantasy themed rather than ancient egyptian. I think the whole series would have worked better if the ancient egyptian theme was replaced with medieval fantasy, or if more of the duel monsters were egyptian themed.
