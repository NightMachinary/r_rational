First world countries remove citizens from warzones/unstable territory fairly often, nevermind if they're a high ranking military employee in our space program. The answer is either "unmarked black helicopter picks them up" or "mercenary squad which no one looks too far into picks them up". US department of state even [[https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/what-state-dept-can-cant-do-crisis.html][says]] that they "provide departure assistance" if there is no commercial means of leaving dangerous territory, including "U.S. military or other U.S. government assets" in exceptional situations. Somewhere like North Korea, where we aren't able to do covert rescue ops due to China backing them and have to do prisoner exchanges, isn't the norm.

You could still write a story about an astronaut being held captive by a militia or something, but it's pretty much just be waiting around until the birds come in.
