An 'AIsekai', where an oracle-type artificial intelligence, after its final shutdown, is copied/rescued by the Administrator God of a fantasy realm, and gives it a new task: To calculate the Worth of his World, with a 5% margin of error.

Some years later, a local wizard receives an artifact captured from a group of bandits, the so-called 'Orb of Answers', and is given the task to analyze it in order to check if it is dangerous or not.
