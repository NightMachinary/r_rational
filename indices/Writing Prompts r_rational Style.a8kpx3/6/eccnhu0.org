The Martian, but the failure is during launch from Earth and the crew capsule crash-lands in the ocean during a storm. All personnel but the main character escape the capsule and are rescued; he stays with the capsule's air pocket and oxygen supplies for a few days until the capsule washes up on a deserted tropical island, with all electronics ruined.

He still gets discovered by a satellite operator, but what makes rescue problematic is that he's washed up in disputed territory in the middle of a regional conflict. (Pick whatever makes sense for an orbital launch abort.)
