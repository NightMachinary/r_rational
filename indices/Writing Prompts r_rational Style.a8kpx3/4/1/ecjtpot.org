  HJPEV gets transported to the world of Yugioh, without his magic. What will he do?

I've been thinking a bit about a Yu-Gi-Oh ratfic. The only answer I can find to how that would unfold is that you'd need to carefully study actually clever, surprising yet plausible strategies/decks within a given card set that is accepted as the one existing in the setting of choice (aka: Duel City). Then somehow manage to write a CHILDREN'S CARD GAME (sorry) in a compelling way, while allowing the reader to keep track of which cards are in play, what's the LP score, etc.

If someone has enough knowledge of the game and patience to undertake that work, it would be amazing. But the thought is frankly intimidating.
