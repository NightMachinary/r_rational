1. HJPEV gets transported to the world of Yugioh, without his magic. What will he do?
2. All pokemon are sentient after all, and you have been transported to the world of pokemon in Ghetsis's body.
3. Legend of Zelda, except that Ganondorf is the good guy and Link and Zelda are evil.
4. Deconstructed time travel romance fic, like, what would happen if the protagonist of such a story was actually smart?
5. Rational romance period. Tell the story of a healthy romantic relationship between two smart sensible characters, and make it interesting.
6. This one might not be possible to give the rational treatment but I thought some people here might like it: Someone is stuck in a groundhog day scenario which will not end until they have written an original zombie story with an angle that has not already been tried.
