When AlphaZero detects that they are winning, it effectively starts producing garbage moves, just to hold its advantage. When you see this, you generally know you've lost, but you don't know why. A win is a win to it after all. The utility function doesn't take into consideration the margin of victory, merely the fact of it.

I'd really love to see something like this emerge in rationalist fiction.

On one hand, it could make for a nice explanation of why the transhumanly smart AI seemingly does stupid things mid-plot, and still crushes humanity, or why the humans even /seem/ to have a fighting chance at all, despite the overwhelming superiority of the opposition.

On the other and given could be leveraged by plucky protagonists acting in a sufficiently out-of-model fashion to defeat an at least marginally technically superior foe if you want to go with a more standard Hollywood trope.
