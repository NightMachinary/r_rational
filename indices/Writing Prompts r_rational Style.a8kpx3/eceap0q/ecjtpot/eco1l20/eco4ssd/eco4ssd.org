The way it's supposed to work, I think, is that the monsters were 'bound' to the cards by the Pharaoh and his priests, whereas they used to exist and roam freely. So in a way if you play, say, Blue Eyes White Dragon what you're really doing is tapping a fraction of the power of the /real/ BEWD who lies trapped beyond space and time or whatever. As such the games are themselves pale reflections of the summoners battles of old, with the non insignificant benefit that they don't destroy the world any more. However they remain magically binding, which is why you can wager your soul on them, or use them to force an opponent to do what you want. In the so-called 'season 0' part of the story (before the card game gets even introduced) we see that the Pharaoh inside Yugi's body does this multiple times: he challenges someone at a game, /any/ game, and establishes an ante. If they break their part of the deal after losing, then the penalty kicks in, and that's usually them losing their mind or soul. The Pharaoh is quite hardcore and doesn't fuck around.

I think there is potentially a really interesting setting in there. You could even justify the variety of the monsters as them being 'archetypes' that belong to the human collective imagination and transcend time (a bit like Servants in Fate). It's just that actually designing and depicting the games would be such a pain. I played the game, mainly in virtual form, including recently on Duel Links. But early game had too few cards to create gripping strategies without all the fuckery that happens in the anime, and currently the game has /so many/ cards it's impossible to keep track of them all. You can of course just rely on established meta, but at that point you're not really creating anything especially original, most likely.
