I just realized how the HPMOR/Gurren Lagann crossover works. I've been trying to cast the Defence Professor as Kamina, and Harry as Simon. But that's not how the story works.

Harry is Kamina, Draco is Simon, Hermione is Nia, The Defense Professor is the first-arc opponent, /Snape/ is Viral. The timeskip is the ensuing seven years of Hogwarts. But who, or what, is the Anti-Spiral?
