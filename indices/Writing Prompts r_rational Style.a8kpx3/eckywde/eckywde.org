A ROB whith humanlike mind is bored and uses his powers to summon whatever human will make him have more fun from the set of all computable universes (or maybe just from a really big multiverse) into a cliche isekai fantasy world.

The Rob knows this is dangerous but still decides to do it, thinking that completely isolating himself from that world except from being able to see what happens its enough to be safe.

After a series of aventures that "just happen" to convince the ROB to give his power to the human the multiverse is turned into paperclips.
