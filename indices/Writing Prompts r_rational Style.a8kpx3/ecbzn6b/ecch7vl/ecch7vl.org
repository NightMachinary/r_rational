My immediate thought is that Kirei is long dead because no way would he not have been deposed so he doesn't have unbreakable leverage over his Servant. Voldie is running this show, and he has already won. 10 years of prep time? Harry needs a strong advantage to have any chance, and he's about to get run over.
