I can't really say whether or not the 4th is supposed to be an OC yet. I'll admit that their arc is what I would write, were I penning the next film.

You make a good point. I don't want the 4th to come off as "crazy," as in being an unpredictable wild card or something. I don't want any BvS-Lex Luther types making plans with no discernible motivation other than moving the plot along and acting unsavory for the sake of it.

I was trying to convey that the 4th is the first main character who isn't a schemer or a thinker. Originally the scene was going to end by shifting to the 4th's perspective as they actually they themselves realized how talking to the DC was pointless. In the end you are right that it just didn't make much sense.

Hopefully now the changed last line from the 4th fixes the scene's logic.

Thanks for the critique!
