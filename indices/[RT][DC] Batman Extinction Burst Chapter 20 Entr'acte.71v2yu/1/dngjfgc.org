Is 4th an original character? I noticed that you didn't describe them at all, which seems intentional if you're trying to hide who they are from Batman-savvy readers.

Still enjoying the story immensely by the way :) I am a little confused by the 4th's actions here: his conversation with her seemed pointless if that's what he planned to do all along, but I don't see how what she said might have made him decide to do that instead of have her pass the message along. He might just be "crazy" of course, but that seems less interesting.
