I'm a big fan of how you portray Ross's celebrity status. She's almost giving me Stephen Hawking vibe with all of her handicaps and special needs. Shouod I pity her or should she pity me?

I honestly can't tell how much of her personality is a facade, and the dissonance with William really hammers that in. Carol and Nic's awkwardness is entirely justified IMO.

Beyond that, I can relate with the feeling of interacting with somebody who's more talented than me in every way. I don't think Carol's feelings of inferiority are going to go away while Rose is on campus.

Overall, you've done a great job of making Rose feel truly alien. I'm really looking forward to the next chapter, regardless of length. If you need a beta reader, feel free to hit me up!
