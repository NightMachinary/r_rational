Thank you!

The points you bring up are exactly why I need to find a beta reader. These chapters are long, so a lot of description/explanations were omitted in favor of being concise. Sometimes I accidentally omitted too much. I /really/ should have described telepathy better. There's a ton of stuff I'm hoping I'll be able to sprinkle in the coming chapters.

I want to convey that Rose is surprisingly small, like how many people are surprised when they see the Mona Lisa. Her wings, however, are huge when unfurled.

Carol and Nic only have vague goals so far. This is very sudden for them, and they only talk about their plans briefly over breakfast. It's not something they had ever seriously considered, and they truly have no idea what they're doing. They'll have a lot more time to put thought into it before classes begin.

I am adding some more description to chapter 1 to target the things you mentioned. For people who have already read it, I am posting them below:

--------------

- /William Statton, the eldest of the three Statton children, was almost always seen accompanying and translating for Rose in public. It was his family that had raised the alien they had discovered in secret for several years. Rose Day, two years prior, was deliberately timed to take place at the end of his senior year of high school. After that, he had traveled around the globe with Rose, spreading her influence everywhere they went. William would be somewhere around Carol's age, despite only now beginning his freshman year at Lincoln. Rose, on the other hand, was probably setting a record as the youngest person to ever enroll in Oxford./

- /Nic was right: the alien was a lot smaller than she had expected. Carol had imagined it being the size of a large Komodo dragon, but in person it was quite small, excluding its wings./

- /According to the couple dozen telepaths on the planet, the skill was a permanent connection that grew organically between two individuals. Initially, one had to make physical contact with another telepath to be sown the seeds of the power. After several days, it would be possible for the two to transmit simple messages, but the connection could become stronger through practice./ If the telepaths' words were to be accepted at face value, it was simply impossible to telepathically control another person (of sound mind) without their consent. /Both minds had the ability to throttle the connection at any time./

- /Rose was trying to be friendly. She had just moved to a new place and was surrounded by strangers. Maybe Nic wanted to be a fanboy, or just learn about physics, but Carol was Rose's new neighbor. The least I can do is reciprocate./
