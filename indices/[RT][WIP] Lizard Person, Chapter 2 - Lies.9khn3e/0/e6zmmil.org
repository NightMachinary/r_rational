I think the story is really nailing the anxiety that would come with interacting with an empath/psychic.

I see so many stories where if they touch on it at all it's just an "oops had a sex thought" and it's never really brought up again. So I really appreciate the detailed look into how Carol is handling it. The paranoia, the second guessing your second guessing, constantly examining your own thoughts and motivations. Never being sure if any interaction is genuine or you're being manipulated and out-thought at an N+1 level. The guilt at your doubt and mistrust being known. I can't help feel a bit distressed as I'm reading, which is always a good sign.
