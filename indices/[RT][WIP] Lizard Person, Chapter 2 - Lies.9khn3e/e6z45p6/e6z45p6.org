I'd really appreciate knowing what you think of this chapter. It took a lot longer to write than I expected, but thankfully I have a chunk of chapter 3 drafted (and more of the story planned further on) as a result.

Although it's 3rd person, I've been thinking of the story as documenting Carol's own experiences. The day she meets an alien would be particularly memorable, so the first couple chapters show almost everything that she observes.

That said, I'm considering making future chapters about half as long so I can release them more frequently.

Edit: Releasing more frequently is on hold for the time being. I'm going to be more preoccupied this next month than usual.
