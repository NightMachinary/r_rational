Interesting concept. I'm having trouble picturing the size of Rose. She's light but large.

I didn't really understand the William character in the first chapter. He's a physic or something which is why he was able to bond with Rose? I have no idea his age.

Does Carol or Nic have real goals for meeting and befriending Rose? The first chapter made it seem like they wanted to exploit her somehow but it seems they don't actually know themselves.
