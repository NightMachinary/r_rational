It's either the normal human desire to socialize or an extra intense desire to socialize, it wasn't clear which because the protagonist's society seems to be obsessed with ambition and economic growth so their perception of what normal human values are might not have been correctly calibrated. I lean toward saying it's the normal human desire to socialize because that would explain why outbreaks are so common, but the evidence against is that one character mentions that those of the Loom aren't zombies and "still love their daughters", indicating that those outside the Loom also feel, or believe they feel, familial love, and that the Loom is characterized as strongly memetic.
