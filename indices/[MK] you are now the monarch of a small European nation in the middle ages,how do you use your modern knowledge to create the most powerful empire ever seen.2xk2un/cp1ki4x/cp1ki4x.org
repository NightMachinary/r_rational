This is going to be a multigenerational project. If you wanted a quick fix, then you probably shouldn't have transported yourself back in time to the Middle Ages. Shit moves like /molasses/ back then. Moreover, we're not going to concern ourselves with any of that voodoo magic -some- people are calling "science" or "banks." /Heresy/, the lot of it.

First of all, you're going to want to get married. (Assuming you're of age. If you are not of age, spend the next few years trying not to get killed by your regent.) Pick a young, genetically-fit princess of a powerful, nearby nation as your bride. You should now be allied with said larger nation. (That's if you're a man. If you're a woman, you have the problem of needing to matrilineally marry a prince to keep the dynasty name going. This is /much/ harder.)

Next, have lots of children. The more the better.

While waiting for children, take a look at your kingdom. Is it big? Are there annoying people calling themselves "counts" or "earls" pestering you for more land? Is yes, then congratulations! You are the monarch of a proper /Petty Kingdom/, and may move onto the next step. If not, then don't worry! You probably won't be independent for much longer.

You're going to want to consolidate your rule. Do this by plotting to revoke the titles of one of your vassals. This will probably lead to civil war. But that's not an issue, since you'll have the backing of a powerful ally, and should only be fighting one vassal at a time. (They're not too smart.) Once the rebellion against your "tyrannical" rule is crushed, you will gain the former vassal's land. With this newly acquired power, begin the process again with another vassal. Repeat until you can no longer efficiently manage your new land, or find yourself out of vassals.

Do you have children yet? If no, assassinate your spouse and get a new one. If yes, then it's time to think about who they should marry. This is important. Ideally, your heir should marry the heir of another kingdom, so the two crowns merge in a couple generations. If no heirs are available, marry your heir to a princess or prince of a powerful nation - just like you did earlier with yourself. Do the same with all your other children, taking care to matrilineally marry your daughters whenever possible.

Tell your chancellor to fabricate claims on weak neighbors. This may take a while. Expand. Check your Kingdom's succession law, and be sure to switch it from gavelkind to primogeniture if necessary. Raise crown authority too, while you're at it. This will probably lead to more civil war. You know what to do.

At least one of the kingdoms your children married will probably have a civil war of their own. They may send a missive calling for your aid. Ignore it. Instead, invade them - backed by your /other/ allies - with the purpose of putting the spouse of your child on the throne. If you succeed, your dynasty will control yet another Kingdom. If you fail, then at least make sure your allies take most of the losses.

Eventually - assuming you haven't gotten poisoned or killed in battle - your body will grow old and frail. Your mental acuity will leave you. If you're lucky, you may even grow senile. (Have fun with that.) One day, you will die...

...and promptly discover your spirit possesses the body of your former heir, now the new King. Apparently, this particular medieval monarch had a horcrux, or something. *Now* you understand why we were playing the long game. So long as your dynasty exists, /you/ exist.

Eventually, your dynasty - and perhaps your personal empire - will control most of Europe. This, despite considerable infighting among your dynasty - and rather substantiated rumors that your family is possessed by the devil.

(In your eternity, try seducing and/or vassalizing the Pope. I hear it speeds up the whole world conquest thing considerably.)
