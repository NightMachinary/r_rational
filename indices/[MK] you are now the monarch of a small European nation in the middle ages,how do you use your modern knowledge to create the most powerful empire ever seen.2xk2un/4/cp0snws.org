Hm...

There will be several avenues to victory:

1) Industrialization. Factories, machines, large-scale production lead to economic victory over others, use wealth to leverage into control over other countries.

2) War. Gunpowder knowledge (kept secret, inasmuch as possible) + flintlock rifles should give a pretty decisive edge. Furthermore, some sort of knowledge of things like sanitation and the like should help significantly (it is only in the 20th century that we had wars where more were killed on the battlefield than by disease).

There have been numerous books written with this sort of thing as a premise. The 1632 books by Flint, put out by Baen, have a less medieval sort of thing where a whole town is put into the past. They got dreadfully dull/tedious eventually, but are more-or-less in this genre. Similarly, the Island In The Sea of Time books by Stirling have a similar premise with the island of Nantucket put into effectively pre-medieval circumstances.

A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is of course the classic of the genre, which inspired all others.

If you're really interested in reading about technical details of industrializing medieval Poland from the perspective of one who starts out with randomly extremely helpful resources like a collection of modern seeds, consider the Conrad Stargard books by L. Frankowski - however, be warned that those books have numerous objectionable bits (especially /really rampant/ misogyny that is extremely objectionable) and also be warned that the books get progressively worse, not better, and on no account should you read Lord Conrad's Quest for Rubber or further, those books have no redeeming qualities.
