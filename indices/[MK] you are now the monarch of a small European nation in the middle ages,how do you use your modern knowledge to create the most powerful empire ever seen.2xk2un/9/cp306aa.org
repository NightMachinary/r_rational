Re-introduce concrete, geometry, and competent roadbuilding. All of these things can be traced back to the Romans. When everyone is oh-so-happy with your brilliance about figuring out the knowledge of the ancients, get glassmakers to create lenses that you can use to provably introduce germ theory. Implement schools and say the Romans had them, because they did.

I emphasize the Romans in this because the more educated persons in the middle ages KNEW the Romans were more advanced than they were. Europe had lost huge amounts of knowledge. Even the church would respect most Roman innovations, and give you a pass on some other things as long as you were very careful.

You also know what the real shape of the world is. Your traders would have a massive advantage, especially if you were not landlocked. Establish trade routes with China, India, and Japan. Colonize the Americas and Australia but respect the indigenous people.
