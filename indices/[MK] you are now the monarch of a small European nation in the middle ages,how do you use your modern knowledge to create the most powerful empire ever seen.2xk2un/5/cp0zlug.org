I don't really think that going on a conquest binge is the right answer, but for anyone who does try - you're vastly under-estimating the infrastructure needed to make guns and the length of the stretch of history where they coexisted with knights and pikes, and overestimating importance of open field combat in a time period where castles still worked. Try introducing floating arm trebuchets instead.
