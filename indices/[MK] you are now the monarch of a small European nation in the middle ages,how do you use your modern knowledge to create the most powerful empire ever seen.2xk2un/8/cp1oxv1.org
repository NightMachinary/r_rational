I kinda feel like we need to focus at least a little on communication. Is there any way we can speed up communication over large distances without our enemies catching on in time to be a pest? It needs to be something difficult or impractical to lose because of one spy or entrepreneur letting the enemy get a look at one facility/item. Cell phones would be great for this, but they're pretty impractical to build. Telephones or telegraphs wouldn't be too difficult, but they'd also be impossible to hide without some eninja-esque shenanigans. (Consider: have prisners dig trenches and fill them back up as punishments, but leave some of these trenches dug at night. Your ninja engineers (Ninjaneers?) lay phone lines at night, carefully protecting them from sight and moisture, then the prisoners unknowingly bury them the next day, preferably before any curious peasants wander along and discover something interesting to add to the rumor mill. Requires too many things to go right, huff.)

Neighboring European powers are the primary immediate threat. What about bigger, more distant powers? The Pope, the Middle East (if this is pre-Mongol invasion), China? The Middle Ages are pretty much "Europe falls apart, but everyone holds together until the Mongols shake things up". I feel like there must be some way to take advantage of that.

The Church was a great power in Medieval Europe; it's not safe to ignore or dance around them, especially if we're some Luxembourg-esque swath of land surrounded by other kingdoms. We might have more success infiltrating the Church, building up influence, and using it to our advantage. But that's a completely different challenge.

If there's any way we can secure access to easy petroleum deposits, there's a brief window before anyone can figure out what we're up to during which we can invent plastic or internal combustion engines or something. This seems so unlikely as to be hardly worth mentioning, but GeeJo has most else covered.
