I know the chemical routes to extract and make chemical weapons of a fierce power that could wipe out armies. I know how to make improved metal work from local deposits. I could equip my army fairly easily with chemical weapons that should give them dominance over any fixed enemy force. I'd probably start with that. Should be easy enough to keep the process fairly secretive so I can maintain that advantage.
