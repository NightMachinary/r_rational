This is not an easy question. People were not stupid back then. If your nation starts producing guns en masse and institutes agricultural and medical reforms that have startling results, you'll only get a few years head-start before other nations copy what you're doing. You can extend the lead by staggering your innovations a bit, creating new tactics every five years (Basic gunnery, then pike/gun squares, then plug bayonets, ring bayonets, etc., the same in other fields). But since it's stated that you're in charge of a /small/ nation, that's not going to be enough to overcome the Big Blue Blob of France in time before they catch up and eliminate your advantages. Straight-up military conquest just isn't viable.

Let's start with something seemingly insignificant, with apparent drawbacks that make the decision unpalatable to other European dynasties even after you start to see results. Establish a national bank, guaranteeing national debt and currency backed by the resources of the nation rather than your personal authority. You don't have the clout to make it worthwhile to balk canon law over usury at this point when there's an alternative, so put Jews in charge. While you're at it, establish tolerance for Jews under the law. They're a skilled, wealthy and marginalised group who can be put to good use in your fledgling empire.

The ability to leverage national debt will instantly let you punch above your weight class through the hiring of mercenaries, and fund projects that would be unimaginable on a small private purse. Still, there are limits - you're the head of a small nation with small assets. You can't leverage them infinitely. You need something that with a small initial investment, can pay massive dividends within a decade. Time to play Columbus. I know enough about basic ship design that I could guide production of small trans-Atlantic vessels even with basic carpentry tools, and the mere knowledge that there really /is/ land beyond the Azores is one of my biggest advantages. Medieval cartography [[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Hereford_Mappa_Mundi_1300.jpg][looked like this]], after all. Strike out for the New World and invest most of your nation's budget into developing Mesoamerican and South American colonies. /Deliberately/ use biological warfare to destabilise the existing empires - we're going for world conquest here, morals be damned. Grab some choice locations along the Gold and Ivory coasts of Africa. The hauls of gold will pay off your loans and allow for re-investment, though the inflation of gold-backed currency is going to cause major problems. You might want to consider instituting fiat currency as soon as it's practical.

Colonisation is an area where even a small nation can compete incredibly well (see: the Dutch), and knowledge of germ theory, vaccines, and the utility of quinine in treating malaria will make for more rapid gains than otherwise historically plausible. If you have absolutely no morals, you could institute the triangular trade early, as that would act as an incredible multiplier on your industrial and commercial capacity. Use the wealth to maintain a healthy force of mercenaries to defend the homeland until your African (and ideally Indian) colonies are developed enough to provide the raw manpower to begin making your moves back on the European continent.

Even then, you'll soon be facing a coalition of basically every other European Power all looking for nothing more than to put your upstart dynasty down and get back to squabbling among themselves. I still don't see a way to /reliably/ expand into a new pan-European Empire, but just seizing the "empty" lands of most of the rest of the world should be enough to outdo the historical British.
