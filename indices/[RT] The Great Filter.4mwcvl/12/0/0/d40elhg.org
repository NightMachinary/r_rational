It uses board game style mechanics, but I use a computer to do the book keeping.

So my next prototype is meant to be something like a chess match, but every piece moves simultaneously.

Is as difficult to 'kill' as the king in chess.

And you play it by controlling an individual piece on your side until it is taken, then starting over from the start of the match with a new piece.
