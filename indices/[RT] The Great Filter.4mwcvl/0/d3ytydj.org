Short fiction. About 4000 words. Read time ~10 minutes.

It was inspired by a lot of rationalist stuff I have been reading. Especially from Robin Hanson's Great Filter and Brain Emulations and SlateStarCodex's take on it.

Would love feedback.

Thanks and enjoy.

(Just want to say: I read almost everything posted here (and much of what is recommended). This is definitely my favorite sub-reddit. Thanks for all of you that write for me...)
