That is impossible. There may be another time traveller, who came from a time contemporary to yours - once you can build the machine, it is conceivable that the other time traveller can build the machine. Worse yet, after your first one or two times round the loop, the "other time traveller" is /you/ (unless you continually and deliberately overwrite your past self).

You /might/ be able to build it before it's conceivable that anyone else on Earth could invent time travel from scratch; but you're not guaranteed that that's going to be enough.
