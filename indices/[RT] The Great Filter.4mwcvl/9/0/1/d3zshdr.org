Some alien civilisation should have been able to refrain from groundhogging itself out of existence. Imagine any lifeform that could evolve, that wouldn't have problems coordinating. Perhaps a species whose members can exchange thoughts, where at some point during their civilation's history everyone became a hivemind? "Nobody presses the starsystem-nuke button on the back of their hand" isn't enough of a great filter.
