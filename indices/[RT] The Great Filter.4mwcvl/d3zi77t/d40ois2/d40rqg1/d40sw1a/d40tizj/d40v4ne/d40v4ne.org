  It's possible that another time traveller is there, but since the traveller didn't build the machine in your originating loop then unless your actions change things the traveller won't build it.
#+end_quote

True. However, "your actions change things" might mean "the other time traveller discovers your existence, and decides to, so to speak, shoot first".

#+begin_quote
  And there won't be any "unpredictable" travellers from the previous loop because the fact that you still existed to build the machine means that nobody else time traveled.
#+end_quote

No, it means that anyone else who did time travel must have changed history in such a way as to prevent their own time travel. Or time travelled from a far earlier timeline, far in your future. While it is true that they won't time travel without a causal chain of events that leads back to your own actions, there's no telling which action (or lack of action) on your part might trigger that causal chain of events.

And then, of course, there's the point that you would have to time travel before your previous-loop-self, or you might end up trapping the universe in a steady-state infinite loop...
