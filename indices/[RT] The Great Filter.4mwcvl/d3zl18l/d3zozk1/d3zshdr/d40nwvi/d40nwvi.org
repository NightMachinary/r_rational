All you need is another species somewhere else in the universe to invent time travel before your hypothetical time travel avoiding species is advanced enough to encounter them. And if the chance for such a species developing is small enough to almost always coincide with a more "typical" reset species and thus be disrupted at whatever point is critical for it to form then it might just not have happened yet. Or not happen ever before the heat death of the universe.
