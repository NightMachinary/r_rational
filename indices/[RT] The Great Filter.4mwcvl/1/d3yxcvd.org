Honestly the only solution I can come up with for this problem is to develop a GAI, they are the only entities with enough power to ensure their civilization never develops time travel if it's so easy.

Of course the problem is that given it's supposed to be much harder to develop than time travel I can't imagine it would be easy to ensure GAI comes first. So how would you control tech development to that degree?\\
I suspect any answer would have to involve massive unstable conspiracies or world domination, and you can't rush development because normal AI safety problems still exist.
