I love this story and I am so glad that this subreddit inspired you to write it. I love love *love* stories that take weird scientific takes on concepts. "Time travel is basically a thing that happens all the time, naturally" is something that I haven't come across before. It's fresh.

I have some technical-type critiques, if you'd be interested in them, but the story overall is pretty good.

I have now tagged you with "not-so-secret time traveler fighting the apocalypse" (I also have a weakness for stories that claim to be real accounts just masquerading as fiction for one purpose or another).
