I like it! I'm already well acquainted with "time travel as genocide", but this is the first time I've seen the GF twist. Good insight/length ratio.

You may want to remove the Horcrux reference; it adds a barrier to entry, and is not very sensical even for Harry Potter readers.

However, if you're feeling cheeky, you could try to work in a reference to pop culture that /doesn't exist in our timeline/. If you can make it obvious yet seemingly not deliberate.
