Thank you for writing this, but I find the moral positions in this story silly, for the most part (immortal twin is accurate). That said, the "random walk" model is actually really compelling.

Temporally looped information is, near as I can imagine, experimentally identical to a Boltzman Brain situation. So there's no reason to believe you killed an entire universe of anything, and even if you did, you should also believe that you /created/ an entire universe of that same anything. Mork's not born, Gork is, and it's a push.

As for the model... there /is/ the third terminus state: Invent, but not use, time travel. This seems to me to imminently reasonable, given sane time taveller: First thing you do is create a looped failsafe: If extinct, send time traveler; now the bottom line loops just like the first, and over infinite iterations, the walk will progress as a balance.

An interesting side effect is that we'd expect to see dead alien civilizations where exactly the wrong thing happened; basically, the opposite of this: [[http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?id=3994]]
