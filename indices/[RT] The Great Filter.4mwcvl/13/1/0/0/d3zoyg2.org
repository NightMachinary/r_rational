You are half-way correct.

The first species develops time travel and keeps re-setting until they don't use time travel (likely due to an extinction event before the invention of time travel), then THAT timeline continues until the next species develops time travel. And it repeats.

So the reason we don't see any space-faring civilizations is the final timeline we exist in they have all destroyed themselves (If they haven't it's not the final timeline)
