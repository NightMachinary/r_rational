It's about timing. The reason the Drake equation / Fermi Paradox results in a high probability of aliens in that you need to believe the average lifespan of aliens able to communicate will be very high.

If you assume the average lifespan of communicative aliens is say 200 years before they go extinct then the rest of the assumptions can be reasonable and you can assume you are the only living intelligent species in the galaxy.

The re-set just makes it highly likely that species will not last anything close to 200 years in the "final" timeline.

(The chances that two species are close to inventing time travel at exactly the same time is very very small, but it doesn't really change things - just makes the modeling much more complicated)
