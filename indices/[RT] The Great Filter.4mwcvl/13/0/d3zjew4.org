It is a proposal for why every alien would fall to this great filter. And that the great filter is time travel.

Effectively it proposes time travel is so much easier to discover then interstellar travel.

And it has universe spanning reach to reset a species.

So the end state of the universe is that time travel deletes civilizations eventually, and doing so makes it like they never were interstellar in the first place.
