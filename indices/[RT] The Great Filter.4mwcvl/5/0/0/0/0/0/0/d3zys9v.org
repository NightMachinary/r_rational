That can be engineered around. It's not like it will be a surprise when it happens.

On the other hand when a timeline going all the way to the end of universe already happened - what better can we hope for? Isn't a reset in such circumstances the best possible option? Yes it will result in death of everybody and small chance of humanity vanishing in next turn (and big chance of humanity vanishing eventually), but humanity is vanishing anyway because of heat death, and after reset even if humanity vanishes - most probably some other species will have their turn.
