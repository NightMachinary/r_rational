Hmmm.

The desired terminus state is /given/ as "time travel is not invented", but that's not quite right. The /actual/ desired terminus state is "intelligent life continues to exist". In order for this to happen, it is necessary that humanity develop sufficient, independent off-Earth colonies /before/ time travel is invented, and then no-one ever travels back to before that time. (As noted in the story, once you have enough colonies, even with a high probability of a given colony dying off, stellar expansion becomes a near-certainty).

It's easy to push for the /discovery/ of a given technology, given time travel as presented in the story (and assuming you're sufficiently ruthless). You simply do the research, calculate when-and-where you want it to be discovered, pick a person who's in the right place at the write time, time-travel back into his head and produce the required scientific paper. When you need funding directed to a specific place, overwrite Bill Gates in the past and direct it as needed. (Or overwrite some random person, but bring with you memories of the performance of the stock market after that date. Or the next winning lottery numbers.) So, it should be relatively straightforward to arrange for the discovery and funding of space travel. It shouldn't be hard to arrange for it to be done, either - not when you can have the loudest denigrators of the project suddenly and inexplicably drop any and all objections pretty much on command.

Then, once you have (say) a dozen planets colonised, you just need to find some way of preventing anyone from travelling back to /before/ that time, whether or not they figure out time travel...
