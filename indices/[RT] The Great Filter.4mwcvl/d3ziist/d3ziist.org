I think there's an inconsistency in your proposal. The Drake equation asks why we do not now see more signs of alien life. You propose that time travel resets technological progress. But, the reset is universal (you talk about killing all of the aliens when resetting the time back to the mid 21st century).

This does not answer why we don't see any evidence of aliens as of the date of your reset. Any aliens have been reset to where they were, leaving the question of the Great Filter unresolved. As I see it, this proposal would require that either we are the first developed species, or that aliens have all fallen to the Great filter. That is, the same situation before introducing time travel.
