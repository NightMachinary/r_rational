  The re-set just makes it highly likely that species will not last anything close to 200 years in the "final" timeline.

No.

The reset is /more influential than that/. The reset says that the time state of the universe will not count past the first species to develop the ability to time travel. The reset of state is painted as universal; a time-reset in Alpha Centauri resets the entire universe. So the universal time clock wont pass the first development of time travel (we'd keep getting sent back to the earliest time-traveller's reversion point).

But based on the anthropic principle, earth exists and so we know the universe counts at least 13 billion years from the big bang. Thus, we can conclude that one of the following is true:

1. Earth is the first place time-travel develops
2. Earth's development happens within the time-loop of some other civilization.

As far as I can tell, the story has an additional unstated assumption that every sapient technological civilization will develop time travel ("easier than space flight").

Now, option (1) seems to fall within the already stated boundaries of the Fermi Paradox: Why is earth the first place to develop sapient life?

Option (2) is more interesting, but seems to require that all other civilizations have roughly equivalent technological progress to us: their time-resets happen after ours.
