Star travel won't work to solve this because you remain vulnerable to someone going back to before it happened. You need humanity to /leave the lightcone defined by the birth of the first hominid advanced enough to be overwritten/. That is a much higher bar to clear. And since FTL is time travel..

Basically, you need to leave this universe for one in which time travel is not possible. Whoo-hoo. Doozy of a problem.\\
But at least this setting does provide a compelling reason for entire civilizations to abandon this reality - any remnants they leave eventually get retconned out of existence, so "Abandon ship" isn't ruled out as a solve by fermi.
