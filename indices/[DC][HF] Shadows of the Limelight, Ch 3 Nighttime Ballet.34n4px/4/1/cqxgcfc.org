I probably will. I write in Scrivener, which has a compile function, and can "Compile to PDF" with some settings. I want to be able to do something like the HPMOR PDF, which I was a fan of. I've done a few test compiles, and there are some kinks that need to be worked out before I can consider it good enough. There's also the question of distribution, but I think it might be enough to just have it as a Patreon-sub-only link. Hopefully I'll have that figured out by next chapter, if it doesn't cut into writing/editing time.

The other stuff I'll think about. I did some of the cameo stuff for /Metropolitan Man/, which I think had generally positive results - cameos are best when you need a throwaway name and can just grab from a list of people who helped you out by pointing out typos (or in this case, donated), rather than having a scene for themselves.
