"Being a dick to everyone" is a level 1 strategy. Since /everyone/ can get powers through fame, you're in competition with all of them, and a lot of them are /also/ going to try the BADTE strategy, trying to outcompete each other along those lines, until eventually the market is saturated with dicks, and they're no longer really distinct. You're no longer "the dick", you're "one of those dicks". Like how a vampire novel makes it big, and then there are a ton of replaceable vampire novels that come out the year after to try to capitalize on the trend but find no success because there's a glut in the market.

More than trying to be a dick, what you'd want to find is an area of the fame market that you can exploit. /Maybe/ that's by being a dick to people. But maybe it's by being a big shining beacon of hope and goodness. Or by being a low-brow comedian. Or by being a stoic. You carve out your own section of the market, try to be original and probably fail, since there have been hundreds of years of people trying to be original. The BADTE strategy is one of the competing strategies in the fame market, alongside "be really fucking nice to everyone you meet" and "be a snide asshole with a heart of gold" and "be innocent and virginal" and "rebel against the status quo" and "be a fount of wisdom".

The optimal strategy depends on what strategy everyone else is following.
