  Many of these are good questions, and "read and find out" type of things.

Certainly, one of the reasons I'm closely watching (and very disappointed that you posted this one late by a whole hour!!!!! /s) lots of things to think about and wonder.

Sure enough if slaves are quite expensive probably a lot better to go the sell slave fame to them instead. Another question that brings up though is if a slave costs the same as a new house, wouldn't it be better to stick up posters of yourself everywhere and then get double your strength? Really depends how it scales and all that.
