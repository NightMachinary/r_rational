Maybe? It probably wouldn't exist in exactly this form. If you want what I would consider the primary influencers:

- /Avatar: The Last Airbender/, where people have control over a specific element.
- /The Paper Magician/ by Charlie Holmberg, where people bond to a specific man-made material and get access to certain types of magic - including flesh, since man makes man. Not something that I really recommend, since it didn't end up being the book that I wanted.
- /The Baroque Cycle/ by Neal Stephenson, which has no magic at all and mostly introduced me to the wonders of the time period.
- My [[http://maguseuropa.wikidot.com/][/Magus Europa/]] campaign setting, which had Isaac Newton as a gnomish wizards, dragons that had fled to the New World because of the advent of firearms, necromancers in the catacombs beneath Paris, etc.
- /Europa Universalis/ which taught me a fair amount of the variety in world geography, global politics, balance of power, etc. (supplemented with Wikipedia).
- /Worm/. Though ... I don't know. I'm not actually consciously borrowing or integrating anything from there in the way that I'm picking and choosing cool stuff from the others. It would probably be disingenuous to say that it didn't influence me at all, but there's nothing that I'm consciously trying to do "like Worm".

And then there's a lot owed to Brandon Sanderson as well, mostly in how he constructs his magic systems and the way that they influence the world. And I don't consider it a straight riff on any of these, nor is it a straight synthesis.
