Certainly I agree but my suggestion was that if it's cheaper to become famous and gain more power than the number of slaves you could purchase for the same cost (plus the cost of having slaves: looking after them and expected revolt risk) and that fame power could translate to equivalent or better than work that your slave would do then you might expect there to be less slaves in this world than in any other one.

As I said, only if those things hold which don't seem too likely from what we've seen, seems like you need a lot of "fame" (time spent thinking about someone else perhaps?) to get fairly little "power".
