Many of these are good questions, and "read and find out" type of things.

A total glossectomy carries a lot of risks with it - severe swelling that leads to an inability to breathe, a permanent difficulty in eating and swallowing, bleeding, etc. The state of medicine is a little schizophrenic (due to people like Gaelwyn having advantages as physicians) but slaves are pretty expensive - more than a hundred thousand of today's dollars in the real-world equivalent of the historical period this fantasy world is aping. (There are also different forms of slavery - it's not always as pure "property", and quite a few slaves have some recognized rights.) Which is basically a short way of saying that there are some incentives in place such that removing the tongues of slaves isn't always the optimal thing, even leaving aside the moral aspects of it.

Edit: [[http://www.measuringworth.com/slavery.php][See here for the value of a slave,]] though it's an analysis of a later period than /Shadows/ is a fantasy equivalent of. You can assume that a healthy slave in this world would cost around that though, by author fiat.
