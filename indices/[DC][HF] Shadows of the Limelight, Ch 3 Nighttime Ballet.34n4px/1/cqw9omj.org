Something I'm interested in is how closely the stories have to be related to a person to grant them power.

Obviously it's quite abstract but there are plenty of examples in our own history of multiple real people merging into some single person in tales.

Curiously since infamy is more compelling to real humans there's a real incentive to commit evil acts in this, and also an incentive from any governing bodies to silence criminals and the such without saying a word, certainly leads to dystopia.

There's also mention of democracy in this chapter, you wot? A bunch of merchants would have far less fame than a single figurehead unless you get all the fame of your family name or something (see: Rockefellers)

In terms of slaves, why would you allow any of them to have a tongue? If I was a slave owner I would brand them with my name as that surely counts as recognition/fame, if you're the owner of slave ships or plantations that's 200 people who're going to know recognize you. Again it incentives being the biggest dick possible since if you're just like any other slave driver when the slaves move they won't talk about you.

Edit: Alternatively sell being nice to slaves for money, so a illustria or whatever comes in and gives them all chocolate and then they won't stop talking about how great they were.

Alternatively you want to raise people to not be able to communicate about anyone except yourself that would be the best, so have your name be sign language or something unique like a brand as I said so the only thing they could communicate in would be regarding to you.
