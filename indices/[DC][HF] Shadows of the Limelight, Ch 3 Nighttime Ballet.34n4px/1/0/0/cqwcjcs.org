I agree with that, however it's the case that bad things have a larger impact on the human psyche and so on fame, you can see this from the news we have at the moment and from evo-pysch. People tend to remember the worst times way more than the best.

So of all things being particularly evil or authoritarian/conquering is much more likely to generate fame than being the best person ever. Of course there will be an optimal solution where you're not killing off more of your fame generating commoners than the fame gets you.
