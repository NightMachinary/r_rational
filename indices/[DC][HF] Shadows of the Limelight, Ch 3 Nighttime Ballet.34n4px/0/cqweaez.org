Vidre has an excellent point about how now every civilian at a fight between illustrati is going to try to backstab the villain.

I think the solution is to spread it around that Dominic Lightscour wasn't just a random nobody at the time; he was already a fledgling hero. Earned his domain as a runner, got powerful enough with it that attacking Zerstor wasn't suicide, and was just waiting for an opportunity to get out of the criminal life and use his powers for good. It's even true, mostly.

Then only people who already have some power are going to try to imitate him. Still a problem, but much less so. And as a bonus, spreading the story will increase Dominic's power that much more.
