Have you considered including reward tiers to your Patreon campaign? People would be more motivated to donate if you included things such as a cameo (like the sailor, Michael, in this chapter), a beautifully formatted pdf with all of the current chapters, a short story for the highest tiers, a chapter about a myth or legend set in the world based on a prompt chosen by your backers, and more!
