I think I will include it, but only when the protagonist interacts with others. So when he's by himself, nothing happens because the environment follows his expectation of reality. But when he runs into someone else and they comment on something he hasn't paid any strong/focused attention to, their expectation dominates instead.

I'll make it obvious by having the stranger be someone with red eyes (dream-demon?) and they'll comment on what pretty red eyes he has. His expectations won't affect his eye color because there is no mirror in the dream for him to find and observe his face in.
