I see what you mean. At first it's like the world is normal or similar to real-life, but you are not focusing too hard on the details (it's the same old stuff, why care?), but then something happens where it's clearly unusual and because you haven't focused on the detail yet, it becomes set.

For example, you are walking along a path with someone and the sky above you is the same old sky as ever, no need to pay attention to it at all. But your friend says what a nice purple color the sky is, and you look up to see a purple sky and it was always purple even though you could have swore it wasn't always purple.

  The sky was always purple. The sky had always been purple. Always. But had the sky always been purple before you looked?
