I really really like this idea, because I love the absurdity available in dreams. My suggestion is read (or reread) a bunch of Lovecraft's really weird stuff, because he does a great job of explaining just enough that you're forced to let your imagination fill in all the horrors that you know are so abundant, and I think that's a great quality for writing about dreams. We've all got different ways of letting our brain run away in all the wrong ways, and of course that's doubly true for dreams. Lovecraft takes full advantage of this by using vague superlatives that feel like they describe what he's writing about but really leaves all the good stuff up to our imaginations. Of course if we're talking dreams then I've gotta mention [[http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/dq.aspx][The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath]], but a lot of his stuff reads like a nightmare taken flesh, which I suppose is what he was going for.

One more thing, something that I've noticed about my own dreams and nightmares is that often someone makes an assumption, and it's as if it was always the case to everyone involved, even if it very clearly wasn't not two seconds earlier. Might be a fun way to keep people on their toes, not that you need too much of that with an idea like this.
