I'm planning out my first ever quest on Sufficient Velocity and I need help looking for similar works +to plagiarize ideas from+ for some inspiration.

The idea of the quest is that the protagonist is stuck in a reoccurring lucid nightmare and he needs to escape within an unknown time limit. The quest is meant to have the players discover the rules of an bizarre new world where the rules of physics and logic may not necessarily apply.

I'm basically requesting any recommendations that involve a dream world to get some ideas for writing the scenery or modifying the dream logic/rules.

Something else that may also help me are stories that involve exploring a maze/labyrinth since the nightmare is set in a maze-like abandoned city.
