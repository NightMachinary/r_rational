- Anything can appear in any out-of-direct-sight location.
- Things tend to appear when the protagonist thinks of them - this especially includes terrifying monsters from the depths of his own psyche.
- Nothing (including the protagonist) can be permanently destroyed or escaped from. However, clothing will vanish at the most embarrassing moment possible.
- Running doesn't help.
- Playing dead /does/ help, but the monster never exactly goes away and will attack instantly the instant you stop playing dead.
- If it's out of sight, then it's /right behind you/.
- /It's going to get you./
- You are already too late.

Those rules seem pretty nightmare-logic to me.
