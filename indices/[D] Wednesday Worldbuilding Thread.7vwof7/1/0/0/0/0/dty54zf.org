  If you take four right turns at a 90-degree angle each time, you don't end up going the same direction that you started. (Basing the dream geometry on hyperbolic space will really mess with anyone trying to keep a map).

This is one of the things I have planned which is a reason for why it's so hard to escape the explosion or to keep a map.

  The closer you get to the exit, the faster time goes (on average).
#+end_quote

I like this idea, because then the protagonist can use this as a clue for finding the exit.

Thanks for the suggestions!
