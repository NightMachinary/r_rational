  Rock-Paper-Scissors is probably one of the easiest unstable equilibria, so that's where my mind first went

Mhh... One thing I got from watching extra credits is that rock-paper-scissors metagames are more interesting when they're unbalanced. At least, this feels more interesting to me.

Like, for instance, maybe Fire is clearly the most powerful of all elements, on average, by a wide margin. Water and Shadow beat Fire, but Fire beats everything else by a wider margin than every other elements. That means that the distribution of powers is asymmetric. Instead of being sorted roughly equally in the different categories, most beginners choose Fire, because it's the comfortable choice, most people with a little experience choose Water because it beats Fire, etc. At a higher level, people maybe start choosing some combination of elements or switching elements at random between fight so they can't be out-predicted.
