In this case I was thinking that perhaps the arenas would simply be places where someone on the outside could reverse the flow of time once the battle was complete, which allows for full lethality and gruesome injuries. I'd want people to (magically?) keep their memories of the fights, but that's not a huge problem if you already have magical fighting.

Of course, the existence of such an arena would imply a lot of other things about the world, given how such magic could be used (even with restrictions), all of which would need thinking about, but some interesting worldbuilding might come out of the concept.
