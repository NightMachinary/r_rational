Ooooh. So, a sealed and prepared area can have a Save Point but everyone remembers what happened in there?

Opportunities for shenanigans abound!

- Have a secret meeting with an ally instead of a fight, and no-one else knows because the Save Point was not observed while in use
- A villain can sabotage the Save Point so it looks like it works just when the Hero and the Honor-Before-Reason fighter go for a death match in the arena (at least /one/ of them will die, right?)
- Non-Arena areas can be prepared with Save Point technology for a variety of reasons, up to and including torture. This is hardly ever advertised.
- A single person with a Save Point and a good memory can do weeks of planning in an apparent few hours. (This is probably restricted to teachers or the principal, who can use their offices as a Save Point).
