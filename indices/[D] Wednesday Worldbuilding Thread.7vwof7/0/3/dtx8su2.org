Hmmmm.

You are probably going to want a major villain who's near undefeatable. Given the above cycle, then, it might be worthwhile taking inspiration from [[http://www.fynboshub.co.za/fynbos-and-fire/][fynbos]] - a type of plant that actually /requires/ regular fires to maintain a healthy ecosystem. (Yes, it kills the parent plants - of some varieties (some have massively insulated stems and just lose their outer branches) - but the heat makes the seeds germinate and the entire area has just received a healthy fertilising coating of ash, so a short while later the only plants in the area are fynbos).

So then you have an antagonist who can nearly always win on the minor cycle (but can still be beaten on the major cycle by the right opponent). This also implies that plant-second-cyclers can perhaps take minor traits from different types of plants known to them (poison and leaching strength from Earth opponents are probably the major ones there).
