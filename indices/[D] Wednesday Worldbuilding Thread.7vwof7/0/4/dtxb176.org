Some stuff that stands out to me immediately, is trying to make at least some of the configurations non-trivially different from another. Making it so that, the different 'elements' do different things, and it is through that difference in functional ability that the cycles arise. The flavor to something like Power>Speed>Defense or Earth>Plant>Fire already imply something like this, along the lines of "Speed allows you dodge Powerful attacks, Defense allows you to weather fast attacks, Power lets you crack open Defenses" or "Plants' roots break up the earth, fire burns away plants, earth smothers fire" but there is possibly further depths to be explored.
