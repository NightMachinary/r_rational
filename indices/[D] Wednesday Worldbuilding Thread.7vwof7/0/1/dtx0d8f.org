What if participants are able to build their configuration during the fight? An opening move might be to attune a particular attribute and begin gaining abilities associated with it?

So, someone might start off by attuning Power, while his opponent foregoes any attunement in favor of a martial opener, ending the fight immediately. Alternatively, someone attuning Defense would be able to immediately deflect a martial strike, thereby gaining the upper hand.

Perhaps experience could determine how fast someone can attune a particular school. So at a higher competitive level, fighters can attune so fast that a martial strike would be effectively useless, no matter what attunement was chosen. Furthermore, people might be more familiar with certain attunements and powers that using other attunements, even if better from a metagame perspective, would be inferior to their preferred strategies.

And don't forget about combo victories. Like if someone is using some kind of acceleration ability, and starts stacking the ability to gain unlimited time. (For that particular scenario, perhaps the downside is that if their time is doubled, their senses are halved, so they'll also need a way to improve their senses; abilities that mess with their senses might be particularly effectively against them, essentially stopping the combo from working.)

--------------

Maybe the abilities used in their competitions are unique to the arena? A 'natural' phenomenon, so to speak. This would allow people to use outrageous powers while explaining why they aren't used all the time in world-breaking ways. Perhaps participants have to fight over who gets which abilities as they spawn from the arena.
