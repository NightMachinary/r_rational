Well, I'm the kind of person who thinks if you're willing to go that /out there/ that you might as well go all the way and make it a trippy surrealist fantasy where the battles have utterly bizarre stakes and rules to exploit.

Go listen to the first episode of One Shot's [[https://youtu.be/II8MpLIEh20][Invisible Sun]] campaign if you want some inspiration for building a setting like that. It's like Welcome to Night Vale meets Harry Potter, and is surprisingly rational.
