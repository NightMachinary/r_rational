The best execution of safe sparring I've seen is when the characters have an additional “heath bar” that absorbs damage to prevent injuries. RWBY has auras that do this, where matches end when it's depleted, but mecha and mons shows follow the same principle by giving something else for combatants to hit than each other.

The simplest way to include class and politics is to tie the characters' wealth and background into the combat. Even something as simple as them having to buy school supplies would create a divide among them. Politics comes into play when characters have conflicting beliefs and goals. Privilege, in my experience, is about biases instilled by upbringing.
