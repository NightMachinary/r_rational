[[https://www.reddit.com/r/magicbuilding/comments/2jndl2/magic_building_is_tough/cldgiez/][Here's an (old) checklist for making magic that might be helpful.]]

Basically, I would focus on:

- *Who can use magic?* People of a certain bloodline? People who have undergone a specific ritual? Those born under the glow of a comet that passes overhead every thirty years? Anyone who studies well enough?
- *What does magic cost?* Is there some internal chi, mana, spirit, etc. that renews slowly over time? Does it take a lot of time? Do you need to crush up rare gems every time you cast a spell? Or maybe once, and then you can cast the spell forever? Do you need the blood of a virgin rabbit? Does using magic tear away at your soul, piece by piece?
- *What does magic affect?* Does it only work on sand? Can it affect the minds of men but not animals? Does it work on the unique but not the generic? Does it allow for time travel? Can it manipulate gravity? Add generic amounts of lbs-force to objects?

From these, you can get your divisions. My recommendation is to think about how the people in your world think about magic, and then start from there for "schools". Some examples:

- There's a world where "magic" means the ability to control four basic elements. The primary division between elementalists is which element they specialize, since there isn't much cross-applicability between them, or alternately, you're locked in to a single element by your very nature. (Names are highly connected to culture, and not to be taken lightly, but if you don't want to do a deep dive there, you can mash two dog-Latin words together with slight mutuations, so virignis, viraqua, vircaeli, virsolum, but spend more than five seconds on this. If you were going with that, maybe change it to "virele" instead of elementalist.)
- There's a world where "magic" means the ability to control four basic elements. /Here/, however, the primary distinction between the elementalists is not the element, but what they pay for that control. The schools are those of blood, barnacle, and dust, each who pays the Shadow's Price in their own way -- the sanguis must let their own blood, the bernak grow bone spurs, and the horologe give up years of their own life.
- There's a world of four elements, etc. But /this time/ the primary difference between the elementalists is in what their power does with those elements. The partumni are creators, able to make fire, water, earth, and air. The mutati are changers, capable of shifting one element to the other, and to control the movement of the elements around them. Lastly, the erado can wipe any of the elements away without a trace of them ever being there.

These are all lazy, quick-sketch examples, but hopefully they illustrate that divisions are A) artificial and B) a result of the natural cleavages in the system that emerge from how people do magic.
