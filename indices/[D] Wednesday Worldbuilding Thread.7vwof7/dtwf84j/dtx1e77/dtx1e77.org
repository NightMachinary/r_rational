Well, first you have to ask what kind of mages you have?

- Wizard - A person who uses their knowledge of the mystical forces of the universe to reshape reality.

- Sorcerer - Someone who has inborn magical ability. Their magic flows from them to strike out at an uncaring world.

- Warlock - This person has made a pact with supernatural beings, often trading their soul in exchange for magical power. Alternatively, this could be someone who receives divine power from their god as a reward for their devotion.

--------------

Next you have the categories of effect:

- Divination - Information gathering abilities.

- Transmutation - Effects that change the physical characteristics of a thing.

- Illusion - Changing how others perceive the world.

- Conjuration - Making something where there was nothing.

- Necromancy - A somewhat broad category that covers magic dealing with the souls and/or bodies of the dead.

--------------

Be careful not to conflate effect with specialization. A fire mage might be able to get a wide variety of effects from fire, being able to both conjuring a jet of fire, and also disappear (and reappear) in a pillar of flame. That same mage, however, might not be able to work with water at all.
