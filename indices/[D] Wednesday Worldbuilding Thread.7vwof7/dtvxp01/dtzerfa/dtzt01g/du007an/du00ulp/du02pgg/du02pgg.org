Exactly! I've never lucid dreamed, so I've never picked up on the oddities as they happen, but it might be neat in a story about dreams. Also worth noting, of course, is that it would make it much harder for readers to pin down what rules are being followed and which are open for subversion. That might be really cool, or it might feel like everything is an unexpected ass-pull. It might not be worth it to include that into your world, but if you decide it is I think it'd help drive the point home that it's a dream and not, say, his/her mind being kidnapped at night time.
