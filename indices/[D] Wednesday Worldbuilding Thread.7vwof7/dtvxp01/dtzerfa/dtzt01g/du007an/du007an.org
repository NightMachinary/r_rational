Right, um, let's say you're dreaming you're on a ship in the middle of the completely normal ocean. Someone casually mentions how it's such a relief that the ocean around here is carbonated since that means no sharks. If you remember all this upon waking up you're sure that the water was just normal ocean water before hand, but after that the water was definitely fizzy.

Honestly, maybe this isn't a thing for other people's dreams. I dunno, I've only ever had my dreams, ya know?
