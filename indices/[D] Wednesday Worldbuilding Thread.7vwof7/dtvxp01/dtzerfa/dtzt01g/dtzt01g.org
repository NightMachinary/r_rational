  One more thing, something that I've noticed about my own dreams and nightmares is that often someone makes an assumption, and it's as if it was always the case to everyone involved, even if it very clearly wasn't not two seconds earlier. Might be a fun way to keep people on their toes, not that you need too much of that with an idea like this.
