- The closer you get to the exit, the faster time goes (on average).
- Time does not go at a consistent speed. Sometime you blink and lose half an hour on the timer. Sometimes you spend an hour or more doing something and only lose minutes. Sometimes time goes /backwards/ for no apparent reason.
- The more you think about the timer, the faster time goes.
- When you hit a certain point on the edge of the city, the explosion /will/ go off.
- You can't outrun it. (However, if you are far enough away (i.e. out of the city), the explosion will merely throw you harmlessly through the air).
- If you take four right turns at a 90-degree angle each time, you don't end up going the same direction that you started. (Basing the dream geometry on hyperbolic space will really mess with anyone trying to keep a map).
