Heh, thanks for the ideas. I'm including some monsters, but I want the quest to be about exploration, so the nightmare is about time running out rather than monsters. The protagonist has to escape from a suburban maze before an explosions occurs instead of survive an attack. This is because my nightmares were always about a creeping horror lurking out of sight and I tend to wake up without anything actually happening in the dream.
