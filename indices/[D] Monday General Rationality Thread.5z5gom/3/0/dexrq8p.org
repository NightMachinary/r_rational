I'm not familiar with the exact example (not being a reader, and google not being very helpful), so this might be inaccurate; but the core concept behind considering future/past selves as independent agents with different value functions it is [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/6c/akrasia_hyperbolic_discounting_and_picoeconomics/][hyperbolic discounting]] - the fact that there are things that you value more/less depending how far away you're considering them from, time-wise.

So, for example, me from 5 hours ago as well as me 8 hours in the future would much rather the me right now was about to go to sleep, rather than read reddit. However, for the me right now the annoyance of waking up without enough sleep in the future is minor, while reddit is compelling. If I were to have a dialogue with the future me, maybe he could convince now-me that it's in our shared interest to go to sleep.

(fortunately the now-me is in control of when he wants to talk to future me, and so our reddit adventure continues)
