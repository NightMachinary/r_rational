I recently finished Charles Whelan's 'Naked Economics' and if there's one lesson I took away it was that aligning incentives matters a lot to the policy maker. It's quite easy to create the opposite of the effect the policy maker wants if he fails to think through all the incentives in play in the population. A wealth of plot ideas for a rational antagonist to implement in my stories, so yes it's fun .
