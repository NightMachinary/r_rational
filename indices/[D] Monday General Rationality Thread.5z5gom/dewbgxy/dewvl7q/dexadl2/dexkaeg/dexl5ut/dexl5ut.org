Every system implementing a government policy is going to have significantly above-human resource applied to maximising output of some quantity only tangentially related to welfare.

So I guess the only interesting question is whether a particular policy has above-human level optimising power (I'd like to taboo 'intelligence' here). And perhaps really ineffective policy does not count - but then you could just call it a really weak paperclip maximiser. For me the core requirement of PM isn't really its optimising power, but just a value system sufficiently different from human. In fact, I think Bostrom's original paper considered paperclip optimisers of different power - from human-level, which would collect and buy paperclips, to god-AGIs that would optimise all atoms to be part of paperclips.

Anyway, I don't think ineffectual policy is worth considering anyway; it just devolves to laissez-faire capitalism.
