My main criticism/rant against Capitalism, and all the satellite plolitics, is that afterall it is a paperclip maximizer.

After all things in capitalism get produced with the sole scope of making a (ingent) profit.

Furthermore corporations are more or less china-room AGIs, not able bootstrap themselves to godhood ,yet, but smarter than any individual.

It is also my opinion that they are being also used from the profiteers to distance themselves from where the profit is coming from, to shield their personal morality and empathy from their-not-anymore-theirs actions.

I would unironically suggest to read Capital by Karl Marx, he isn't perfect but he tries to describe economic phenomena in the most scientific way he can, basing himself on historical evidence; which we know isn't perfect but we cannot exactly simulate universes in which to try different economic models.\\
Afterall, it became political later on, while it was being written it was a critique and an offer for an alternative.
