It sounds like you're taking an inflation-centric view. I'd suggest taking a trade-and-production-centric view: the question is how much stuff and service is produced; and to a lesser extent, who gets the stuff. Notions like 'inflation' and 'deflation' only matter to us except insofar as they affect how much stuff gets produced, or to a lesser extent, who gets the stuff. The point of NGDPLT is not to stabilize inflation or whatever, it's to produce as much stuff as the economy can produce, with a minimum of distortion on who gets the stuff. It does happen that unstable inflation or deflation or hyperinflation reflect circumstances leading to less stuff being produced, which is the only reason we care.

I don't see how the Fed is acting not in its self-interest under NGDPLT or how other actors would take advantage of that.
