  how do you ingest information about economics, find trusted sources, and most of all evaluate claims?

I know (and trust) a few people in the public service who have PhDs in economics, so I tend to talk to them over dinner. Which I guess doesn't help very much ;p

  To me, [a consumption cycle] just looks like a bubble?
#+end_quote

To some degree it is, in the same way that borrowing money to make investments or even having a floating currency - kinda like a bubble in that if everyone panics it's bad, but good in that panic is unlikely and it allows for greater liquidity and prosperity.

  it's really hard to imagine financial investment to have negative externalities on its own

The usual examples are volatility, high-frequency or insider trading, and bubbles. This is basically "too much liquidity" and "too much leverage", the results of which can definitely cause social harm (see: 2008).
