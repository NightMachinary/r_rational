I guess my first thought when I think of 'consumption' is closer to waste and signalling, rather than utilons. In particular one example from the movie was a man who moved from having/buying "60 pairs of jeans" to "3 a year". Which I guess must be an exaggeration, because what possible utility would someone gain from buying even 15 pairs of jeans, not to mention 60?

Perhaps I anchored too much on the example. But it still feels to me that the goal of an economy should be to keep the infrastructure running, so that people can /do/ things they want to do, rather than produce transient, consumable things.
