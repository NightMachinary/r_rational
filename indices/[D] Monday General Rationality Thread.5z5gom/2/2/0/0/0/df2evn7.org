Thanks for elaborating.

  It sounds like you're taking an inflation-centric view. I'd suggest taking a trade-and-production-centric view: the question is how much stuff and service is produced; and to a lesser extent, who gets the stuff. Notions like 'inflation' and 'deflation' only matter to us except insofar as they affect how much stuff gets produced, or to a lesser extent, who gets the stuff.

Well, the argument beings with "Q. Help! I keep undershooting my 2% inflation target!". I do agree that NGDP targeting probably makes more sense (I especially liked the [[http://www.basilhalperin.com/blog/2016/12/monetary-misperceptions-food-banks-and-ngdp-targeting/][argument by food bank analogy]]), but I view it as an improvement on the idea that you should be targeting /something/, and that you need to be credible when you do it, and I was mostly addressing the first part of the linked post rather than the second, where NGDP is suggested.

  I don't see how the Fed is acting not in its self-interest under NGDPLT
#+end_quote

Hm, what I meant by that is that the Fed is not an agent that is trying to maximise its return on investment. So perhaps I should have phrased it as a different goal function than everyone else, rather than 'not acting in its self-interest'.

  or how other actors would take advantage of that.
#+end_quote

I think you misread that; the actors take advantage of deteriorating situation when the Fed /isn't/ involved, as you describe in the original post:

#+begin_quote
  In fact, there are positive feedback cycles which means that targeting a base money level can produce wild instability. When money is becoming more valuable, people try to hold onto it more, which slows down velocity, which decreases the effective amount of money available per transaction, which decreases prices even more, which makes money even more valuable.

It's a tragedy of the commons thing, right? Everyone would rather deflation not spiral out of control and the economy not stop into a depression, but your immediate incentive is to hold back more cash if you expect cash to become more valuable. Having an agent out there who is /not/ going to hold cash when cash is expected to be more valuable, in fact they'll do the opposite, means that this incentive to hold is reduced, and everyone is better off.

I.e. the actors are /benefiting/ from there being a Fed, not /exploiting it/. When I said

#+begin_quote
  individual agents expect this coordinator to intervene if things were getting out of control, they are not incentivised to take advantage of things getting out of control.
#+end_quote

The 'taking advantage of things getting out of control' would be holding more cash when monetary policy seems too tight, which causes the policy to be even tighter, which causes more agents to be incentivised to hold cash, etc.

Anyway, as I said earlier I generally agree with the claims you propose both here and in the linked post. While I welcome further elaboration if you think I'm still misunderstanding you (or you just feel like it), but my original problem is that I just don't feel I can be very confident in that belief. I don't think discussing NGDPLT directly can help with that - I couldn't present an argument against NGDPLT even if it was wrong. Sources that either show that is actually a commonly shared approach to monetary policy (i.e. my belief that there's any controversy is soundly disproved), or have economists directly arguing for and against NGDPLT (so that I could compare the quality of arguments made, rather than accuracy of any factual statements) would be much more useful here.
