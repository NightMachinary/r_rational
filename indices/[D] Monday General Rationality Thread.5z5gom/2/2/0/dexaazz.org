Yes. I generally agree with this argument, or at least with how I understand the argument (summarized below). My problem is that I also find convincing arguments from the opposing side. Thus rather than a constructive 'this is the right thing to do because of this chain of logic' argument, what I feel I need is a deconstructive analysis of the competing, internally-consistent arguments, with the assumptions behind the arguments made explicit and analysed for conflict.

The way I understand the precommitment/print-more-money argument for inflation targetting is mostly by seeing inflation targetting as a coordination problem. Everyone prefers moderately low, stable inflation [citation needed; bitcoin guys really like deflation, I guess]. But the individual incentives do not support stable inflation; without organised control small chaotic movements can blow into inflationary or deflationary reinforcing cycles. However, the cycle only works when individual actors expect all other actors to follow their individual incentives; i.e. the self-reinforcement in part relies on the expectation of a self-reinforcing cycle. Adding a powerful agent that does not act in its self interest but instead precommits to keeping inflation stable defeats most of the self-reinforcing process, because if individual agents expect this coordinator to intervene if things were getting out of control, they are not incentivised to take advantage of things getting out of control.

I'm not equipped to evaluate whether the assumptions behind inflation/deflation cycles, and the market response to trustworthy commitment to inflation targetting, are reliable. It /seems/ correct, but I would not be very surprised if an economist with an opposing view came in and pointed out complexities or externalities that are ignored by the argument.

I guess what I'm looking for is dialogue, where I don't have to evaluate the factual accuracy of assertions made by either side (which I can't evaluate), and can just look at the logical coherence of arguments made because factual inaccuracies are caught by the opposing debater.
