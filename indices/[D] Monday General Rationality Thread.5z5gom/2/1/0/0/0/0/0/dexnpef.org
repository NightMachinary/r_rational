Agreed. I just don't think the way to argue that is by calling capitalism a paperclip maximiser; instead just argue that when uncontrolled it's a runaway self-reinforcing process that is not necessarily optimising for the right things.

I.e. argue the /dangerous/ part, not the /paper-clip maximiser/ part.
