I dunno. That it was phrased "[this dynamic system] is [an agent]" is the only reason it occurred to me to describe it with the terms I did. Admittedly that's not a new /concept/ to me, it doesn't generate new ideas in and of itself, but I would rarely manage to make the claim so lucidly.

The power of analogy is that you can convey a lot of meaning and nuance in a very succinct and generalizable way.

NB: We're arguing on the meta-meta level now. We should probably stop before we get lost.
