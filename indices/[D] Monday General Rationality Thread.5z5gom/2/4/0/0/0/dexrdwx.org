Yeah, I do know that; but perhaps I haven't processed it full. I can definitely see how an increase in demand for services drives more jobs, and leads to more people focusing on things they are good at, rather than doing a bit of everything to avoid paying someone. So in a way I can see how the larger pay -> more consumption -> somewhat more specialization -> somewhat higher productivity thing could work.

It does not appear like a thing that could go on forever though, or even very far; you hit the limit of how much can be gained purely by focusing on competitive advantage.

It seems weird to me to focus on that as the main driver behind an improving economy, rather than things that, to me, seem more impactful on the productivity of persons: education (to change the degree of competitive advantage between people), technology, etc.

I guess I'm still confused, but your hint to focus more on services than goods definitely helps me understand what the movie meant in this part. Thanks!
