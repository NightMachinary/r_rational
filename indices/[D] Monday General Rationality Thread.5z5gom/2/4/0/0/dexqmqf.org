There's definitely problem of tangled terminology. Consumption in economics terms includess goods /and services/. If I hire housemaid to save my time it's consumption. If I buy weekend at buddhist retreat it's consumption. If I donate 10% of my income to charity it's consumption.

What you are thinking about is conspicuous consumption, and it isn't necessary for economy to grow. If people change their spending habits, economy would adapt.

Besides, it may look like economy is focused on making stuff but in fact 80% of U.S. economy is made of services.
