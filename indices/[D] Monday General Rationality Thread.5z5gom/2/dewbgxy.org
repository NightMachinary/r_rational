How much do you guys think it's 1. useful and 2. fun to know about economics?

Mostly asking because while the topic generally interests me, and is likely important in an abstract way (this is a thing that needs to be understood if we ever are to get a working government, but we're so far away from that it's probably not the bottleneck right now, and also nothing I can ever do will make a difference here), but I'm finding it really hard to interpret what I'm reading.

Main problem being with how politicized this area seems to be, there's a lot of people seeming very confident, and of course they don't agree with each other on almost anything. Below, I rant a bit about [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2215151/][Inequality for All]], which I've watched recently, but rather than focus on particular factual assertions, I'm more interested in the meta topic: how do you ingest information about economics, find trusted sources, and most of all evaluate claims? I've read some of [[http://www.themoneyillusion.com/][themoneyillusion]] (though most of his posts assume a thought framework that I don't have, and it's hard to extract value); and some of [[/u/EliezerYudkowsky]]'s rants. They both seem very confident (EY especially, but then EY seems confident in very many things :P) in a non-mainstream model (granted, it's been becoming more mainstream, so that's something). And while their arguments generally make sense to me, so do the opposing sides', and so it's hard to share that confidence.

Getting back to the example of Inequality for All, the author seems confident that he's making a case for a particular policy, and I just can't follow his argument from the factual assertions he's making, to why his suggested policy helps with those problems.

For example one claim from the movie that I can remember, is this rich trader guy saying he has gained <some large amount of money> from his investment into <hedge funds etc>. And then he says something like "I believe no social good was produced from these investments", which the movie just takes as a fact and doesn't elaborate on. That quote perplexes me - someone gave this man money, and presumably they gave him the money for some perceived benefit. Perhaps the social good was very small, like just providing some extra liquidity to a market so that someone else that's not speculating can buy at a lower price / sell at higher price; but it's really hard to imagine financial investment to have negative externalities on its own.

The movie extends that argument by noticing that rich people don't spend their money; they save/invest it. As opposed to the middle class, which is consumption-oriented. Which consumption, in turn, is what the movie presents as the real driving force behind the economy in what it calls a [[http://inequalityforall.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/PAGE_25.jpg][Virtuous Cycle]] - whereupon as wages increase, workers spend more, driving more demand, which leads to more production, and higher wages. To me, that just looks like a bubble?
