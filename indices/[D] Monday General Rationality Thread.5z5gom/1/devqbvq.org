Are there any "primers" for being more rational? That is, more easily consumed than academy textbooks. Something (maybe not a perfect example) like the snippet from Luminosity about /"What do I want? What do I have? How do I use what I have to get what I want?"/ to break down problems, avoid pitfalls and generally have the tools to handle everyday things rationally?
