Saw [[https://www.facebook.com/quartznews/videos/1493070964059934/][this]] interesting video recently. They had a male and female actor play the part of Hillary and Trump respectively, mimicking their mannerisms and wording from a presidential debate. The (largely liberal) audience had the reaction that female!Trump was much more trustworthy than male!Hillary.

I'm still not sure what conclusion to draw from it.
