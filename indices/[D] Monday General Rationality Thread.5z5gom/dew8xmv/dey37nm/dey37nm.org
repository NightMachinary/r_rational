From my comment about it on Facebook:

So I find this fascinating, not just on its own merits, but particularly because of something I did a couple years ago: I took clips of Game of Thrones out of context and showed them to a few friends who never read the books or watched the show. Without access to the bigger narrative, I wanted to see if I could make characters come off differently than the way they were experienced by viewers of the whole story. Obviously it made a difference, but it seemed like a fun exercise in exploring characters and narrative, and some of the reactions were still surprising.

Which is why watching these clips of the gender-swapped politicians who came off very differently than my memory of the debates made me think "Huh. How much of this effect is coming from the divorced context of the characters being played? Is it possible that changing the faces and voices of the characters is enough to disassociate the negative feelings people have of them based on their histories?"

Because as I watched this, I had to constantly remind myself that the female speaker's talking points were factually inaccurate, because yes, charisma matters... but also because I felt like I was watching something disassociated from reality. The debates weren't that long ago, but they were still immersed in the context of their time, where Trump was, from liberal perspectives, blatantly lying day after day, week after week, not to mention all the other... character flaws, let's say, that he exhibited.

So overall, I love that this was done, but I want it taken further. I want to see this reproduced as a full film that mirrors the election. Not just the debates, but rallies, speeches, press releases. Let us get used to these two characters, Jonathan Gordon and Brenda King. Let us really feel what we felt about them again, from the left and the right, but gender flipped, THEN see how we judge them.

Because I think the context is important to just about everything in life, including our reactions of King's attitude and Gordon's affect, as seen in these debate videos. Just like context was important in judging whether Cersei was a benevolent and wise queen or Arya was a bloodthirsty psychopath in my own "experiment."
