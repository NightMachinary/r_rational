Not at all. Thank you for letting me know, I seem to have scattered a bit of info about the story over multiple areas. I forgot that there is no readily available abstract directly on the site. When I work on some revisions and 'sprucing up' of the site in the next few weeks, I'll make sure it gets posted.

The present one available is this one:

/A serialized web-fiction in the Swords & Sorcery genre/

/The world of Aelth Myrris is dying, the world-god is in her death throes. This was not caused by rampant environmental devastation, the fall-out of some cataclysmic war, nor a random happenstance of celestial events. This act of murder was entirely intentional, caused by capricious, hidden entities even more powerful than the gods themselves./

/The many groups that call the world-god Myrris home have been abandoned. Once proud societies are crumbling into ruin and barbarity, as those with ambition vie to seize what few bits of fading power they can. Still, amidst this tumult, there are stories to be told about those few who cling to life, wanting more than power and trinkets. This is the saga of those few who hope for a better future, who defy the hidden entities that devour their world, who refuse to be the pawns of fate./
