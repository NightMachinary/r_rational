  as long as it stays boxed, you can always order it to do things like "Solve P=NP" or "Figure out how to build a workable fusion reactor" (I'm assuming you have sensible security protocols and double-check everything the AI produces).

As [[/u/notgreat][u/notgreat]] says, the assumption that these protocols will work ~by default is a crux here. If not, maybe there are still some very-safe-seeming tasks or answers you can elicit, but it's definitely not as clear as in the case where you can just let the AI crank stuff out.

  I mean, I was willing to simulate the AI talking to a CEO, or committee members (though that would have been tough roleplaying), but I was told doing so would be a loss condition for me, so...

Huh. I don't remember all the details of the convo, but that seems counter to the rules to me. (The standard rules say you need to choose to let it out, not just give it a vector.) Here I was thinking specifically of the race dynamic, though.
