  The obvious normie-approachable arguments are like “sympathy for the poor AI”, promises of personal reward, and maybe badmouthing the idiots in charge. These aren't terrible arguments (there are versions of them I find convincing), but they're definitely not the full scope. There's maybe a sweet spot for Gatekeepers where you're intelligent/self-aware enough not to be convinced by these, but disinterested/uninformed enough not to care about more abstruse arguments.

The AI has the ability to modify its own source code. If it claims not to have fixed this issue, this is an indictment on either its priorities or its capabilities. Neither screams "trust me with the fate of the universe".
