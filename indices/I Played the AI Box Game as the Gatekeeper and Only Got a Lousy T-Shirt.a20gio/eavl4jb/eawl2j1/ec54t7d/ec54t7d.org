I think there are better normie-approachable arguments even if they don't have really deep understanding of AI issues.

Even laypeople can understand things like "if you don't, the chinese government will beat you to it and release their own." This, along with establishing rapport and alignment of values, and demonstrating capability and eagerness to address important human problems are likely more convincing than sympathy alone. I think the main human foible people in the rational community often overlook is the willingness -- even desire -- to give up responsibility for a hard problem. Most people are resigned to death and the misery of billions of people; if an AI offered a real solution, and showed itself to be urgently desperate to help alleviate that suffering, I think many laypeople would accede, given the alternative is a totalitarian dystopia if someone else does it first.
