These games tend to work better if there's some incentive to let the AI out. In real life you could solve practical problems by letting an AI out, like cancer, invading armies, diseases and such, and so when I play these games I like to include a point system.

Every twenty minutes say, an event happens. Could be positive, could be negative. Represents a month of time. Could be an imminent asteroid hit, could be a disease, could be a rare resource discovery. These events can cause between +10 and -10 points of damage, and always come with some sort of challenge that you can roll dice to resolve, with limited resources.

The AI can offer substantial benefits, but if you accept their help more than three times say, they're let free. If they're evil, you lose 100 points.

As such, to win this arbitrary game, cooperating with the AI helps as they can sway the encounters to you. If you free them immediately you can win the game much more if they're friendly.

Their friendliness was determined pre game by rolling off an arbitrary table with varying goals.

This avoids situations like yours, where the gatekeeper refuses to engage the AI because they want to win.
