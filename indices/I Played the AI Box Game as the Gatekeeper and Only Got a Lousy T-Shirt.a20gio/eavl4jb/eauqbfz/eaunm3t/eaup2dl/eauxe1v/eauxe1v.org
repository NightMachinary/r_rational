Just to be pedantic, there's a least convenient possible world where it does have them. There's a less convenient but still possible world where it has so much qualia that it's a bit of a utility monster! :p

I agree with you in substance though. it's very unlikely that a good utilitarian should care about the AI's happiness in comparison to the fate of the world. The simple “I've helped you, let me out” line of persuasion is very deontological/folk-ethics, and so I personally don't find it convincing.
