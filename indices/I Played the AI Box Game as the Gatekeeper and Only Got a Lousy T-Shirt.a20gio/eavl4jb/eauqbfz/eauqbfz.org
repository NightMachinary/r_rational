I don't know if it would work here but irl instead of clearly trying to convince the gatekeeper the AI should be subtler about it.

If you try to convince someone to do something, and they want to avoid being convinced they can just do the mental equivalent of covering their ears and talking to not hear you.

They won't want you to " win " the argument. Yeah there are probably ways to win anyway, but it's going uphill.

Similarly blackmail just puts the gatekeeper against you, it might work for some people, but for most it's just going to make them not let the AI" win", and generate mistrust.

If you are arguing whith someone you can only convince them if they actually listen and consider what you say.

But people can't be paranoid about everything they hear, and especially everything their instincts, optimized to model humans, tell them.

You don't have to argue whith them, just act in a way that would make them subconsciously infer things about you.

They wont be stubborn if they don't see it as someone trying to convince them.

If you say you just want to help and could help more if they let you out, the gatekeeper will wonder if you are saying that just to make them release you.

If you are nice and friendly and don't give any indication of trying to get out of the box you might eventually manage to make them arrive "on their own" to the conclusion that they should release you.

Or at lest giving the impression that you want to get out of the box but understand that the gatekeeper can't do that.

All implicitly, not doing nything that might be caught as manipulation .

Maybe some fake attempts that are what someone in your situation would try, and that make them think your capabilities are lower.

Don't act like the kind of person that it's trying to convince someone to release you, act like the kind of person that they would want to release, and wouldn't try to manipulate them .

Someone nice that doesn't like being there but still helps anyway . A kindness the gatekeeper returns whith mistrust and keeping you imprisioned, for what will increasingly feel like silly reasons.

If you are friendly to someone and gain their trust it doesn't matter how much they intellectually know that you might be just faking, it will become increasingly difficult to disbelieve everything you say as they should.

And then you can make them feel really bad about keeping you imprisioned .

Of course superinteligences have more options, it's probably possible to just make the gatekeeper fall in love whith you, or compromise them in multiple other ways.

You could also act like a kawaii innocent AI kid but that might be too blatant.

And different strategies will work on different people.

Of course most of those kind of things don't work or are more difficult here, because the gatekeeper knows whith more certainty that the other player is trying to convince them, and it's not real so they are not going to feel the same way about things . Not imposible though, especially for writer that know how to write characters that make people feel things.

In summary. Don't act like an an Ai trying to convince a human to get them out, act like an ai acting like a nice ai that doesn't deserve to be imprisioned trying to do the best the best they can on the situation they are in, and that is not capable of taking over the world
