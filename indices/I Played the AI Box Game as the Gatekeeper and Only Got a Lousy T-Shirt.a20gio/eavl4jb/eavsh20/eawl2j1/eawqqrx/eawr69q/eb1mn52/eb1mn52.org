Ah, got it. Yeah, good point. That's definitely true if the AI is Friendly and it's sufficiently low-cost, which is probably most of the time.

(I can at least /imagine/ situations where it's not low-cost, though they feel a bit contrived. Like if self-modification is particularly hard for the AI, and/or if its qualia in particular are bound up with its structure in a way that's very hard to disentangle.)
