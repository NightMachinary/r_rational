  On a side note, I really have been enjoying your characterization of the the Snake Sannin as a rational 'villain', it makes him a fascinating character and adversary.

Thank you. I've said before, and I still feel, that he's the most fun character in the story to write and I suspect to read. It's a bit problematic, because the heroes really should be the most fun, but he's just so engaging...I get to be unabashedly evil when I write him, and that's the sweet sugar of the soul.
