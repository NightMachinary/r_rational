You mention that Kurama presents the trolley problem inverted from its usual. It seems that this is perhaps an approach to make Naruto consider the virtues of non-action as a choice. Interestingly, it also had a dichotomy of Sound vs. Konoha, one vs many, likable vs unlikable.

Personally, Naruto needs to invest in a more thorough ethical framework rather than attempting to do everything - as you've pointed out, this simply defers conflict and responsibility.

On a side note, I really have been enjoying your characterization of the the Snake Sannin as a rational 'villain', it makes him a fascinating character and adversary.
