Firstly, I would like to thank you for writing this novel and your continued dedication to it.

Secondly, the fox clearly had a lot more information than he should have been able to gather given the restraints that the seal supposedly placed on him.

Thirdly, you seem to consider the implied release of an eldritch horror sealed away by the ancients to be a good note. I approve.
