Ok ok OK /OK/.

I get it.

I ask for a chapter, just a anything to get me by, and you give us this... mountain of a cliffhanger. It's like giving a thirsty man some sour sherbets, then when he asks for something to quench the thirst, you offer a dollop of Ghost Chili.

Of course, you're now only your merry way to disappear for the next month with that NanowriMo thing, and I have to sit here burning through my imagination as I try to work out all the possible consequences of having a Kurama on the loose.
