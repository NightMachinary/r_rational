- Rapid prototype expensive equipment.
- If you can create /specific/ objects, like part #352 from batch 402 of the John Smith Space Parts Plant, destructively test them in the room. If not, have them brought to you for destructive testing; they'll revert to normal after you're done.
- Solve arbitrary computation-intensive problems by screwing with physics to give your computers faster computational speed / arbitrary information density.
- /Examine/ objects at the atomic level. Simulate them with the aforementioned arbitrary compute power.
