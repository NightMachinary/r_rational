1] If you're in a vehicle, you can run inside of the vehicle and constantly accelerate it to match you.

2] You could engineer a [[https://i.imgur.com/wJ1I2Gx.png][vehicle]] (I'm an amazing artist, I know.) with sufficient acceleration to escape gravity and even quickly reach the speed of light. Have a bunch of spinnable wheels mounted inside of a much larger box. Strap wizards into the wheels. Spin the wheels. Whenever the people inside of the wheels are moving towards your target, have them activate their magic and accelerate the vehicle in that direction.

Accelerating the outside vehicle will quickly cause them to accelerate by the same amount, because of the weird way in which the wizard is moving relative to the outside vehicle.

I'm sure there's some better way to do that one, but that's the basic idea.

3] Free energy/crazy new labor options.

etc. The power is basically the same as regular telekinesis, as Roxolan said.
