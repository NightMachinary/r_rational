Warp seems to be the most useful, intuitively understanding the laws of physics (and magic) is an incredible advantage. As for weaknesses, it is hard to see how knowing the way the world work puts you at a disadvantage against somebody unknowing.

I have trouble understanding what you can do with the other talents.

Does "manifest your will into concrete existence" mean you can use telekinesis? Cast a fireball? Do you need high willpower to use Weft effectively?

What is a "change into the fabric of reality"? Creating matter ex nihilo? Changing the laws of physics in an area? If so, it is extremely powerful, especially if combined with Warp.

Let's say somebody cast a spell neat a Comb user. Can the ripples of magic be used to cast another spell? to counter the original spell? to make a long lasting effect at the spot the magic was used?

With Sight, you can see the "fabric of reality" what does that mean? can you see the space-time continuum? The laws of physics?
