Warp does give you an intuitive understanding of the laws of magic equivalent to, say, our daily lives giving us an intuitive understanding of the laws of physics. (Not every runner can verbalize Newton's laws, but every runner feels them in their ankles.)

High willpower is needed for Weft, though you could safely assume that nobody will low willpower is going to have weaksauce Weft, they just won't have it. As to what you can do with it? A directed fireball or precise telekinetic strike would require Weft & Shuttle, but a flamethrower spell could be done with just Weft. Creating matter ex nihilo or changing the laws of physics, much the same, with only Weft you can't do precise things, but you can do things.

With Comb you can absolutely use the aftermagic to cast another spell (though if the original caster has Comb themselves you're trying to shape something already shaped; that's very hard). Countering the original spell is tricky, because definitionally more power went into the spell than can be Combed out of it; if it's a long-lasting spell you can unravel it and there might be consequences (backlash, explosion possibly included), if it's an instantaneous spell maybe you can destructure it or redirect it. Long-lasting effects, I'm having trouble seeing a way to do that that isn't just another spell, so that would require at a minimum one of Shuttle or Weft.

Sight is like having another sense. It sees the nature of things, it sees patterns (including false ones, just like our other senses see false patterns), it sees magic and power as it pools and moves and is drawn and is cast. You can't see the space-time continuum or the laws of physics, but you could see the magic involved in a spell that made a micro-singularity, get a sense for whether/how it was Combed, probably see the ways in which it was twisting spacetime (though not grasp it unless you knew what you were looking for), that sort of thing.

These are great questions which are helping me think in different ways about the system! Thank you!
