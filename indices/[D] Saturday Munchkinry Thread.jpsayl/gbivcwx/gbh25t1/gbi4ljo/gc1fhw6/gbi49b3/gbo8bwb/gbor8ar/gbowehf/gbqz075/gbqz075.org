You've gotta have a pretty good shield to laugh off a high-caliber rifle round, and if someone is high-Warp, they'll probably know it's not going to put you down, so they won't fire until it will.

Obviously there are plenty of people with shields that good, but there're also plenty who don't; even a Fiver (wizard with all five of the talents) might have a weakness, might have to drop a shield to use the Sight, might have a flinch reflex to being shot at, might have just engineered their shield badly.

If you've read S. L. Huang's novels featuring Cas Russell, that's a good showcase of what someone with high Warp could do. (And also some things they'd be weak to.)
