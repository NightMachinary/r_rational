Warp + Sight gives a combination that can understand almost anything.

Weft + Shuttle gives a wizard who has the magical equivalent of a swiss army knife in a dark room - he can do a lot, but he can't see what you are doing.

Sight+Comb makes for an /infuriating/ opponent. He can't do a thing on his own, but the moment you fire off a spell, he redirects it and uses the echoes to do what /he/ wants done.

Warp+Weft makes for an interesting combination - he can only do imprecise effects, but he can do them precisely where and when they will be most effective. (If he limits himself to probability alteration, he can get away with merely looking /incredibly/ lucky).
