- How fast does the conversion occur? This significantly impacts potential strategies, since a day-long conversion process is far easier to mitigate than the absurd case of conversion which takes place in under a second (which could end up close to /28 Days Later/).

- Is there any variability in conversion time? In other words, could some people get bitten, think they're fine, and then later turn into me?

  Only their bodies and minds change into yours, not their clothes etc. They gain/lose mass magically to match yours. You do not get their knowledge or skills.

- If they are injured or have other medical problems at the time of conversion, do those problems go away when they are converted into me?

- Would biting a copy of myself cause that copy to turn into a more recent version of me?

- How injured does someone need to be before biting them does not convert them into a copy of me? For example, if they had a heart attack and their heart is no longer beating, but I bite them and then start providing CPR, would they still convert?
