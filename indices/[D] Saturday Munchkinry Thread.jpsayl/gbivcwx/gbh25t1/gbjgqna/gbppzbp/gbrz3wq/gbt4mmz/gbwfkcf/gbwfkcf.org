I'll go for the scenario in Round 2. Given the longer conversion time, this couldn't reliably be used to end a fight, so both the existence of the clones and the means of making them would need to be kept a secret for quite a while. Biting would need to be done in a controlled situation where the victims can't escape or report it. To minimize the flood of missing person reports, growing the evil clone horde would probably require targeting lone undocumented immigrants initially.

Transportation is tricky; driving around with four clones in a car would draw suspicion unless they could effectively pull a Borat and use disguises to ensure that the four clones look nothing alike. That's certainly a technique they would still need to keep to a minimum, preferably keeping all clones at home or traveling solo as much as possible. Additionally, getting a few replacement driver's licenses might be feasible, but more than 3-4 could quickly draw suspicion, so they'd be limited in how many vehicles could be simultaneously operated legally. International travel would be even harder, and likely require a single clone doing a tour of several countries and leaving clones behind to further plans in each.

Beyond the secrecy requirement, there's also economic considerations at play here. Each copy is another mouth to feed, another body to clothe, and another bed to fill. For the horde to grow sustainably, the copies would need to pay their keep. The best option is probably to select jobs which can be done remotely, and without necessarily being hired and needing to provide photo ID. Software development could fit the bill, such as making games and selling them on Steam. However, this gets tricky when filing taxes.

For example, if there's 100 clones, the weird income situation would probably trigger an IRS audit which would find maybe 100 times as much income as could be expected for a typical software developer, along with expenses which include enough food and clothing for 100 people, enough computers for about 100 people, and oddly something like 10 "vacation" homes. This would probably have to be justified by frequently giving away clothing at some kind of church give-away, giving food to a local food bank, as well as running an online computer store to claim the 100+ computers as "inventory" for the store.

As the horde grows, having only one ID would start to become a major roadblock. It wouldn't be possible to send a dozen or so clones to college without classmates Googling them and finding way too many results for one person. However, making fake IDs for this purpose (unofficial to semi-official IDs) could be done relatively easily. One clone could hire a lawyer in Delaware to legitimately set up a Delaware-based corporation (providing anonymity for the founder), then set up a branches of it wherever clones need IDs, and print off employee photo IDs for the clones. These would suffice for taking a GED which could then be used to apply for college under the new name. Each clone would still need to find their own 'Borat' style to reduce the risk of chance encounters with people that other clones have interacted with. While this wouldn't work for employment or driver's licenses, it would be better than nothing.

With IDs semi-solved, the next step would be development and specialization. The leader obviously needs to stay in absolutely peak physical health, probably doing cardio and body building for at least five hours per day while maintaining excellent preventative health care. A few hundred specialists would need to be assigned to a broad range of fields like rifle marksmanship, pistol quick-drawing, MMA techniques, defensive driving, lockpicking, etc., but also with assignments for things like pilot school, medical school, communications technology, chemistry, physics, electrical engineering, foreign languages, and so on. As long as they're each going to different colleges or training programs spread over a wide area, possibly several countries, and as long as the payments are done in cash to minimize any electronic trail, they would hopefully escape notice.

After perhaps eight to ten years of lying as low as possible, these specialists (and others who focused on planning) should be ready. They would be brought back and "freed of their mortal shell" to merge their consciousness with the leader. The leader would then update all the other copies, giving all the benefits of peak physical health, encyclopedic breadth and depth of knowledge in nearly all subject matter, fluency in every major foreign language, expert-level skill in firearms and hand-to-hand combat, etc. Basically Jason Bourne with about 100 PhDs and even greater strength and stamina.

At this point, the horde could start to go international, expanding into non-English speaking countries. The first phase of major expansion would likely target rural and underdeveloped areas across the world, anywhere cellphone networks aren't available. At the same time, cruise ships might be targeted, with their communications systems being disabled just prior to mass conversion of everyone onboard.

The second phase would require a near-global communications blackout. Undersea internet cables would need to be cut, radio and TV stations would need to be either directly disabled or indirectly through power outages, etc. At this phase, the clones go into combat mode. Entire cities are searched and converted overnight. Over the next two weeks or so, the hordes take over every major population center in the world. This might result in Russia or China launching nukes in response to an apparent US invasion, followed by NATO retaliation. This would be a major problem, but as long an original set are kept in secure bunkers around the world, any clones suffering from radiation sickness could be treated with a bite from an original.

The third phase would involve rebuilding and restoring power and communications, along with all other economic and infrastructural necessities. Obviously, these would not be supplied to any remaining non-clone holdouts, so eventually they'd run out of food, water, fuel, medical supplies, etc. With time, 99% of the world would end up as clones or dead.

  Reverse Round: you are in charge of a task force intent on stopping such a self-copying Menace. By the time The Task Force is organised, the Copier had made 10 copies in EU, 10 in the US, and 10 in China.

If they're spreading in China already, they've probably had a decade or so to develop language skills, among a wide variety of other skills. This would be late in the game and extremely dangerous. Evidence of the threat would need to be presented to world leaders immediately to direct all possible resources towards tracking and arresting the clones. Rural areas would need to be evacuated, ships would need to be returned to port, cities would need to be readied for fighting back, and the clones' images would need to be presented on practically every TV station and webpage.
