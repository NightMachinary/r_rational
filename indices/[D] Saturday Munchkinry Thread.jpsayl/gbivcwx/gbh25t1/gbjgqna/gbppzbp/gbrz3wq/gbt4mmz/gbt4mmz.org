- there is a small variability in time of conversion, depending on how severe the bite was, but in general its between a minute and an hour tops. The change is not gradual, but rather comes in a sudden burst.

- Medical problems are undone by conversion, unless the person is already dead (brain death and no life functions). They can be severely injured prior, but as long as the brain is still alive, they can be converted into a copy of you.

- If a copy bites a copy, it can be up-dated, but not down-dated.

- A copy cannot be more healthy than the higher tier copy that made it (in other words, copies inherit injuries, disease etc).
