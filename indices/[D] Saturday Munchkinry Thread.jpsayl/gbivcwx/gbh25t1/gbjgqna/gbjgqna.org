You wish to help people (and preferably humanity as a whole) and are incredibly powerful.... inside of an isolated 8 foot x 10 foot x 8 foot room. Inside the room you are completely immortal, can create any object that is either naturally occurring or has been made by humans before, can manipulate matter with atomic precision, and can alter the laws of physics (with a few exceptions noted below) at a whim.

However, no effect generated from inside the room can affect anything outside the room. Anything you take out of the room will "revert" to how it was before entering. For example, if you bring in laptop parts and assemble them in the room, they will go back to being parts when you take the device out. The only exception is that humans retain their memories when leaving the room.

A few additional things you cannot do with your power:

- No time or space fuckery (You cannot for example, do anything to give yourself more time to act in the room relative to the outside, nor can you alter space to give yourself more effective room than the 8x10x8 provided.)
- You must actually know specifically what object are trying to create with your power (For example, thinking "I want to create the cure for cancer" will not work, even if there is a naturally occurring substance somewhere that would effectively cure all types of cancer).
