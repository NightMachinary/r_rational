Create a copy of a brain, test things on brain copy, practice makes perfect. I don't know whether an individual brain counts as an "object" though for creation purposes.

Could also find some exploits based on whatever definition of human is employed, how clones are counted, and how much you could "ship of theseus" a clone into not counting as human or the other way around.

Also humans retaining memories opens the door to brainwashing folks to various degrees. Saying "okay I'm going to brainwash racism out of people" could be considered beneficial.
