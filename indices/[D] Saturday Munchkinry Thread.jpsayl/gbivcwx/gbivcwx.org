I was reading a story where acceleration and deceleration were different forms of magic. This got me thinking. If you only have deceleration what could you do.

Rules(through not the ones from a hero's war)

You are aware of any macro scale motion within 10 meters of you.

You may set any object's velocity to any velocity between yours and its current velocity. Ie deceleration relative to you.

You may affect multiple objects at once, as many as you can focus on.

If an object is only partly within your range, only that part will be affected, but it will drag the rest.

Objects travelling too fast will past by before you can react.

You have the power described above. What can you use it for? How would you exploit it. How would a civilization exploit it if some fraction has it.
