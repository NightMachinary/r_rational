Being pushed into specific forms would cause all sorts of culture fuckery. Everyone being able to see who is stronger or weaker for statue specs seems open to discrimination. Also massive dysphoria for people opting into stature for any social/cultural pressures.

Also the stronger you are the faster you can complete quests, meaning any individual who pulls too far ahead of the pack will grow increasingly stronger than their peers. If quests have a set number of people that can complete them, the strongest folks become unkillable dictators from snatching up quests first. If quests are repeatable, it means organisations can conspire to hamper others and control the geographic area of the quest, which is harder but still achievable.
