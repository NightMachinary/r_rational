The archetype thing is partially there to make serious questers recognizable as all heck. It is possible to have the look without being one, but that will likely land you in trouble. (This is also one upside to integration. Someone with only heavy integration investment is superhuman.. but not visibly recognizable)

Investiture can break the limits of the humanly possible, but not the /physically/ possible - the abilities granted are not themselves magical. (Because that would require ongoing expenditure by the granting powers, not just a one-time working)
