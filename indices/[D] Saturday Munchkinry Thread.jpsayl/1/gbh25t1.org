Magic has five talents:

- Warp, which is an intuitive understanding of the world

- Weft, which is the ability to manifest your will into concrete existence

- Shuttle, which is the ability to weave a change into the fabric of reality

- Comb, which is the ability to shape the after effects / wake / ripples of magical usage (this can be the actual point of a spell, or it can just be a beneficial side effect; discrete comb effects have themselves (weaker) combable wakes)

- Sight, which is the ability to see (perceive; it's not strictly ocular) magic and the fabric of reality

What do you feel, as a reader, are the most and least powerful one- and two-talent combinations? How would you use your /lack/ of a talent as an advantage in some scenario? Best I can come up with is basically magical flashbangs for people without the Sight.
