Identity Virus Supervillain:

- you gain the power to turn people into a copy of yourself, whenever you bite them (the bite must draw blood)

- Only their bodies and minds change into yours, not their clothes etc. They gain/lose mass magically to match yours. You do not get their knowledge or skills.

- whenever one of your copies die, their memories, knowledge, and skills gained since their creation are beamed to the original, to seamlessly add to their own. All further copies made personally by the original get that extra skills. The process is cumulative, and depends on the copies being quantum entangled, or something similar.

- Copies are instinctively loyal to the copy who "made" them, and that one to their progenitor, etc back to the original. Copies instinctively know which of them is of "older generation" and thus have automatic leadership structure.

How would you utilize this power to take over the world the fastest, most optimally and efficiently?

Round 1: your goal is simply to take over the world ie: become its greatest political and military superpower, able to call the shots on a planetary scale. At least 90% of humanity must be de-facto ruled by Yous.

Round 2: your goal is to convert EVERYONE into a copy of yourself. At least 99% of humanity must either become You or dead.

Reverse Round: you are in charge of a task force intent on stopping such a self-copying Menace. By the time The Task Force is organised, the Copier had made 10 copies in EU, 10 in the US, and 10 in China.
