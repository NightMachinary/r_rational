Warp is the weakest to have as a single talent.

Assuming any amount of organisation, community, or knowledge sharing, a large chubk of Warp can be taught. Weft, Shuttle and Comb can't be taught, Sight might be able to be mimicked to some degree with manipulation of the previous three.

Warp at the highest level of ability, or combined with another talent as an effectiveness multiplier, would be reasonable, but knowledge without power won't be up to snuff in the majority of cases. You don't have to know how to build a gun to pull the trigger, and you can't put a bullet in someone with only knowledge.

(that might be too combat-focused an assessment of strength, but that is the immediate connotation of "powerful" to me. Also Warp may have uses in trickery, misdirection, and misinformation, but that may be countered by Sight depending on how things work)
