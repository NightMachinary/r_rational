You're definitely spot-on about the ability to teach/learn your way around not having Warp, and you're right about the immense force-multiplier of community/organization for non-Fiver wizards.

I would say this about high-Warp single-talents: a nigh-perfect intuitive understanding of the world and of the workings of magic means that your entirely mundane bullet out of your entirely mundane firearm is going to have perfect aim and hit the exact weakest point on the enemy's shield.
