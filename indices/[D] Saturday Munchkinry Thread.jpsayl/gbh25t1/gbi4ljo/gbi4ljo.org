What is the difference between

#+begin_quote
  manifest your will into concrete existence
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  weave a change into the fabric of reality
#+end_quote

I would think that Warp + Sight would be an effective information gathering combo. Comb with Sight speaks to me as the most powerful Comb-based two-talent builds.
