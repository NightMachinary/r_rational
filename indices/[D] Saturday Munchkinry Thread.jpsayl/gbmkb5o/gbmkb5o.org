So. Been reading some gamer and system fic, and decided that most of these systems are fundamentally not well designed, and also involve terrifying levels of mind-rewriting, so been doodling on a more coherent system.

Rules: There is no such thing as grinding, xp for killing, or buying skills. Upgrades can be won solely from questing, which in-universe are tasks set by spiritual or temporal powers who have the ability to generate the currency the system runs on. This currency is named Talents.

Stats:

Stature:

Your physical form. Investing talents in this will make your body better, starting with the lowest hanging fruit (fixing health problems), and escalating towards making you a paragon of whatever you are. Your ideas about what this looks like do not matter, the System has its own opinion, and it will not make you into a bodybuilder or skinny super model, but basically give you the build of a top mma fighter or dancer. With very symmetrical features and amazing skin. People with any significant investiture in stature also find it /incredibly/ difficult to change their bodies by diet or training. (or the lack of it)

Integration: This basically improves your non-central nervous system. Nerve ending density in muscles, skin, signal speed, senses, ect. This will make you faster, stronger (because you can use stature more effectively) and more graceful, and more perceptive. It will not teach you how to fight or dance, though it will make you a very apt pupil.

Cognito: This basically improves your /central/ nervous system. Not by rewiring it, but by making it function better as, well, an organ. Subjectively, this feels like you are at the very top of your game all the time, and it gets progressively easier to remember things and learn. At high levels, it also means you can ignore the need for sleep for extended periods with no immediate downsides, and various other side effects. Like stature, investiture in Cognito also fixes outright cognitive disorders of the brain first.

Soul: Increases your integration into the supernatural world. You cannot be a mage without soul investiture, but investiture will not by itself suffice, it is a skill.

Opinions?
