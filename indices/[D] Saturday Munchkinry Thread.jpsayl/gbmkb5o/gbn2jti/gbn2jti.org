I guess the initial questions are what this system is in aid of, and how many people have access to this system? Is this fueling a sword and board fantasy adventure and disregarding how a society works? Or are you looking for world building implications for everyone being able to solve genetic deformities by completing some quests?

There's some overlap between stature and cognito, since being generally healthier improves brain performance.

Stature pushing your body towards very specific forms is a little weird, since training differently for different tasks will give you very different physical results. Runners look very different from weightlifters, especially internally. Some athletes gain benefits from higher bodyfat content. Will women be just as strong as men with the same points into stature? Will this disregard various biological realities such as height or muscle mass?

Integration seems kind of weak. Enhanced senses is nice, but as a whole it seems like the worst stat to focus on. Good to put some points into, but you're going to getting diminishing returns pretty quick.

It's kind of impossible to judge what soul would do as a stat without knowing what magic does. Magic could make any of the above stats much better than they are, or render them mostly superfluous.
