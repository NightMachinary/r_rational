I gilded a low-scoring comment there, to check this out (with the plan to gild all of them if it worked) but it still looks hidden to me, so I don't think it works.

EDIT: Eh, what the hell, I'm gonna gild them all anyway, lest someone considers the gilding of just one as favouring it unfairly or something. I can afford it and ketura deserves it for the effort anyway.
