I'd like to note that I downvoted 4 or so posts which I really like --- which go into details and nuances that distinguish the concept from others --- but any average, non-PhD holding redditor directed to the sub (someone who would benefit from reading ratfic most) would fall asleep on the third or so sentence.

In retrospect, brainstorming the content and then the form separately would be a better way to go. Nevertheless there are enough readable sidebar proposals to proceed.
