During discussions, the following ideas for the definition seemed to be popular:

- [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8xqtp0/meta_rrational_characteristics_of_rational/e26dscc/][It's inclusive, not exclusive]]. It shouldn't be a list of must-have attributes, but a relatively vague definition, with /possibly/ a list of emergent properties.

- [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8xqtp0/meta_rrational_characteristics_of_rational/e254z4e/][It defines what it /does/, not what it /is/]]. E. g., instead of saying "rational fiction has sensible characters", it says "rational fiction focuses on exploring thoughtful characters".

- [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8xqtp0/meta_rrational_characteristics_of_rational/e25tfp1/][It has a grab-bag of adjacent tropes]].

- [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8xqtp0/meta_rrational_characteristics_of_rational/e2f02fa/][It defines "rationality" as a qualifier, not as a genre]].

- [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8xqtp0/meta_rrational_characteristics_of_rational/e299xvf/][It describes author intent, not emergent properites]].

I disagree with the last one, but the rest seems sensible, if possibly not /absolutely/ necessary. I think your proposal, as it is now, isn't that different from the sidebar one.
