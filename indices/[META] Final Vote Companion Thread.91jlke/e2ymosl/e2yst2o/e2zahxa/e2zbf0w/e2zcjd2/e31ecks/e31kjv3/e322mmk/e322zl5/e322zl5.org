I regret not taking part in the discussions, because regardless of popularity/consensus, those first two points are just /wrong/, not only because they fail to rectify the problems with the current definition but because they're actively antithetical to the point of having a definition in the first place. /How/ on /earth/ was a consensus reached that the new definition shouldn't actually be a definition?
