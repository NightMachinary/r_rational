1. I agree with the principle (most of my previous replies were to the same effect), but a definition is -by definition- creating boundaries and exclusions. Like most of these bullets, it has the problem of edging into convoluted legalese, e.g. "including but not limited to". However it's entirely possible to word a definition to be open to interpretation. If your concern is excluding emergent properties, the best way to crack open my or anyone's definition is to identify what it has wrongly excluded.

2. [[/u/haiku_fornification]] had an interesting idea, but the example was flawed. I like the idea that ratfics should explore the setting, but I'm not sure whether it's /necessary/ in the inclusive/exclusive sense. "Coherent" is funnily enough a synonym for "logical and consistent." It's certainly true that consistency can be an accidental byproduct of ignoring the setting, but we also have to ask whether a story can be a ratfic if the rules aren't consistent (coherent). I feel like that's a binary that's non-negotiable in the spirit of rationality. Nevertheless, I feel like my 2nd/3rd sentences of #3 is an adequate qualifier/substitute for "explore" and being more than just internal consistency; "exploring" can also be implied in the wording (e.g. #1-2).

3. A list of adjacent tropes and themes is useful for this subreddit's fiction-hunting purposes, but not necessary as part of the core definition. It does more closely approximate what [[/r/rational]] values in a rational story, but it's too diverse. I feel like there's an important distinction to be made between a comprehensive definition and a sidebar definition. My issue with most of the redefinitions is that they read like wikipedia articles, attempting to capture everything rather than introducing fundamental or common themes.

4. I like the idea that rationality comes in a spectrum. However, in a definition, it's avoiding responsibility for pinning down the genre. Anyways the response covered the issues with thinking of rationality as only a quality.

5. I disagree as well. A genre shouldn't be defined by the author's intent, as it is the readers who decide what qualifies. Though [[/u/ArisKatsaris]]'s actual definition is more a combination between #2 (defining what RT does) and #4 (list of qualities).

You didn't give an actual analysis, so I'm not sure what you're thinking, but I didn't write the proposal to overhaul the sidebar definition. My intentions were to cover the fundamental issues people had with it (mainly being overly specific and vague in areas) while also incorporating what I saw as the common threads in all of the other definitions.
