I think it's worth it to avoid a wordy or pedantic definition, but this is catching the edges of ideology and our expectations for the sub. I'm not supporting a lax, indiscriminate definition. Identity demarcation is important, but it isn't black and white, as the differing choices of emphasis of each redefinition has shown. Part of the attraction of [[/r/rational][r/rational]] is turning these irrational stories/characters into great rational fics and as long as the new specific definition doesn't intimidate a new reader/writer in its attempt to be correct, it's serving a good enough purpose.
