But is that /really/ something worth aiming for? Something approachable/accessible which catches the attention of random passers-by?

This is how I see it.

Accurate or accessible, either way the definition will function in part as a filtering mechanism. I think the community and the genre itself would benefit from a more accurate definition so newcomers can get their bearings straight and filter themselves out if they aren't a good match for the community.

It's not a sour grapes attitude, it's just a necessity; demarcating yourself as "a community" or "a genre" and defining who or what is a part of it implicitly means that you're also defining who or what /isn't/ a part of it. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. House and Doc Brown and Rick Sanchez - as great as those characters are - aren't part of it. That doesn't mean we think there's something inherently inferior about Sherlock Holmes and it doesn't mean that we hate him, it just means that he belongs here about as much as he belongs in the MCU or a Victorian romance or a stoner comedy or a Tolkienesque fantasy.

The whole point of rewriting the sidebar is to try to make the definition more specific, because as it stands it's already too accessible. If the definition is too accessible/inclusive and doesn't differentiate rational/ist fiction as its own genre, /any/ work from /any/ genre could be argued as being "rational" as long as it's got characters who behave believably and world-building without any holes in it. Whatever the new definition ends up being, it should make sure that potential future authors and community members write and submit content that belongs here so the genre doesn't end up getting diluted into irrelevance.
