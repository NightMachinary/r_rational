Sounds like a rather droll mirror of [[http://www.chs.ubc.ca/participatory/docs/Paradox%20of%20Democracy.htm][the paradox of democracy]]. The active sub vets, rationality-educated "citizenry" are the ones are who are most involved in the redefining process, and the more lukewarm, apathetic members (like me) merely engage in the final product of the process: the vote. I'm self-conscious of my complicity in this discontinuity, but I'm not surprised I'm not the only one commenting given the disproportionate emphasis on voting in a democracy. Someone made a joke about appointing a Benevolent Dictator For Life - is it time to execute?

I'm not advocating an /exciting/ definition. The words I emphasized are cogency and approachability. However, I don't think it's beneficial to hold a sour grapes attitude toward potential newcomers on the basis of rationality pedagogy. I'm more for "if they're even remotely interested, give them a reason to stick around longer."
