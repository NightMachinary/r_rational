Fair enough.

Voting started eight hours ago, and three people already stated similar opinions. It implies that a statistically non-insignificant part of the community shares this concern, yet it wasn't raised almost at all during actual discussions. It's concerning.

And frankly, I disagree with it. I don't think that trying to tailor the definition for people who don't want to read one sentence unless it's /exciting/ is a good idea. If they're so disinterested, they won't stay around anyway.
