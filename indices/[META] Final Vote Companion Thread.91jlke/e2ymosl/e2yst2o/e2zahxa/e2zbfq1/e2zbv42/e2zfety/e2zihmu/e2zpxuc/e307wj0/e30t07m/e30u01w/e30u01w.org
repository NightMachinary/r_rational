Seems a minor wording issue, which you overinterpret as 'fundamentally missing the point'.

I used 'describes' rather than 'shows' because it felt to me that 'describes' actually felt more like 'going into detail, experiencing the process', while 'shows' felt to me actually more removed than "describes", like pointing at a mountain in a distance.

But I'm not a native English speaker, native speakers may feel differently about what each word connotates.

Either way, corrections in wording would have been nice to have during the previous week, when I could still fiddle with said wording, and asked the community at large what they felt each word connotated. If my definition wins, I could still afterwards ask the community / coordinate with moderators, with whether minor such wording changes can still be done.

How do you feel about "depicts", btw?
