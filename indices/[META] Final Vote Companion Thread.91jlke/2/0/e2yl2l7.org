Heh, fair enough; this thread existed mostly so I could link it in that one, but I suppose people might stumble upon this one first.

We are near the end of a month-long series of threads discussing the best way to replace the "Characteristics of Rational Fiction" section of the sidebar. In previous weeks we discussed various aspects of the problem, and last week people submitted their solutions. This week we're going to vote on them, and next week we'll have the winner.

I've updated the OP with slightly more information.
