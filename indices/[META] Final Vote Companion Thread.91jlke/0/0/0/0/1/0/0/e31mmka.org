I debated whether to include that bit, but there's enough focus on the thinking /process/ (as opposed to only showing the solution) in the discussions that I thought it should be included even for rational fiction. The wording could be better optimized to fit that aspect though. Any suggestions?

e.g. alternative: "Besides showing realistic solutions, the thought processes that precipitate any resolution are apparent to the reader through details in the story."
