I felt unconscionably guilty about commenting but not contributing anything constructive, so I threw together a redefinition intended to combine what I felt were the most cogent elements of everyone else's proposals. If nothing else, it hopefully helps narrow down the solution space.

** Characteristics of Rational Fiction:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: characteristics-of-rational-fiction
   :END:

- Characters think and act in ways that are consistent with their beliefs/values, motives, and worldview. They are rational agents, in the sense that they have /agency/ as unique individuals who pursue their own goals and don't exist only to facillitate the plot.

- The characters solve problems or achieve their goals through intelligent application of their knowledge and resources. More importantly, these thought processes are usually transparent or at least plausibly reproducible to the reader through details in the story. Ideally, they go beyond obvious solutions and exploit their knowledge and resources creatively.

- The fictional setting has logical and/or consistent rules. Even if the world resists our common sense or "it's just magic", the author thinks through the effects and implications and makes an effort to remove or justify seeming incongruities. Worldbuilding should reflect the previous two points, e.g. social structures and the world-system should be the realistic consequences of such characters.

** In Rational/ist/ Fiction:

   :END:

- Rationalist fiction is about [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level3intelligent][/showing/ good thinking]], through the perspective of an intelligent character, so that the reader can reproduce or internalize those cognitive skills. If a story is structured like a puzzle, the reader can conceivably arrive at the same (or even alternate correct) conclusions by applying similar thought processes, reasoning, and techniques from cognitive science, logic, game theory, etc.
