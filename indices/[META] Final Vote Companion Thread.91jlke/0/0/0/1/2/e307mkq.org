As the author of one of the less-wordy definitions, I support people voting for the less-wordy definitions. :-)

But seriously, how wordy, complex & accessible something is, must always be part of the equation. People are allowed to have whatever criteria they want for the purposes of voting, and something being /brief/ can be one of those criteria.

I didn't hate the current definition for being /short/, I hated it for many other reasons.
