The mods could easily declare the current vote as a preliminary vote. I don't think the whole thing is enough of a big deal to warrant that, but other people might. I'm personally never going to not view rational fiction as the offshoot of rationalist fiction regardless of how many people insist on the opposite, because that's how it transpired in real life; rationalist fiction came first as a genre, and then works calling themselves "rational fiction" came afterward. My own definition reflects this, in as polite a way as I could word it. "Rational fiction" in my mind isn't its own genre, it's simply any work of fiction which apes the tropes common to the rationalist fiction genre.
