Oh, I don't mind that people prefer shorter definitions. Certainly brevity is a valid concern.

What I'm concerned about is that a non-insignificant number of people stated its significance only /now/, when the proposals are locked, instead of during the discussions. If it's actually that important, but nobody optimized for it strongly enough, what else have we missed? Perhaps we actually should have let the previous thread run for two weeks, or ran some kind of review-thread/preliminary vote first.
