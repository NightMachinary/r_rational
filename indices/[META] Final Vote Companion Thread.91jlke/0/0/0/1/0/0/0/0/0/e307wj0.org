  The whole point of rewriting the sidebar is to try to make the definition more specific
#+end_quote

No, it wasn't the /whole/ point. The current sidebar was too vague in some ways, and too specific in others.

E.g. in the portion of my suggested rewrite that addressed rational*ist* fiction, I actually removed two of the three bullets and thus made the definition smaller.
