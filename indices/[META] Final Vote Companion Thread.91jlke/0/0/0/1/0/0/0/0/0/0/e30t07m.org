Your suggested rewrite vis-a-vis rational*ist* fiction:

#+begin_quote
  The author *describes* rationalist and scientific principles and techniques which can be applied by readers in real life.
#+end_quote

I'd argue that that fundamentally misses the point.

Yudkowsky arguably codified the genre. Let's see what what he has to say about it.

#+begin_quote
  I once read - though I don't remember where - a proverb which has stayed with me ever since: Nonfiction conveys knowledge. Fiction conveys /experience./

  When we enter a fictional world, we aren't just learning facts about the characters and the world, we are /living their lives/ and vicariously gaining their experiences.

  If you do the practice and learn the skills of both science writing and fiction writing, you can do something that ordinary textbook authors /cannot/ do, which is to put the reader directly into the shoes of a character as they use a science the way it is meant to be used. You can share the /experience/ (not just the facts) of what it is like to understand and apply simple Mendelian genetics.

  If there's anything I hope that Serious Writers pick up from HPMOR, it's the idea of using fiction to convey the /experience/ of cognitive skills.
#+end_quote

The point of rationalist fiction is that it doesn't just describe principles/techniques, it conveys them through the lived experience of the main character, showing instead of telling. Simply dropping in explanations or descriptions of the scientific method or the prisoner's dilemma or the planning fallacy or whatever might be enough to get a work over the "rational" bar, but it shouldn't be enough to allow a story to be classified as /rationalist./

#+begin_quote
  The readers who /intensely/ loved the intelligence of the characters in HPMOR weren't being impressed by the rocket-broomstick or other feats of Level 2 Intelligence. They were impressed by the detail on how Harry thinks through to the solutions he uses, the heuristics that Harry used to come up with his answer, the alternatives he considered and discarded. They felt themselves learning how to think better by watching Harry think, and from watching Harry himself learn to think better.

  This level of character intelligence cannot be faked at all, by any literary artifice.

  You cannot do it by namedropping cog-sci terminology, trying to signal that you are part of the rationalist ingroup, because reading those phrases will not teach anyone how to think. Even if they look up the phrase â€˜planning fallacy' online, you haven't taught them to think from within your own writing, you have not /shown-not-told/ intelligence and thereby /sneezed it onto them/.
#+end_quote

You cannot sneeze intelligence onto the reader by *describing* principles and techniques. An author's description of techniques is not the point. The point is a character's experience of /thinking while using said techniques/, which is something significantly harder to pull off and is not a trivial difference of semantics.
