Agreed, there are 4 good answers but only one that people will actually read, so I'm voting that one even if the others might technically be more accurate.

EDIT: I think I explained myself horribly. The one I voted is great, it's not like I "settled" for it. I'm just saying I valued clarity and conciseness over completeness. 10k word complete definitions can go in the wiki just fine, but we're voting for something that will go in the sidebar.
