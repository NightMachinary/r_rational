Your argument kind of assumes that the Godly Being cares about us. Maybe he just wants to harvest us for resources, and slight changes to our timeline every century or so is the most resource-efficient way to do it.

I would plead for a chance to have a continued discussion with the alien. Time is unlikely to be of the essence (or else he would not have had this discussion with me) so I can only assume that his bottleneck is timeline changes, so he'll probably accept to chat with me for hours as long as he's having fun. I would interrogate him on his motivations, his needs, what ethics he has if any, and see if I can try to broker a deal with him. Highly unlikely (though I could try to ask for RationalFiction's collective brainpowers for help), but at the very least it would give me a few more enjoyable hours to live, whatever /that/ is worth.

EDIT: and by 'enjoyable', I of course mean 'increasingly filled with horrible despair'.
