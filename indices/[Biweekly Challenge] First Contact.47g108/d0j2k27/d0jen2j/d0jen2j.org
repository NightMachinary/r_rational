I didn't like the following, however: " The Makers will refer to the people who sent us, a little corny and dramatic but easy to remember". That sounds out of character, like the author speaking through a character and being self deprecating.

There is also a problem with the grim Vingeian Slow Zone-esque picture she paints -- [[#s][Spoiler]]
