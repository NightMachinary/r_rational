There's feedback between the brain and the body, though -- for example, fear makes you breathe shallow and fast, which reinforces the feeling of fear. If you can break that loop by making yourself breathe deeply and slowly, it will reduce (although not eliminate) the sensation of fear. It's not a silver bullet, but it helps a lot. Ditto for muscle tension -- being angry makes you tense your muscles, so forcing yourself to physically relax will help reduce anger.
