you can't directly change the neurotransmitter balance in your head via willpower. You can't will yourself to be less anxious or less scared or less stressed, the chemicals in your brain don't care what your conscious mind wants.

You can however, choose to ignore those feelings. Understand that they're the result of a chemical soup your brain is steeped in, take a deep breath, and put them aside. Its not easy, but not much in life is particularly easy.

Or you can always try and change the chemical balance via brute force methods, taking certain drugs, maybe using that new headset thing that supposedly changes your moods via electrical stimulation of your brain, things like that.

The lizard in the back of your head is a strong fucker, and has been around a lot longer then the actively conscious (in the sense of being aware of your own awareness) then you, and has quite the arsenal of chemicals and pathways to keep your higher brain in check.
