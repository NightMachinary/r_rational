Is there an actually effective way to improve attention span and/or working memory?

I can pay attention to tasks for a very short period of time and I never reach 'full' concentration like some people do; at the same time I'm a bad multitasker because it's hard to me to pay attention to every thing I have to think about/hold in my working memory. Also, I've noticed that I often intuitively figure out a a problem/make an observation, but I can't concentrate on the observation enough to further analyze it.

The only thing that has somewhat helped me were SSREs I'm alleviating my depression/aboulia with, but it's still serious enough to interfere with my functioning, and no generic exercises have helped me at all.
