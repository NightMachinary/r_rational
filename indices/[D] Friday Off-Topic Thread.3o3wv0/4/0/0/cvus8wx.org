What, other than medication, have you found to help with your ADHD? I suspect that I might have it, but haven't been tested (yet, procrastinating on making a doctor's appointment). Currently I'm using org-mode as a mental prosthetic to get a better overview of my life, and have found it extremely useful. However, other issues like being unable to concentrate on school work, or getting caught up in something (in a manner fitting the description of hyperfocus) and forgetting to go to sleep remain problems for me.
