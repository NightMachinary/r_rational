I apparently hyperfocus too, most often when drawing!

I have mild Aspergers as well. Since your experience seems /very/ similar to mine, I'd guess I'm going to have to get evaluated for ADD/ADHD again (I was diagnosed with it as a child, and it was basically a handwave to explain my somewhat atypical development; when i was slightly older i was told I don't have it).

I think my attention issues may stem at least partially from persistent stress and anxiety, since it had gotten a little tiny bit better near the end of spring break, and returning to school made it worse again, but I don't see why I couldn't have ADHD as well, especially since it's often comorbid with autism spectrum disorders.
