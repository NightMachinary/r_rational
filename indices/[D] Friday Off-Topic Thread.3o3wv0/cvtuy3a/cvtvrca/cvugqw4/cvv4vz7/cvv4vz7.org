You don't need to share on facebook. Having one and checking it occasionally may be useful for keeping up with the happenings of people you know who /do/ share. Being able to ask about things you've seen posted may make awkward conversations with family, or sort-of-friends you'd like to upgrade somewhat easier. And it's a fairly easy way to contact someone without needing to keep up to date on a phone number, or email address.

But if you're concerned about what facebook sells, avoid putting it on your phone altogether, and forget messenger. The list of required permissions is just deranged. There's no legitimate need for the app to use a quarter of it.
