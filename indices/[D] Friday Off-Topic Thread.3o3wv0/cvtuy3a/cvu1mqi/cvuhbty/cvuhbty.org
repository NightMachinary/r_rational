<rant> Why is that, exactly? Facebook is a horrible company and an even worse user experience -- for one basic example, they are the only major internet property I can think of that doesn't support threaded comments. Why are they so damn popular?! </rant>

Yes, I know. They used the velvet rope + Ivy name to capture the 20-somethings, all of whom were thought-leaders for family and friends. The question remains as to why the name+rope was enough to get past that crappy UX.
