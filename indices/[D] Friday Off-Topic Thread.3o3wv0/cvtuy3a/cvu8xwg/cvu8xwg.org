As a comparison point, my social prescence is limited to this subreddit and I spend most of my time online at sites for reading such as fanfiction.net, fictionpress.net, fimfiction.net, webserial sites like Worm, Set in Stone, and more.

Holy cow, there are a lot of brilliant writers online guys!

However, I have social accounts on FaceBook, Twitter, and a few others, but they're all for scholarship contests when I was applying to college which required me to have an account and I don't use them at all.

The one exception that I use regularly is LinkedIn, because it's a nice place to put my resume for my employeers.
