How active are you guys on social networks? I have zero presence online but.. I don't know why this is. Sure, if someone asked me why I'd say I don't need to post selfies every 5 seconds and pretend to have a really busy social life. I don't but I think the real reason I don't have facebook or twitter is I'm afraid of rejection online just like I've faced in the real world (introverts unite). But that isn't a reason either.

I'm remarkably like [[http://www.leftoversoup.com/archive.php?num=722][Jamie]] from Leftover Soup in this regard. I'm not shy, but I'm still uncomfortable with photos of me online. Why? I have no idea. But like the comic says this is atypical of my demographic and I'm afraid I'm missing out socially.

I guess what I'm asking is if there's another outlier like me, if yes, why? If no, why?
