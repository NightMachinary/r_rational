Well, I see the return-on-investment of my pseudo-friendships as being /pretty/ high. My pseudo-friendships had the enormous plus side of requiring the expenditure of next to /zero/ real effort: all I had to do was think of hundreds of questions (and answer them, but that's just pure pleasure). Remember also that, in my later friendships, I could just copy-and-paste questions that I'd already asked to my earlier friends--and that the other person must ask questions as well! "A burden shared is a burden halved", or whatever. I stopped using them becase I was disgusted with myself for associating with people whom I thoroughly disliked, and for contenting myself with pathetic half-measures--not because they were an inherently-bad method of socialization.

On the other hand, how much effort do I have to expend on an /actual/ friendship? Being dragged to a bar? Helping someone move furniture? Advising on how to do homework problems? And what extra do I get out of it? Playing some games of Super Smash Bros.? Having an audience for my opinions on fanfiction? Intercourse? That's a /lot/ more effort for /not/ a lot of extra pleasure.

I mean, really--what could be more satisfying than getting a person to tell you something like [[http://pastebin.com/QdXtKHVh][/this/ delicious morsel]]? It's literally the third of my favorite memories... (clenches fist with a fleeting-yet-heartfelt feeling of unquestioned, megalomaniac control)
