OK, I feel like I should do some proselytizing for my other hobby.

Chess has an image as an intellectual game, but the most /rational/ game of note is *Bridge.* So if you are looking for an interesting game and willing to devote the necessary time, look no further.

1) It deals with incomplete information. Nobody can see all of the cards, but each player can see 1/4 (or 1/2, after the auction). So you have communication, but on a channel where the enemy is listening. (By the laws of bridge, your communication cannot be encrypted).

1a) There is luck. Good play is usually, but not always rewarded. This makes for a much more interesting game, IMO. I have played in (short) matches against Nat'l and world champions and while I usually lose, I don't always. (I'd be unlikely to win a full day match, obviously). And as someone who has read lots of bridge and chess, bridge has much more interesting stories.

2) Of all of the traditional games I know, it's the only one where Bayes' law comes up routinely. See the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_restricted_choice][wikipedia article on Restricted Choice]]. In fact, the card play is highly rational, but also has the cut and thrust because the defenders use their cards to signal, but must decide (independently) when to signal correctly, randomly, or lie, and each side must consider the potential layout of the cards he needs, and if they are consistent with the bidding.

As a downside, it does take considerable experience to become comfortable, much less competent, with the game.
