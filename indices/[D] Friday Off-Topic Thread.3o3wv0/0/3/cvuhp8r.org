A more accurate question is: is there anyone here /without/ depression?

My constant-chip-on-his-fucking-shoulder is actually my way of coping with my bipolarity-type issues. You see, when I get manic, which is almost never, I can pour it into DRILL TO THE HEAVENS, WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK I AM, and when I get depressed, which is reasonably often, I can pour it into NO MATTER WHAT'S IN MY WAY, I WON'T STOP, AND ONCE I'VE DUG THROUGH, IT MEANS THAT I'VE WON.

Because yes, [[http://mindingourway.com/see-the-dark-world/][I can see all the fucking problems]], but I am NOT going to fucking break down instead of FUCKING DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

My girlfriend is currently suffering a crying/panic/asthma attack over how her abusive job that makes her work way too fucking much and makes her feel inadequate and stressed-out all the time. She seems to have gone to sleep now, though. In the morning she will have to get up and go work in the lab. And on Sunday.
