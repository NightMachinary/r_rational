Oh my god, every time with the preaching and the misunderstanding science and the not so subtle insults and the misdirection and the high handed mannerisms like you're holding some kind of high ground where you're clearly right and everyone else is plebs for doubting your glorious word even though you just can't be bothered to actually point to whatever nebulous things will back up your claims.

I said show me something the crystal healers /can't/. Anyone can make a documentary. I can show you documentaries that make it look like mermaids are real and I can show you documentaries that 'prove' that we're all getting chemtrailed. It is not a good standard of proof.

So, since you clearly don't understand what scientific proof is in this context let me explain it to you. I'll walk you through the whole deal. What you do, is you give however many people hypnotherapy and you give a similar number nothing and a third group some other random treatment from a convincing seeming guy and you give the rest some other thing and see who comes out best. Then if you end up with 10 cases of spontaneous remission or whatever it is you're trying to achieve and they all end up with 5 then you win. Pretty fucking simple if your deal isn't bullshit.

And then everyone's like 'oh look at this guy, he has an interesting result. We should try to see if we can reproduce it.' And then they do. And then a few years later you have a huge pile of evidence on your side and you get recognised as a branch of medicine and it's all hunky dory. But you apparently don't, because that video is from 2006 and by now you should have at least 10 years worth of evidence sitting in a nice pretty pile, but you don't. Or at least, you refuse to point to your pile of evidence which is essentially the same thing from where I'm sitting.

It's really not that hard. Normal therapy vs your therapy: a dude just rings up all your ex patients and also a bunch of conventional ex-patients and a bunch of ex-patients from something we know is bullshit and quizzes them about how they feel before and after therapy. Then if you do better than normal therapy everyone will sing your praises and if you don't, they won't.

Quit saying science doesn't understand because neurology is hard when what's happening is you don't understand that neurology is not the relevant field for proving your claims.
