Well I would update my beliefs based on observed reality, but I haven't observed anything, have I? The only thing I have observed is you telling me to trust you, which is not nearly the same thing. However I congratulate you for jumping straight to accusing me of motivated cognition.

So I'll just say this: I'm a scientist. Do you know what that means? It means I believe in what works. If crystals healed people I would want them in every hospital curing cancer with amethysts. If reiki hands could cure people there would be scientists at the front lines figuring out how best to maximise energy flow. If rotating your chakras while feeling relaxed let you commune with nature in a measurable way then I would be reading papers as scientists argued about the best direction to spin them and categorising the most soothing types of herbal tea.

Demonstrate that you're more than a crackpot convinced of an incorrect theory, and I'll believe you. Till then, there are 20 dozen other people out there with just as much proof as you have from where I'm sitting, so you get just as much belief as they get.

Show me something that crystal healers can't.
