I really appreciate the help. I don't think my depression is as severe as yours was, but it's good advice regardless. I have been seeing a councilor for a while and it's been very helpful.

Of course, I also have to deal with gender dysphoria. It's harder to find people who have experienced that. I think that there's one other active user on the sub who's trans (hi transfuturist).
