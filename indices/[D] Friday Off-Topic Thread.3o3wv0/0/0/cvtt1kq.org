Not currently, but depression and I have a long history that goes way back. For me, it was mostly a two-pronged strategy.

The first prong was not getting depressed in the first place; the strategies for that were exercise, eating right, avoiding stressful situations to the extent that was feasible, keeping my immediate surroundings clean, and doing my best to cut off any downward spirals. You probably have your own triggers for depression, or conditions which make you more likely to become depressed, so watch for those and try to avoid them.

The second prong was coping with depression once it arrived. That's the more difficult of the two, because you have such a limited amount of finite willpower with which to get /anything/ done. For me, doing small things that I actually have the willpower to accomplish helps. Like, maybe that pit of apathy is going to prevent me from going out with friends. Maybe I just don't have the brain chemicals necessary to get my laundry done either. But there's got to be /something/ small that I can do in-between episodes of my fourteen hour TV-watching marathon. This is basically "strategic use of willpower". If you can use whatever scraps you find more effectively, you can start digging out of a hole that you're in, or at least accomplish enough that you can get to the next day without your life falling apart in the meantime. (This largely depends on how bad your depression is and what's causing it; I was in a mental hospital for a while and I know there were people there who would probably could never get out of their depression spiral no matter what coping strategies they employed.)

Oh, and it probably goes without saying that seeing a therapist/psychiatrist should be on the list of things to do.
