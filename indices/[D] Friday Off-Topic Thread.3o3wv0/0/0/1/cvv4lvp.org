I think I recall you mentioning that you're soon to become a father. After reading that post, I feel inclined to warn you about the possibility of postpartum depression on your part. From what I remember reading on the topic a few years back, if it hits, it tends to last for years, clearing up around when the firstborn hits 4 or 5. That was my own experience as well. I've never had a problem with depression before or since, but I spent an infuriating number of hours during those first few years dealing with relentlessly nihilistic depression that seemed /obviously/ "outside influence". I've just realized that my best friend is dealing with it too. His daughter is 3, so hopefully it'll clear up for him soon. But I really don't know how it would impact someone with a history with depression.

Just something that might be worth looking into, for the sake of preparedness.
