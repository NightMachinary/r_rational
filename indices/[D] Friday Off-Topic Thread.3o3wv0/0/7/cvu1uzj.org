I've got a history, and still have some of that dark fog lingering around my headspace. For me, depression comes with crippling, nonstop, agonizing anxiety about literally everything, which I wouldn't wish on anyone.

I'm off the therapy and drugs now, but my motivation is reduced. I get up for work and just keep the routine. All you really can do, some days.
