  Oh, so you're the one they call "OP"?
#+end_quote

If you're talking about [[http://i.imgur.com/VCZSnwZ.png][the giant screenshot]], I'm "(OP)" and "(You)". "OP" is short for "original post(er)"--the post/person that started the thread.

  Why are all the names pseudo-anime-Japanese?
#+end_quote

If you're talking about the names in [[http://i.imgur.com/ScN7C7l.png][this image]], those are nicknames for acquaintances. The first four are the names of /Naruto/ characters (same as [[http://i.imgur.com/IHeWJc1.png][here]], but I changed "Shiho" to "Isaribi"), while the fifth one is (I think) Spanish for "[[http://imgur.com/a/aqcEv][dungeon]] enthusiast".
