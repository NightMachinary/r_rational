Hmmm... isn't it a question of ROI, then? I mean, from my perspective, when a relationship requires more expenditure of effort than it returns "friendship value", I drop it, even though I'm neurotypical in that aspect. That's actually pretty normal, and it's why we have the concept of "emotional parasites".

I mean, you seem to be capable of mutually-advantageous social cooperation, so I guess from your perspective you already get that without feeling the emotions evolution gave the rest of us to encourage that.

Weird. Remind me not to trust you too much :-p.
