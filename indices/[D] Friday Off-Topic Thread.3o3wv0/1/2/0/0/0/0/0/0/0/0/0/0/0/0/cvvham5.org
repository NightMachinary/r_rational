  Tell me where your links lead.

Can't you hold down your finger over a link to inspect it and see where it leads? I can do that on my Android phone's version of Google Chrome. (Also, this is /by no means/ a "creepy" part of Literotica--it's only the "Mind Control" section. There's a "Non-Consent/Reluctance" section that I've never even looked at--to say nothing of the "Non-Human" section, which often features werewolves and aliens...)
