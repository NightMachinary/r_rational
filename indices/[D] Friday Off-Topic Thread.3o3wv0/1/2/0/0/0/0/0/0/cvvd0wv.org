Certainly not "for a while". What would be the point of temporarily gaining a personality capable of liking and being liked, if I eventually became unable to sustain or enjoy the friendships obtained under those false pretenses? [[http://i.imgur.com/Vk1qJYe.png][I like permanency.]]

Even if the change were permanent, I still probably wouldn't be very interested in it. I'm under the impression that standard friendship between people who actually enjoy each other's company entails a /lot/ more expenditure of time and effort than did the facsimile I attempted.
