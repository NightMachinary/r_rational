I have a Facebook account, but I have only nine "friends" on it--five family members (who can see almost nothing that I post--tee-hee!), and four people ([[http://i.imgur.com/IHeWJc1.png][1, 2, 3, and 6]]) whom I once called /actual/ friends under [[http://i.imgur.com/VCZSnwZ.png][this system]]. I had about two hundred "friends" on the site at one point, several years ago--but I didn't like them, they never posted anything interesting, and they never gave likes or comments to any of my own posts, so I gradually deleted them all. I typically make at least one post (usually text or a shared link, sometimes a screenshot, rarely a photograph; [[http://imgur.com/a/2SjAr][samples]]) per day, in vain hope, but I'm nearly always the only person who gives a like or a comment to it. Other than that, my main use of the account is following the pages of The Onion and its Clickhole spin-off, since a good portion of the enjoyment that I derive from them lies in reading the funny comments left by people on the articles, in addition to the articles themselves. (Also, I follow Mr. Yudkowsky's account.)

I don't see the point of Twitter at all, and don't have an account there. I do have [[https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/13619843?shelf=read][a Goodreads account]], though, with four hundred books and two "friends".
