That's not how anonymous imageboards work. After a certain length of time, a thread will be deleted, rather than just being saved for eternity--necroing a thread is impossible. Typically, a person who wants to save a thread or a post from an imageboard of this type will use an archive site (typically archive.is) or take a screenshot (see [[/r/4chan][r/4chan]] for innumerable examples); I took a screenshot--or, rather, took a /zillion/ screenshots and then pasted them seamlessly together in an image-editing program.

I took the screenshots with the browser window filling half of my 1920-pixel-wide monitor; therefore, it should be perfectly readable if you click on the image (933 pixels wide) to go to 100% magnification. If you're on mobile, sorry--I didn't feel like expending the effort to make a separate 500-pixel-wide screenshot. (Believe you me, it took a while to paste together all those images...)
