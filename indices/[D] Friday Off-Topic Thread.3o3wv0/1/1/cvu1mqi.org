Facebook is the modern replacement for email addresses and chat clients for most people. I am unusual in my friend group-- I use forums, email, and IRC extensively.

When I need to communicate with most people, the best way to do so is Facebook. Organizing a party? Use facebook. Want to meet someone for dinner, so you want to send them a non-urgent low-latency low-barrier message they can respond to via computer or phone? use Facebook. Want to get someone's contact info in an arms-length sort of way and be easy to reach? Use facebook. Want to contact your college friend from years ago, even though everyone's changed emails? Facebook.
