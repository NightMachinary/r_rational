I don't believe in using it heavily (every day) like Reddit, but it's a useful tool. I have a close few friends I no longer live near and use it for staying in touch with them (although now that I'm giving it some thought, I think using email would probably be equivalent), and then locally there are a few groups that I follow so I can find people with similar interests / attend events. There's also a Rational Transhumanism group that I follow as basically the equivalent of this subreddit, although I'm less active there.

Oh, and it reminds me of people's birthdays. So nothing too crazy but like I said, it's a tool.
