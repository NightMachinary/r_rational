I don't pursue people because most people completely and utterly fail to catch my interest, even if it's public school and I have the same people as classmates for a decade. I don't care what you're major is or where you're from or what music you like! If that's all we're going to talk about then we are not going to talk more than twice!

... I currently live alone with no friends within a few hundred miles and no one has come to see me since summer 2007. This policy is clearly a failure, but blast it, I cannot do this normal conversation thing, especially with complete strangers. Why, just a few hours ago, I was thinking "I Have Nothing to Say" would be a decent title for one of those horrible mass-market opinion paperbacks, but then I realized that I would have nothing to say in it, either.

I think this actually gets worse with time, because I become increasingly aware that I can't just hijack conversations with irrelevant Pinky and the Brain-esque babblings and expect anything good to come of it. My enthusiasm for everything rapidly decreases with respect to time. I wouldn't be surprised if the lack of non-annoying human contact has a lot to do with many of my most distressing problems, but even if I somehow found a way to get to some local tabletop group (I'm not even sure there are any, but who knows?), I'd still just sit there and observe. Maybe some brave person in the group would find some way to get me to talk about something, but not only would I not count on it, I wouldn't expect it to be the sort of thing friendships grow on. None of the people I ever counted as friends were friends because we displayed mutual interest in each other's interests, but because we could stand each other's company long enough for fun things to sometimes happen. mutual interest kinda happened once or twice, I guess. But most of the time, I cannot interact meaningfully with people, and seeking them out for mutual interest does not work.

Mutually satisfying activities tend to outdo conversation, in practice. These rarely happen, because <list of reasons no one wants to read badly enough for me to write>.

(I suppose I can imagine conversations that aren't terrible. But they aren't realistic, either.)
