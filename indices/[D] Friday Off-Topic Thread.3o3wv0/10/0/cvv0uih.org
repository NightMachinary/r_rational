Mostly from my pursuit of them.

A lot of people tend to just become friends with people they are most similar to or people that they spend most of their time together with (ever notice how often a guy's best friend was also his college roommate?).

I noticed this trend at a relatively young age, early junior high school, and started going out of my way to spend time with other people who were deliberately from very different social groups. I didn't want to be labeled a geek.

By the time I reached high school, I went from a major introvert to a slightly unsocial, but more extroverted person. By college, I considered myself to be an extrovert.

I mostly do this by being active in several wildly different clubs (although I'm stopping with this, this semester, to focus more on academics). While I've rarely stayed in any club for more than a semester, I've developed connections with at least a few people from each club and over time, it built up.

In addition, I'm self-confident enough that I'm willing to just walk up to a random person in my college's dining hall and start a conversation with them. I mostly do this in the beginning of a semester when people are more open to talking to strangers.

I'm the only person I know who is fairly well-connected on campus and doesn't use any online social network such as FaceBook.

For an example of the diversity in my friends, there's a lot of variation in sexual orientations, ethnicities, sport teams, and some are transgender, deaf, or in the military.

Of course all of this is a lot easier in college than when out of college, so I hope I will still find it easy to make friends later in life.

So, the number of friends I've gained in pursuit is like thirty times larger than the number of friends who've pursued me.

I wonder if this is why I'm so optimistic and positive so much of the time.
