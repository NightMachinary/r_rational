Yes, sure. So if the counselling is any good you should after two years have made significant progress?

I know my 18 month have helped a lot.

Next you have to find your individual triggers:

for me its not eating well- so spend money on snacks/fast food/eating out.

External stressors: eg. bills I am unable to open will accumulate huge stress, so if it gets too bad I mail my psychosocial service here in town and they will open them for me.

Another thing I do is withdrawal from people; after about 4-5 days of not talking to anyone I'll start to get a bit loony as well.

Also, the most amazing internet ressource I know of is [[http://pete-walker.com/flashbackManagement.htm]] ; his modell of whats happening - emotional flashbacks in PTSD fits me extremely well, so I have his 10 point plan printed out and glued to my laptop.
