No idea at all. That's the point of studies. See, you can get convinced therapists even when the theory and the method are complete bullshit. There are therapists out there convinced that you can pray the gay away and various other bullshit things. Which is why we don't take that as strong evidence either.

Imagine two worlds: one where the thing works and one where the thing doesn't. In both worlds I would expect to see convinced therapists. In both worlds I can expect to see documentaries. In both worlds I could see a singular study in favour. In only one world do I see a plurality of studies showing that the thing works, and that is the world that the thing works in. In the absence of such a thing, I assume I am in the other world where the thing does not work. You follow?
