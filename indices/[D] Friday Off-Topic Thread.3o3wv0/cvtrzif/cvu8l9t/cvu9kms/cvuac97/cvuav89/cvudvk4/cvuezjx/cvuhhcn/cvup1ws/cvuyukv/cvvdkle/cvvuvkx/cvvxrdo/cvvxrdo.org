I never said to dismiss the judgement of the patient or therapist. I said they are a singluar data point and thus insufficient to prove a theory. I'm tired of explaining things to you when you are either trying to misunderstand my point or lack the required background knowledge to understand my position. I think it's probably the latter. Now either go learn how science actually works so you'll stop make a fool out of yourself by knowing just enough to get it all impressively wrong, or resign yourself to a life of not actually understanding why no-one takes your claims seriously.

I'll believe your claims when you show me the data that proves them. Anecdotes are insufficient. So put up, or shut up.
