In my case, it's anxiety as much as depression. I'm actually doing much better right now than I was a month ago, thanks to therapy, loving and supportive parents, and 75mg of venlafaxine daily. Time will tell if my happy mood keeps up once the treatment's over.

Eating a balanced diet, sleeping on time, and exercising at least 3 times a week is more important than it seems. Depression is a chemical problem as much as anything else.

I tend to procrastinate wildly because I'm too stressed to work, and then stress out because I haven't done any work. The vicious circle is obvious. So focus on doing things as soon as you can, to avoid starting the downward spiral. As yourself "What is the benefit of doing this work later instead of now?" Usually there is no benefit, so get started. You'll slip up sometimes, and when that happens you shouldn't be afraid to get a helping hand with things you don't have the willpower to do alone.

"Thinking things through" can be a bad thing. Perfectionism and overthinking are a major source of anxiety. Your work doesn't have to be perfect on the first draft. Don't be afraid to say yes, don't be afraid to screw up, don't be afraid to apologise. Depression makes you pessimistic; understand that bias and counterbalance it by being deliberately na√Øve and optimistic.

Friends like to help. Do not think you are doing them a favour by keeping quiet about your condition or avoiding contact. They will worry about you anyway, and they might imagine something terrible has happened to you. *Talk to people.* If you do nothing else in this comment, talk to an old friend or family member (even if it's someone you haven't spoken to in years), tell them about your difficulties, and then take their advice. Do not be afraid of looking silly. That is a small price to pay in any circumstance.

Socially, in casual conversation people will ignore or forget 90% of what you say anyway. You can say the first coherent thing that comes into your head and it'll help move the conversation along. Don't think you're a boring person, because you're not.

Any particular questions?
