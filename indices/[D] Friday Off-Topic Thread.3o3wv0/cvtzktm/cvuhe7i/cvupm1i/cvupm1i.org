It's still good. It's got full size dinosaur skeletons and a large minerals and gem collection, but I found the astronomy/big bang wing to be very underwhelming. One four minute video with only the zooming stuff, followed by a short walk down a spiral with signs telling you what came into being when, and... that was it.

To anyone who has the time, I certainly recommend both, but in a pinch I say go with the MMoA over the NHM.

Now, that said, the NHM had this wonderful little vending machine where you popped in 51 cent and it took that one cent, crushed it into an oval shape, and pressed the image of a T-Rex into it.
