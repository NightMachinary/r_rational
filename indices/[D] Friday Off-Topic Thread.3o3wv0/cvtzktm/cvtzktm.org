Came back home to Europe on Wednesday after spending two weeks in the US. Had a wonderful time. Started getting sick on the last day and got progressively worse during the trip home. Am currently dealing with fever, snot and phlegm. Still, rather miserable at home than during the brief vacation.

Also, anyone thinking of visiting New York, the Metropolitan Museum of Art is amazing. Beats the Natural History Museum hands down. Really, really big though. I could have easily spent a whole day there, seeing and reading about everything from dark age weapons and armour to exotic music instruments to Byzantine art to reconstructions of 18th century American mansions.

Also, the statue of liberty is like half the size I was expecting it to be even after being told everyone is always surprised at how small it is.
