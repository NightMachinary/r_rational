I'm considering taking nootropics when I'm a bit older - I'm a minor and my parents wouldn't be very happy about me taking brain enhancing drugs with little research on long term effects, and I myself would prefer to wait with it until my brain is a bit more mature. Thanks for the suggestion though!
