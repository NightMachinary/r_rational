No worries. I hope the doctor helps :).

In order of appearance and including markup and database languages: Java, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, jQuery mobile, jQuery, MySQL, PHP & XML (edit: and JSON). Android SDK makes an appearance next semester and we do other things like project management & analysis. I'm also looking to familiarise myself with qt based on a recent recommendation and I spent some time learning unity syntax and programming (ft. C#). I have a spreadsheet of languages, programming skills / concepts and other things I want to look into when I have time (probably some of it between this and next semester).
