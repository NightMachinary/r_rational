Stress, hardship and a lack of options basically. I don't have any particular strategies that I use or any deep analysis that might help. My main advantage was having someone else devote their time to help me and getting used to / feeling trapped in a 9-5 job. I'm in a situation where I'm aware of my past failures and find the prospect of repeating them so unbearable that most of the time I don't have any choice but to keep on track. I probably should identify better strategies to use for various aspects of life, but I'm doing well enough (top of my class and the candidate for employers seeking students for employment) that it's not a priority for the moment.

My main driving factors: About 6 or 7 years ago I left the same level of programming course I'm doing now for reasons including: the relevant undiagnosed ADHD reasons, security of a privileged childhood, my prior lack of having to study to pass subjects and all my other bad habits and flaws. Worked four years in a job I didn't mind for my father who I (much of the time) hated. I now have the amazing support of my partner, who helped me recognize my ADHD symptoms as such, get medication and then supervised me to keep me attentive while I studied my ass off three nights or more a week for four months to re-learn everything I'd known about programming and more. I don't need supervision anymore. I moved with my partner away from my family, my remaining (non-problematic) friends and everything else to get myself and my partner out of bad living situations, to enter my course, to afford life in a cheaper city, etc. I kept the newfound, near complete absence of a social life to avoid distraction, but wow I miss weekly tabletop gaming. The move cost me all of my savings (gradually), most of my partner's savings and finding a job hasn't worked with the course load (which is above what is typical for this level course). Both of us are on minimum welfare support, less payment of debt left in my partner's name by family. The only good options if I fail include moving in with family, the most appropriate of which lives far outside an isolated rural town. My partner, for various reasons, is actually closer to miserable now than before. Getting through my course and getting a secure job feels like the only / best thing I can do to help, and all that does is free up time and money so I can use them to learn how to better support them.

So, yeah. Not an ideal way to manage symptoms.
