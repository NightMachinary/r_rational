Although I don't have any suggestions, I do have the same, or similar, troubles and it's mostly ADHD related for me. However, I'm unsure whether the difficulties with analysis of intuitive observations are related to ADHD, though I do experience the same. Beyond not knowing every symptom of ADHD offhand, it's difficult for me to know whether that one is not instead a symptom of something else, or simply the way I would function anyway. Aside from ADHD, for which I have been diagnosed and medicated properly, it's likely that I suffer from mild Aspergers and mild depression -- neither of which I've sought diagnosis for. The former due to my twin being diagnosed and a small number of specific symptoms I've noticed in myself. Depression isn't something I can say with certainty I've experienced and it's probably not worth going into here.

Other than the similarities of your troubles and mine, specifically with concentration, I also experience hyperfocus, where I concentrate fully on one thing and don't absorb external stimuli well. This usually only occurs when I'm very interested in the task (reading, gaming, sometimes programming). Distractions from hyperfocus make it difficult, often frustrating, to return to the task.
