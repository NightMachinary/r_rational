Possibly something along the lines of, if a billion people take a 2% chance of death, that's 20 million people who thought they were being rational and ended up dead.

That said, I also am in my mid twenties and poor and have made no plans beyond "when I have a high paying job in X years I'll start saving up". All I've succeeded in accomplishing is bringing the subject up to my mother and my best friend. My mother is vaguely religious and believes in reincarnation, and thinks living too long is a strange thing to want. My best friend is atheist but says he doesn't want to live forever after all his friends and family die.
