yeah but keep in mind that a good portion of that 2% is going to be taken up by things that destroy your brain beyond what cryonics can do to preserve it anyway. If you get hit by a truck and your skull bursts like a melon, you're pretty fucked, cryonics or no. If you take out accidents and things that make cryonics useless, I suspect that % would be much lower (though don't take my word for it, I don't have the statistics on hand)
