So I've been spending a lot of time on cryogenics lately and am curious.

1) Are you signed up for cryonic preservation, why or why not?

2) If so, which organization are you signed up with? Alcor, Cryonics Institution, or some other one I have never heard of?

PS For clarity, cryogenics is the /field/ while cryonics is the /process/.
