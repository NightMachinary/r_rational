/sighs/ Ok, I will be explicit then;

Neither seems to be clearly superior to the other. Alcor is more expensive, but if you are paying via life insurance, it is mostly inconsequential. I do not have a good reason for choosing CI, and I do not believe one exists, unless maybe you live close to the facilities of one or the other. I think I might have actually flipped a coin.

If I had chosen Alcor and you asked me the same question, I'd give the same answer. It is easy to invent reasons post hoc based on positive affect, rationalizing it as something more substantial. I try to make it a habit not to do that.

Also; I believe there is a strong tendency among intellectual types to over-analyze options, and forget that not deciding is also a decision with consequences. A majority of those I have met in the rationalist community are "considering" signing up for cryonics, snd have been doing so for /years/ at this point.

As a general heuristic, I have found that it is usually far better to make /any/ decision under consideration than to procrastinate, waiting for more information or a better alternative. Absolute worst case, you should be able to spend an hour or two researching details, maybe sleep on it, maybe seek council from trusted others who have been in similar situations. Then go with your system 1's judgement, and don't look back. If you take a positive EV gamble and lose, do not be upset at yourself for making a winning decision.

Hence, making either choice is better than making neither.
