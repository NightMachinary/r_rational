My life is enough of a miserable slog that the idea of it continuing forever is horrifying. I'm fairly sure I'll never be wealthy enough to retire so when I imagine an eternity of stressful, dead-end jobs and unsatisfying relationships... that really might as well be Hell.

I welcome the embrace of death, but haven't yet been able to overcome my biological will to live. If I could arrange to never have been born, I'd do so immediately.

I rate the odds that the future contains a post-scarcity utopia at so close to zero that it's statistically indistinguishable. Even if they're frozen safely and effectively, I think the preserved are significantly more likely to be thawed in an extensive blackout or harvested for organic chemicals than to be rebuilt or uploaded. Lasting, unbreakable contracts with the dead are a luxury relatively few civilizations will be willing to endure.
