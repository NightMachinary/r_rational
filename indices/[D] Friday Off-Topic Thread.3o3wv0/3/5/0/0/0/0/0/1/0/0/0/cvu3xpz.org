Really? I mean, I go rock climbing and I take what I consider to be a reasonable risk of death from that (lower than you're probably thinking, but still) in the name of fun. And I guess there's a chance the plus from the exercise might cancel it out.

It seems badly calibrated to worry so much about such small percentages. Then again, my rational friend finds it odd that I consider jumping down from 4m walls instead of downclimbing. So perhaps I am the badly calibrated one.
