I give the same epistemic rating as [[/u/alexanderwales]], and suffer the same emotional setbacks as [[/u/Sparkwitch]] (though with considerably less rational justification for feeling that bad).

On life insurance, I bite the bullet and admit to sucking for not getting it. Or I might actually have it through work, with my fiancee properly designated as the beneficiary.

Also, I consider /death/ to be a smaller problem than both general unnecessary human miseries, and also /ageing/, including the fully general fact that people's bodies start degrading more-or-less as soon as they leave school.
