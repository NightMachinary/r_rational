The question I care about answering is probability of continued existence, not likelihood of cryonics working.

I die in worlds where I sign up for cryonics and society doesn't stick around, or doesn't develop the technology necessary to revive people / prevent biological death. But then, I also die in those same worlds if I don't sign up for cryonics.

I am far more concerned about the organizations sticking around, the process actually preserving information, and preventing failures long term. I don't have a good, precise estimates, but I do think that's where most of the "cryonics is a wasted effort" probability mass lies.

1/1000 is just spitballing. It is definitely, definitely not the case that I only buy 1/1000 increased chance of not dying by signing up for cryonics vs not signing up for cryonics. But even if it were, that's good enough for me.

Do you have an alternative that provides comparable odds for comparable cost? Please do let me know; I want to sign up for that too.
