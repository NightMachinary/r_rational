How do you arrive at the 1/1000 number? I see a lot of numbers floated around and most of them seem /really, really/ optimistic. I'm as much about avoiding death as the next rationalist, but especially with cryonics I see a lot of what appears to be wishful thinking. I've seen Robin Hanson's [[http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/03/break-cryonics-down.html][estimate of >5%]] but he seems to be putting a lot of faith in not only the advancement of technology, but the continuity of organizations, the continuity of society, and the motivations/beliefs of future people.
