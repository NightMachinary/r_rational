Exasperated. I sincerely expect that no matter what I might try to do for humans, it will take an additional century or so of cultural change before they learn that the metaphysical abstractions they use to give so-called "grounding" to their so-called "value systems" /are not fucking real/ and that almost any of the various things I can do for them are infinitely preferable.

But oh well, in that circumstance, I can afford to wait forever. Let them live their lives as they please, and let the people who /want/ my help get it. Some transhumanists with a dark sense of humor have tended to say things like, "Oh, the ones with the right idea will eventually outnumber the dumb ones, because they'll be alive while the dumb ones are dead", but no, I will not fucking /let people die/ just for the sake of ideologies they don't even really believe in.

God-Emperorship is for corpses on golden thrones.
