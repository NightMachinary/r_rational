I've been thinking about the /Matrix/ movie and I was wondering how could someone with the knowledge that they're living in a stimulation escape or gain outside knowledge *without* being Neo who can warp the surrounding code for super-powers?

I mean, what kind of proof would be required to convince you of being in a stimulation, and what would be your first steps when you don't even know anything about how the stimulation works?

P.S. How would you feel as a successful Friendly AI? ;)
