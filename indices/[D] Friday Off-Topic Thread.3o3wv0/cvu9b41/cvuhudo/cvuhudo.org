Depending on our prior on the laws of physics of the world above our own, we might not want to do anything out of order (i.e. things that don't already happen near weird celestian bodies) in our universe, lest a bug scrambles it like the glider randomly thrown into a carefully assembled Game of Life construct. But if the negentropy of our universe turns out to be finite, we've ought to take our shot. I would guess that the most probable way to gain an interface into the higher levels would be to find types of computation that some universes cannot (easily) do, and which our universe can - for example, if the universe above us is like ours but classical (and actually implements us via the copenhagen interpretation, hah), it's going to run into trouble once we hook up a few hundred qubits and factor a large number. Do things that produce different results on different underlying universes, and Bayes does the rest.
