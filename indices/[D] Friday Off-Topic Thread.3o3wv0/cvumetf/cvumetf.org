I'm curious if anyone has advice on how often posting a story I myself work on is appropriate. It seems like the pace of updates has slowed down to about one every week at the shortest and occasionally longer.

But the amount of written word per update is rather low because I do a lot of illustration work on top.

So what's the opinion?
