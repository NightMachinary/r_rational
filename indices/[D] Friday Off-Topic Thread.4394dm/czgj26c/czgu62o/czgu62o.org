Antichamber is a great puzzle experience. It's very minimalistic in terms of story (almost no story), it's basically 100% first-person puzzles. The game has a bunch of noneuclidean space and stuff that's really neat. It's got really good puzzles, though, and will keep you occupied for a few hours without overstaying it's welcome. It's sort of expensive at full price for what it is, but is old enough to be on sale frequently. Completion time: ~8-10 hours.

Braid is, as everyone else says, a wonderful 2d puzzle game. It's totally worth picking up, even at full price, but also goes on sale frequently. Fairly short game (~4-5 hours at most, probably less).

The Swapper is a great puzzle game with a few interesting ideas about identity, the ship of theseus problem, consciousness, etc. It's got a fairly minimalist plot, but absolutely gorgeous aesthetics - everything in the entire game looks great. Completion time: ~5 hours.

The Talos Principle. It's got a neat mixture of portal-like first person puzzles with a gorgeous ruined civilization aesthetic, and a storyline that is surprisingly engaging. There is a lot of philosophical questions and stuff in The Talos Principle, but they're mostly not terribly sophisticated. Still more interesting than most videogames. A really fun puzzle game. There's a lot of secrets and hidden easter eggs, but even without those a full playthrough takes a long time.

QUBE: First person puzzles are pretty great, but game is short and fairly easy. Almost no plot, almost no replay value (worse than any of the other games in this list in terms of secrets and replay value). Get on sale, don't pay full price. ~3 hours.

Go play the Stanley Parable Demo. If you like it, you will love the game and it will be well worth your money for it's ~4 hours of play. If you don't like the demo, don't pick up the game. The demo doesn't spoil the game at all, but at the same time is the best possible explanation of what the game will be like - I /strongly/ recommend the free demo, even if you are convinced you will enjoy the game there is a lot of demo-only content you should see.

Dishonored: My single favorite game of recent years. It's got a neat plot, and gameplay similar to the Thief games - that is, stealth-FPS with looting, evading guards, etc. Only, you get magical powers to teleport and stuff. It's got a number of levels to explore in the course of missions which feel very big and are very complicated, it's got some replayability (two paths you can take that have meaning - low chaos and high chaos), and it's just a ton of fun, some of the most fun I've had in a game recently. The story is competent but not amazing for the most part - the actual main plot is decent, but all the optional quests, recorded sound journals, and other noncentral stuff is really amazing and brings the whole world to life.
