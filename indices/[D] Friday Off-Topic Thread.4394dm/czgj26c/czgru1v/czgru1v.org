I've played over one thousand hours of /[[http://store.steampowered.com/app/236850][Europa Universalis 4]]/ (mostly with the /MEIOU & Taxes/ mod) and almost 750 hours of /[[http://store.steampowered.com/app/203770][Crusader Kings 2]]/ (mostly with the /Historical Improvement Project/ mod). These historical grand-strategy games are entirely different from the /Civilization/ games, since they're inherently asymmetrical right from the start, and they actually aim for historical accuracy ([[http://np.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/42atyf/amazingly_cool_plans_for_the_next_totally_awesome/][especially with the mods]]). They're also ridiculously easy for a player to modify for himself, since most of the game files are in plain text. However, they can be a little expensive if not gotten on sale, since each game requires about a zillion expansions (lists: [[http://www.eu4wiki.com/Downloadable_content#Expansions][EU4]], [[http://www.ckiiwiki.com/Downloadable_content#Expansions][CK2]]) for the full experience. (See also [[/r/ParadoxPlaza][r/ParadoxPlaza]], [[/r/EU4][r/EU4]], and [[/r/CrusaderKings][r/CrusaderKings]].)

/[[http://store.steampowered.com/app/265890][Hexcells]]/ is a nice, cheap combination of Minesweeper and Picross/Nonograms.

/[[http://store.steampowered.com/app/360740][Downwell]]/ is a fun and cheap little action game.

/[[http://store.steampowered.com/app/24740][Burnout Paradise]]/ is pretty fun.
