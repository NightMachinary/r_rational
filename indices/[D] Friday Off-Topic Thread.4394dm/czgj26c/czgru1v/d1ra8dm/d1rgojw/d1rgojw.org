Yes, I'd definitely recommend the purchase of EU4 at this price.

The list of actually-important DLC (as opposed to the minor content packs) is [[http://www.eu4wiki.com/Downloadable_content#Expansions][here]]. In my opinion, [[http://www.eu4wiki.com/Art_of_War][Art of War]] (HRE league wars, revolution targets, client states), [[http://www.eu4wiki.com/El_Dorado][El Dorado]] (custom starting nations, exploration missions), and [[http://www.eu4wiki.com/Common_Sense][Common Sense]] (subject interactions, government ranks) are the most important expansions. (checks Steam) Oh, and how convenient--those are exactly the expansions on 66%-off sales.
