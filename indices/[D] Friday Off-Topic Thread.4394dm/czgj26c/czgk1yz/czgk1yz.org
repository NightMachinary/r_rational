[[http://braid-game.com/][Braid]]. Gorgeous, clever, doesn't outstay its welcome.

Also: [[http://store.steampowered.com/sub/37429/][XCOM]] is really cheap right now (and XCOM 2 comes out next week and seems strictly better). It isn't like any of the games on your list so I can't tell for sure if you'll like it, but an /excellent/ strategy game with AAA production values for Â£5 is certainly worth a try.

  1/10 - Borderlands 2 - Played this a while ago, forgot why I hated it

Possibly because it's boring as sin, with most of the gameplay being running backwards while whittling down samey bullet sponge enemies. My great disappointment of the year, and reminder that with video games you can't trust review aggregators one bit.
