It's against Steam's TOS to pretend to be in a different country (precisely because of that price discrimination) and Steam does its best to make it inconvenient. Use at your own risks.

Being an old, popular indie game, Braid frequently gets discounts and bundles though. Patient gamers can get it for much less than $15.

(It is worth the $15 IMO.)
