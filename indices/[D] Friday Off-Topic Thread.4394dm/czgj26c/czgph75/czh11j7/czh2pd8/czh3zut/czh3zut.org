Agreed that the acquisition of abilities that allow progress elsewhere is a shining feature of proper Metroidvanias.

I feel like a really good first-person Metroidvania could be, well, really good. People decry first-person platforming all the time, but I think Portal put those complaints to rest. I think an open-world Metroidvania Portal 3 could be pretty neat.
