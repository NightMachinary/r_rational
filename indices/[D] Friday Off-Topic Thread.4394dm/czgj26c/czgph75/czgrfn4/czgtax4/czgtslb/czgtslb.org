Oh and one game I feel compelled to mention that's probably too hard is La Mulana.

It's a metroidvania platformer where you explore a ruin as an Indiana Jones expy. But...

Remember that part in Indiana Jones and the last Crusade, where Indiana is going through the trials and he has to use his father's notes to survive? That's La Mulana.

It's basically one giant chain of Indiana Jones puzzles like those ones. It's fun, but you either need to get a guide or take notes. With real paper. Organize them.
