It took it some time to find its footing and develop its voice. I'd never have thought that the show as it existed in the pilot would have become the wild, energetic, off-the-wall show that it is now. I think the silliness really works for it though and helps to distinguish it. The power of NZT is about as variable as the plot demands, but I think it's got enough charm to make up for that.
