Yep, the first few episodes had my GF and I skeptical, but its quirky humor won us over soon enough.

I'm really interested to see how they develop their uses for it: I'm glad other characters in the show are quick to point out how wasted the drug is in solving crimes rather than biochemistry or engineering, where it can be used to literally solve worldwide problems.

That seems to be the direction Mora is heading in, obscure morals/methods aside.
