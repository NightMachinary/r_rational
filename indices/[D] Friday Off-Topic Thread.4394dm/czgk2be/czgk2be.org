Question for those of you in romantic relationships: Is your partner a rationalist as well? If not, do you ever find yourself having difficulty with them on certain things, due to you favoring a rational viewpoint over the viewpoint she prefers (a societal based one, an emotion based one, etc.)

For example, I could see the concept of "the one" causing friction in a relationship. As in, you don't believe in the concept, whereas your partner may be convinced that you are "the one" and is hurt by your reciprocating her belief.

Also any general notes about how you found rationality impacting your relationship ( If it does at all) would be cool. I'm just speaking as a curious, single person.

Edit: sorry in advance for typos. On mobile :(

Edit2: +I'm obviously only talking to M/F coup-+ Alright, let's end that there. In all seriousness, this post was primarily written with heterosexual couples in mind, simply because I'm a heterosexual and have the most experience with heterosexual relationships (from a viewer's standpoint anyway) No offense meant to non-heterosexual relationships, feel free to comment, regardless of what relationship you're in, as long as it's a romantic (though not necessarily sexual, you asexuals you!) one!
