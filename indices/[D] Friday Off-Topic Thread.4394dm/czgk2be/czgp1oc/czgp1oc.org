  Question for those of you in romantic relationships: Is your partner a rationalist as well?
#+end_quote

My fiancee dislikes LW culture and harbors genuine resentment and hatred over much of HPMoR. I also took her to LW-TA meetings sometimes and she liked the people there.

She doesn't follow the community, but very much considers an active practice of /good sense/, grounded in science and evidence, to be an absolutely essential part of life.

The fact that she deeply dislikes many societal norms and doesn't want to trust emotions that might derive from an active mental illness are big spurs towards that view.

Also, if she were here, she'd be telling me to beat you over the head about "emotion-based viewpoints" not being necessarily irrational, blah blah Straw Vulcan, blah blah. I concur.
