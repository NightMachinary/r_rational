Beating a human at Go is really hard, but it isn't GAI. All it means is that they managed to make a branch of their AI program specifically designed to do this one thing. When they have a single program which can beat an average human at Go, and drive a car, and precisely manipulate arbitrary physical objects, and just generally do all the things humans do on a day to day basis, then we have to start worrying about our benevolent robot overlords.
