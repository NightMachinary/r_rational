Oh, the algorithm is general, but if you sat the Go program in front of a chess tournament, it wouldn't do anything. If you gave it arms to manipulate, it wouldn't accomplish anything either. Google has a learning algorithm, but you have to train it for a while to do any specific task, and your end result won't be able to do anything else.
