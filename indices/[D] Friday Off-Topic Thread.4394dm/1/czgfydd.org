What do you guys think about [[http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-35420579][Google AI beat european go champion]]? is the breakthrough really about go, or about GAI?

On a side note, if anyone here is looking for nice mystery you can give [[http://myanimelist.net/anime/31043/Boku_dake_ga_Inai_Machi][Boku Dake Ga Inani Machi]]. I wouldn't say the writing is -that- good, but the direction is really really good. It really manages to get you into the mood of what is going on in the story, and to connect to the characters. Also the animation and art are fairly good.
