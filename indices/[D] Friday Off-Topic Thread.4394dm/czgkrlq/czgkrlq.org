I'm brainstorming a scifi story with alien races that have some common traits with humans because of convergent evolution. I am interested in the question of which features we are most likely / least likely to share with an intelligent alien race given similar primordial soups. (E.g. Earth mammals having five fingers seems just an accident of common ancestry, but eyes keep cropping up in unrelated species and often drift towards the human model.)

This sounds like the sort of topic there must be a lot of fun articles about; I would appreciate any recommendations.
