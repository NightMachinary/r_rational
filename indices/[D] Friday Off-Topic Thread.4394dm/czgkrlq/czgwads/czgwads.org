I too would love to see more articles about this, but in the meantime I'm happy to speculate:

*A Brain, Familiar Senses, and a Head* It's nice to limit the distance your nervous system must extend, and centralization has huge advantages. A brain centralizes thinking, minimizing thought time, and clumping as many sense organs as possible around that nerve center keeps reaction times low. Light and sound are omnipresent in most liveable environments. The molecular analysis of taste and smell are crucial for basic dietary reasons. Touch, temperature, balance, and proprioception would all be familiar mental concepts whether the aliens had specific devoted organs for those senses or not.

There's no reason any of these senses necessarily need to share (or not to share) the particular holes we happen to use.

*Arms and Hands*: You're right about not necessarily needing five fingers, but it is extremely important to have dexterous many-pronged instruments on the end of relatively strong limbs not used in general locomotion. The ability to manipulate and to carry seems an important step towards what we think of as intelligence.

Contrast the difficulties that crows, elephants, octopuses, and dolphins encounter with such interactions. They might be uplifted to technological competency, or provided with prosthetic versions, but their own innovations will have a hard time getting far with such limited physical ability to experiment.

*Bilateral Symmetry*: Binocular vision and binaural hearing have huge advantages in conceptually-2D land based life. Limbs in pairs have a lot of locomotive advantages. Given the importance of arms, the whole "two arms, two legs" thing might not even be that unusual. Fewer is inconvenient, more is a waste of energy.

*Omnivorous*: Energy is important.

Generally speaking, the fewer things a creature eats the less it has to think about what it's eating. Conveniently, the more things that a creature eats the less energy it has to spend digesting and the more that can be devoted to thinking.

It turns out flexible minds are expensive, but so are the sorts of vibrant guts that can turn a single food source into all the myriad proteins necessary to sustain life.

The smartest herbivores /can and must/ eat a wide variety of plants which supply different nutrients, the smartest carnivores /can and must/ eat the largest variety of animals. That dietary/intellectual spectrum has shown up in animals as diverse as arthropods, molluscs and mammals, so it would be no surprise if it existed in unconnected evolutionary trees.
