Like the others who commented, my GF isn't a "rationalist" and couldn't get into HPMOR, though she did give it an honest shot (not even my remixed version helped ;_;). That said, she's an exceedingly intelligent person who is studying biochemistry and programming, so she's more rational than the majority of people.

*That said,* we argue occasionally about things like whether her love for me is "stronger" because it's more emotional and less logical (neither of us believe in "the one," but two people loving each other exactly the same amount seems improbable), or some differences of opinion that can mostly be chalked up to her being more "traditional" or "conservative" in certain regards.

Every relationship has disagreements, however, and the most important thing is how we react to them. We've always tried to treat each other with respect, and have commented on how grateful we are that the other is an intelligent and rational person that we can disagree on big issues without it causing resentment. Best of all, we've changed each other's minds on a number of things, which is really the best you can ask for in a partner: for them to logically challenge your beliefs and help you learn.
