[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9676374/1/Daystar-s-Remix-of-Rationality][This.]] I wrote it to help the early parts of the story flow a bit better and introduce the characters as more well rounded and less abrasive, the way they do in the later parts of the story. I noticed a lot of people who start reading HPMOR have the same complaints about Harry's brattyness and the generally rough writing, and have gotten good feedback on the remix's ability to introduce people to the story better.

"Traditional" and "conservative" not in the sense of religion or anything as personality/world defining. More about things like to what degree society's mores are helpful or harmful. For example, I have a tendency to be a bit too flippant about the way other people see me, or the first impressions I might give: "if they judge me on my sandals, who cares what they think?" or similar. She's made the point before that being able to acknowledge that about society and people in it and act accordingly is actually the more mature and rational approach, in circumstances where it actually matters how others view you.
