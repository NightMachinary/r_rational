My wife isn't a rationalist, but she tends to be /sensible/, which gets her most of the way there and is all I really need. We have a fair division of labor around the house, we thank each other for the small things, there aren't many points of friction where an argument could develop, etc. She takes correction well and I try my best to do the same. There's not much that we disagree on, or that we can't talk out with each other; there's nothing intractable and there are no recurring fights.

So no, no impacts at all. She's great.
