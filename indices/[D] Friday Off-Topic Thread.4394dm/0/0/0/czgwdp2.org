The game is all about minimalism, and there are a few places where I think it hampers itself in pursuit of that goal. The lack of a map is definitely one of them. The lack of settings is another (though there are at least /some/ mitigating reasons for that). I wouldn't give it a 10 either, especially not at the current price point. But it is a good game, especially if you like minimalist puzzlers.
