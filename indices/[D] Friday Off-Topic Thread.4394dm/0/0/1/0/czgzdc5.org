Regarding maps: It doesn't necessarily have to be HUD-based maps - it could be other navigational aids as well. I recall, for example, The Talos Principle had no HUD-based obstructive maps at all, but I spent about 95% less time lost because they had /signs/ up everywhere pointing you toward puzzles you had / had not solved (black marks through the puzzle reward on the sign to indicate you solved it already) so you could always find a new goal to work towards. Some signposts or other indicators would be a gigantic improvement. Even just putting the boat map on some boards with a 'you are here' in a bunch of prominent places inland would be super nice.
