Ouch! I feel for you. That's why I haven't switched to a Mac yet, because I have so many cool Windows-only games and software.

Does anyone know how hard it is to export games from Windows to Mac/Linux? I don't know too much about programming games and I constantly see games being offered on only one platform while others are offered on every platform imaginable. So how hard is it versus making the game itself?
