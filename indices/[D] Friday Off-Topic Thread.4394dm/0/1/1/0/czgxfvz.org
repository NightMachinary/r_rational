The recorded market share for Linux gaming (which I don't believe accounts for things like WINE or dual-boot) on Steam is less than 1%. If the effort to support Linux is non-negligible, then it will be neglected. From @cmuratori, the initial porting isn't the problem. The problem is the testing, maintenance, and support.
