metamore is the significant other of my significant other who is not my significant other.

It is a good idea to be on cordial if not pleasant terms with one's metamores but the relationship is not the 'same' as with one who might be with your 'loved' ones.

I'm Asexual, my SO is pretty much pan, [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyFightCrime][we fight crime...]] I mean it's interesting and complicated and wonderful and there is probably three tumblrs worth of complexity and weird terminology that could be used to describe how this works out.

Mostly it's highly convenient and feels like the best way to get things done for us. But it needs to come with warning labels for any fool kids that think it's gonna be easy.
