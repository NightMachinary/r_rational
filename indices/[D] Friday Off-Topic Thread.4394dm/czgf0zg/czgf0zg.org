Do you ever write in reverse for fun?

--------------

I find it fairly enjoyable, myself ([[http://i.imgur.com/96PThIF.png][original image]], [[http://i.imgur.com/pvk5Yy8.png][reversed image]]; [[http://www.jabberwocky.com/carroll/jabber/jabberwocky.html][text source]])--it really forces the writer to /think/ about the shapes of the letters. For example, the letter =d= doesn't have a /leftward/ bulge--rather, it must be considered as having a protrusion /opposite to the direction of writing,/ or the writer will constantly mix it up with =b=. Likewise, =q= in reversed cursive takes a fair amount of thought to execute correctly.
