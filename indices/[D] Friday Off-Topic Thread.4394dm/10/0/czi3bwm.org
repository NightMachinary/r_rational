  My current draft design-document is at [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XcgNwELHCU-r7GuYUgDNDDIviThd8Y7Bdto_kMIcmlI/edit]]

And in that design-doc, I have chosen to invoke the name of [[/u/EliezerYudkowsky]] in the form of the "Yudkowsky-Schneier security protocols", designed to "minimize the odds, and minimize the impact, of a selection of low-probability, high-impact threats". I can only hope that my mental model of what Yudkowsky and [[https://www.schneier.com/][Bruce Schneier]] could come up with if they collaborated is accurate enough that no Willing Suspension of Disbelief will be necessary.
