Fuck.

That sucks man. While I do believe that death can be defeated, as it's merely a result of our imperfect physiology, I doubt it'll happen in time for any of us, let alone your professor.

I don't know either of you personally, so I'm not going to pretend to have attachments I don't, but, on behalf of all of us who've lost loved ones, I can tell you I understand, and I wish you luck in getting through it and them luck in hanging on for as long as they can without excess suffering.
