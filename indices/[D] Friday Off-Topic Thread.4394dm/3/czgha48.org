So I've recently been presented with something of a difficult situation. I was having a conversation with one of my professors, someone I respect and care about. I've known they had a serious condition of some kind since last year but I found out its specific nature. It's a genetic issue often abbreviated as MERRF, basically the mitochondria in their body just begin dying and this causes their entire body to slowly degrade. There isn't a cure, and I don't think there will be until gene therapy advances significantly.

It's something that acts very slowly as far as incurable fatal diseases go. I don't know, I just wanted to share this with some folks that don't tend towards fatalism. I'm not really sure what I'm asking for, it's just a really unfair situation.

Feel free to ask for more information, although I might decline to answer since I'm not sure how much it would be appropriate to share.
