Just binge-watched the first season this week, and once you get past the usual frustration of irrational characters, it's immensely entertaining. Obviously the pill doesn't actually make you any smarter - it just gives you massive amounts of processing power.

I love Brian's narration and general sense of humor, and the plot isn't lacking in things to keep me interested. Looking forward to season 2.
