These are all things that I've complained about while watching the show: namely that the very first thing you should do when a mysterious and scarce pill lets you learn anything is learn enough to make your own, as Mora did in the movie. But I think the character is just less intelligent overall, and working within more restrictions, namely that the apparently all-knowing and also on NZT Mora is holding him and potentially his family hostage for his obedience.
