My main point of contention is that, apparently, not once does Brian consider using some NZT-time to figure a potential way out of either of his situations. No real data gathering, no searching for blackmail material, no contingency plans whatsoever. Or maybe, if we're going to ignore even possibly thinking about Edward Morra and the enzyme except when needed for the plot, how about oh, I don't know, immortality by way of mice? Building a jetpack? Anything at all!?

Nor does he actually think for a second about building up a stash of NZT. Step 1: gather materials to make little see-through pills of nothing that look like NZT. Make said pills. Step 2: do enough work in the office for two days, or just pretend you only get through half of whatever you normally get done. Maybe train your non-NZT self on how to act like he's on NZT through videos and such. Figure it out, you're on FLIPPING NZT. Step 3: the next morning, apply some sleight of hand and swallow the fake NZT pill while keeping the real one. Keep the real one on hand in case of emergency, of course. Do this once a week when possible, maybe more. Tada. A secret emergency stash of what is literally your most valuable asset.
