I am seeing more and more people online talk about this game, and it's becoming very upsetting that it doesn't exist on any platform I have access to right now.

Anyhow, what I actually wanted to mention was that in the puzzle-solver genre, I highly recommend [[http://neutralxe.net/esc/elements_play.html]["Elements" by Neutral]] if you haven't played it before. It's free and in-browser.
