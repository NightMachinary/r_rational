I'm really enjoying /The Witness/ for the most part. It's a game that's very much about challenging your assumptions and taking in the world as it is rather than how you would like it to be. It's also filled to the brim with fiendishly difficult puzzles. So I second [[/u/xamueljones]] recommendation and think this is a worthy successor to /Braid/. I haven't finished the game yet, though I think I'm only a few hours away and will probably go for full completion, which will likely double my time.

Also, today is my last day of work, after which I will be a stay-at-home dad (and ideally doing contract work and/or writing on the side). So that's neat.
