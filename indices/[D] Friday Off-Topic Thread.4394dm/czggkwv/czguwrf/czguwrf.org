I have a somewhat different opinion of The Witness. I really like a lot of the game, but I don't feel it's perfect. I have played ~12 hours and [[#s][spoiler]], so while I haven't seen the entire game I feel I can render some sort of initial judgement on the game. I really like a lot of the game overall, and it seems really fun in many areas, but the problems that I have with it are significant enough to lower it from potential 10/10 to more like a 8/10 experience.

1. It's now [Current Year], we should have options menues where we can adjust field of view sliders, graphics quality, resolution, etc. We shouldn't be forced to edit random text files in the game's folder with Notepad to adjust antialiasing levels. This shit is not acceptable in a $40 release. No, having 3 graphics quality options is not enough.

2. The puzzles have a lot of neat mechanics, and they work together well when they mix multiple puzzle mechanics together. It's great. However, there are a HUGE number of puzzles after you understand the basic mechanic of an area just using that basic mechanic in more complicated ways, and in several areas they get boring like halfway through or even earlier. Ten of the same puzzle with extremely slight differences is not ten times as amazing as the first puzzle - and lots of areas don't limit themselves to small numbers of repetitions like 10. A lot of mechanics overstay their welcome in this game and become boring for me before I'm done all the puzzles.

3. The audio is all FUBAR for my PC. I get constant skipping and repeating of audio cues and audio logs. It would be a bigger deal in a game with more audio logs etc (I have found precisely 2 extensive audio logs in my ~12 hours of play). Some forum threads suggest killing audio software etc, and I haven't had any success with that - basically, I don't know why it's broken but it is and it made the two audio logs I listened to almost unbearably annoying. There are also segments of puzzles using sound that were much more difficult than they had any right to be because of this issue. Thank god there's no music and mostly not a huge number of ambient noises.

4. The lack of an ingame map [[#s][spoiler]] is a giant nuisance for a game this sized. It's impossible to navigate the island without getting lost constantly for the first ~12 hours, and trying to find somewhere you've been before is a nightmare.
