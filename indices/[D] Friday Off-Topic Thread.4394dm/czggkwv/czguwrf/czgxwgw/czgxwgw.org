The lasers and the boat aren't spoilers, they're in the trailer.

I consider the lack of a map display to be a good thing. I want more games with no maps, or at least maps embedded into the world with no game-model-breaking properties. The Pip-Boy is bad. The boat map is good.

I won't disagree on having options menus, however, there's no real way around that without killing accessibility.

The audio is a bug and you should report it. Number None is doing a lot of support work, so make use of it.
