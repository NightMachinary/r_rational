Early Metroidvanias were 2D exploration platformers. I would suggest going back and emulating old GBA metroid titles. Metroid Zero Mission and Metroid Fusion are some of the best games in the series.

Castlevania has grown as a franchise. Earlier games were more difficulty focused, But starting with Symphony of the Night the 2D games began following the formula of gaining power ups to progress in exploration of the castle, and were all generally well received.

Both series are somewhat minimalist storywise, and the lore is generally still understandable if you play them out of order.

If you want a more story based metroidvania, Cave Story is generally considered a masterpiece. It has always been free to download online since its initial release, though remastered versions such as Cave Story+ exist for purchase on steam.

Roguelikes.

Spelunky and Rogue Legacy are two games that bridge both genres.

I'd play Splunkey before Rogue Legacy, firstly because I find it more fun, and secondly because much like Cave Story there is an original free version in addition to a remastered version on steam.

As for pure roguelikes, there's a difficult line to straddle. Too hard and it's boring because you're at the beginning of the game too much. Too easy and.. well.

Faster than Light and Teleglitch were both roguelikes that I felt had both great game-play and great atmosphere, but they share the feature of being pretty hard.

I'd suggest you just watch someone play the beginning of each of those games on youtube and see if you like what you see.
