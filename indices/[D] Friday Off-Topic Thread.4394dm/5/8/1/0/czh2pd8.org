I Wanna Be The Guy isn't what most people refer to as a Metroidvania - one of the distinguishing elements of a Metroidvania is collection powers that allow you to advance in other areas - you're in a large area that you unlock more and more of by collecting more mobility / unlocking / etc powers. The canonical examples are Super Metroid and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. IWBTG is a straight platformer.

The best Metroidvania so far is probably Guacamelee! Super Turbo Championship Edition. It's a great game that takes inspiration from Mexican culture (esp. luchadores etc) and is just really wonderfully well done.
