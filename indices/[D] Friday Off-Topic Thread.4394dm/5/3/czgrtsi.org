HyperRogue is a pretty great mind-bending roguelike. Casual play is simple, but coming to a deeper understanding of what's going on over many playthroughs will necessarily and easily teach you advanced mathematical concepts pertaining to non-Euclidean geometry. As of yet it has no story, but on the mind-bending front I'd certainly compare it to Portal. It's regularly updated with new areas.
