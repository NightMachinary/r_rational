I like Crusader Kings 2 a lot, but the learning curve is a cliff face +(and by all accounts it's the simplest one)+.

You definitely don't need "the full experience" aka all the DLCs. Many are overpriced cosmetic, and even the gameplay ones mostly just increase replayability of an already very very replayable game. I'd recommend starting with the vanilla game only unless there's some crazy discount. (Alas, the autumn-winter Steam sales season is behind us.)
