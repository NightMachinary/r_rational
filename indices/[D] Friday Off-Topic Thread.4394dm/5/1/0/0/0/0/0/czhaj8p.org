Actually, Firaxis had mods on launch on Civilization IV, I believe, as well, although their more recent games have been bereft of it. It required quite a bit of hacking to get Civ V to support multiplayer modding (see the NQMod reddit for details on that), but Civ IV had some really stellar (doho!) mods like Fall From Heaven 2. I toiled away many an hour on that one.
