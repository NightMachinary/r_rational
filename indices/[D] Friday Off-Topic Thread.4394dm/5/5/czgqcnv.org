The Binding of Isaac (Rebirth) is a good Rougelike. It's very light on story, but it's got a great deal of replayability. A game takes 30-90 minutes to finish, and everything is randomly generated (Within certain parameters, of course; one shop per floor, with random stuff in it, one treasure room, one boss).

Every playthrough is different, because there are hundreds of different items you can come across, and they all have weird synergies with each other. It's not an intellectual game, but there is planning ahead and experimentation to be done, and you'll never have two identical runs.

There is /some/ story stuff to figure out, as well as the mystery of how to unlock things, so if you haven't played it before I recommend staying away from spoilers, at least until you have cleared a 10 floor playthrough.

Rebirth is the same game as just The Binding of Isaac, but bigger and better, so no reason to play the vanilla version unless you can get it for free somewhere.
