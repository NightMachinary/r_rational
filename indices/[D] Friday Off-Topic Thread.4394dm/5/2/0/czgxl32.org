I second pretty much every puzzle game just mentioned here.

The only ones missing are [[http://store.steampowered.com/app/224760/][Fez]] and [[http://playdead.com/limbo/][Limbo]].

Fez is an awesome puzzling game where a 2-D character learns to move between 2-D slices of a 3-D world.

Limbo is a fairly simple puzzling game where a young boy has to survive monsters stalking him and reach important levers and switches to reunite with his sister. It's one of the most brilliant blend of environmental puzzles and story telling I have seen.
