I like Antichamber's structure, where you don't have to solve everything to beat the game - it has some more or less mandatory puzzles, but every /major/ obstacle to completion has multiple different ways to achieve victory (different puzzles all leading to same ultimate goal location) which makes it more forgiving and easier. Also, there's tons of extra secret rooms unnecessary to achieving victory where the dev put a lot of their developer's work, and these most difficult puzzles are pretty much wholly optional.

The hardest puzzles in Antichamber are harder than the hardest ones in Portal, but the level of difficulty of the puzzles you have to do to beat the game is about the same. Braid is similar, in that the secret stars are sort of BS but the rest of the game is more straightforward.
