Some method of fine manipulation. Not necessarily opposable thumbs, but something similar enough to allow precision in tool crafting and use.

Sexual dimophism also seems like a plausible candidate, both for the rapidity of mutation, and as a way for the species to compete internally, while still allowing for wide-scale cooperation.

It would be interesting to see some of those species lack some of those common features, and explore what that difference would entail. How does the intelligent solitary predator compare to intelligent group hunter-gatherers?
