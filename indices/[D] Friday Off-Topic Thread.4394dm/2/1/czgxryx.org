If you don't have something exotic like a genetic memory or telepathy through skin contact, then I would expect aliens to have a long childhood and some sort of protectiveness towards their young.

Because the main drawback of intelligence is just how long it takes to learn everything you need to know without it being hard-coded in as instincts. Hence there must be some sort of lengthy learning phase and the species needs to have good protection for their young during this period of life.
