  it is extremely important to have dexterous *many-pronged* instruments on the end of relatively strong limbs

Why many-pronged? Couldn't a tentacle of some sort (with either good strength or a rugged / sticky / sucking surface, so that it can grip) be good enough for advanced tool use? [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DoWdHOtlrk][Octopuses seem to do okay]], if you account for their weak boneless grip.

I was not aware. This is really interesting, and exactly the kind of insight I was looking for.
