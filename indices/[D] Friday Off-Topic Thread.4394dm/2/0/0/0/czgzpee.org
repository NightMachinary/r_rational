An octopus tentacle is arguably multi-pronged: They have individual control of each suction cup. It can grasp exactly as much or as little as it cares to, and by that definition considerably more than half an octopus's surface area is hand.

What it's missing are /arms/, with lifting strength and distinction from locomotive use.
