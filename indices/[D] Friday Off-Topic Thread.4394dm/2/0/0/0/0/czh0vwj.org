Also there are birds with independently posable beak segments. if you include a tongue in that you could make a case for a bird having three 'prongs' to manipulate objects and tools.

I challenged myself to making a quadrupedal crocodilian tool user. They developed tool use via their jaw muscles and used tongue+variety of teeth and jaw postures to manipulate tools. Their forelegs acted as proping/grasping and the long/strong appendage factor was fulfilled by a muscular and flexible neck. Their tool use occured as an offshoot of nest building/manipulation and the invention of fire and cooperative social interaction allowed for more precise control of the heat distribution in their nests, which gave their females a way to control depending on environmental conditions the genders of their offspring.

sexual selection became a highly social game and sons/daughters and ready access to burnable fuels along side aquacultures of usable fish and general environmental challenges eventually created industrial revolution.

Their version of population labor opening up from necessry work was the creation of electrically heated nest beds (an offshoot of their more kiln like 'traditional' nests) and eventually caused much social, political and economical upheaval.

then some one built a GAI out of video game and everyone got raptured and is arguably dead.

If you want to use any of that particular species' traits feel free.
