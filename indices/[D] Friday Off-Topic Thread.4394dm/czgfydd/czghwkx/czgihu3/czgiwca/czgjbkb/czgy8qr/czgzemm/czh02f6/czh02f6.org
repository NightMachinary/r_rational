Deep neural nets aren't good at /all/ tasks. They still fall down on a lot of things real brains can do fairly easily, and can be easily fooled. The hype just brushes that under the rug.

Not all tasks have lots of multi-information in their training datasets, require only very weak generalization, and don't make use of strong prior causal knowledge.
