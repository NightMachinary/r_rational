Any comment on that whole "this advancement is about a decade faster then expected" talk which is mentioned in a couple of articles in regards to this? is it really that much of a jump? is there any reason to expect similar jumps in the future? is this just transferable to other fields, i.e. could the advancements be used to play any arbitrary board game? game? function such as voice to text?
