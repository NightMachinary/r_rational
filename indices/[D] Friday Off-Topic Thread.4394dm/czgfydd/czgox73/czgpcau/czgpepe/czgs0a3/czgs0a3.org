  To me that sounds like hype based on a misunderstanding of how research advances and a desire to market their achievement as bigger than it really is.

It definitely sounds like hyping on the one hand, but on the other so will a real advancement that is a decade ahead of time. The question is can you evaluate the development and actually judge that it is an over statement or is it just well placed skepticism?

I saw EY seems to think its a big deal from the thread on SSC, but I am not sure if its a principle thing or a technical thing. and it seems a lot of people over there think he is overreacting.

  That's already being done with deep neural networks, eg: Amazon Echo. It's a product now: the UFAI you can keep at home!

I know they are used, the question if this algorithm would enable more accurate\quick recognition? or some other advancement?
