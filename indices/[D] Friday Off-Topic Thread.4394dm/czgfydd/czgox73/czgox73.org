  What do you guys think about Google AI beat european go champion? is the breakthrough really about go, or about GAI?

Neither but both.

The breakthrough is in /general/ models and algorithms that can be /trained/ for arbitrary specific tasks. So-called "transfer learning", re-using training data/experience from one task to pre-train for another, is still considered an open problem in which comparatively few advancements have been made.

Further, there isn't a consensus on /why/ these "deep learning" models work as well as they do, as there are several different hypotheses as to why and most of them aren't very, shall we say, /predictive/, in the sense of being able to tell you ahead of time when deep learning should work and when it shouldn't.

I'm partisan to one of those theories, and it also tells us a lot about transfer learning, but it's going to take a few good experiments and a theoretical paper to actually cover the ground.
