There are subjects without practice. The only use in learning it, is so you can teach it.

But yes, this ("an implied self interest") attributes too much effect to one cause.

Teachers and students both have different priorities, and different ways of operating.

For a student, "X MUST BE DONE /THIS/ WAY" is the worst way to teach - The method is irrelevant, only the answers matter.

There is a big difference between an student who is interested and one who isn't.

Some students learn best one way, others another. (In math, some people are great with geometry, others algebra, and still others with some other method neither you nor I have ever heard of.)

I love math, and know it well. Math classes are garbage.
