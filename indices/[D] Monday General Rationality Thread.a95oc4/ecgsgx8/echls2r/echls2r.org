I always had some version or another of this concept in mind and today I found somebody who phrased it in a better way.

​

#+begin_quote
  Experts and teachers have an implied self interest in making people think learning their fields takes more time / is harder than it actually is.
#+end_quote

Not a direct quote btw. This means you can, actually learn things with less effort, and time than your professors / teachers would have you believe if you use a method more compatible with your own learning strengths and weaknesses. While focusing on the important points while not diving as deep into unimportant specifics.

This is the kind of thing I'd like to see more in Good Student sometimes, instead of just being the guy that works harder than everybody else and studies more, it'd be nice to see him studying smarter, focusing on learning the more important things first, using different methods, optimizing in different ways, combining unrelated subjects into new ideas, reasoning from first principles etc..
