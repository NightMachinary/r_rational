  Experts and teachers have an implied self interest in making people think learning their fields takes more time / is harder than it actually is.

I understand the theoretical point here, but I think this statement might be too cynical.

At least in my experience, the kinds of people that become teachers or experts in technical fields are the people that are super enthusiastic about it and those people tend to want nothing more than to share their love for their field with others.
