I can see this going the other way as well. Experts and teachers are more likely to have a significantly higher than average interest and talent in their particular field, which is why they chose to go into that field in the first place, and also they're someone who succeeded rather than someone who dropped out because they found it to be too difficult. As such, they are likely to have had an easier time learning it than someone without the same interest and talent and suvivorship bias in their field.

Both of these effects will pull portrayals in opposite directions. I'm extremely good at math, but even if I have some implied self interest in making people think math is hard, I definitely perceive it and portray it as being easier than everyone else seems to think it is. I actually struggle to figure out why most other people don't get it the same way that I do, even if I know due to experience that they don't.

Now, there probably are different learning strategies that work for different kinds of people, so the sorts of techniques and metaphors that I encountered and invented when learning math for the first time and use to teach it won't be the same techniques and metaphors that work for every one of my students. So some students could benefit by learning from techniques more suited to their own learning style, but that's more of a compatability thing, and isn't related to any sort of prestige bias.
