  As a replacement since this season is advertised as one in which we come together?

That one, I believe. The winter is (at least in large parts of Europe and North America) a dark and cold time when people have a stronger need for social connections.

Religious holidays (used to) fill that need, if we want to stop this whole religion business then we'd have to find some replacement for those holidays.

Personally, while the whole thing is cool as hell, I think Christmas is already becoming plenty secular for a lot of people, so it's more practical to just push to continue that trend.
