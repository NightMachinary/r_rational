The interlude chapter titles have been lyrics from a song about traitorous:

#+begin_quote
  “Then let us be wicked,

  Let us be reddest ruin

  Rent, broken, crooked

  Black hearted and cruel

  .

  Then let us be doom,

  To both friend and foe

  Fly banner of gloom

  We lowest of the low

  .

  Rise, rise all ye villains

  You rogues and madmen

  Proudly claim the stage,

  Of this wondrous age

  .

  We are not kind or just

  Deserving of any victory

  We are a thing of dust

  Promised only misery

  .

  So smile, Tyrants,

  And let us be wicked”

  -- Final monologue of “The Many Deaths of Traitorous”, a play on the reign of the Dread Emperor Traitorous
