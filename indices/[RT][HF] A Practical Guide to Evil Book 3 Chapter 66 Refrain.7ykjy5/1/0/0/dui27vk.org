That depends entirely on how the crossing works. It has be based in something and it seems like it using the target's mind as a basis to generate hypothetical scenarios instead of literally being able to traverse time in multiple directions seems much more likely. And if it is based off the target's mind then biases could play a pretty big role in determining how the pathways flow and ultimately converge.
