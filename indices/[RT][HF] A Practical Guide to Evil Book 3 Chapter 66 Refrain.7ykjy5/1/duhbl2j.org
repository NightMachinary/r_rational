General thoughts in chronological order of reading:

- The point about Akua being lonely as a result of the insane competitiveness of her upbringing was interesting. You can almost treat her as a tragic figure, emotionally stunted and grasping for the only way she knows of to get approval, power and respect. Makes me a think of those kids who are trained from five to be athletes, dancers or piano prodigies. They end up kinda messed up in the head. It seems like her mother raised her a similar way but with power and magic as the focus. Even her father who seems to have an almost normal relationship of love and affection with her mainly related to her by teaching magic.

- The idea of the “Fourfold Crossing” test as being cleansing also gives us a hint of how she thinks. Seems like a lot of her ideology is a kind of refined self interest. Where being true to yourself means not having contradictions, even if that means being 100% evil its still being true to who you are. Cat regardless of her circumstances made the same choice in all the scenarios. Seemingly black didn't in his?

- ““That's your first mistake,” I said. “Thinking I'm only now beginning.”” Reminds me of a certain famous moment in Watchmen.

- Nice to see Cat actually having prepared for a fight by thinking about tactics and benefitting from that. Makes a nice contrast to what was alluded to earlier about her habit of recklessness. Only really works because Akua is so predictable though. Against a smarter enemy it wouldn't. Akua always thinks of herself as the only clever one.
