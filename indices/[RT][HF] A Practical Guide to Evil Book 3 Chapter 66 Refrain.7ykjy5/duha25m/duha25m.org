  “Is this the sum of you, Catherine Foundling?” Akua said. “Were you so disbelieving of victory you decided to burn us both?”

  “Do you ever get tired?” I smiled rudely. “You know, of being wrong all the time.”

Brilliant.

--------------

Cat was dominating from the very beginning. Diabolist never stood a chance.

Nice use of the villainous monologue. I was actually shaking my head at the beginning, because you'd think that Cat would know better than to launch into a monologue - Akua even hangs a lampshade on it, pointing it out - but, evidently, Cat was playing chess while Akua was playing checkers.

She should have killed Black as soon as he failed the trial. Classic blunder, and a massive mistake from someone who was thus far admirably avoiding the idiot ball. I wonder why she didn't, actually.

Akua's as good as dead now. Neither of them have used an aspect, but I have a feeling that Cat's prepared for that eventuality. The only question is, what is Cat's endgame with stepping into Arcadia?
