Since Diabolist referred to Wekesa as 'the Apprentice', it'd have to be before the fight that gave Warlock his epithet.

The fact that Akua knows about and uses it points to it being Praesi (she seems the type to disdain using non-praesi workings), so probably during the civil war. I just said 'before/during' to give a general time period.
