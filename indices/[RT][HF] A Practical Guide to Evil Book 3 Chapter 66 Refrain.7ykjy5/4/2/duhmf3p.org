Presumably its a trap to bait Akua into arcadia, where Cat is stronger? Like, lead her from her own domain to Cat's

An interesting tidbit is that stories are stronger for fae, and stronger in arcadia. And now we go into arcadia, with Cat being part fae. That should probably come into play at some point
