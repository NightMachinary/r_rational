  It is widely accepted that villains who leave their enemies to certain death will find them coming back at the least opportune moment, having impossibly escaped the perfect trap.

Not exactly. It's widely accepted that /heroes/ left to certain death will come back at the least opportune moment. Hell, the current White Knight explicitly calls on this at one point (saying "We couldn't possibly survive this! Let's do it!").

Akua definitely isn't playing a hero role here, and she definitely doesn't have the providence that heroes do.

This is not to say that Akua is definitely dead and gone (someone guessed her *claim*ing the portal to Arcadia, and I find that likely - if she even needs to). Just that Cat isn't insane for doing this against another villain.
