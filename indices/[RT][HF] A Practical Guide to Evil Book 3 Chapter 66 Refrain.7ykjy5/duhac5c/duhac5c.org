I'm guessing Cat's plan is to escape into Arcadia and (hopefully) leave behind Ubua's body to burn.

In that case, how is she planning to keep Black alive? My guess would be that he is also in Liesse (or at least accessible from there, hmm, he might not be in Liesse, but still, there's a chance that he is there); meaning the goblinfire would engulf him as well, correct?

Also, although it is somewhat likely that Ubua's phylactery is hidden somewhere in her city of power, it's not /that/ likely and so I don't think I can hope for it getting destroyed here :( Any thoughts on how Ubua is going to come back if she doesn't get in on Cat's gate?
