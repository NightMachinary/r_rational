Waiting until Wednesday is gonna kill me.

EDIT: So, the Fourfold Crossing was the trial, and Akua herself is the monster. Interesting. It's pretty likely that this tenth exchange will be the pivot.

My theory, here, is that Akua will attempt to usurp Cat's Winter powers (like in the Crossing-vision), but the fact that Cat is in Arcadia will fuck with that. Cat herself mused within the last few chapters that fey were weaker (for lack of a better term) in Creation because they need to fit into reality.

Edit2: Found the passage I was thinking of.

   I should have understood it properly then, because what were even the most powerful of the fae but Named with the weight of millennia behind them? It was why they'd lost. Because when they'd come down to Creation, to this messy battlefield of ours, they'd been forced to fashion themselves into people. In Arcadia, they were perfect: not in the sense of flawlessness, no, but in the way that a cog in a machine fit exactly the form and purpose it was meant for. A god made to masquerade as a mortal had the fatal flaw of perfection removed from the perfect.

While Cat isn't truly fey, she is closer than a regular person, so I don't think she'll get a huge power boost (though she effectively has 2 Names right now) from this, but she should get some benefit from it.
