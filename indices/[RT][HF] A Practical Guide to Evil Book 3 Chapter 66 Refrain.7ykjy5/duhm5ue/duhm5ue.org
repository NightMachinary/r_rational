You know, for a chapter that starts the direct phase of confrontation between Squire and Diabolist, it's surprisingly self-contained. No references to next parts of their respective plans, exact number of turns proclaimed at the outset of the fight and all of them carried out by the end of it, even the beginning of the next chapter (Akua having to follow to Arcadia, where Cat has more power, story not limited by the laws of Creation and fairies that can't touch her) is relatively clear.

The only loose thread remaining is, well, Black. Who's still stuck in Liesse, with whatever Akua's monster is, most of her mages and wight. And Thief with about a company of sappers freshly out of goblinfire.

I gingerly hope for another interlude, now from PoV of the remains of Diabolist's staff, in style of what TVTropes would call Mook Horror Show.
