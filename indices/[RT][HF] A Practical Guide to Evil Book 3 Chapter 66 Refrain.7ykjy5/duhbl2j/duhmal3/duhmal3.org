  The idea of the “Fourfold Crossing” test as being cleansing also gives us a hint of how she thinks. Seems like a lot of her ideology is a kind of refined self interest. Where being true to yourself means not having contradictions, even if that means being 100% evil its still being true to who you are. Cat regardless of her circumstances made the same choice in all the scenarios. Seemingly black didn't in his?

option A, Black just didn't know, and if Cat hadn't known, she wouldn't have stabbed either. Stabbing seems logical for at least 2 out 4, Cat herself and White Knight, General was also in it for Callow, but what about the Toltaker, seems out of character for her?

option B. Black's 4 lives are vastly more different than Cat's, if they diverge at a similar point (So black doesn't become the Black Knight) then presumably in one life he lead the life of a farmer or something in that vein.

option C. Blacks pragmatic nature lead him to bargain or cut his losses in several worlds.
