I think one of the most interesting point of the "Fourfold Crossing" is the contrary of what you think. You may say Cat acts in a kind of self interest, but the three other "what if" show something really important. No matter the way she could have choose (General/hero/underground lady), Callow DOES end very very badly. Her current path was as she said, the best way for the country. When she said things about how the things would go with Praes kicked out, one could say "yeah, but it's all theorical, it's not sure".

Now, she IS sure. She saw the other possibilities. Sure that her way is definitely the best way she could have done things, and thus, she will even more believe she is doing the right thing. It can be good, or it can be bad. But she will even less hesitate, now.
