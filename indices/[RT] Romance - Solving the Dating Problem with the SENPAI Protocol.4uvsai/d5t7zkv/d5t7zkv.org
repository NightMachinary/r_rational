  *1. Introduction*

  The Dating Problem is an extremely difficult computational problem that has plagued humanity since time immemorial. The problem concerns two agents Alice and Bob (or Alex and Bob, or Alice and Beatrice), each of whom may or may not have a crush on the other. Each is initially unaware of the other's feelings, and if they have a crush, they would like to know whether the other does as well; however, each would like to reveal their crush only if the other shares the interest. This problem is of widespread interest and appli- cability; for example, a solution to the Dating Problem is a hitherto unremarked-on prerequisite for the Stable Marriage Algorithm. This problem, once thought intractable, can in fact be solved efficiently using cryptographic methods. A protocol providing security against semi-honest adversaries was pre- sented as early as 2008 in a paper by Scott Aaronson. In this paper, Aaronson suggests that zero-knowledge proofs could be used to remove the semi-honesty assumption; however, this poses serious challenges for any practical implementa- tion of the protocol. We have now augmented Aaronson's protocol with a few extra protections to create the SENPAI protocol, which is efficient, easily-implemented, and maxi- mally resistant against covert adversaries.

The whole paper is pure gold from start to finish. Someone, anyone, write a romance using these, [[/r/rational]] /needs/ it.
