People considering writing something based on this (if any exist), consider including something from their reference 2, "Covert Two-Party Communication". The idea of that paper is that there can be a protocol which the parties can execute without knowing they're executing it, and find out it occurred only if it returns 'yes'. Lots of interesting things could be done with this; the paper mentions a hypothetical undercover agent in a terrorist cell who suspects another terrorist of being an agent from a friendly agency.
