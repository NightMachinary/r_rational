  That obvious failure mode is that, if you expect to receive far less 'yes' than you send, your incentive is to defect and send as many 'yes' as you can.

That is what actually happens on the dating sites. See:

#+begin_quote
  The data analysis reveals some interesting differences between the sexes. For a start, men and women use entirely different strategies to engage a potential mate on Tinder. Men tend to like a large proportion of the women they view but receive only a tiny fraction of matches in return---just 0.6 percent.

  Women use the opposite strategy. They are far more selective about who they like but have a much higher matching rate of about 10 percent.
