I don't believe so. The "Chapter 1" thing is just a function of the website. If you open any story on this website, it will say

#+begin_quote
  "Chapter 1: " + (Title of the chapter as given by the author)
#+end_quote

And all subsequent chapters will be "Chapter x: " + (Title of the chapter as given by the author).

I simply found amusement in that the first chapter of the book was named Chapter 3. This amusement could have also been experienced had I opened a brand new book and found "Chapter 3" as the title of the first chapter, even without explicit text stating which chapter it is supposed to be. Because of course it's supposed to be the first one.

This story does not rely on knowing the exact number of which chapter you are reading. It also does not take advantage of any of the website's functions, such as author's notes. I believe any alternate versions will be completely fine.
