If you like anime, FLCL is something along these lines. it isn't foreshadowing so much as everything in it makes sense in a certain context, and you don't have enough of that context until the very end. the first time through it looks like chaos and noise, but a subsequent viewing ends up looking much different.

that said, it is still an anime, and if you aren't into anime in general then I do not think you will enjoy FLCL based on this particular quality alone.
