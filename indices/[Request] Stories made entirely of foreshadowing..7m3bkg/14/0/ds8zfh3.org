Not sure about The Thief itself, but definitely books 2 and 3 in the series. In particular, a significant fraction of the dialogue in the story has more than one layer of meaning. (It's not always foreshadowing in the sense that it allows you to predict what will happen, though; often it just recontextualizes it.)
