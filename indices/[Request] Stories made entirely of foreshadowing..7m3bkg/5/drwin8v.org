I'm somewhat taken aback by the way you chose to phrase that.

#+begin_quote
  What work that you've read, if any, stands out in your mind as having the second-highest level of this quantity?

Surely you don't genuinely believe that you have created the work that has more foreshadowing than any other in the history of fiction? So much so that there may not even be a second place.

I enjoyed HPMOR, but it had its faults. While it was memorable, it's hard to claim that HPMOR is the ultimate example of any particular literary virtue.

(Oh, and to answer your actual question: Mistborn. HPMOR is nowhere close.)
