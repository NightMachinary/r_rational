Hmm. I don't know. I feel like a good many stories have high levels of foreshadowing that go unnoticed. Tons of foreshadowing doesn't make itself clear without good analysis and many re-reads.

The less foreshadowing a story has the more random it will be. Readers pick up on narrative cues, and without them stories tend towards being incoherent. As rationalist stories put a huge premium on internal coherency, they might have more foreshadowing than the norm. However, I think the largest driver behind so many people posting rationalist stories here (and indeed, your post) is because there's a community of dedicated and attentive fans who discuss and analyze the heck out of every chapter of a given story.

If you search for "foreshadowing" in any academic database for literary criticism, you will see thousands of essays detailing the dense foreshadowing present in hundreds of different works. I suspect the reason many posters here see such dense foreshadowing in the stories they're posting (and HPMOR) is because they really enjoy and /care/ about those stories, and perhaps more importantly they're part of a community that helps them ferret out all those hidden instances of foreshadowing.

Hence my recommendation: most of the literary canon.

*Edit:*

In the interests of being a good sport, I'll go ahead and shill for Malazan Book of the Fallen once more. The little passages at the beginning of each chapter have /insane/ foreshadowing. Moreover the world is just so complex and multifaceted that off-hand comments about events in one part of the world will have huge plot ramifications thousands of pages later when the story shifts focus to that part of the world. It's really quite mind boggling how rich and detailed the world is, the only stuff I've ever encountered that come remotely close are Worm and maybe Tolkien.

Since one is tossed into a complex world mid-flow and with exposition severely lacking, it's often hard to tell what is foreshadowing and what is world building. To a much greater extent than really any story I can think of, it's really quite a puzzle to figure out the exact shape of the world and the forces at play in the narrative. There's really no one character that can deliver a succient explanation even if they wanted to, so much is lost to time and chaos. So much knowledge lost to entropy, that even the most knowledgable characters are not much aware of the forces shaping their world.

To me this is great, I find too much obvious foreshadowing somewhat annoying.
