My frustation is that on howlongtobeat.com the game showed 10 hours, so after 4 hours I thought I will be half way. But after a better search it turns out the game has a 64 hours completion time. And it is a lot of time. Anyway so far no one died, it is night and I suspect George is the main suspect of whateer will end up happening (Current guess is that there are currently 3 plots going on).
