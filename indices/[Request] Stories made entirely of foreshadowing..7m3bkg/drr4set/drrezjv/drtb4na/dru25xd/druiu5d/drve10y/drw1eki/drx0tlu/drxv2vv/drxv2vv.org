(Second edit: Copied from this message's final paragraph: --I've talked too much. Summarised reply (Fourth edit: 'Regarding the timescale'): [[#s][]] *cheering-on encouragement*)

Is the 64 hours for Episode(/Game) 1, or for the entire 'Question Arcs' game(/program) which incudes episodes/games 1-4? Plus the time for the in-between sections, 10 hours for a single game sort of fits (keeping in mind that later games might have more fun parts..?), and intuitively feels as though it fits more with my own impression, though dependent on reading speed.

My native language is English.

Trying not to give any spoilers, why do you suspect George? *curiosity, while thinking back on own impressions at the time* ([[#s][]]?)

(Edit: Oh, and whose/what plots are you guessing are going on? *curiosity*)

If I remember correctly (Third edit: 'regarding the timescale', the next two spoiler tags), [[#s][]]

Yes, got it. [[#s][]]

Let's see... my initial impression is to recommend that you at least complete the first two games (and their after-sections) before deciding whether you're finding it interesting enough to continue. [[#s][]] can be taken as a barometer of whether the fiction is worth continuing to you.
