Thus the importance of reading in one's native language so as to be able to quickly process the less-dramatic bits... *guilty sympathy*

Thinking more on this, I should warn that the first as-a-character appearance of a witch is at the very end of the first episode (at the border between the first episode and the short section right after it?), with the second episode being the first one with the establishing of the dramatic truth-interrogating questioning.

The first episode has the introduction of all characters, and if I understand correctly (at least in the Japanese original?) deduction of certain mysteries is possible even with only that first episode, though the further episodes of course help (and are enjoyably dramatic).

If you feel as though you're in danger of shelving it if you don't have someone encouragingly pushing your back, you can tell me where you are in the game and I can try to encourage you about how much is left before someone dies. (That said, my own memories of game 1 have already gotten very fuzzy.)
