*blinks* Wow. I had no idea about this... *searchity*

If [[https://forum.rokkenjima.org/t/an-announcement-by-the-witch-hunts-usagitenpura-regarding-uminekos-upcoming-steam-release/380][this]] is trustworthy, then I am /envious/. Witch-Hunt.com makes no mention of it, and the downloadable patch versions are still 4.4 and 4.1. (Would I have to obtain it again to get the latest translation quality..? That said, I have complicated feelings about the '[[http://store.steampowered.com/app/639490/Umineko_When_They_Cry__Answer_Arcs/][Renewed Character Sprites]]'... hmm, it seems like they're swappable, good... though no, while I'm honestly curious, my original point was that I would be satisfied with the anime visuals and not paying extra for new sprites if I could keep my on-hand translations patch up-to-date... though who made the new sprites..?)

--Wait, there's [[https://steamcommunity.com/app/406550/discussions/0/358417008718806495/][a voiced PS3 version now]]?
