Seconded. Back when I was a huge HPMoR fanatic (truly to the point of obsession) Umineko was the only fictional work that I considered to be on par if not above it. Eliezer trying to solve the mysteries of that story would be something amazing for me!

I also want to put forward my own recommendation: [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FromTheNewWorld?from=Literature.ShinSekaiYori][Shin Sekai Yori]], either the anime or the original novel. This story displays many examples of elegant and subtle foreshadowing and re-watching it is an entirely different experience.
