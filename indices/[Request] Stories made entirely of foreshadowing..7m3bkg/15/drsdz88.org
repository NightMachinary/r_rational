/[[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0482571/][The Prestige]]/ is one of my favorite films for this reason. As is probably true with most of these recommendations, the greatness of /The Prestige/ is hard to describe without spoiling it. It is very rewatchable.

Has anyone here read [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/239239.The_Prestige][the book]]?

I think I'll save this thread for future reading.
