The Shadow of What Was Lost does this well as it re contextualizes everything after you read the ending.

Wheel of Time does this well but the story drags on a bit.

Discworld series is great at this because it foreshadows further into the future than it seems because character traits are brought up in further stories that impact how you can predict a character to behave in other novels.

The Necroscope series turns decidedly darker when you reread each triplet of books. It doesnt necessarily foreshadow specific plot points but character motivations.

The Ringworld series is great for this too.
