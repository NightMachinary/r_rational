My problem with how this was done is that the foreshadowing was /just/ foreshadowing, in a lot of those cases. Proper foreshadowing, in my opinion, doesn't /look/ like foreshadowing, because it's disguised within the fabric of the text.

In /Mother of Learning/, a lot of the foreshadowing just bogs down the movement of the early chapters, because it's totally irrelevant to that movement. Telling the reader "hey, this is going to be important later" seems really inelegant to me. This is in contrast to something like HPMOR, where a solution to a conflict early in the story serves as foreshadowing of a solution to a different conflict later in the story, or where lessons taught to a character include clues that get used later in the plot.
