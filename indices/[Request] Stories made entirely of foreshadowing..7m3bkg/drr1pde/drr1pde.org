Mother of Learning comes to mind immediately as having a flavor of this.

Damn near everything that Zorian encounters early on happens to have some relevance or importance later on. A sad girl standing on a bridge? Subplot. A kitten looking at him sadly? Subplot. Language expert consulted early on? Subplot. Some rats running by? Subplot!

It has the side effect of making the world of Cyoria really feel alive, and it's absolutely lovely.
