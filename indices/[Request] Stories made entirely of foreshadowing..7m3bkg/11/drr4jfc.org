You've basically just described Worm in three sentences.

The world is fundamentally built on deception and secrecy. The protagonist is as much a newcomer to this world as any first-time reader. At first glance, the setting seems to be filled with tropes and ideas that are culturally familiar to the reader, and this familiarity lets the author subvert expectation in creative and interesting ways.

Characters introduced early on are more fully explored later, often in ways that radically recontextualize past actions and behaviors.
