  I recently reread worm and except for picking up more on the unreliable narration and being more favourable to characters that are initially hostile, I don't think the reread was much different.
#+end_quote

Okay. Working from memory to find examples of these, but here are things I think are recontextualized on a reread.

*Any scene with Sophia in it*

In example, the confrontation with Emma and Shadow Stalker at the mall in 5.3. On a blind read through, Stalker comes across as a tough but fair hero motivated by a concern for public welfare.

With context, the dramatic irony in this scene transforms it into something farcical. Stalker knows about Taylor and her history with Emma. She is motivated by helping Emma, and is intentionally trying to put Taylor in the most negative light possible.

The meaning behind all of Shadow Stalker's actions is recontextualized, making the scene feel fresh on a reread.

#+begin_quote
  Emma looked up at me, eyes wide, mouth open, one hand to the side of her face. I was as shocked at what I'd done as she was. Not that I felt /bad/. A large part of me wanted to laugh in her face. /Weren't expecting that? Miscalculated how I'd react?/

  Hands seized me with an iron grip and spun me around. Shadow Stalker. She interposed herself between me and Emma. Dark brown eyes glowered at me from behind her mask.

  [...]

  Shadow Stalker scolded him, “This is /not/ the time or place for arguments. If your daughter is this... unwell, then that's /your/ responsibility.”

Shadow Stalker knows why Taylor hit Emma.

It has nothing to do with Taylor's concussion, but Stalker is playing along.

#+begin_quote
  I felt like laughing. Part of it was just being giddy at doing something to get back at Emma. The other part was that this whole scenario was so ridiculously upside-down. Shadow Stalker wasn't really anything special. She was just a /teenage girl/, lecturing my dad, an adult. The crowd that was watching was seeing Emma as the victim, me as the bad guy. *But if you stripped away the costume, if everyone knew the real story, this would all be playing out so differently.*
#+end_quote

(Bolded emphasis mine) Taylor is more right than she knows.

This is a blatantly intentional author nod, when you have context.

#+begin_quote
  I pointed at Emma, turned to my dad, “You want to know why I hit her?”

  Shadow Stalker put one hand on the side of my face, forced me to look at her, stopping me from talking in the process. “No. I'm stopping this right here. No arguments, no excuses as to why you just assaulted someone. We're breaking this up now. Turn around.”

  “What?” I half-laughed, incredulous, “Why?”
#+end_quote

This can be read as the actions of an overworked Hero trying to immediately deescalate the situation, or as an attempt by Sophia to publicly humiliate Taylor.

#+begin_quote
  Shadow Stalker bound my wrists with what I guessed was a plastic wrist-tie. Too tight. Then she turned to my dad, and her voice was hushed. “Look at this crowd. These people. They're /scared/. A place like this, with this much suppressed panic, fear and worry, this many people close together? *I don't care if your daughter is an idiot or just ill.* She's proven to be volatile in a powder-keg situation. *It's both dangerous and /stupid/ to have her here.* You can cut off the plasti-cuffs when she's separated from anyone she might harm.”
#+end_quote

The verbal insults and put-downs are so /clearly/ in line with Sophia's character, but I don't think most people would ever connect these dots without the later reveal.

#+begin_quote
  My dad nodded, embarrassed. I felt bad at that. I felt worse at being led off like a criminal, while Shadow Stalker gave Emma a hand to help her up. Emma was beaming, smiling one of the widest smiles I'd seen her give, despite the red mark on the side of her face. *Smiling as much at the way things had turned out, I imagined, as she was at getting the chance to talk with the concerned superheroine.*
#+end_quote

Really damn funny on a reread, in my opinion.
