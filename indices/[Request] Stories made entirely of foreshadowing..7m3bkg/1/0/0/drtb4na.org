Umineko, thirded. I suspect that a large part of that is inherited from the mystery novel genre itself (or in Japanese, 'suiri shousetsu'/'deduction novel'), it was actually my introduction to the line between stories like Sherlock Holmes novels, which show a detective pulling answers out of a hat, and stories like Agatha Christie novels, where the reader is challenged to pay attention to details, /especially/ the 'I am confused' moments, and trying to arrive at the truth before the grand reveal is made--I particularly enjoyed Umineko's meta-commentary about the trust between the author and reader (the trust that the reader will try to solve the mystery, the trust that the mystery can be solved), the mentioning of Knox's Commandments and Dine's Rules, et cetera. After Umineko, I began reading library-held mystery novels, gradually getting used to certain tricks, delighted when I missed something and later kicked myself over not realising its significance.

In any case, yes! Umineko was particularly delicious, in many ways, and the Higurashi/Umineko Question/Answer arcs' division is delightful.

(That would indeed be fun, if Yudkowsky were somehow in a spoiler-free box, keeping a diary of notes/impressions and thoughts about Umineko as he read through (challenged) all of it...)
