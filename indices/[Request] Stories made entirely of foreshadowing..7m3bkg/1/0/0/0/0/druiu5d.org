See rotflol's comment about which is better. For the biggest 'answer' scene, I seem to remember that the manga gives a little more explicit information (about what was done how), as extra explanation for still-confused people (since published chronologically after the VN, I think), but overall I strongly recommend the VN.

I liked the animation, but for pleasure (at seeing and hearing it) rather than for challenging, so would recommend only watching it after finishing the first 4 episodes of the VN. I might be tempted to suggest watching it after all 8, as a reminder of all that happened, but going through the VN original episodes after finishing has much more in terms of thoughts and conversations to be reminded about...

To read, both the game (episodes 1-4 and 5-8 grouped) and the English patch (likewise) are needed (unless you can read a lot of Japanese very quickly and smoothly, otherwise the longer sections drag on), from separate sources. The patch should be here: [[http://witch-hunt.com/stage.html]] .

Other than a small number of low-importance selections in Episode 8, there are no choices--you read it through as though it were a book, screen by screen, though you can also (once available) review character information et cetera in a separate screen.

Important: The background music tracks are wonderful/evocative, and Umineko has at times been referred to as a 'sound novel' rather than a 'visual novel'. The combinations of different tracks with different scenes, and the changes from one to another as the emotions in play shift, add an extra dimension which would be muted (in all senses) if one were to read through without sound. In conclusion, if you read through the VN then definitely use sound!

Summary from what I can remember of the starting process: Get the games, get the patches, install the games (where desired), install the patches (according to instructions, should end up in the same folders?), run the desired patch executable. Running the gmae executable would run the Japanese-version game, with its own savefiles (stored/accessed separately from the patch's savefiles). From the title screen, choose to play and select the episodes (and in-between sections, I think) in order as you view them.

Each section/episode should be 'unlocked' once the previous is completed, and when a future section is unlocked a prior section allows skipping to set points within it upon a fresh start, like chapter beginnings. (Not as convenient to use as it might be.) Unlocking also changes the background image for the title screen. If reinstalling or installing on a fresh computer, it should be possible to manually unlock sections to match what had been unlocked by readthrough.
