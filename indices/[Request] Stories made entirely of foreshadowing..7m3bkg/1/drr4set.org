[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry][Higurashi no Naku koro ni]] , and especially [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/UminekoWhenTheyCry][Umineko]] is absolutely full of this. Reading Umineko a second time is like a completely different story.

I really like HPMOR, but regarding this quality, I think these stories outdo HPMOR.

The Higurashi anime adaptation is fine, but the anime adaptation of Umineko is terrible (critical pieces of information are left out, it feels extremely rushed compared to the original novel, and it stops before the 5th story arc which is one of the best parts).

So watch Higurashi and then read the Umineko visual novel (there's an English translation available online). I think you'd enjoy them Eliezer.
