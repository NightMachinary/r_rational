Yes, Sophia is a good example. And you can find foreshadowing for a lot of things abut Taylor's character that aren't originally clear. I'm not saying there's no foreshadowed twists in Worm.

But large segments of the plot and characters are just played straight; you find out something new that fits previously shown snippets, but doesn't really /change/ what they mean. The reveal is foreshadowed, and a re-read makes you notice the foreshadowing, but - for me at least - it doesn't make me "read [the foreshadowing] in a different light"
