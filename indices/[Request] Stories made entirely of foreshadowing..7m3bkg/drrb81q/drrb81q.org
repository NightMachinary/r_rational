Here's something a bit different.

Interactive fiction that redefines the unreliable narrator in a very rational way. Try not to use a walkthrough until you get past the puzzle. You'll probably know what I'm talking about when you get to it. There comes a point in the story where you'll have to reevaluate everything that's happened up to that point /before/ you can move forward.
