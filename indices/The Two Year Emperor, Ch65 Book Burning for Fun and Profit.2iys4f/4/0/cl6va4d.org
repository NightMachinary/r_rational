  It's a pity Jake didn't wish up a magically precise photocopier and railgun them through that first. But I guess that would make it less of a sacrifice.

Yep. Would have rendered it not really that much of a sacrifice...it would have amounted to sacrificing knowledge, not secrets, and that has a /lot/ less oomph to it. Right now, they need all the punch they can get; I did the math out and the Icefies' sacrifices outnumber the Grofhamrites by multiple orders of magnitude.
