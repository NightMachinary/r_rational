  Is reading a free action?
#+end_quote

I spent a lot of time trying to figure that out, and even asked on the GitP forums. As far as I'm aware, there is no RAW classifying how long it takes to read non-magical text. As such, I would say that it is NOT a free action.

  stuff to make things larger (so the illegibility of the text isn't an excuse),

The Enlarge Item spell increases the size of something by a factor of 16 in each dimension. If we assume (as above) that each letter is 500nm on a side, that means that after being Enlarged it would be 8micrometers per side. Still far too small to be seen with normal vision or any standard magic item.

  and people with intelligence-enhancing gear and POPE boosts which should put them well past humans from the normalverse.

D&D Intelligence seems to map, very roughly, to the IQ scale. A standard human has an Int of 10 / IQ of 100. Maximum human Intelligence is 18, and people with an IQ of 180 are considered top-end geniuses. [A random website[([[http://www.therichest.com/rich-list/the-biggest/the-10-highest-iqs-in-histoy/9/]]) tells me that the real-world person with the highest IQ that may have been accurately measured is Terence Tao, coming in at around 230, with Hawking being around 160 and Einstein estimated at around 180. The people of Grofhamr are survivors of a massive war, so let's assume they are smarter than the average, starting at 12 and going up to the normally maximal 18.

The POPEs give a +5, and a maximized Headband of Intellect gives another +6. The majority of people who are being run through the FLEA would have started with a 12 so, after full enhancement they would be at 23 -- meaning they would be as smart as Tao, a real world human.

They are WAY smarter than the average, but not superhuman.

      The sum total of the discussion about the nature of gods can be summed up as "humans create them by believing in them. This will create a god from nothing, or cause a mortal to ascend to godhood."

  Racism against non-human sapient creatures aside,

/sigh/

  this is not the full nature of the gods: it does not explain the mechanism that transform sapient belief into fact, what a god actually is, how it wields power, how it decides how to exercise that power, etc. All that is part of the true nature of a god, just like neurology is part of the true nature of a human.

You're right that those are critical facts, but I wouldn't call them part of the "nature" of gods. I would put those in a distinct category. But, that's just semantics. I'm sure that the answers to all the questions you list are in that library somewhere.
