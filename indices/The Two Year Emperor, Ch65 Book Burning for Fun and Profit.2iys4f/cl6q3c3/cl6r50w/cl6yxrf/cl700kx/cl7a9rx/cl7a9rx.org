Is reading a free action? If so, it seems /very/ implausible that there wouldn't be a way to have all the text legibly pass in front of someone. We've got industrial assembly lines (so stuff taking a standard action isn't an excuse, when you can drop an object to trigger it), Graham's number of XP, perfectly cutting walls of force, stuff to make things larger (so the illegibility of the text isn't an excuse), and people with intelligence-enhancing gear and POPE boosts which should put them well past humans from the normalverse.

It might still be a bad idea because of [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/warning-labels][memetic hazards]] and other nasty Trickster stuff

  The sum total of the discussion about the nature of gods can be summed up as "humans create them by believing in them. This will create a god from nothing, or cause a mortal to ascend to godhood."

Racism against non-human sapient creatures aside, this is not the full nature of the gods: it does not explain the mechanism that transform sapient belief into fact, what a god actually is, how it wields power, how it decides how to exercise that power, etc. All that is part of the true nature of a god, just like neurology is part of the true nature of a human.
