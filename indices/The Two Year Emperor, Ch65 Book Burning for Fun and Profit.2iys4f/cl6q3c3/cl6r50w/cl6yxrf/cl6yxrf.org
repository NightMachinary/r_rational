Yeah, I just double checked. Chapter 55. The wish specified that the books be sorted in order of importance. Also, the books on the nature of the gods were in the first row. Obviously knowing the nature of the gods is the #1 most important information.

Some math on those books: The text is small enough that it appears black and requires an electron microscope to read. Lets assume that the writing consists of individual ink molecules laid out in a readable fashion. So the letter H might consist of 11 ink molecules, each of which is 100 nm, giving us an average letter size of roughly 500nm including white space. Average word has 5 letters, so 2500nm per word. That gives us 10k words per line, for a total of 100 million words per page. A thousand double sided pages gives us 200 billion words per book. Nine linear feet of such books, comprising the sum total of everything he could possibly know about the gods, gives us 2 trillion words total.

In comparison, the library of congress has 20 million books giving us 1 trillion words. So... totally readable. Just saying.
