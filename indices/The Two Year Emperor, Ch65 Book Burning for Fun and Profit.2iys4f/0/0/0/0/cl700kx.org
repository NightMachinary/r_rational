  Some math on those books: ... 11 ink molecules, ... 100 nm, ... 500nm including white space. ... 2500nm per word. ... 10k words per line, ... 100 million words per page. ... 200 billion words per book.

/grumble, grumble, rational fans, grumble, doing math, grumble, can't just relax and enjoy, grumble, grumble/

Hm. That sounds low to me, let me check.

The dimensions of the book were called out as "one yard wide and high, and at least 6" thick." Let's assume that it's 1m x 1m x 6 inches. (I'm using inches for thickness because that's the measurement I found online for paper thickness.)

If a word is 2500nm, then by my math the page is 400,000 words per line (ignore margins). If a letter with whitespace is 500nm, let's assume that each line (including leading) is 1000nm. That means there's 1,000,000 lines per page (we'll ignore margins again), for a total of 400,0000,000,000 (four hundred billion!) words per page. Now, based on a quick googling, regular printer paper is 500 sheets to the inch. The paper in Loki's books is from a medieval technology and probably thicker; let's keep the math easy and say that it's 100 sheets to the inch. That's 600 pages per book, double sided makes a total of 1200 pages with 4E11 words on each one, meaning a total of 48E13 words per book. Ignoring the thickness of covers, nine linear feet would be 18 books; let's round it down to 10 to account for the covers and some small space between the books (and to keep the math easy). That's a total of 48E14 or, more properly 4.8E15 words. Round it off and call if 5E15.

  9 linear feet of such books, comprising the sum total of everything he could possibly know about the gods, gives us 2 trillion words total.

Ermmm...I think you might be shooting a bit low. :>

Also, note that those nine linear feet weren't "everything I know about gods". They were "the opening paragraph of the discussion about the nature of gods." Yes, Loki spent about /five quadrillion words/ on a single paragraph of text -- of course, all of it was carefully proofread and grammatically correct.

The best part? The sum total of the discussion about the nature of gods can be summed up as "humans create them by believing in them. This will create a god from nothing, or cause a mortal to ascend to godhood."

  In comparison, the library of congress has 20 million books giving us 1 trillion words. So... totally readable. Just saying.

Well, let's see...there's 3 bookcases, a total of 6 sets of bookshelves (one of each side of the bookcase), and they recede to "the vanishing point." Let's call that a measly 1000 yards. Now, rounding our earlier estimate of thickness even further, let's say that it's one book per linear foot. That means there's +30,000+ 3000 (oops) books per shelf; I didn't specify the number of shelves, just that they are "tall". Let's go with 30', which is the estimating-from-memory height of other major needs-a-ladder libraries that I've seen. Let's assume that's 10 sets of shelves on each of the 6 bookshelves, for a total of 60 shelves of (at minimum!) 3,000 books each, for a total of +1,800,000 books+ 180,000. And let's round that again to 200,000 books, each of which contains 5E15 words, for a total of 1E21 words.

I think you're going to need a lot of Red Bull to get through that in a timely fashion. ;>
