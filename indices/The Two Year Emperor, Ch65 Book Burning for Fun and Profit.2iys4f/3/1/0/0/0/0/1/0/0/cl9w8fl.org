  Though I am still not clear what the second sweeping gesture and the door being stuck to Jake mean.

When Loki originally created the room, the door was always a couple feet behind Jake -- it would follow him around as he moved. (It would hold still if he wanted to step into it, of course.)

This is great for making sure that it's available, but not so much when you want to leave it next to the altar while you go off and do other things. At Jake's request, Loki temporarily untethered the room from Jake; it'll stay right where it is until Jake comes back and picks it up, at which point it will start following him around again.
