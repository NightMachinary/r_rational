  Do objects have to be carefully dropped in the sacrificial fires, or can they be thrown?

They can be thrown. The "throwing it in the fire" part is mostly set dressing -- the actual important element is the choice of sacrifice. The fire is really just the equivalent of an "are you sure?" dialog...you can make the decision to sacrifice something, but you get to change your mind right up until the moment you actually put it in the fire.
