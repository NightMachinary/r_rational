No spells, no killing. I'm betting on yet another Helm of Opposite Alignment. But how to apply it enough times to break through the Will Save of a god?

One way would be to stack millions of helms together. Nothing is stopping them from being a nanometer thick. But what if they have to be touching the head of the person in order to work? (Does Jake know the rule on this?)

I have an amusing mental picture of a stack of graphene nanolayer "helms" that disappear as soon as they touch an Evil person's head. (Every other layer in the stack could be a spell engine that causes itself and the layer immediately below itself to disappear.)

I wonder if such a stack could be wished into existence in one go, or if a bunch of sequential wishes would be needed.

Also, could the hats be delivered magically, say teleported or wished into being directly onto the target's head?

If so, instead of a stack of thin hats, it might be more efficient to use a bunch of small spell engines (a bag of sand with each grain being a spell engine, say) to rapidly apply and remove a single helm.

("Spell sand" could be useful for a lot of things, come to think of it. You could go into battle with every person armed with millions of spells ready to go off instantly. And the particles could be arbitrarily small, perhaps individual molecules...)
