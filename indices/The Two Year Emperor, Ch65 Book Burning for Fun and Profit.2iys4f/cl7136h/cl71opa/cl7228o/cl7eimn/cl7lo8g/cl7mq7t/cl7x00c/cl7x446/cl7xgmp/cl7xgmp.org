I played a lot of 4th, and generally agree that it showed too much influence from videogames - mostly the fact that it seemed like something that you could have programmed pretty easily, and how it stripped out a lot of the weirdness (and coolness) of 3rd.

5th is basically a return to being more like 3rd in a lot of ways. So far, there hasn't been a change between 3rd and 5th that I find myself disliking. Everything is streamlined, but unlike 4th, you don't feel like you're missing out on anything. They added a lot of the weirdness back into the game - cool spells and unique classes that do things that can't be easily put into one category or another. And the production values on the books are quite high. It's still a /little/ too soon to say, since the DMG isn't out yet, but mostly I think it's an improvement on 3rd (though it's difficult to say that when I'm comparing an edition with hundreds of broken splatbooks and contradictory rules to something that has virtually nothing in the way of supplemental material as yet).
