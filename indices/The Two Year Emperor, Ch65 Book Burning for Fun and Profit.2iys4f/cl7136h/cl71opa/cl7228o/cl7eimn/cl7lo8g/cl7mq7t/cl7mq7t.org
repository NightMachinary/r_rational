RAW is pretty stupid about all of these things. (Well, it's pretty stupid in general, but leave that.)

Actions come in several types, but the ones we care about here are: free, move, standard, and full-round. In a given round you can perform:

- standard+move,
- move+move,
- full-round

No matter which format you choose, you can perform an arbitrary number of free actions in a round -- basically, as many as the DM will let you get away with.

Picking something up is a move action, and it's a singular thing. The exact text is:

#+begin_quote
  [A move action] includes retrieving or putting away a stored item, picking up an item, moving a heavy object, and opening a door.
#+end_quote

So, picking up a /bag/ of daggers is one move action, but picking up two daggers is two move actions.

As to multiple attacks: yes, if you're high level, you are allowed to make multiple attacks in a round. In order to do that, though, you need to use a full-round action, which means you can't do anything else except free actions.

There's some nits about 5-foot steps and how they interact with all of the above, but that's not important.
