You should get multiple attacks per round if you're 60th level, which means that the only thing that needs to be streamlined is picking up the object. Perhaps you could pick up multiple books per move action? I mean, does the universe consider "a pile of three books" to be a single object? I guess I think that picking up two daggers should take about as long as picking up a single dagger, since most of the action is spent bending down and moving your hand into position, but I don't know where RAW falls on that.
