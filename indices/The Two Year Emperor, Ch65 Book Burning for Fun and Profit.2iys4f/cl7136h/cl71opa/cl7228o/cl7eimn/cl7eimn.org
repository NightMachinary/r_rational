Actually, it can still be done in one round. "Pick up object" is a move action, "drop object" is free. So, Person A +throws two books+ throws a book (*) at the start of the round, Person B picks them up an instant later and rails them on.

(*) Throwing the books is probably an attack with Improvised Weapon against the square that Person B is standing in. Therefore, it's a standard action and you only get one of those. You can still do the entire throw+pick up sequence in one round, though.
