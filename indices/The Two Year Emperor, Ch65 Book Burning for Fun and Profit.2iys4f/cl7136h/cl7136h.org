Do objects have to be carefully dropped in the sacrificial fires, or can they be thrown?

I'd say that the books are Large Improvised Throwing Weapons, giving them a range increment of 15 feet, a -4 penalty to attack, and 1d6 damage.

A 5 foot square has AC 5, so let's say that the fires are AC 15 (because they're small). Being 5 range increments (75') away (the maximum, ) gives a -10 penalty to hit, so a roll of 30 is needed to hit it, which an Ice Assassin could do 19 times out of 20.

If some Monks came out of the FLEA, they could also use the [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#snatchArrows][Snatch Arrows]] feat to speed up the bottleneck at the door, by having people on one end throw them through the doorway, while the monks catch them on the other end. there could be about 300 people on each end of this, practically negating the bottleneck. The main problem is that natural 1's would still miss and disrupt it.
