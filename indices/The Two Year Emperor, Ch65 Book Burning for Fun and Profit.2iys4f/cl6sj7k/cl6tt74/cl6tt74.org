  I'm betting on yet another Helm of Opposite Alignment. But how to apply it enough times to break through the Will Save of a god?
#+end_quote

You can't. :> Greater Gods (like Neklos) have the ability:

#+begin_quote
  Always Maximize Roll

  Greater deities (rank 16-20) automatically get the best result possible on any check, saving throw, attack roll, or damage roll. Calculate success, failure, or other effects accordingly. When a greater deity makes a check, attack, or save assume a 20 was rolled and calculate success or failure from there.
#+end_quote

So, nope. Nothing that allows a save is ever going to work on him.

The idea of spellsand is slick. I'm pretty sure there will be some reason in RAW why it's not doable, but I don't know what it would be..maybe "because spell traps have to be a certain size" ?

I don't know if there is a rule about transporting things onto a creature; I have a question over on GITP about it.
