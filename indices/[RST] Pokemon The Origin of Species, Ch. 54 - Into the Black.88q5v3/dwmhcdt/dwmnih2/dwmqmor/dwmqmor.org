23 is a lot, but Blue was speculating Oak HAD used up his "resistance" at that point:

#+begin_quote
  there are rumors that he was nearly crippled from the after effects, and was warned off ever attending another by his physician.
#+end_quote

He also implied 23 is more than normal:

#+begin_quote
  How many fights do most trainer get with the birds before they start getting overpowered? Ten, maybe fifteen?
#+end_quote

Then again, the whole paragraph was speculative and more than a little panicked, so who knows? Maybe there IS no loss of resistance, or maybe it's something that our protagonists will find can be trained against.
