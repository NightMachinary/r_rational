I imagine it's effects are variable depending on the species and "Legendary" status as well.

It seems the Stormbringers have an AoE measured in miles (or kilometers for your non-Muricans), whereas this Absol's is measured in yards/meters.

If we're going through with some "scientific" approach, most forms of non-focused radiation do not fall off at a linear rate--ie something twice as far away is not taking half, but one-fourth or less the amount of exposure.

Thus it's likely the Absol have a Pressure "output" several orders of magnitude less than the Stormbringers. It's /probably/ not too dangerous for an Absol Trainer to be exposed to it, in as much as they might be exposed to the chaos of its effects (the opposing 'mon might lunge at the Trainer instead of the Absol, for instance). The "total amount" they would receive is likely negligible compared to the exposure of a Stormbringer.

TL;DR: Absol Pressure is likely similar to the dose of a microwave oven or a cellphone; Legendary Bird (or Mewtwo) Pressure is similar to that of the radiation from nuclear fallout.
