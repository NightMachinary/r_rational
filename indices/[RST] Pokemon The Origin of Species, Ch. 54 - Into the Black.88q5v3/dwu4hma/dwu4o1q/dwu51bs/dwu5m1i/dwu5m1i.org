Ahh, I see what you're saying! Yeah, he didn't go into an actual text message or anything, just flagged his location with a descriptor that said that his group needs reinforcements. Think of it like a macro that people can use to communicate quickly and easily. He was expecting to stay there until others arrived or talk to them over the phone, and totally forgot to update Bretta's group when he left. That's why he still had to describe the specifics to the Ranger.
