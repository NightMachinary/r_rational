I reread the bit I was referring to. I can't copy it, but it's right after they exit the cave, having found the Absol resting by the Onix nest.

Blue can't reach the other trainers involved, besides Bretta and the Rangers. It feels as though Blue didn't tell Bretta about the Onix, or seriously downplayed the threat, because she and her group appear to be completely taken by surprise when Blue and company show up to rescue her. Unless she just didn't believe him? Though if she follows Blue online, it could be reasonable for the reader to expect her to deduce he would not benefit from such kind of lies.
