Thanks for the feedback! I edited the conversations a bit to hopefully correct for it. Here's the taboo one:

  "It's a way to keep from getting caught up in semantics. We're not allowed to use that word in the discussion anymore, we clearly mean different things when we say it, and are just getting more aggravated every time that happens." She lets out a breath. "Or I am, anyway, so let's just focus on what we're actually trying to say instead of tripping over that word again and again."

  "Oh, that's like a game! What would you say instead of luck, then?"

  Aiko stops to think, then continues slowly. "If this power or ability or whatever exists, it has to be something guided. It can't just be some diffuse, aimless effect that happens at random but also keeps benefiting the absol. Otherwise it could just as easily hinder itself with the things it causes. So it must be through some specific mechanism, something under conscious control, like clouding someone's mind or sending a tremor through the ground or whatever."
