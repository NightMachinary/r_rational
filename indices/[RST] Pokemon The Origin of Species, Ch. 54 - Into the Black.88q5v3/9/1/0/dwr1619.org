I'd say ghost types would be better suited to indirect solutions rather than direct ones. Fighting is out of the question esp. when weakened.

My naive and simple strategy would be to have a few gastly use Curse. Paging [[/u/DaystarEld]]: how do moves like Curse, Spite, and (less likely) Pain Split work in Oos?? Are those psychological, rather than physical effects?
