Interesting that of all non-legendary lines with Pressure (Aerodactyl, Weavile, Dusknoir, Absol, Vespiquen, Spiritomb, Wailord, Bisharp), 50% of them are dark type.

Could Blue's darkness give him an advantage on resisting Pressure? Maybe that's why elder Oak was so resilient, something Dark about the Oak family tree.

As an aside, I find it a little unusual to think that a Pokemon like Vespiquen, which seems to relatively common from the way they were talked about during the Pineco catching chapter, would not have the same reputation as Absol for bad luck. Maybe attributed to the chaos caused by dealing with large combee swarms?

Absol really does seem to have some kind of heightened intelligence, of only for it's ability to be so dang creepy. That scene of a lone cat-monster standing in the center of a dimly lit hollowed out chamber while the rumbling of even larger snakes come burrowing toward you. Chills to the extreme.
