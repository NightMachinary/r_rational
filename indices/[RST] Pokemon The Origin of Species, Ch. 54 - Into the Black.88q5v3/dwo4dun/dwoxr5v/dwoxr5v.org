I kind of think of it as just an overall heightening of agility and combat prowess, to the point of being able to strike more cleanly and effectively. It looks to others like you just happened to step to the right place at the right time to avoid a strike and land a critical blow in return, but in truth it's more like the ability to read the enemy and move in tune with them.

And again this is just one adaptation of the ability. In my world pokemon abilities are named the same thing because of their effects, not because of the underlying mechanism behind them :)
