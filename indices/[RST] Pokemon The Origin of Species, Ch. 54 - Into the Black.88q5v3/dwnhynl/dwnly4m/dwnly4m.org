The game treats abilities as pretty binary (either you have the ability, and its effect is 100% there, or you don't, and you have none of it), whereas I'm treating abilities as much more fluid than that. So most vespiquen don't actually exert any Pressure noticeable by humans, nor do most absol for that matter :)
