Has no one ever captured an Absol before or something? This hypothesis seems like it would be pretty easily testable with a caught one. My first thought upon reading that was "great, catch one and you've got a safe way to train against Pressure!" And then I read the next part.

If resilience to Pressure really does get "used up", that's an absolute nightmare of an already terrible situation - your strongest trainers getting weaker over time, less able to make use of their stronger and more experienced pokemon. If that was proven to be the case, would someone dedicated to fighting the Stormbringers be better off not attending their attacks for the first half of their career, so that their limited number of attendances would be "used up" with a stronger, more experienced team?
