Something about the way the dialogue is built rubs me /slightly/ the wrong way.

    "I felt something like that too!" Blue says, sitting up. "Shit, sorry, I interrupted."

    "It's okay! What did you feel?"
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

later on..

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    "That's it, we're tabooing the word 'luck,'" Aiko says suddenly.

    "Tabooing?" Elaine asks.

    "Yeah, it's a way to resolve arguments that get caught up in semantic confusion. We're not allowed to use that word in the discussion anymore. We clearly mean different things when we say it, so let's focus on what we actually are trying to say instead of tripping over that word again and again."

I get that as a rational fic, this is designed to teach some conflict-mediating skills.

So I see the value in having a timid character (Elaine) that others learn to allow to speak before interrupting.

But I guess it would feel more authentic with some slang, whether invented or not. The dialogue feels like 10% too formal or stilted and IMO could use a little more 'sprawl' and a little less formal definition of terms. Instead of Aiko fully explaining what 'tabooing' means, maybe have her say:

"it's a way of getting around words that keep tripping us up"

Not sure if that feedback made a ton of sense to you...
