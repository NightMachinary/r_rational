Ha! I like this mental image. There are many moments where I would like to add music to the reading experience, and this would be the second or third scene that not only would have lyrics, but also wouldn't be anime or video game music. I feel like that might be jarring (in the hypothetical world where there actually is mini clips of music playing at random points in the story) but think it would fit in this case :P
