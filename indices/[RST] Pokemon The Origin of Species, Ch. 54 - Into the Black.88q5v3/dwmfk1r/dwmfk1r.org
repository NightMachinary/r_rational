Welcome back everyone! I want you all to know that I care about you a lot, and the way you know that's more than just words is that I chose /not/ to update today with a temporary (and /very/ short) April Fool's chapter that would have reeeaally capitalized on last chapter's cliff-hanger.

Instead, enjoy a normal, boring chapter. All feedback welcome, as always, and thanks for reading!
