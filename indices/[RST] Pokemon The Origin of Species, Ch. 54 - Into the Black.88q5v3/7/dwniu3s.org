Awesome chapter as usual! I love seeing Blue improve as a leader and avoid making costly mistakes that he easily could have made in the past ala Viridian Forest's events. I kind of hope Blue captures the Absol somehow and bonds with it in a unique way since he's Dark and it's a Dark-type.

Also, I do have one quick question about Pressure. Is the whole discussion about only being able to stand up to it a limited amount of times a definitive thing, or is that just something that Blue and the others were speculating? It was a bit hard to determine from the way it was written in this chapter.

Thanks for not giving us a joke chapter, and if you celebrate it, happy Easter Sunday!
