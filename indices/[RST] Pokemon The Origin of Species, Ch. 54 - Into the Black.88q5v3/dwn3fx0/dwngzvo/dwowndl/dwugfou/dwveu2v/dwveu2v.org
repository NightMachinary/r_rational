Right, what would have been great is if the flute somehow stopped it from using Rest to heal itself. That way if you fight it without the flute it was a really hard battle, or if you got the flute it would be easier.

Not that they'd actually let you do that of course, since it was just meant to be a contrived way to direct the player from one place to another.
