By far the worst was the whole snorlax sidequest.

"Oh no, there's a giant sleeping pokemon blocking the road! If only we had some way to... make it smaller... or... move it from place to place... or... capture and tame it... Oh well, better go get the one specific flute that can wake it up so you can fight it!"

Twice the hilarity ensues if you then put it back to sleep in-combat to help capture it. I really don't know what the game writers were thinking :P
