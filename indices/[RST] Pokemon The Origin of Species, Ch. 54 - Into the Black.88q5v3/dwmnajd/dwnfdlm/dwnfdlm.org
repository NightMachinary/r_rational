  A question: Are ghost types rare and difficult to catch?
#+end_quote

They are indeed, and the most difficult to train. Most trainers in fact don't bother, and leave Ghost pokemon to psychics who feel a need to walk on the dangerous side.

  Surge's gym pretty much teaches people how to deal with those situations. Why not even the rangers ask for backup?

Do you mean in general, or this situation? They do in general, and in this situation they didn't realize it was as dire as it was until the report by Blue's group.
