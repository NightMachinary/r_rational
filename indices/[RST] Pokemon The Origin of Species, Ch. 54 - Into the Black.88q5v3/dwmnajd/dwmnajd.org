I'm glad you didn't make a joke chapter.

A question: Are ghost types rare and difficult to catch? They would be a very useful resource in this situation: even if they can't phase through walls, they're probably silent. Gen VI removed Gengar's levitate (wtf?) but even Gastly by itself is pretty darn scary; quiet cloud of poison (secondary typing!) that moves by itself.

Also, one thing that I just noticed: Surge's gym pretty much teaches people how to deal with those situations. Why not even the rangers ask for backup? Practical field experience, too.

BTW, suggestions for an actual joke chapter anyone? "There's a Rotom in your dishwasher!"? Peak humans (Batman) in the Pokeverse? Blue finds
