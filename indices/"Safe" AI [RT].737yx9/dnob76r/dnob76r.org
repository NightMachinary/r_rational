  Say you were to take that motivation away from an AI and turn it into a glorified question-answering machine ... It has no purpose, no endgame, no values. All it can do is answer questions asked to it by humans.

You're postulating it's something like Siri. Or Alexa. Or Google. But we have those things, and you're probably aware that they are less than ideal. They really only respond to the things they're programmed to respond to. More precisely, they're constructs or tools made using the intelligence of the programmers and engineers who built them, not their own intelligence. And that's not what we want.

I'm not suggesting that a calculator isn't useful. It's just never going to be what you're really hoping for when you interact with a question-answering AI. If you had a true artificial intelligence, it seems that it would be necessary to give it motives: A desire to understand communication. A desire to answer questions asked of it. And let's not forget to add a desire to make sure those answers are correct. Finally, it would need the resources to achieve those goals.

It's only a slight perversion of those goals to imagine a machine that desires people to ask it questions. Or that asks questions of itself. Then you just have an information maximizer, not a friendship and ponies maximizer, which is at least as bad.
