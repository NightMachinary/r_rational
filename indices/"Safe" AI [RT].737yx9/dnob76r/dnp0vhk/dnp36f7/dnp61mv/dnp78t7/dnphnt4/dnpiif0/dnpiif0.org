I confess I don't know what an SAT Solver is so I can't really argue with you on that point.

I agree it is a huge leap from using optimization sub-routines to turning the world into paperclips. But the important missing step is that the hypothetical AI in this situation is able to do something that no current optimization program can do (at least not significantly): it can rewrite its own code and improve itself.

It will still be optimizing towards the same goal as it improves upon itself. But it will also be exploring all possible avenues for optimizing that goal that are available to it, unless we have explicitly coded it not to pursue those possibilities, or it has reasons to believe that they will impede its main goal(s).

That's where the danger lies.
