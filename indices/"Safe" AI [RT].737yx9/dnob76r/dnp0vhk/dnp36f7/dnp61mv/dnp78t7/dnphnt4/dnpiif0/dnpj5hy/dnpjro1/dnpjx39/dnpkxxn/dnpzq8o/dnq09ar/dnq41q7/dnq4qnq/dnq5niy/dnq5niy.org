  That is not what most people are describing when they talk about a General Purpose AI.

I'm not entirely convinced by this. I imagine that most people would consider a human upload to be able to function as a general purpose AI. However although it will learn things about the world and develop new tricks over time, it won't be substantially different from how it worked initially a decade in.

And fine. If you define "AI" to mean "thing that will cause a hard takeoff singularity", then of course any AI will necessarily be hard to predict and keep safe.
