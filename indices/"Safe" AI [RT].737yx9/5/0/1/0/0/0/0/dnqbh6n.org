  But fine, I'll go there. Do you have strong evidence that there isn't some relatively simple, non-self-improving program that solves all SAT problems in near linear time?

I'm not sure what the relevance of this is. Whether something is an AI or not does not depend on its efficiency. A magic 8-ball that magically solves any SAT problem instantly without any other effect on the world is not an AI. What determines whether something is an AI is what its algorithm does. If it receives a SAT problem and decides "Oh wait user, I'm going to go to the library first to read up on SAT problems so I can figure out how to solve this", that would be an AI even though it's very very slow. Though it probably wouldn't be a very powerful one like the one in "Friendship is Optimal".
