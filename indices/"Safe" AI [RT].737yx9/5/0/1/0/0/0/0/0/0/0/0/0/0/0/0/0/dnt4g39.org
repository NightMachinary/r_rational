Question: What is your interpretation of the Chinese room? Who in the experiment knows how to speak Chinese?

Not in this universe where we have finite computational resources.

  Imagine an arbitrarily large desert, with chaotic winds randomly blowing it about for all eternity. Inevitably, after an incredibly long period of time, the sand will be arranged into a magnificent sandcastle by sheer random chance. Is the desert or the wind intelligent then, seeing as it designed and constructed a building?

No. It's behavior was to randomly rearrange sand. You can see this if you watch what it does for hundreds of years. You can only conclude that its functionality was to build a sandcastle if picked to exact right time to stop it and observe.

Now, if the wind were set up in such a way that there was some fixed amount of time T so that /under essentially any starting condition/ after T time you would end up with a sandcastle, you could reasonably claim that the wind actually built a sandcastle, since it reliably produced that behavior after a reliable amount of time.
