  Note: this all assumes that we can draw a distinction between full self-improvement and merely learning from data.

Well, as you said, the line is blurry when it comes to machine learning. Because machine learning is in some sense, self improvement, just relatively limited. It is this limitation that allows humans to have a "vague idea" of what the program does, as opposed to "no idea". The "amount" of "idea" humans have is inversely proportional to the amount of self-improvement a program has.

  If the postman's sole behavior was to route emails to their intended recipients, I would start to doubt that they were intelligent.

The outward appearance is identical though. For both of them, the user simply observes a letter being delivered. It's in the process where creativity can be found in the postman, not the email service. For example, if some error occurs in the network, like a node crashing, the email service just follows simple algorithms to reroute to the destination. In contrast, a postman that gets lost can come up with all kinds of creative methods for finding a way to the destination. A postman could check a map, or ask a stranger for directions, or use a compass, or check his satellite GPS, or use a phone to call for help, etc. etc. All of these, the user won't actually see, but are signs of intelligence.
