I mean a SAT solver that does well on the kinds of complicated SAT problems that humans can do well on (like finding proofs of complicated statements). I would have just said "near linear time SAT solver", but you might be one of the people who believes that P is almost certainly not NP and claim that this is just theoretically impossible.

But fine, I'll go there. Do you have strong evidence that there isn't some relatively simple, non-self-improving program that solves all SAT problems in near linear time?

And yes, I'm not claiming that using an oracle AI to design a better oracle is necessarily safe. Though I suspect that if you are OK with slow progress, since you already know how to build an oracle AI, you could get by with asking it technical questions about how to improve various aspects of your design that you might be able to reasonably understand the answers to.

Also the bar for being safer than having a rapidly self-improving AI is pretty low.
