  I believe that internal functionality might affect whether or not you contain intelligent beings within you, but not whether or not you are intelligent
#+end_quote

Is there a difference? Containing an intelligent being seems the same as intelligence to me. For example, we say humans are intelligent, because they contain an intelligent being (their brain or soul or whatever).

  For example, an adding machine is not AI even if you implement the logic gates by hiring people to manually compute NANDs of inputs given to them.
#+end_quote

It would be intelligent, but not an AI since it's not artificial, there are biological people in it.

  isn't more intelligent than any other SAT solver. It might just have more intelligent subroutines.
#+end_quote

Isn't having more intelligent subroutines exactly the same as being more intelligent?

#+begin_quote
  Does SAT solving imply intelligence? I would think that it does.
#+end_quote

I would argue that it doesn't. Not necessarily. It strongly suggests intelligence, but at the end of the day, SAT problems can be brute forced, which doesn't require creativity.

Imagine an arbitrarily large desert, with chaotic winds randomly blowing it about for all eternity. Inevitably, after an incredibly long period of time, the sand will be arranged into a magnificent sandcastle by sheer random chance. Is the desert or the wind intelligent then, seeing as it designed and constructed a building?

Or imagine a typewriter under a waterfall, with the falling water pressing random keys. This system would eventually type up the complete works of Shakespeare and a rigorous proof of Fermat's last theorem. Is the waterfall intelligent then?
