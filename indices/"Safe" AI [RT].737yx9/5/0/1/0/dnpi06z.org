An efficient, practical SAT solver is clearly powerful. Do you believe that it is not an AI or do you believe that it is impossible to create one without self-improvement?

Also, I will note that with using oracles for self-improvement, this is basically what gets done today with computer hardware, where computers are used as aids to design better computers.

Also, I won't argue that oracles aren't dangerous to have around. Suicide by genie is a real worry if you try to use them for anything big enough. But at least they won't destroy the world all by themselves.
