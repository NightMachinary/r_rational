Where does this dichotomy come from? I mean on the one hand, we have machine learning algorithms, which are self-improving (in the sense that they learn from data) and are much dumber than humans. On the other hand, one can plausibly imagine human uploads that are not much smarter than humans (and also are not substantially self-improving).
