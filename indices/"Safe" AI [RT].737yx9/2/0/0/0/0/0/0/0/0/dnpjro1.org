If it wasn't able to explore anything outside of one specific field of expertise then it wouldn't be a super-intelligent AI.

We're talking about an AI that is not just as intelligent as a human in the sense that it can do as many calculations as a human brain can in a second, but in the sense that it has problem solving skills on-par with or greater than a human.

It's not just using one algorithm or a small group of algorithms and decision tress to determine its actions. But rather it has the ability to accumulate knowledge and even create its own algorithms.

Now you can definitely argue about whether such a super-intelligent AI will ever come into existence. There are certainly some experts who doubt that it will happen. But the AI I'm describing is many orders of magnitudes beyond what Alpha Go is doing. It's basically an AI that has the ability to learn and improve upon anything a Human can and more.

Edit: I'm saying super-intelegent AI. But specifically I mean a general purpose AI or AGI as I stated in earlier comments.
