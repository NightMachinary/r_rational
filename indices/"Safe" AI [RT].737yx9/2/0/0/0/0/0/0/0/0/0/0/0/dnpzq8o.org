Firstly, I think that mathematics is closer to general purpose than you give it credit for.

Secondly, even if you really insist that it can directly answer questions about the real world, I don't see why this would immediately imply that it is agent like. It would use modeling and problem solving capabilities to come up with answers, it would maybe even compare them to each other based on some sort of accuracy or understandability metrics. However, it would merely be programed to think about these problems, not to act in the world in a way to optimize its ability to think about these problems. It also is programmed to answer the question given to it as best it can, not to try to optimize the world to give it questions that it can answer. Computers don't end up acting in the real world unless you tell them to.
