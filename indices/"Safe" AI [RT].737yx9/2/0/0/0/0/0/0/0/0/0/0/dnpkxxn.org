Perhaps, but again that's not really the type of AI we're talking about.

If you look at the OP we're talking about something with a much broader scope than Mathmatics. An AI that's primary purpose would be to answer any question asked of it.

Such an AI would have to know of the existence of the outside world in order to answer questions about it.

I'm not saying it's impossible to have an Artificial Intelligence that's smarter than humans and better at problem solving a specific task without it going haywire. I'm saying that a general purpose AI like the one described in the OP would have to be designed very carefully in order to make sure it wasn't dangerous to humanity.

But I agree if it has no access to any information outside of a very small specific range of data, it's unlikely it will ever be directly harmful to people... depending on what that data is and what's trying to do with it.
