Thinking about this a little bit more, I believe that internal functionality might affect whether or not you contain intelligent beings within you, but not whether or not /you/ are intelligent, in sort of a reverse Chinese room kind of way.

For example, an adding machine is not AI even if you implement the logic gates by hiring people to manually compute NANDs of inputs given to them.

In this instance, the people will still be intelligent, but the system that you built is just an adder and thus not.

So I think that your machine that solves SAT problems by looking things up in a library and thinking really hard isn't more intelligent than any other SAT solver. It might just have more intelligent subroutines.

Which I guess pushes the conversation up a level. Does SAT solving imply intelligence? I would think that it does. Solving general, complicated SAT problems is essentially as difficult as finding proofs of theorems, and I would argue that proving difficult theorems is a fundamentally creative endeavor.
