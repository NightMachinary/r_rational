  If it is built by humans, then it is necessarily within the realm of human understanding.

My understanding is that this is totally false even for existing machine learning algorithms. If you train a neural net to classify something, you have a vague idea of what the classifier does (in the sense that it is a circuit consisting of gates of a given type and that its higher level nodes probably detect more abstract concepts) but coming up with a human-interpretable explanation for why the classifier behaves the way it does (that is much simpler than "that's what the following complicated algorithm outputs") is a major open problem.

  Compare a postman and an email service. Both have the same functionality: they deliver letters.

If the postman's sole behavior was to route emails to their intended recipients, I would start to doubt that they were intelligent.
