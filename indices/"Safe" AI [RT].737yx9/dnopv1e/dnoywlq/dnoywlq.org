What definition of "AI" are you using in order for this to be true? How do you square this with things that are currently labelled as "AI" that maybe train on examples, but never substantively rewrite their code or progress beyond solving image classification problems (or whatever it is programmed to do)?

And you can write programs that are smarter than you are (in specialized ways at least) without giving them self-improvement. Linear regression algorithms are way better than I am at noticing patterns in certain kinds of high dimensional data.

At the very least, if you want to go the singularity route, it seems that the far safer way to do it is to build oracle AIs, and simply ask them questions that allow you to better design the next generation of oracle AIs. That way at least humans remain in the loop.
