I think they optimize exactly the value function you provided: "display on the screen the output of this algorithm". All universes in which the screen displays the correct output have value 1 and all others have value 0. Though I would say this is a rather pedantic answer. You can map both those programs onto a markov decision process with the value function above, the algorithm then defines a policy on that MDP.
