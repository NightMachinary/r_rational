An AI, if we go by the standard usage of the term, is by definition agent-like. This means, among other things, that it take actions to optimize the universe based on some internal metric. If your specification doesn't have that, it's a glorified calculator, not an AI--no matter how many simulated mathematicians it uses (which incidentally would be a horribly inefficient way of searching for proofs, and would also make it unsafe depending on how smart said mathematicians are).
