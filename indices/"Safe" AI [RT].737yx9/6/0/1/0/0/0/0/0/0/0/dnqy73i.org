You left out literally the next sentence of the Wikipedia article:

#+begin_quote
  Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is applied when a machine mimics "cognitive" functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as "learning" and "problem solving".
#+end_quote

And slightly further down:

#+begin_quote
  Capabilities generally classified as AI as of 2017 include successfully understanding human speech, competing at a high level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go), autonomous cars, intelligent routing in content delivery networks, military simulations, and interpreting complex data.
#+end_quote

Note that several listed items such as understanding speech and interpreting complex data clearly do not require that your machine be agent like.

And I'm not saying that your definition is wrong, I am saying that your definition is not so standard that you should be policing other peoples' usage. I feel like the burden of proof for this should be that there are significant authorities that agree with me rather than that a majority of authorities or that the best authorities do.
