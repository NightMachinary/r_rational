Not everything is an optimizer. I mean what if what your "AI" did was take any formal mathematical statement and correctly assessed whether or not there was a proof of less than 10^{10^{10}} characters? Or was a Solomonov inductor? What value functions do these optimize other than "display on the screen the output of this algorithm"?

Edit: Though the proof-finder is basically just an oracle for NExp.
