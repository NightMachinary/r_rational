  I guess there's the distinction between "number of copies of me" going from many to fewer (with the ability to go back to many arbitrarily), versus going from one to none permanently...
#+end_quote

That is a big part of it--I will still have at least one copy. The other part is, if I currently have myself beheaded it helps a few people. By allowing my beheaded self to be copied, I could help most people needing organ donations. The number of people helped depends upon the existence of the machine.

If I could somehow solve organ donation problems for thousands of people by having my one-and-only self beheaded, I would feel obligated to do it.
