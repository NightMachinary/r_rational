  The number of people helped depends upon the existence of the machine.

Number of people helped /per future-self sacrificed/ stays constant though. Although it is perhaps also relevant to consider whether those future-selves would have existed at all if not for the possibility of harvesting their organs.

Ah, I also just realised the procedure suggested was [clone, behead, clone the beheaded copy n times]... so there's only one /person/ that ever actually dies, in exchange for an inexhaustible supply of headless organ donors. I was thinking of it as [clone, behead]*n, which would make each set of organs a separate individual who just got beheaded.
