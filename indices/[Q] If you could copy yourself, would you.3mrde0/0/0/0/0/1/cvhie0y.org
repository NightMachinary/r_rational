  I was thinking of it as [clone, behead]*n, which would make each set of organs a separate individual who just got beheaded.

I see. The difference in the procedures makes me uncomfortable because beheading me seems like it involves killing me. I'm not sure that it should--especially if my soon-to-be-beheaded self never regains consciousness.

Suppose instead of beheading I injected my copy with a lethal dose of some poison that doesn't ruin organs, waited for my copy to lose consciousness, and used copies of my doomed self for organs? If I am doomed and unconscious, even my one-and-only self, might as well take my organs. I wouldn't be killing people with futures, then--just creating tons of doomed people, which is traditionally much more acceptable.
