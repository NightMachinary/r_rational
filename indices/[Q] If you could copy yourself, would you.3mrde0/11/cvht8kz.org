If I had children, I definitely would. Life can end at any moment.

As it stands right now, I still would. I have a three bedroom house, and could use a trustworthy roommate. I even have a spare computer they could borrow until they got a job to help pay the rent.

I know, this seems so... pedestrian. However, even if we don't share income it's still a net benefit for the mortgage and utilities. And yes, I probably wouldn't share money with myself if there wasn't serious need, because that other me needs to get a job, dammit. My niece, however, would get twice as many presents, every year.
