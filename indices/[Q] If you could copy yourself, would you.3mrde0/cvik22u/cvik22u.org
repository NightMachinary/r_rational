As several others have mentioned, there's a number of flaws for those of us who have established lives at this point in their life. A number of flaws arise if you have a significant other, a non-duplicable job, high expenses, or even just a non-negligible social circle.

*Options if you have a significant other:*

- Lie to them about the existence of your clone (generally bad for relationships in general)

- Have your clone never interact with them (likely emotionally traumatizing, given that they have all the memories of being you, and thus you've just forced yourself to dump your SO without any real reason)

- Convince them (and yourself) to go full-poly with you and your clone (unknown if this is doable if you're not already so inclined)

- Convince them to clone themselves along with you (probably the best choice, if possible, other than further increase of required resources)

*Options if your job is not easily duplicated:*

- Try to find another position for your clone. (Depending on your field, this might be easier or harder. Software developer in a strong market? Not so bad. Marine biologist in academia? Good luck.)

- Split work between you and your clone. (Hopefully you're /really/ good at communication, because if there's some project specific details that got left out in your daily clone briefing, you're not going to have a clue, and you're no longer doubling up your income, so bill will be that much tighter.)

- Get a shift/part time job. (If your current job is in any way intellectually or socially stimulating, you're going to have a bad time.)

*Options for high expenses:*

- If you can both work, then you can both contribute to the bills. (Some things might cost less per capita for more people, like a larger house/apartment, so this would be a net increase in income.)

- Continue at normal or slightly more than normal income. (Lots of other things, such as food and clothing, does not change in cost per capita when expanding it by 1 or 2.)

*Options for social circle:*

- Tell friends about your cloning, have clone join social circle. (Shouldn't be an issue unless it destabilizes the social interactions in the group, unless you're trying to keep it a secret.)

- Keep it a secret and split time. (Lack of shared memories will impact you the same here as it would with trying to share a job with project work or something similar.)

- Prevent clone from interacting with friends. (Same negatives as not interacting with SO going forward, in regards to emotional impact.)

--------------

The alternative scenario is doing as was done in The Prestige, and committing mass murder/suicide to keep the total number of "you" down to one, but will also be highly likely to have strongly negative emotional impacts. The best possibility for this would be to use the machine as a save state, especially if you can scan without duplicating (in which case, "latest healthy state" would be a decent way to increase your ability to do things that would risk your own health, given someone else who can operate the "create new clone from backup" for you)

I think the best bet would actually be to collect large numbers of small paper bills and a small number of large paper bills, and use the free transformation to convert all of the small bills into some amount of larger bills, assuming that the amount/type of inks should hopefully be able to be sourced from other paper bills.
