Finding another job for your clone is not as easy as "Software developer in a strong market? Not so bad." Finding a job requires having records of yourself including a Social Security number, college transcript, job references, etc. Attempting to use yours will leave a suspicious-looking trail.

You're pretty much going to have to go public. And once you go public, immediately contact a lawyer, so your clone can get a birth certificate (and let's hope the law doesn't require listing the date of birth as today), SSN, bank account, driver's license, etc. and be able to generally act without committing fraud. Otherwise your clone can't even legally sign a credit card receipt.
