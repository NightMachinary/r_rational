Probably. If i only get one... maybe not, though. now seems like a bad time, and one of us would get screwed over, most likely, from the duplication, because we wouldn't have valid id, or we would, but two copies that make people suspicious. (meanwhile, i have no useful skills yet. as a second year college student, i would be spliting our resources two ways, unless we pretended to be one person and split classes- which would be bad for actually learning. it would likely end badly, and preparing a backup without making a copy would be better.)

unless this offer comes with future duplication, one me would never get their driver's liscence, and while i can get away with one id between two people, we'd need to be careful.
