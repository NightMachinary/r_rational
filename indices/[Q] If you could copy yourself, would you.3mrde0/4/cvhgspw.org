Yes. Worst case scenario it means that the person I am at the point of the copying will be immortal so why wouldn't I? Even if the me that's older will die I don't see a reason for why this version can't be immortal as there isn't really a drawback.

It would make things a bit harder having two me's but it's not insurmountable and I think we would work well together.
