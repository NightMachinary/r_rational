Presuming I wanted to keep my new clone secret, it would be extremely hard for both of us to survive post cloning. We'd only have one legal identity, so it would be difficult for me to get an additional job. We could hardly afford to pay for both of us to live on just one job, and I'm just ignoring the whole problem of my wife suddenly having two husbands.

If we lived in a context where clones where an accepted legal entity, then maybe, as me 2 could go get a job for himself. But ultimately an army of mes would need feeding and shelter proportional to the number of mes, so it wouldn't be terribly financially viable.
