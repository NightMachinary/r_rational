I was thinking about this earlier today. Assuming you go the route of not telling anyone that your clones are clones (you hide the fact and pretend you're still one person): Three clones get two or three shift jobs. Day shift, Afternoon shift, Night shift. If three, one or more has to be less than 8 hours. Basically just make certain you're never officially in two places at once. Might want to give six hours in between all the time, for "sleep". Additional clones can work online, make things, write, program, whatever skills you have or they develop. End result, "you" make a lot more money. As to the health care... yeah, that's going to suck. Maybe make as many clones of yourself as you're ever going to want, ditch / destroy / hide the machine, and go public? Your clones get their own identity then.

I think I'd make 3-5 of me. Some would work, some would support at home.
