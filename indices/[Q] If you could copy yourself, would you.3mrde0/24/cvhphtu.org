  Let's say I have a sci-fi replication machine that creates atomically perfect duplicates of whatever you put inside. Its not a magic mass-energy violation engine, it has to be supplied with raw material. The goal of the post is /not/ to munchkin the machine, so don't worry about that. It won't damage the original either so don't worry about that as well.

  Anyway, I have this machine and I offer to let you use it to copy yourself. The copy will have your memories, personality, its identical to you in every way. Would you take me up on my offer?

Yes, no hesitation.

  Let's also add another twist, in the process of making the copy your exact 'state' is saved as data. From this, you could create additional copies of yourself identical to you at the moment of the scan.
#+end_quote

Again, yes with no hesitation.

  How would you use this? You can copy yourself but does that count as an instant shortcut to immortality, or is the copy not really 'you' ? Would you make any army of yourself, create a think tank of yous? What would you do if you had any easy way to make more of you?

I would feed other people into the device to make more of me, primarily the destitute and disestablished, the ones who are passed by by others. Possibly suicidal people.

I search out thought experiments to train myself for theoretical situations(Newcomb, Prisoner's Dilemma, etc.), and one that I came across in fiction is one that I don't know if it already has a name. I'd call it 'Identical Selfish Cooperation' or some such thing. Essentially, I've already primed myself with a multitude of secret verification methods that any version of myself stemming from certain points in time will be able to use. Also, I've already precommitted(a la Timeless Decision Theory) to never directly and knowingly hinder any plans of any other version of myself, while being amenable to(or even just outright) helping further plans of other versions of myself.

This ends with me pushing humanity /strongly/ towards achieving functional immortality and interstellar travel at /every/ level.
