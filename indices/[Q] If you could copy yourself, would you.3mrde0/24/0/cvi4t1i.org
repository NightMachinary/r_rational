  I would feed other people into the device to make more of me, primarily the destitute and disestablished, the ones who are passed by by others. Possibly suicidal people.

... "it has to be supplied with raw material"

Copied from Fullmetal Alchemist Wiki:

"Water (35 L), Carbon (20 kg), Ammonia (4 L), Lime (1.5 kg), Phosphorous (800 g), Salt (250 g), Saltpeter (100 g), Sulfur (80 g), Fluorine (7.5 g), Iron (5 g), Silicon (3 g) and fifteen other elements in trace amounts."

So I'd just buy up a lot of those ingredients and use that to make the clones.
