So yes, I'm going to copy myself.

Then I'm going to start testing ways to get me to be more productive/accomplish my goals more effectively.

The biggest long-term effectiveness multipliers would probably come from creating habits for exercise, meditation, and effective studying.

Starting with exercise then, I know I need to get more exercise, but convincing myself to exercise is hard. So I'd take what I already know, and devise 5-10 different 'programs' based on various approaches to convincing myself to exercise, and track the total amount of exercise done by each copy.

Khaos1 uses method #1.

Khaos2 uses method #2.

Khaos3 uses method #3.

Khaos4 uses method #4.

Khaos5 uses method #5.

Track which of these methods works better for a month or so, copy 5 more versions of the Khaos version that's best instilled exercise as a habit, and then change the focus to meditation. After a month, gauge which of the now 10 of me's have the best combination of exercise + meditation habits, copy another 10 of them, and then repeat this for instilling studying habits. Then repeat this for sleep.

So now that we've tested and iterated towards a more 'ideal' me, what to do next?

Drug testing. Make 2 copies of me, do a double blind test with modafinil, and test them with various cognitive procedures to see in what cases it's beneficial, and in what cases it has drawbacks.

Ditto for all the other popular nootropics.

Decision theory testing. Make 24 copies of me, break them into 6 groups. Give 3 groups no instruction, a difficult cooperative board game, and have them play 10 times, recording their win %. Tell the other 3 groups to play the first game, but then use methods inspired by Phillip Tetlocks Superforecasting classes to see if the methods used in the superforecasting classes can improve the ability of groups to optimize for outcomes.

Repeat this study design for ideas found in 'Psychology of Intelligence Analysis', 'Expert Political Judgement', and 'the Four Disciplines of Execution'.

There will definitely be group reading sessions, where large groups of us choose random topics we're interested in, start tracking down information on those topics, and when we run into interesting or actionable information, we present it to the rest of us.

When most of the initial bout of 'sate my curiosity' things have been tried, tested, and evaluated, I move onto doing things that actually fulfill my long term goals. I create 'think tanks' dedicated to the promotion of a number of ideas.

A) Argument Mapping. In my mind, this is a no-brainer way of improving the critical thinking skills of anyone who's exposed to it for a sufficient amount of time. With tens, or even hundreds, of me working on the problem, I'm convinced I can eventually force it into public school curriculums. I'll have one wing focused on convincing republicans it's a good idea. A separate wing focused on convincing democrats it's a good idea. We'll have people start studying and practicing journalism, with the goal of inserting people in major online publications and then relentlessly using the tool in those publications to ensure the public gets used to seeing them, understanding them, and considering them useful.

B) Prediction markets. These need to be a real thing that's used everywhere. So I'll have a think tank full of like-minded me's dedicated to pursuing this task, in a similar manner to how I approached the argument mapping one. Have one wing target the left, one wing target the right, and one wing focus on the public at large.

C) Forecasting. We need a think tank that's primary purpose is to get as good at forecasting as possible, and so we'll find and record every insight we can find when it comes to the topic, and deliberately practice with an internal prediction market. The problem of us all thinking along the same lines can be mitigated by creating 10-15 decision making frameworks some of which seem plausible, and some of which don't, and having people try to stick to that specific framework for a year at a time. That way, we can iterate on frameworks while also collecting experience.

The long term plan is to take over the world, but in the short run, 'know thyself', as well as improving my own sanity/rationality is key.
