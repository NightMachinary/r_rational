  Number of people helped per future-self sacrificed stays constant though. Although it is perhaps also relevant to consider whether those future-selves would have existed at all if not for the possibility of harvesting their organs.

I don't think 'number of future selves' is the only thing to consider. Another is: 'optimality of future world state'. It's reasonable to believe that a single 'me' (with the ability to create more clones if necessary) has similar world-optimizing-towards-my-goals power as multiple 'me's (exactly because it can always clone to the N if advantageous). Zero 'me's is at a clear disadvantage.
