#+begin_quote
  For example, if I am willing to copy myself once, behead my copy, and copy my beheaded self an arbitrary number of times, I could provide a lot to organ donations.
#+end_quote

I'm finding it hard to locate an argument for why being willing to do this shouldn't logically dictate also being willing to behead your current self for use as an organ donor - if the current version of you is willing to sacrifice some future-selves for their organs, then what's the significant difference between a clone-o-mat future-self and the "regular progression of time" future-self?

I guess there's the distinction between "number of copies of me" going from many to fewer (with the ability to go back to many arbitrarily), versus going from one to none permanently...
