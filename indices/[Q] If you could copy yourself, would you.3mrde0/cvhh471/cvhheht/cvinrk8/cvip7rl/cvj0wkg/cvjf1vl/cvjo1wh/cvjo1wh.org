Isn't that the whole argument about how teleportation through deconstruction/reconstruction is no more like dying than going to sleep is? If that is true then my argument logically follows, no?

Not to mention that babies in their last trimester could be considered as conscious as babies right after birth. And yet I'm pro-choice.

All in all this is just me being consistent. But if you see a flaw in my reasoning then please point it out. It is always good to change ones mind when one is wrong.
