If the clone is unconscious at creation and thus has no experience that would be lost, nor suffer any pain otherwise. It essentially lives on through you just like you would live on through the guy who comes out at the other side when you step through a teleporter. Or to put it differently, if the clone has never been conscious between creation and death this could be considered no worse than an abortion. After all the clone only ever had the /potential/ to become a distinct person instead of just another instance of you.
