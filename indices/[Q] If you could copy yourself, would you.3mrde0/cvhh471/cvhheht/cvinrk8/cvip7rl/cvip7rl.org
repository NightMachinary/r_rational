Killing people by refusing to manufacture the clones? Just to be clear... are we both talking about making /live/ clones (with the heads on), then carving them up for organs?

Maybe I'm a bad consequentialist, but something unnerves me about any position that denies the natural right of a person over the contents of their own chest cavity, not to mention their right to not be killed for that contents.

Feels like that's one of those things that it's important to maintain, even in cases where the organs could be saving multiple other lives. Like that's one of the things where "I shut up and multiplied and this small evil is for the greater good" doesn't justify a course of action, because that reliably leads to "the bad place" even when we think we've been careful.
