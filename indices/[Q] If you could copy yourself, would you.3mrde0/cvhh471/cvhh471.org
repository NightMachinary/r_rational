It is really hard not to 'munchkin the machine' with this. For example, if I am willing to copy myself once, behead my copy, and copy my beheaded self an arbitrary number of times, I could provide a lot to organ donations. I would hate to have to die once, but it would probably be worth it. I could make the initial copy while unconscious to minimize distress.

Disregarding obvious abuses of the machine, it would still be nice to have a copy of myself. We would use our shared history to become a very effective team, but specialize in different things after the split. This works for more than two copies. However, the more copies I'd make, the harder it would be to keep it a secret--or to deal with other complications, like keeping all of me fed. I'd probably limit myself to five or so, and 'scan' each of those five every day so I could load a backup in case of accident. Unless the scan necessitates instantiating a copy, in which case I'd only save the original scans and count on all five of me not dying at once. The long-term plan would be to load five younger selves with the older selves as mentors, say every thirty years, and make a 'family' of sorts. We of course would specialize in research.

I would only have more than five per generation after careful consideration.

The biggest flaw with this plan is that other people might be more deserving of copies than myself. Five copies of a recognized genius (not going to name any genius in particular though) might be more worthy.
