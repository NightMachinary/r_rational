I'm writing a story that features this exact ability in the shape of a handheld device, and with the limitation that the copies only last around an hour before dissolving harmlessly into nothing.

So; the primary limitation of this machine seems to be that the copies are not easily expendable. However, if the machine can recycle human bodies that does take care of that problem.

Also, I am assuming that the scanner is separate from the duplication chamber, so you know if you are the scanned or the cloned copy.

Here's a helpful mantra, to recite /before/ scanning:

#+begin_quote
  /If I am a clone, I will protect and aid my true self.\\
  If I am a human, I will respect and utilize my copy.\\
  When I am a cloned being, I am an asset; expendable. My true self is all that matters. I don't matter.\\
  When I am the scanned original, I am a liability; irreplaceable. My clones don't matter. Only I matter.\\
  I shall not want to be what I am not; I shall not mourn. That is the state of affairs; how it was, how it is, how it will be./
