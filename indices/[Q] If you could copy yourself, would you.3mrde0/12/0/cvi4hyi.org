I'm interested in reading that story, if it's free, reply here or PM me a link?

I've often fantasized about having a cloning superpower, however my fantasy is a bit OP. Can clone instantly, infinitely. Clones can clone as well (they're exactly me, ability included). Clones can choose to un-clone (disappear) and memories will be merged into the original (me). I start a branching series of clones, who go into the world, far and wide. Periodically, they clone themselves once and then one merges back, updating me in memories and ability.

Your story sounds a bit more rational and limited though... But I'd picture in yours that every clone would be kinda sad and mopey for about an hour, unless the device imparts something in them that makes them not perfectly identical to the original. Imagine, you push a button on your device to clone yourself, and /poof/ your POV changes and you're looking at yourself, holding the device, and you realize you have an hour to live. I don't think I (as a clone) could deal with that. And you'd have to be cruel as the original to keep doing it. (Unless, as I said, the device does something to mitigate the cruelty)
