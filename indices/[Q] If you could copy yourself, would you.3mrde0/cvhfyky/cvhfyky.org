Well, I'm an identical twin so I'm already halfway there.

One avenue to some humor using this machine would be further confusing people who mix up me and my brother.

And yes, I'd use this in a hot second. After a few days of letting my counterpart do whatever he wanted, we'd be sufficiently different enough to carry on a conversation. Although, now that I think about it, it would be emotionally taxing for one of us to have to give up many aspects of my current life. Even with myself, I think my SO and I would find it weird to have two mes in the house.
