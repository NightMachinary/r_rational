I think most of us answer "yes" to the first few questions, so let's skip to the interesting part: what do you do with your copies?

Step one is making sure I actually get along with myself. If I don't, it's time to try to "fix" myself so that that is true. Can't act like a hivemind if you can't work with yourself, and you're probably not someone you want to be, either.

Step two is to start finding branch points. New job is a solid one there, and probably the leader: it's not like two of me could show up to the same desk. Even if it's a duplicate of the job I'm already doing - well, "Job" is more "Thing you do most of your day most days".

Branch points have to have enough divergence that we're not stepping on each other's toes.

I'm mostly going to stop this track here, except to say there's two other uses I'd specifically go after: 1) Getting this machine into the hands of a few specific other people who I want there to literally be more of in the world. 2) Need to work out a Merge method, so you can do Fork and Merge. That blows open the accessibility and value of branch points.
