  Step one is making sure I actually get along with myself. If I don't, it's time to try to "fix" myself so that that is true. Can't act like a hivemind if you can't work with yourself, and you're probably not someone you want to be, either.

I've solved this issue by precommitting to work with any identical copies of myself and precommitting with very small reservations to working with future or alternate versions of myself.
