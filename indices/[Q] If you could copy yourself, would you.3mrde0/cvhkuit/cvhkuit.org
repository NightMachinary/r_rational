Assuming I would be allowed multiple copies, I would probably have a primary me whose task it was to further my education and learn things. That one would be a primary base for possible future clones. One whose job it was to be the optimal me. I'd probably need admin too, to coordinate various things so I didn't try do the same thing five times at once.

Assuming I wasn't supposed to let everyone know I had clones, I would try and get a night shift job. I'd also try and find a decent way to make money under the table. I'd try and find work that I could alternate mes without raising suspicion (imagine if your coworker never remembered your conversations from yesterday) to increase overall leisure/personal time per me.

With that set up, I could probably support a lot of mes. Buying food in is even cheaper when everyone likes the same food, buying/renting is usually cheaper per room with larger places, I could easily double up by simply sleeping in shifts. I could probably even double up again on bedrooms, since I wouldn't need much space without having to deal with all my stuff, which could be easily centralized. I'd probably also turn some of the common space into more sleeping space, the main downside is I'd have to balance that with project space, unless I had a shop.

I could buy some land in the middle of nowhere and have a bunch of me live kind of off the grid... with high speed internet. I've always kind of wanted to, and it would be much easier with money still coming in, and an outside source of help/supplies.

TL;DR I'd work with myself to minimize work and optimize play.
