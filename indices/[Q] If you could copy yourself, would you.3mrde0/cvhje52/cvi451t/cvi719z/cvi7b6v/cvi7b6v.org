I don't think so. In a different comment, I copied the Fullmetal Alchemist Wiki's list of the components of a human body (water, carbon, iron, etc.). I think you would just research and put all the ingredients in there. To make it easier I imagine you could probably throw like, a dead cow or several dead pigs or what have you in there, I don't think humans necessarily are composed of different things than your typical mammal.
