  Let's say */I/* have a sci-fi replication machine

  in the process of making the copy your exact 'state' is saved as data. From this, you could create additional copies of yourself identical to you at the moment of the scan.

Does that mean that I am essentially giving /you/ the ability to make as many copies of me as you wish? Because giving a complete stranger such power over me is a rather large deal.

If you're saying that you would give me my own machine, not networked to any database you have access to then I'd answer with a resolute yes. But this way... I don't know. Depends on how our meeting in person goes?
