This doesn't seem like a shortcut to immortality to me; at best it's a forward time machine + cloner.

Consider: you save the state of me right now. If you wake that state in 10 years, it's as if it was time jumped forward by 10 years. If I age 10 years normally, then take another state, that new state has physical capabilities of 10 year older me; eventually me-prime will die of old age, and all of his most recent clones will be almost-dead too.

Still, that's somewhat valuable. By waking a new me every 10 years I get a 'family member' with values close to mine, with whom I can talk about my recent experiences and hopefully he'll do more than the current I could achieve. In that way it's very like having children, except without the exhausting/boring/expensive/blahblahblah raising children bit. (but also without all the positive sides of raising children, which i'm sure exist; liike [overcoming adversity with a partner? there should be a {probably german} word for it] etc. No children here, can't really know)

But yeah I'd probably copy myself a couple times now, and then wake another couple copies every decade or two. Obviously would depend on current events.

An army of me would probably not do much better than just a couple me's.
