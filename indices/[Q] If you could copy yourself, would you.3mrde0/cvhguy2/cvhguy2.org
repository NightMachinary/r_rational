  If you could copy yourself, would you
#+end_quote

Yes.

#+begin_quote
  The copy will have your memories, personality, its identical to you in every way. Would you take me up on my offer?
#+end_quote

Yes.

#+begin_quote
  In the process of making the copy your exact 'state' is saved as data. From this, you could create additional copies of yourself identical to you at the moment of the scan.
#+end_quote

Yes.

#+begin_quote
  How would you use this?
#+end_quote

Make as many data copies of everyone as I can.

#+begin_quote
  You can copy yourself but does that count as an instant shortcut to immortality, or is the copy not really 'you' ?
#+end_quote

Instant shortcut to immortality.

#+begin_quote
  Would you make any army of yourself, create a think tank of yous?
#+end_quote

No need for an army, but I could work several jobs and cooperate with myself to pool resources and cut my cost of living. No point in a think tank, as you want diversity of thought for that which copies of me will lack.

#+begin_quote
  What would you do if you had any easy way to make more of you?
#+end_quote

Live forever.
