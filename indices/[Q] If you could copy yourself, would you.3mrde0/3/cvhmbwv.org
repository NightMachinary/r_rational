How will your copy get his [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndeadTaxExemption][Undead Tax Exemption]]? Your copy isn't going to be able to get a job unless it's under the table, is going to have trouble getting health care (especially if you need medications--no way to buy two copies of the prescription) and you're probably committing several kinds of fraud by having your copy even do things he can get away with, like using your credit card, or not filing a tax return.
