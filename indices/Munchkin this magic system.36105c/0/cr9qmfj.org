  The power of any individual talisman is auto-balanced by the talisman granting object, so no individual talisman is objectively any better or worse than any other talisman.

How again?

Doesn't this mean you can explore the fundamental nature of the universe by comparing examples of manipulations of forces and phenomenon against an objective ruler? By simply having citizen scientists ask for and measure arbitrary physical effects against each other, don't you have something that would allow you to explore the very nature of consciousness (for mind altering talismans) against something like boiling water?

How does altering minor electrochemical states in the brain compare to creating self-sustaining chemical reactions (fire) from nothing? Seems like creating elemental fire is a lot more energy intensive, and actually violates fundamental physical laws. So things more concrete, like turning tons of sugar into smaller quantities of hard drugs and mind controlling hundreds of people by tweaking conceptual memory formation while you talk, should be "balanced" against creating a fireball from nothing once per day.

This talisman granting object seems bigger and more complicated than the magic itself. I think you need a different way to balance things than simply *declaring* them balanced.

  Talismans are transferable (can be bought, sold, or stolen.)

  A talisman ceases to function immediately after the brain death of its creator.

Oops. Slavery worse than has ever existed on the Earth is now not only possible, but easy and desirable. Might want to make a change there, like that they don't work /at all/ for anyone but their creator. Even then...slavery seems like a very good option. 15-year-old soldier conscripts seem inevitable, even with a non-transferable plan.

Best part is, these will be the "best" kept slaves ever, living long, long lives of absolutely nothing. Create food, create water, minor healing, and webs and stuns for everyone 24/7. Bonus points for hibernation effects keeping everyone in magical stasis.

Keep the over-16s healthy but in chains and pregnant for their entire lives. Promises of instant death for entire families from slavers holding hordes of actually useful combat talismans if anyone steps out of line.

Seriously, don't allow transfer of power if you don't want a crapsack world ruled by the first guy who comes up with a mind control device, or makes a cave full of stunned, former talisman owners.

And that's if brain-in-a-jar /isn't/ possible. If it is:
