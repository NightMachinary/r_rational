Yeah, I've decided to come up with a better balance system. The original idea was basically just an excuse for me, as the DM, to nerf player characters so people didn't make mary sues.

As for the second part of your post, there is an in-universe reason for why that doesn't happen, but it's not applicable to this post.

As for the "extend duration of talisman after death idea" that's a pretty good idea. The drawbacks to something like that would be pretty big, though.
