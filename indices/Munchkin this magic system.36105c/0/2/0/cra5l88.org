You.. don't need to lock people up ? Looking at the rules doing so seems daft, in fact. Simply stealing or buying the talismans ought to work just fine. Buying is better because if the expectation is that any talisman you make is subject to confiscation people are just going to make talismans that aren't useful to the powers that be.
