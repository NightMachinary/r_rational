Crapsack world, that was my first assumption on reaching the point where talismans are transferable.

In that world the only rational thing to ask for is a talisman that confers a benefit only on the creator. The only way out is if the talisman-creator is not unique or is an attribute of the world, so competing societies can develop, and so liberal/enlightened societies where people can feel safe asking for talismans that can potentially be stolen or coerced would have a long term advantage.

That also leads to more interesting stories, set in the early years of the growth of the great society. Or stories set in a world where a society has started a slide back towards totalitarianism, where the belief in the values of the enlightened society keeps people generating socially responsible talismans for a generation or two before the general realization hits... you could even toss in an Aesop for contemporary America and corporatism. :)
