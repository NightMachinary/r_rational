I suggest making the power granting talisman as smart as the smartest person who has ever used it. That keeps developmentally retarded or intentionally damaged people from being taken advantage of, while leaving it as a "good genie" for creating talismans. Also, this prevents simple yet powerful instructions from being hammered into compromised users by brainwashing, indoctrination, and drugs.

--------------

I also suggest the magic effects be limited based on how much work is required to reproduce the effects without magic, roughly including all iterative cultural developments required to produce and support it.

For example, creating a tame horse to ride or a magic fireball would then be orders of magnitude easier than creating a steel sword from nothing. Horses were tamed relatively easily, and raising and training one requires not much more than time and a stable of horses to breed. Basic fire is long mastered by humanity and a flaming ball of pitch is physically possible and doesn't require much cultural knowledge or personal skill. Steel is expensive and requires a huge tech base of knowledge to invent and create.

Creating a wall of earth would be similarly possible and even easy, while creating a rock made of radioactive elements as a Renaissance-era user would be flat-out impossible. Even for someone who knows how a cart works, creating one would be much more powerful an effect than creating that tame horse, even if currently buying a horse is harder or more expensive than buying a cart. The chain of effort, historically speaking, is much longer for the cart than the horse.

Creating a /thinking, talking/ sword (or horse) would therefore be impossible. No one has ever done it before, and the talisman couldn't cobble together one from scratch without the person using it having some idea how it would work.

That would make talismans force multipliers, not universe breaking levers.

--------------

Overall, making the talisman fallible and driven by historic precedent is a good idea. But, as a thinking device, it needs a goal. What is it trying to balance against? Excess damage to other people? Satisfaction of users? Imbalance compared to human endeavors? Other talismans and their effects?

Once you have that goal, I think you'll have a working magic system as well as a good plot hook.
