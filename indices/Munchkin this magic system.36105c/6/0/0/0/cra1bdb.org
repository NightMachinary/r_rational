From comments on this thread, I noticed that the balancing system is pretty poorly defined, so I'm going to think of a better definition, post it on the OP, and notify you. The balance system was primarily intended so that I could stop mary-sues in their tracks, so I didn't make it as specific as I should have to allow smart players a greater modicum of control over their powers.

Those are some pretty good suggestions though :)

As for the RP, it's not out yet- I've been working on the wordbuilding for quite a while, but don't quite have a story to put my players through. Note that the rp would actually be a fantasy kitchen sink, though- humans (which all PCs are required to be) get the talisman granting super-talisman, but other species will get super talismans that grant extreme longevity, or extreme hardiness. (in general, other talismans are more powerful in a specific area, but the human supertalisman has more versatility than most other super talismans.) I'll be posting a thread on this subreddit when I finalize it.
