Is it guaranteed that the talisman will at least be usable once? if so all you need is a "generate a universe ending explosion" once for it to break the system.

You didn't really specify how the balancing works so it would depend on it, But if you could make a talisman that creates two 16 year old humans that will listen to all you tell them and then be eternally frozen in an alternate dimension to have a power multiplier, because you will just create two guys and tell them to create other talismans for you, in a possibly unending cycle.
