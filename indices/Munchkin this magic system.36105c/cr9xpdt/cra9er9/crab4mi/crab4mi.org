Well, your new rules do not effect the world ender approach, or any other infinitely powerful talisman, as long as single use is permitted, as convoluted as it may be it will, by definition, be overpowered.

Nor do these rules significantly hinder the power multiplier option, after the first success it will be trivial to keep the "children" ignorant. you mention that the talisman will look back at all the previous uses of the talisman, but i assume it would still be with the intelligence of the person asking for it, so as long as you keep the person just barely intelligent enough to ask for the talisman the retrospection will change nothing.
