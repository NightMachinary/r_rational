This is a good point. Perhaps the super-talisman, being only as smart as the power-requester, can't bestow powers more complex than the power-requester can successfully understand. This would also serve to curtail people using others to get extra op talismans.

Conveniently, it also places burden of technobabble on the PC's, rather than me.
