maybe something along the lines of having a directly accounted for "complexity penalty," like first defining that all possible actions of a talisman have to be possible by expelling power through predefined ways (whether through, say, EM waves or increasing the strength of gravitational fields, or creating matter or increasing kinetic energy, etc.). How hard it is to make a definition is then correlated with the restrictions the super-talisman puts on the individual talismans For example, a talisman that just puts out heat energy is the simplest possible talisman, then a talisman that only puts out heat energy when the closes person to it desires that it does so, then a talisman that puts the heat energy out in a pre-defined pattern on command, and so on. A talisman that "makes the user lucky" by making the user constantly stumble into people who can and will help them with their problems would need massive predictive powers to determine how to use its telekinesis in such a way that it's always beneficial for the holder, but would be less complex and therefore have fewer penalties than a similar talisman that functions by implanting subliminal suggestions by expelling EM waves that affect the brain, because even though it would take less energy, accurate mind-reading /and/ mind affecting is a lot more difficult that just mind reading.

I'm not sure how I could quantify that in such a way that PC's could understand and have control over their talismans, though, which is, as always, the major problem.

That being said, my intention to begin with was to make talismans mundane, even to the reader, to reflect the fact that they're old hat for the people in the RP, and balance the system around making talismans more useful in the long run for everyday tasks rather than slaying monsters. The sense of "magic" would come finding information about the mysterious surrounding polities (which have their own talismans), and the origins of the top-level talismans.
