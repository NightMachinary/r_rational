The drawbacks may go beyond limited charges, OP also listed unknown-by-default conditions for the usage. I could imagine a plot where some omnicidal maniac makes a world-ender, finds out it doesn't seem to work, then "borrows" some amulet of meta-amulet divination to figure out that it only works at the peak of Mount Doom when the stars align 6 months from now. He then or later thinks of using the divination amulet on itself and finds that the drawback is that drawback and function [and creator?] of the target amulet also magically become known to a random amulet-user on the planet... our protagonist.
