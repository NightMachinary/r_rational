I mostly meant that for the talisman not to be abused they need to not be able to have ability to effect conceptual stuff such as "luck" or "human thought" any more then any other device. i mean, if someone could define the ways in which an EM could make someone hate someone else you could make a talisman, just the same as if you made a device that produced that EM.

But once you can do that kind of stuff with the talisman directly it has the potential to be overpowered, especially with the ruleset you defined which is based on the number of humans that exist, and what they think. Anything that could directly effect one or more of those two will be overpowered.

And because these are two factors which are "soft"(we already know of ways to manipulate them even without magic) this system is inherently vulnerable
