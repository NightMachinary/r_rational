To be honest i think such an issue is inherent in arbitrary wishes, to fix the issues i raised specifically you could a. impose limiting maximum power, so max energy\radius of effect\etc. b. set only specific set of base powers, so for example only energy based \physical properties augmentation\etc. basically think of a few base classes of powers and limit to those, and only enable the power to be based on them in a way that the user defines, so you could make logic circuits etc. that can do more "complex" actions, but they will no longer be arbitrary(this is kind of similar to the demons in EYs "Precisely Bound Demons")

limiting the talismans only to "simple" powers would prevent a lot of the possible power cheats, but would also make them much less "fun" and "magical", so a lot of clever-but-not-overpowered tricks will be lost as well.

Alternatively you could just go with the talisman being omniscient and having arbitrary limits, but that is usually less defined and fun..
