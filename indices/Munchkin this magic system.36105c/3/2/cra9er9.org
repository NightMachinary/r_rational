  alright, I've revised the balance system, but I'd still consider it incomplete. Could you tell me any other ways to make it better? Remember, my reason for making this is to keep players from creating OP talismans, but I'd still like a way for them to get a general idea what constitutes as "powerful" and what kinds of drawbacks their request would be likely to get.
