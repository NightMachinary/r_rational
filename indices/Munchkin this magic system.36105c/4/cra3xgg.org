  Talismans are transferable (can be bought, sold, or stolen.)

The common individual will never own a talisman, and the nobility will own millions. Individuals will be given very specific direction, on pain of death, as to what talisman they will be requesting and giving to the nobility. The age of granting is not 16, it is the youngest someone can reliably repeat their noble's order for a talisman. It's even younger in a failing state when the nobles get desperate.

The nobility will be incredibly powerful, because they'll have a super-powerful once-per-decade talisman for each hour of the day. Nobility will be immortal, if the talismans can affect longevity at all, otherwise hereditary.

The talismans the nobility request, however, will be so trivial they can be tested instantly, probably a mood ring. Think of old monarchies making alliances: they'd either explicitly swap family members as hostages or implicitly by marrying them off. The sending family would keep the hostage's talisman as a way to check in that that they're alive and in good health (or maybe even spy a bit).

Nobles will live like dragons on hoards of talismans. There will be a lot done to ensure that their guards are loyal (eg. talismans to detect and punish theft). Because they'll want use of more talismans than they can hold, they'll rarely leave. But they might lend out a large part of their hoard to their armies to go seige another noble for their hoard. Actually, yeah, seiges will probably never happen if (as you say elsewhere) meta-talismans are rare. Offensive talismans will be more powerful than defensive talismans, much like nowadays artillery is more powerful than castles - so nobody builds them. But a hoard of talismans is so dang useful... yeah, really turns on how many defensive talismans you can accumulate. If a lot, castles. If not, endless total war.

Fertility, reliable food, and maybe medicine (but not medical talismans used on plebs) are important to the nobles. Gotta keep the talismans working. You don't say if it's obvious look at a talisman if'll work or its creator has died, but that's a minor inconvenience for the noble: have a meta-talisman that detects dead talismans every so often.

They'll have telegrams, too. It's hard now to imagine life when major news moved at about 4 mph (see The Discovery of France for an exploration of this), but it took a lot of time for major news (death of the king, war, etc.) to pass by rider and minor news could take much longer. This society will just require some kids to get talismans that can be used as telegrams. Even if you find some way to tweak your setup so talismans are tradeable but there are no god-kings, every farming village would want this.

Actually, why not an assassination talisman? A noble orders a talisman that, when used, kills a specific named person to bump off a rival. Even if it's only useful once ever, that's fine, you get to kill that pesky rival without an invasion and then your guard puts the requestor to death - why waste fifty years of grain that could go to the peon who requested the talisman that keeps your fingernails manicured?

etc, etc, etc. Total crapsack world.
