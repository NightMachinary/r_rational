Trust me, there are in universe reasons for stuff like this being averted. I'm not going to into the majority of them here, but think- if people are afraid of nobles stealing their talismans, all they need to do is specify that only people who posses only that talisman can use it. Given a few years/bloody civil wars as the nobles lose the power of their talisman as their subjects get killed, and pretty soon power isn't so concentrated. Of course, the rich and wealthy will still hold disproportionate amounts of talismans, but not so many as to be able to transform the culture into a dystopia.

In the past things like this might have happened (haven't thought of much background) but the society has spent quite a while with talismans, and as we see in the real world, the living standards of the lower classes does have a tendency to improve over time.
