  alright, I've revised the balance system, but I'd still consider it incomplete. Could you tell me any other ways to make it better? Remember, my reason for making this is to keep players from creating OP talismans, but I'd still like a way for them to get a general idea what constitutes as "powerful" and what kinds of drawbacks their request would be likely to get.

(just reposting this statement across top level comments.)

As for the super-talisman thing, the general idea is that there are multiple top-level talismans which each do different things, one of which is the super-talismans used to create minor talismans. The implication is that they have been taken and warred over, and the reason each polity corresponds to a top level talisman is because polities without a top level talisman inevitably are out-competed by societies with a top level talisman. Note, however, the fact that i never implied that the top level talismans are balanced across each other, which implies that the societies with only one top level talisman that have stood against societies have comparatively more powerful talismans.

I admit, though, that I haven't really thought about international relations. I'm sure that polities would try to get people across to use gain the strengths of other talisman, although that'll naturally be mitigated by stuff like people having their appearances affected by which talisman they gain power from, and the individual restrictions of the top-level talismans.
