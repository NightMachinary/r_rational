So I just punted on the balancing thing and thought about how someone would build a culture around it.

In the doc you link you talk about there being a single super-talisman the rest are created from. Why didn't anyone build a wall around it and charge admission? Or sit on the road and rob people on their way out?

A talisman is /valuable/. Pople want and take valuable things from each other - not just by trade but by force. You have an economic/political problem, not a magical one. :)
