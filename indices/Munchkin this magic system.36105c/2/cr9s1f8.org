The balance mechanism is insufficiently specified.

That said, I'd look at effect magnification / reduction and talisman-effecting-talismans. A talisman that can only be used once recharged by one that's usable once per person recharged by one that's usable once per year recharged by one that's usable once per month... You see where I'm going.

A talisman that makes something X times stronger - supply with a stronger initial force, chain a bunch together... done.

A talisman that preserves a talisman after creator's brain-death. Again, chain it.
