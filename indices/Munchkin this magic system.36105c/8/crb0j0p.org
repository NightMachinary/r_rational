I request a Talisman of Instant Best Immortality. On activation, it grants the bearer (or the target, possibly) a form of immortality that lets them retain the physical age they most prefer and allows them to commit suicide. This would naturally have many limitations -- perhaps it could only be used once every hundred years, for instance. However, if everyone requests one until there's enough immortality to go around, we'll be golden.

If the restriction requires certain circumstances, like it can only be used during a solar eclipse, then there's going to be some interesting scheduling going on, and people will have to take that into account when choosing to give birth. So we'll probably also need contraception amulets.

  A talisman ceases to function immediately after the brain death of its creator.

Then we need to make sure that the people creating these immortality-granting talismans stay alive. So let's change "suicide" to "permanent dreamless sleep".

  That is to say, the talisman granter will adjust the power of the same class of talismans over time. centuries ago, a fire-granting talisman would be a lot more useful, and therefore have larger drawbacks. With easier access to firestarters, fire granting talismans are comparatively less useful, so they lose some of their drawbacks.

We can use various rejuvenation, disease-curing, and injury-healing talismans to reduce the cost of the immortality amulets. If you're mostly guaranteed not to die of a disease or a not-instantly-fatal accident for three to five hundred years, immortality isn't quite as valuable, comparatively. This is going to be a small effect.

  That is to say, wording matters, but intention will still carry through. If you ask for "a shirt that improves speed" and you think that a shirt that improves speed just make you magically a faster runner, wearing the shirt will improve you speed, but because you'd realize speed =/= velocity
#+end_quote

Sure, if you're speaking in physics jargon. If you're speaking in common English, speed and velocity are synonyms. So is the talisman going to choose the least convenient or most precise jargon available and assume you're speaking that? Or is it going to deliberately screw you over with potentially not-quite-synonyms?
