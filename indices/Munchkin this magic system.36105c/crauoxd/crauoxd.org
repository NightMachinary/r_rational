Do talismans last forever?

I can imagine that there'd be ancient ultra-powerful talismans, from before people realized how powerful it would be. For example, perhaps someone asked for a weather control talisman for what little effect the weather has on hunting, and then later on farming was invented. Or maybe someone decided that they want to be able to move stars around so that they could write their name in the sky, and then later people find out those stars are gigantic balls of fire.

Now that I mention that last one, I suspect someone would pick something stupid that gets everyone killed. Like maybe they wish to be able to take stars out of the sky, not realizing how big they are.
