I have not read all the other replies, but one aspect not addressed in your edited version is this: How does a talisman know to stop working when the maker dies? Is there a master control somewhere that can arbitrarily shut off talismans and only does so when the maker dies? Or does the soul/'magic' of the maker fuel the existence of the talisman, and stops doing so when they die? If so, what is the mechanism here? It doesn't resume upon revival you said, implying the connection (if there is one) can snap or close. Would it be possible (In the way atom bombs were 'possible' in Ancient Greece) to break the connection without killing the maker? Or to tap into the connection and fuel a talisman using someone else's magic? Or to pool several people's magic into one talisman?
