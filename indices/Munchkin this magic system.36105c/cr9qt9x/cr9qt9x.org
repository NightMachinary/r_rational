The key is probably figuring out how this balancing system works and then exploiting its weak points. Can the balancing system make mistakes? The implication is that it doesn't take into account how two (or more) talismans can be combined, so that's at least one avenue of attack. Finding the function by which power is capped is supremely important; utility, lethality, energy output? There's some intelligence behind the handicapping, which means that it can be gamed to some extent, at least if we assume that the talismans are reasonably consistent in how or what they limit.

Leaving that aside (because that's not your actual question), I would expect a society to:

- Create an index of "known talismans" which most people are encouraged to draw from, to lower the costs associated with people trying to figure out the limitations of their talismans, and prevent them from creating "dud" talismans whose limitations are so restrictive that they're never known (and the talisman is thus never used).
- Create standardized talismans. If there are a hundred talismans that all operate effectively the same, training people to use them is easier, and a replacement can always be procured. A prerequisite for quickly teaching people how to use something is ensuring that the tool always functions the same way.
- Put talisman creation and distribution under control of the state. It's all well and good for people to want their own talisman, but there's not much practical reason to allow that. Have people create a specific talisman at the age of sixteen, then take that talisman from them and hand it over to a soldier as part of their "kit".
- Because they stop working on brain death, talismans can be used for long-distance communication, though only in simple binary, and then with a bit of noise. Still probably useful.
