I think powering talismans down to the point where one talisman can't feed and water two people per day is a little silly. Compared to D&D-level effects, that is really very little effort. And at that point, keeping factory farms of people becomes a reality.

Assuming talismans aren't worth a dirt farmer's lifetime work output is another huge stretch. I can't see how reality bending magic wouldn't be worth a single peasant locked in a tiny jail cell compared to them working a field. And if you already have an overpopulation problem, the opportunity cost is even lower.

Also, allowing them to continue dirt farming, with the associated dangerous and relatively short life, could mean a magic item disappearing at a very inconvenient time. Much safer and easier to stuff them all in holes, get /other/ peasants to work the fields, then with farmed talismans cast simple healing spells every week and feed and water daily. Magic restraints or stasis would be nice, but not required. Especially when you can build and excavate with magic.

/Modern/ prisons are expensive. Magic, inhuman, medieval prisons, if at all possible, are almost just the cost of labor.
