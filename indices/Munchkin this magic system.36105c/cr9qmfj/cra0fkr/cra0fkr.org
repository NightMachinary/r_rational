To get a crapsack world like that I think you have to make some assumptions about how powerful a talisman actually is. Keeping a person alive is expensive, even if you're just doing the bare minimum. If you're keeping someone in chains, you still have another mouth to feed. Because you can't be cavalier about their death, you have to take at least moderately good care of them, which means some overhead associated with this operation.

If the costs associated with keeping a person chained up in a dungeon aren't exceeded by the benefits of their talisman, a rational person wouldn't keep people locked up. If you can just take their talisman for yourself, then there's not much point making them slaves anyway; better to have them as laborers working the fields, because it's not like they can get their talismans back from men in suits of armor, sharp swords, and a talisman monopoly.

So sure, if a talisman's upper limits allow it to produce enough food to feed a handful of people indefinitely, maybe you get people in dungeons. Otherwise, I don't really see it - keeping people in prisons is expensive, and labor is valuable.
