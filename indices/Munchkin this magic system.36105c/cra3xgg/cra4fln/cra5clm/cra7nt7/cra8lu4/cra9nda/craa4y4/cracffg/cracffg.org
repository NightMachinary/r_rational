You misunderstand. There's only one super talisman that makes new talismans. The rest do stuff like, for example, significantly increase the longevity of people who use them, or, I don't know, give +2 to intelligence. The talisman-granting talisman is in the hands of a single nation, so if they notice an internal threat, they can just prevent anyone with a connection to Phil from obtaining talismans. Sure, phil can gain a lot of power, and potentially (with careful planning) institute his own phil-ocracy, but he wouldn't do it unopposed, whether by others in the nation who would rather "Bob" be the great leader of the nation, by the current government (which, instituted by people sick and tired of people named phil trying to take over the world, would naturally have countermeasures) or by the simple fact that a talisman who's purpose is exclusively to negate the effects of a single other talisman is by definition less useful (since the change in utility of the person who possesses the talisman can only be equal to the potential utility of the talisman, and is invariable smaller because the person with the specific-talisman-negation talisman first has to find the original talisman) and would therefore have fewer (if any) restrictions on use added for balancing purposes.

Thanks for making me think, though. This is definitely turning into a useful discussion :)
