Your society has talismans for practical tasks like lighting candles and turning clockwork, and it has mercantile guilds, and emerging democratic notions. It has clever clockpunk and spunky heroines and taverns bursting with quest hooks.

Phil the living god has five thousand soldiers willing to die for him, each carrying their own magic missile taslisman. Phil also has magical artillery.

How long, in days, does it take before Phil has two super-talismans? (Hint: it's the number of days it takes to march from Phil's to yours.)
