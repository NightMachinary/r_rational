I've been turning it over in my head, and I think maybe we've talked past each other because talismans are such a fun idea and you want your clockpunks, so they don't seem like a commodity. Let's get more obvious:

Imagine a world in which every 16 year old is given $10,000 by visiting a super-talisman in a specific place. They can request the form it'll take: maybe gold bullion, dollars, a check, a jewel, etc. There may be tradeoffs: maybe they end up getting $1,040 dollars once per year for ten years (or whatever, I'm not doing the Net Present Value calculation), or maybe their jewel is unpolished and needs finishing, whatever - the magical system autobalances it so everyone gets exactly $10,000 worth of value. In other places with other super-talismans maybe you can only get specific money-related things like an +1 point on your checking account's interest rate or -5% to your credit card's rate. Through some magical handwavey process (capitalism), even these limited bonuses can be transferred to other people.

Now let's imagine how society incorporates this phoenomenon, and keep in mind that the value of these compounds: if I have ten people's $10k, I can offer you more for your "$10k over 10 years" and have a tighter profit margin (or just hire more guys to take it from you).

What percentage of these 16 year olds have their $10k ten years later? A year later? A week later? The society will extract that from them, fast, whether it looks voluntary ("throw yourself an adulthood party!", "buy your guild apprenticeship", "make the down payment on your house", "you get to pay off your childhood debt today") or mandatory ("it's a tribute to Phil", "your money or your life", "we're going to borrow your kid for a week and take them to the super-talisman"). People don't just leave valuable things in other people's hands, especially not in the hands of inexperienced kids.

Your talisman system has 90% the same problems as this setup (that 10% is the "it stops working when you're dead"). Getting talismans compounds how easy it is for you to get more talismans. In a medieval low-tech low-institutional-trust world, this looks like warfare, religion, theft.

Extra credit version: in /our/ world, every 16 year old is given this commodity in the form of their future labor as soon they are no longer considered restricted child labor. Explain how society has commodified and extracted this talisman with an eye towards our stunning inequality in wealth. Course textbooks: On The Wealth of Nations, Das Kapital, Samuelson's Economics.
