  So you explicitly asked for folks to munchkin your rules and then left out rules? Thanks for wasting everyone's time.

I fail to see how people are unable to munchkin them. autobalancing effects individual talismans- an "indestructable" sword might only be indestructible between 8-10 pm, but, say, an indestructible cup might be indestructible all the time. I've mentioned that meta-talismans are inherently powerful, and therefore get autobalanced based on how strongly they interact with other talismans, but that still allows your indestructible cup and a magic-fire-generating talisman to combine into a directional rocket engine.

That being said, your story is pretty interesting, and I can definitely see the existence of cults based on a single person whose acquired a great deal of talismans. Here's a link to the planning document I wanted to use for the RP for you to get a bit more information on the talismans. [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/15SnoRbLM1PhhqzCdjbviO4h9njcqJleNRr38QI-XoW4/edit?usp=sharing]] You have raised some good points, and I've admitted myself that the balancing system needs to be re-evaluated, so i'm looking for advice.
