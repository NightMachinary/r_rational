So you explicitly asked for folks to munchkin your rules and then left out rules? Thanks for wasting everyone's time.

And you're wrong. When I say "noble", don't think "prince", think "living deity". Nobody would told they can restrict their talisman to themself. Let's have a story:

You're a young man growing up in the city not too far from the capital. Your whole society worships one god, Phil. Phil is a loving, wonderful god, not like the scummy, wretched gods of faraway states. Your parents worship Phil devoutly. They bring you up to love and respect Phil. They tell you stories of when Phil visited the local cathedral (I mean, Phil laid the capstone three hundred years ago, but his /latest/ visit) and bestowed blessings on the people: Phil cured a blind child, gifted wonderful crafts, and righteously slew a murderer with magical fire. This visitation was one of the highest moments in their entire life.

You are looking forward to your talisman ceremony more than any kid has ever looked forward to a bar mitzvah or christening or thread ceremony because Phil is so obvious, so real, you can still see the scorch marks on the wall of the cathedral! It's a few feet to the left of the gallows where they hang the wicked children who fail in their talisman ceremony and have to be ritually sacrificed lest the entire town be tainted by their curse.

The ceremony is a mystery - I mean, everyone knows that afterwards you'll get your adult name and be of majority and you'll go to heaven after you die (which won't be for a while, Phil's really looking out for you). But what happens in the talisman ceremony? Nobody talks about it, but you know you and the other kids your age will go to the church where the priest (who performs minor miracles by the grace of Phil, peace be upon him) will lead the ceremony.

Finally the big day comes - for the first time you get to wear the robes all adults wear to church. Your father saved up months to buy the cloth and you've seen your mom working late into the night to sew them. They're obviously not blessed yet, but you're excited just to be wearing them - maybe you run down to the town's mirror to admire yourself, careful not to get them dirty. But still, you arrive early to the cathedral, can't be late for the big day. After the week's usual ceremony you and your friends are all called up on stage and everyone makes a big fuss over you. Then you head downstairs, and the priest tells you that it's time to make a special prayer to Phil. Flavio, that annoyingly preachy devout kid, gets to go first (and the rest of you go in The Order of Asch, which just means most-devoted first, for some reason). He reads the words over a talisman and after the priest listens and receives the talisman, he bestows the blessing of Phil and Flavio glows with a miraculous, unearthly light! His robes are marked by the light, recording his blessing for all to see at church every week. Flavio is sent upstairs to be received by the congregation, who will see proof of his devotion to Phil - why, you can already hear their cheering!

Now it's your turn, and you receive a scroll to read, asking for - I don't know, something about manicuring fingernails? But you know it doesn't matter what it says, it's time to prove your devotion by reading it. Your whole life has been leading up to this moment and you're about to become a man! What do you do for your god Phil?
