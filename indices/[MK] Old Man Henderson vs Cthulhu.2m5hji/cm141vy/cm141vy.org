There's munchkinry that comes from thinking outside the plot (like [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2lyuhh/mk_that_guy_destroys_psionics/][here]]), and then there's munchkinry that comes from roleplaying so hard that you accidentally break the universe. This is a story of the latter type, about a Vietnam-scarred old man who just wants to get his lawn gnomes back.

This story is the original inspiration for [[http://1d4chan.org/wiki/The_Henderson_Scale_of_Plot_Derailment][the Henderson Scale of Plot Derailment]]. Quite a long read, but definitely worth it, especially if you like chaos and dislike apocalypse-inducing Elder Gods.
