  The chances of someone handwriting that I figure has to be super fucking low.

Agreed, but that's what it says.

  Yeah but I didn't want to be convinced of that. Am I not in the rational subreddit? Suspension of disbelief is a thing, the whole enjoyment of the story comes from not being "Well this is didn't happen", it's from believing it and being immersed in it like with any fiction.

Sure. And I'm fairly sure that this really did happen in some form, and equally sure that there are some serious exaggerations in there - the writer says that the GM was bad enough to prompt him into creating Henderson, but the scenarios seem well thought-out and the GM roll with Henderson's antics as much as he can, so he can't be that bad. I imagine there really was a character named Henderson who killed Hastur in a /Trail of Cthulu/ game - but the GM was laughing along the entire time and probably fudging rolls like crazy to keep him alive.

The notion that WaffleHouseMillionaire actually wrote an eldritch tome of insanity as his character's backstory is ridiculous, but the story does have a ring of truth to it.
