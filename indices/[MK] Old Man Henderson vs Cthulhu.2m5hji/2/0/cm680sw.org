#+end_quote

320 pages written over the course of a week? It'll be unreadable nonsense at best. And it's handwritten, there's no digital copy.

Unless you're just asking because you want some sort of "proof" that it all happened as described, in which case... no, it didn't. You've already convinced yourself of that much.
