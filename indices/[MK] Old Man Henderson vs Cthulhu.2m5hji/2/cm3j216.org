  I know for fact he only knows like two words in German, while I'm kinda fluent.

Come the fuck on, there's a suspension of disbelief in the story, the reason it's interesting is because you can feasibly imagine it happened. 320 page backstory is a first glaring thing, people will wonder if that's legit. Other things about the story you can be like "Well, that could happen with the rules or with a GM using rule of cool", and I'm sure those familiar with the ruleset wouldn't get that joy and would probably be (more or less) convinced.

This happens a lot with internet stories and things like that, it's like once you've made up a tiny slightly reasonable if unlikely story, then boom he's cured cancer.

Maybe it's because I've worked on phones, but what Detective answers his phone as his fucking office that's put in the damn phone book under Detective's Office with anything other than: "You're through to Private Detective Bob what can we do"
