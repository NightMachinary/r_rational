I just hang around literotica's tag cloud or the kristen archive on asstr. Sometimes mcstories or once in a while [[/r/gonewildstories]] or [[/r/eroticliterature/]]

Also storiesonline is pretty good, but you need an account and I refuse to sign up for one and just use whatever login details are shared on bugmenot, and there hasn't been a usable account there for like 6 months.
