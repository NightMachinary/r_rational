The lady we bought the place from brought a family friend with her to help out (I'm not exactly sure why, she may have been 85 years old, but she was still sharp as a tack and the only reason she was moving was because her friends couldn't handle the stairs any more), so in the lull where my mother was signing documents and nobody else was (long story short, once I get out of school, have a job where I earn real money, and have a credit score from paying utilities we will refinance so the mortgage is in my name), we got to talking and the subject of my TOTALLY NORMAL AND NOT AT ALL ADDICTIVE relationship with Magic came up.

Turns out, our escrow officer also plays Magic a lot. She wouldn't talk about it at work, but she did write her personal number on the back of her business card and give it to "us."

Our realtor (a family friend) noted that he had never once seen that happen. I do not think he was totally oblivious on the subject, though. However, it's a toss-up whether my mother was. She vies with me for "most oblivious sapient being in the universe" on the regular.

I have called once, to no response. I will probably try again in a few days.
