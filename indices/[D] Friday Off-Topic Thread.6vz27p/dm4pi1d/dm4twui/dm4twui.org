... why is a car trying to save humans at the expense of animals/property considered to be such a newsworthy item? Like, I admittedly live in a road safety bubble (safe systems! towards zero! forgiving roads!), but... wouldn't that be the obvious thing you want cars to do, right?

The "self driving cars ethical conundrum" to me is the "should it save the 1 driver or the family of 5 on the footpath", which is easy to do trolley problem style but the thought of my car wanting to kill /me/ instead of 5 random jerks is not comforting (though the thought of someone else's car wanting to save them instead of my entire family is also not comforting).
