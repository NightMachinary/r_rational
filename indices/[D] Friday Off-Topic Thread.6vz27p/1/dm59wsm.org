As of Friday morning at 11AM, my name is now on the deed of a building. This is a very strange experience, and I do feel a bit like that xkcd comic where the girl wonders who in their right mind would trust her with a building. Also I went back to school this week, so that is overlapping with moving because having many stressful, life-changing events happen at once seems excellent.

Also, I got the number of a girl without fishing for it, which is incredibly weird. Weirder was that she was the person walking my parents and I through signing the stacks of paperwork, and it's all thanks to Magic: the Gathering.

My day was surreal.
