My parents live in a parsonage, and thus aren't building up equity. It's also several states away from me, and they have to go to meetings here on a semi-regular basis (on top of wanting to visit me occasionally). By buying a house, they fix both of those problems.

The current plan is that, once I have a job (and a credit score), we will refinance the mortgage in my name. Then, once my parents retire, we will either split the price or I will pay them for what they put into it so they can have a good down payment on something.

On the other thing, Magic came up in one of the lulls where my mom was signing mortgage paperwork and nobody else was doing anything. It just so happened that our escrow officer walking us through all the paperwork also plays a lot of Magic. She couldn't talk about it at work, so she gave us her cell number. I am somewhat certain my mother was totally oblivious as to what was happening there.

One call has been made, to no answer. I will probably try again either today or tomorrow.
