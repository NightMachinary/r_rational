"Trapped mind project" releases a book every few months and spoiler after the first bit its hyperscifi non-vr but still very litrpg

Its the only series I know of that the author keeps up with my hunger, not the best writing but... well I keep up

There was a very good one where the gods have death traps of "towers" for humans to go through to get magic and the main guy is fairly smart, where the gods don't like you "cheating" but "cheating" gets you the good magic so he's cheats somewhat carefully, name escapes me
