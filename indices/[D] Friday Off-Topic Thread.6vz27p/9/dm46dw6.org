Any recommendations for LitRPG that's not VR?

I've read The Games We Play, Everybody Loves Large Chests, The Arcane Emperor, Awaken Online, and The Gam3. I enjoyed the first three way more than the latter two. I'd check out works with a VR setting but mostly if you consider them way better than those last two.
