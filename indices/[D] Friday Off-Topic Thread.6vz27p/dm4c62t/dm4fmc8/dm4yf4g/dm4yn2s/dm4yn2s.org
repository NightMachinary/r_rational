I think for this show each season is meant to change the central focus. Season one is a subversion of romantic comedies and their tropes, season two is [[#s][s]] and season three seems to be headed in the direction of [[#s][s]].

So some of the variability there comes from the strength of the season premise. This is probably also the case for other shows that want to /actually/ move things forward instead of staying in perpetual stasis.
