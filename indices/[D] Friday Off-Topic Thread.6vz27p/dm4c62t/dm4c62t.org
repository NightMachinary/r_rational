Today I'm going to attempt the impossible: convincing readers of [[/r/rational]] that they should watch a CW musical comedy.

Crazy Ex-Girlfriend is a show about a smart yet unbalanced woman who moves away from her high status job in Manhattan to pursue her ex-boyfriend from high school in California ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57ZDNuakBsQ][the first song of the show]] is actually a good taste of what you're in for). The show is relentlessly satirical of typical rom-com cliches. Additionally, while the show's characters are all irrational, it is in consistent ways that all get explored by the show (in this regard, I'd compare it to Bojack Horseman). The first two seasons are up on Netflix, with a confirmed third on the way.

The interesting thing about musicals is that they are uniquely suited to exploring the complexities of a single moment. There are lots of times in rational fiction where a character wishes they had more time to think things through, but things are moving too quickly. Musicals are able to sidestep this issue by stretching a single moment into a song, whereas a nonmusical equivalent would require an out-of-place monologue.

Again, I wouldn't call this show rational. That said, some of the songs are at least a very responsible dissection of irrationality. For example, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMY0MTTv16E][this send-up of dude rock]] is all about the main character planning on playing in a ping pong tournament, and hoping that her performance will win over the object of her affections. With the song, there's a chance to look at the absurdity of what it is she's hoping for.

Now, to anticipate reasons you might not like it: 1) it's a CW show, so not as high-budget or polished as other shows. 2) it's a musical, with two songs per episode, and I know that's not everyone's cup of tea. That said, I think it's rad, and woefully underrated.
