I'm four episodes into JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Phantom Blood and I'm already hooked. I know the first arc has issues and the series gets much better later on, but it is already pandering to cliches I like while also giving me things I never knew I wanted. I always thought fans of the show were being overly vague about what they liked about it, only to find out that I have trouble explaining why I like it. I've always enjoyed serial stories that start off with a simple premise only to go completely gonzo as more weirdness is introduced, but I've never seen it done in a story that wasn't a comedy like Sluggy Freelance, madcap stream-of-conscious like Axe Cop, or a goofy kids show like Dragon Ball. I fear I may never be the same after watching this series.

JoJo has a style that's all its own. Every single image leaps off the screen, I've never seen so many colors and textures in a frame at once. Even in darkness I get to see 10 shades of dark blue and green, and a house fire is drawn in purple for one shot just to add visual variety. The effect is only heightened by the unbelievably hammy acting, which the English dub gets down perfectly. I don't think I've ever seen animated characters compete over who can chew the most scenery, but these men seem determined to dramatically pose each other to death and it will never stop being entertaining. These are the kinds of things that normally made for "so bad, it's good" media, but I never get the feeling that I like this show ironically.

I can't remember the last time I watched a show were finishing one episode made me want to watch the next one this badly. It's starts as a cartoonishly over the top melodrama, then becomes a gentlemanly Victorian pulp, then adds in some gory gothic horror with vampires, and when I last checked it's now about magical martial artists fighting monsters. And that's just the first four episodes. I need to see what happens next! Even if it's more of what I've already seen, I'd be fine with that. I know the next part of the arc has crap pacing, but I don't think I'll care since I'm already addicted. I tried to apply logic to the show at first, and my enjoyment of it, but the more I watch the less I care because whatever the hell JoJo is, I want more of it.
