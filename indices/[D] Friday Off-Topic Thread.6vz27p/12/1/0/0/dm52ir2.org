[[https://www.fanfictiondownloader.net/#/home][Here's the downloader I use.]] I'm glad to hear you'll be checking this out, in the time since I posted my original recommendation the story had only gotten better. It isn't afraid to have characters deal with darker problems, which the author has personal experience with, but the development they go through as a result of it continues to make me feel hope in the face of adversity.
