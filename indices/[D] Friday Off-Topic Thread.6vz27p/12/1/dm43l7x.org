My full pitch for What I Learned at SRU is [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6ffjma/monthly_recommendation_thread/dijbsfe][here]], but it's easily one of the most consistently relaxing and life-affirming stories I've ever read. It has enough surface-level appeal from the slice of life to put me in a trance, while still having enough subtly to its characters to occupy my wandering thoughts. I don't like rereading books, so it helps a lot that this story is really long and really easy to pick up and put down.
