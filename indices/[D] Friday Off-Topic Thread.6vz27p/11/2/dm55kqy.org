[[https://www.literotica.com/s/three-square-meals-ch-01][Three Square Meals]] is really interesting. It's an epic-length adventure story (> 1M words) with one of the most impressive character arcs I've read.

At the start, the main character is a random space merchant. And the initial chapters come off as a bit of generic sci-fi porn.

Then, a couple chapters in, I started noticing some apparent "continuity errors". (eg "Wait, did character really look like that?")

Going forward, you realize that the "errors" are entirely intentional, and part of an oddly-detailed backstory for the universe. Some of the apparently throw-away details in the first chapters turn out to be relevant 400k words later.

And, at some point, you realize that the generic "sex on a boat, but in space" story has spiraled off into a huge, impressive epic.
