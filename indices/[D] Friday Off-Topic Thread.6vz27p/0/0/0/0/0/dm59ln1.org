First, the formatting on your spoilers is messed up, or at least it wasn't showing up at all for me on mobile or desktop.

Second, I think I mostly agree with you about season 2 not being as good. I will say that I think season 2 had both higher highs and lower lows. For example, I thought that the song in season 2 that was in the style of 60's music was the epitome of what the show had to offer, to the point that I seriously considered saying "fuck it" regarding spoilers and linking it. On the other hand, "Man Nap" was a special kind of awful.

I think the biggest issue with season 2 is that, instead of one big arc like season 1, it was three smaller arcs, which ended up making the show seem a bit directionless. All that said, I have high hopes for season 3.

ETA: I think the formatting issue is that you need something between the brackets when doing a spoiler.
