I listen to long podcasts, because it's about the only time I can sit (or lay down) and listen to something for hours without feeling like I'm wasting my time. When I'm sick my job is to do nothing, so that my body can get on with repairing itself, so I don't feel guilty.

I prefer Dan Carlin's Hardcore History but he doesn't publish those as often as I get sick (not that I get sick very often, but he publishes even less frequently) and I haven't gotten around to buying his archived episodes.
