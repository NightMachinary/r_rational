I screwed my sleep schedule all to pieces and woke up yesterday at 5 in the afternoon, so I decided the best way to keep myself awake after 9am (when my body would naturally be ready to fall asleep) would be to be in the middle of doing something time-consuming but low-effort.

So, I decided to watch all 8 Harry Potter movies.

I skipped forward a /lot/ during CoS and pushed through that 2.5 hour movie in just under an hour (I recently read the first 3 books (I didn't continue with the rest because I just read the whole series like 6 or 9 months ago and I just feel like it's too soon, so I abandoned it for /the Book of the Long Sun/ by Gene Wolfe (which you can read for free at openlibrary.org)) and I couldn't bear to sit through the plodding nothingness of that plot again so soon)... I confused myself with the parentheses, so we're going to move on.

At the moment, I have Goblet of Fire paused. I'd forgotten how terrible it is.

This might change, but I'm pretty sure I think the movies rank as follows, from worst to best:

#8: Chamber of Secrets

#7: Goblet of Fire

#6: Sorcerer's Stone

#5: Order of the Phoenix

#4: Deathly Hollows Pt. 1

#3: Half-Blood Prince

#2: Deathly Hollows Pt. 2

#1: Prisoner of Azkaban

If anyone wants to agree or argue with the ranking I've presented, I probably won't continue the conversation until tomorrow because I have over 8 hours of movie left to push through, and then I'm going to sleep for hopefully like 9 or 10 hours (for reference, it's currently half past noon where I live).

Harry Potter and the ABC Family Movie Special

Harry Potter and.. OMFG, in /WHAT/ Universe Would Lucius Malfoy EVER Try to Murder Harry Effin' Potter When He's Only, Like, /10 Feet Away From Dumbledore's Office?!??/

Harry Potter and the Best Cinematography and Score in the Entire Series

Harry Potter and the Inexplicable Decision to Cut Everything EXCEPT the Sports Competition

Harry Potter and the Sociopathic Bitch

Harry Potter and the Awesome Scene Where Dan Radcliffe Interprets "Felix Felicis" As "Wizard Cocaine"

Oh hell, while I'm here I might as well rate the books.

Hmm... That's pretty close to reverse chronological. Weird.
