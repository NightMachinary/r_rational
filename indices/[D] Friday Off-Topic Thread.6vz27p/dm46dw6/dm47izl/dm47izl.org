Worth The Candle on here is pretty good.\\
Dice: The Cube that changes everything is a manhwa that puts a neat spin on the LitRPG genre, namely, what if everyone had the gamer power, and were working against each other to achieve a common goal? Also technically not LitRPG, but I quite enjoyed [[http://royalroadl.com/fiction/11397/the-dao-of-magic][The Dao of Magic]], recently posted here, as it shows how an intelligent MC can figure out a magic system from first principles and become absurdly powerful quite fast, while still maintaining a goal to build up to, yet not taking itself too seriously. Hope these help scratch the itch!
