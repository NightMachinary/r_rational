I gave up about halfway through. There was a /lot/ that was just plain bad in that first half though. Some of it comes from trying to compress a complex plot down to a 100 minute runtime, which I'm at least a little sympathetic to, but most of it comes from a fundamental misunderstanding of what made the original compelling.

And yeah, part of that comes from the fact that the original was at least making an attempt at being a fair play mystery, if not rational fiction, with a focus on thought and the consequences of thought.

There's a part near the start of the second act where [[#s][spoilers]] That shows basically all the hallmarks of a non-thinking work of fiction, or at least a non-thinking protagonist.

Light's primary motivation, at least up until the point where I stopped watching, basically became "I want to get laid".
