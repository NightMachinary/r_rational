I actually did end up finishing it, mostly because I think if you're going to talk shit about a creative work you should make some effort to see all of it before dumping on it. So I've been asking myself "how can they so thoroughly ruin something" for most of today.

*Spoilers for Death Note follow:*

--------------

If you're taking an ~800 minute anime down to a ~100 minute movie, you need to cut a bunch of stuff. What they /should/ have done was to cut almost everything that wasn't about Light and L. Near and Mello, gone. Misa, gone. FBI stuff, mostly out, along with most of the internal police force stuff. Keep in a B-plot of Light and his father, but put the primary focus on that /single/ dynamic.

Instead, this movie was /largely/ about Light and Misa (renamed to Mia). Light gets changed to be a loser with a tragic past and reason to hate criminals that "get away with it", Mia is this sociopathic cheerleader that likes the power and meaning that come from killing and wants the Death Note for herself, and everyone gets dumbed down because the writer wasn't smart enough for a smart plot. The climax of the movie is about Light and Mia, not Light and L.

The real question is why the writer of the screenplay decided to do it like this. My /guess/ is that it was either market research, or the crappy cousin to market research, producers and directors making guesses about what the market wants without actual focus testing.

I can imagine people in a room talking about making this film and saying, "But we have to give him motivation for killing people, otherwise he's too unsympathetic! Let's make it so his mom was killed by a mob boss who got off on a technicality!" or saying "Light can't kill police officers, it has to be Mia so he can be the sympathetic".

A lot of misunderstandings of the source material, combined with trying to compact things down, and I'm sure this turd of a movie cost millions of dollars to make, so it's amazing to me that they get so much about basic storytelling wrong. But it happens a lot in Hollywood.
