  am I sleeping on something really great here by having my weird "purity as a terminal value" attitude?

You're certainly weird, but also, drugs can interact unexpectedly with specific indivduals' brain chemistry. After what happened to a certain blood relative, for instance, I am never touching strong hallucinogens. Ever.

Besides, those things would make the voices in my head waaaaaaay too close to independent multiple personalities. Can't have that.
