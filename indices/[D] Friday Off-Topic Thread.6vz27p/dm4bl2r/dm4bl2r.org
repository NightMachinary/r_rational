After ScottAlexander's post on slatestarcodex about Nootropics, and my own battles with depression/anxiety, I decided to look into building a nootropic stack to help me out.

My biggest issue with my depression, is sleep. Thus, I decided to tackle that with:

5g of: [[https://www.ceretropic.com/adrafinil-powder]]

On top of that, I wanted to try something which would help me in my studies, so I bought:

[[https://www.ceretropic.com/solution-sample-pack]]

Lastly, out of curiosity, I purchased 10g of:

[[https://liftmode.com/yohimbine-hcl-10-grams-0-35-oz-98-pure-fblm.html]]

Adrafinil /freaking works/. I went from falling asleep about 2 pm to going all day without getting drowsy. It's not a standard caffeine stimulant, however. Additionally, something else in the stack is working really well, because I went from holding a neutral face 24/7 to smiling naturally for the first time in months.

As far as Yohimbine goes, it pumps my heartrate up from a resting 75 to resting 95 heartrate. It's clearly a stimulant.

If you're looking for an energy so you can actually make it through the day, or starting graveyard and want a little more oomph, I highly, highly recommend picking up Adrafinil/Modafinil or Yohimbine.

That said, review the effects noted on examine.com, and see if they provide what you want.
