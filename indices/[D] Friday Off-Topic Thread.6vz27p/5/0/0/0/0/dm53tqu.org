I just finished watching it as well, and only forced myself through the last half for the same reasons as you (and because the casting of Willem Defoe was so excellent, I felt obliged to give it a chance).

I agree with all your points - as far as a retelling of the Death Note story (or even just a sensible, enjoyable movie in general), it was godawful.

*Unless...*what if it's a /parody/, of what Death Note would have been like if America/Hollywood had written it?

Consider how over-the-top dumb, and/or cliche teen action-drama, the story is...(*/spoilers for Netflix's Death Note below/*)

- Light skims over all the rules, because "they're boring" and "there are so many"
- One of Light's first uses of the Note to impress a girl he barely knows, and he instantly trusts her and tells her everything about it
- Light makes NO attempt to plan ahead or hide himself - so L actually figures out Kira's in Seattle right away, and then a few days later more or less 100% knows it's Light
- Light's father impedes the investigation and stops L from capturing Light, because he can't believe that his son's guilty (contrast that to Light's father in the original Death Note, who was completely willing to trust and follow L once he understood the logic behind his decisions, and was willing to actually kill his son and then himself if the investigation showed Light was Kira)
- Light's /only/ attempt to figure out L's identity was to write down "Watari figures out who L is, tells me, then dies." It's the laziest, sloppiest attempt to beat L possible. And after that fails, Light completely stops trying.
- Instead of a psychological game of cat and mouse, L and Light's final showdown is a frickin /footrace chase scene through downtown Seattle/
- Instead of finding evidence and definitive proof of Light's guilt, L just has an emotional breakdown and decides to shoot Light with a gun

If they used most of this script, and instead made a comedy/parody (a commentary on the terrible writing in Hollywood teen action-dramas, through the lens of Death Note), it likely would have been way more enjoyable than what we got.

I just don't know who this version was for...the writers clearly wanted a different story than the original, so that fans of the original wouldn't know what's coming. But then they also left out all the tone/plot devices/psychological cat-and-mouse thriller elements that drew fans to the original Death Note in the first place. It's almost like a room of Hollywood writers played [[https://icebreakerideas.com/telephone-game/][the Telephone Game]] with the original DN story, except each one also added in one new dumb idea.
