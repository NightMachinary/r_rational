I've always been curious about trying modafinil, because my partner has a valid prescription for it so I have a very easy time of getting it.

But my other partner has a valid prescription for adderall so I'm a bit worried that there might be a slippery slope since I have access to basically two of the most desirable nootropics out there, and I have this weird "purity as a terminal value" sort of thing going on (i.e. I don't drink alcohol or do any drugs, and I don't take caffeine).
