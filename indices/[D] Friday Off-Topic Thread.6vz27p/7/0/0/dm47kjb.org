That news makes me happy because as much as I like that all the characters look like 80s action movie heroes in a glam rock-themed fashion show, even Victorian-era suits look /fabulous/, their proportions look a bit too much like Rob Liefeld's god awful character designs. The cartoony style saves them from looking disfigured the way Liefeld's do, but I'm glad they tone down the gigantism.
