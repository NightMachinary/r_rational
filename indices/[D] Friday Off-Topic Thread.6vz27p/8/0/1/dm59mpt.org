The whole point of that is moot though because a driverless car will demonstrably need to make such a decision far, far less often than a human driver. Even better, if it came to a deeply suboptimal conclusion you can hotfix the problem and push it to the entire fleet. You can't update human cognition. It doesn't matter if we are uncomfortable about the rare cases where a machine is arguably making life and death decisions because the technology saves far more lives than these corner cases could ever account for.
