I think the big difference is that all self driving cars would either prioritise the driver or prioritise the pedestrians as their "default setting", so instead of each "should I swerve into the wall or into that family?" decision being made in isolation by an individual (who could potentially be e.g. "I am 78 years old and have lung cancer, and they have a baby, so I will take my chances with the wall"), the decision is being made beforehand by a "cold hearted programmer" for every single one of the e.g. 1000 times it will happen.

When people get all shitty about this "trolley problem" IRL I point out it's such a hugely contrived scenario, when self driving cars are properly integrated in society they will no doubt have a network where they can share data on the road state (so a car 10km away will know that your family of 5 is enjoying their lovely walk long before it ever goes near you) and be able to act accordingly.
