So I thought about this some more, and when I thought over the prime examples of, specifically, highly successful YA, a major trope jumped out at me. I don't know what TvTropes might call this, but for now I'll call it the Attribution Error Trope.

Basically, as HPMOR points out pretty damn early, HP didn't do anything to earn his fame. When you look around, this is a common factor: the main character has something special about that that's "inherent" and/or unearned. Katniss (Hunger Games) is probably the most "earned", but she still ends up being more the rally /point/ for the rebels rather than the rebel herself. (Then again, I haven't actually read it that closely, sooo)

This strikes me as indicating an interesting desire for the YA audience: They want to be inherently special in some way that they can neither avoid nor lose.
