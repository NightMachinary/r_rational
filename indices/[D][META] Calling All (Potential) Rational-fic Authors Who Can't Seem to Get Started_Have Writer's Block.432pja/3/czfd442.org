I may be in progress of writing a novel which may be rational enough. I do enjoy lurking here. I also may be suffering to akrasia, procrastination and (therefore?) writer's block. I was thinking about publishing serial fiction, but I am afraid of licensing, since I may want to publish my works as a novel at some point in time...
