By most accounts, most writers worldbuild constantly, so they probably enjoy it as well. There's a reason one of the industry slogans is that ideas are cheap. Stephen King again (/On Writing/ is a spectacular book) anecdotally got the idea for /The Mist/ based on a shadow he saw out of the corner of his eye while walking home from the store. He also blasts loud music while he writes, which is usually something people do to reduce perception of time, which would seem to suggest that on the Want Like Approve continuum he wants to write and approves of it, but doesn't especially like it. This is backed up by his tendency (since kicked) to write drunk, which again reduces perception of time.
