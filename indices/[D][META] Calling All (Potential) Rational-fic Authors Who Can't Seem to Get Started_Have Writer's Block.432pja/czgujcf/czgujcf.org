I have an SI story I'm working on, which as yet is a paltry 2k words, but which I have storyboarded out in broad strokes to novel length.

It's based on a gaming world, and so it will be a combination of original content based on that world and published setting information. Having someone to beta read and help with in setting worldbuilding would definitely help with Book 1, which is set entirely withing that game's world.
