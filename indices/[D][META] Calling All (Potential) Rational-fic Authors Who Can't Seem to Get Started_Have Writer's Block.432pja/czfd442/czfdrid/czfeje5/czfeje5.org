That's a reason why I've decided to post stuff to [[/r/rational]] anyway - I have written stuff for nanowrimo but it was crap, objectively. I'm not a writer. (I've got all of my world in my head...) However, I enjoy to write and I enjoy world-building even more...Is there any correlation of an author preferring worldbuilding to just writing the story?
