I'd be [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month][pretty surprised]] if you could put a group of twelve authors together and increase speed on a fiction project. Even if it takes 9 months for 1 woman to produce a baby, it doesn't follow that 9 women working in concert can bring a baby to term in 1 month.

Without doing any research, I'd guess that having more than two people helping you write a novel doesn't help, and probably hurts, and even that, a team of three is a stretch. If you compartmentalized enough, you could make a team with a visionary/worldbuilder, a writer, and an editor, maybe.

I'd guess most of the time the real issue is getting over the initial hump of sitting down and writing. This is very difficult.
