I've got 3 stories in various stages of completion. I have Fall of Oso, I have Advent Signal, and I have the unnamed novel that takes place in the same world as Fall of Oso. I've not been able to do much work on my stuff recently, but if someone was willing to help me with it, I'd really like to see the stories continue. Send me a pm if you wanna help me out.

Fall of Oso takes place in the universe of Aeria, (here's a blog link: [[http://talesfromaeria.tumblr.com/]]) I kind of know where to take the story next, but I'm working right now on hammering out the wider metaplot that will cover the whole world. That's a lot more complicated then the comparatively local stuff I've done so far.
