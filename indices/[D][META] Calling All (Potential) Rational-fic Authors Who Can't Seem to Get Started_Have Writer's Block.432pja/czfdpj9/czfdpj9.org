Having someone to bounce ideas off of is a good thing to have in any even remotely creative endeavour. It's a wonderful way to fix creative blocks and tons of fun even if you aren't trying to worldbuild. Heck, sign me up too: if you want to bounce ideas off someone for worldbuilding etc, go ahead and PM me on reddit.
