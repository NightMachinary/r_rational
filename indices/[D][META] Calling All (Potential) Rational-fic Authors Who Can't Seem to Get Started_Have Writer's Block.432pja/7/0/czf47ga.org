Same, really. I need to reread HPMOR while taking notes on themes and plot arcs, and then do the same thing to A Certain Show, and then map the two together, and write some other stuff to get back in the hang of writing fiction, and then I need to set the world on fire before drafting and looking for a beta and eventually publishing.

Also getting a domain name not tied to my real name, and hosting for that. And probably a ffn account.
