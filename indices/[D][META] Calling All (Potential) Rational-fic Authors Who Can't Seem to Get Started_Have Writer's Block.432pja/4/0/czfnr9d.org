Also on MULTIPLE occasions the film and show industry has demonstrated that otherwise 'creative genius' creators often go to shit when their decoupled from critique and sanity checking.

This is not the ONLY situation that causes failures but I feel like there is a misconception that good works are created by genius springing fully formed from the heads of zeus and then restricted and corrupted by outside influence.

It's more that good work comes from good feedback loops of what is working and what is not.
