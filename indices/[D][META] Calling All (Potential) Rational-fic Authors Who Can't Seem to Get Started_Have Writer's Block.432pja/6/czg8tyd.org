I have a few ideas bouncing around my head, for original-but-inspired-by fiction. One thing I'm having trouble deciding is the type of story to go after - particularly, whether or not to aim for young adult, and then, what that means. YA novels have particular plot structures and archetypes (I think, basing this off HP, Hunger Games, Maze Runner, and that other one with four +houses+ I mean groups set in a semi-apocalypse future). Or maybe there's something to be taken from Name of the Wind, Lies of Locke Lamore, etc?

I guess there's the possibility for a deeper question here - what are classic plot structures, and how to do they respond to rational'ing?
