I like it. I think it's well written. I kind of like the changes from making Uchida female, makes things more interesting than just reiterating the interpersonal conflicts from the original. I don't think I could stand reading a Sakura POV story when she keeps fawning over Sasuke. My impression after the three told their ambitions: I like Sakuras ambition, it makes her (to me) a sympathetic character. It's kind of naive, but that promises character growth. As I remember, the ninjas in Naruto aren't really about helping people, so, how will Sakura react when she comes to a similar conclusion? And about Naruto: your Naruto promises to be less annoying than the canon one, that's good. On the other hand, right now, he seems to be the most boring of the three. I would expect to learn something about what motivates him, soon.

About the worldbuilding: I think trying to make sense of the world in Naruto is going to be challenging. The canon-world seems to be based more on bullshit than on rules. I don't doubt it's possible to make sense of the politics and magic (even if you have to make most things up from scratch). What I'm wondering about the most is: how do you make sense of the genin being essentially child soldiers? I would expect to read something about that in the TTS-style worldbuilding-blurbs. I can think of three ways to handle that (of course, they are not mutually exclusive).

The first: The society in your world has values that are very alien to us, which is why they are okay with child soldiering. I think I wouldn't like that approach, reading about a world of evil people. I think the canon-world, because it doesn't seem to address the problem at all, jumps in my impression very inconsistently between an evil society and a society very much like our own.

The second: There is some reason that they have to use children or teenagers. That's what happens in to the stars and evangelion. Aside from saying that you have to start training ninjas early, there doesn't seem to be much justification for this approach in the naruto-verse.

The third: They actually are treated as children. Any dangerous situation that the genin will be in, will mostly be a failure of the adults to protect them. That's the way HPMoR, the original HP and any child-detective stories do it. I think that's the approach that I like most. Something I really like about Full Metal Alchemist is that the protagonists are sometimes treated like children and the adults try to protect them. What /seems/ to contradict that approach in your story is the fact that Kakashi graduated the academy early to help the war efforts and Kakashi telling the genin that, them having graduated means that they are adults now.

Another worldbuildning challenge are the anachronisms. The canon doesn't make any sense in terms of what technology there is. If there are digital watches, I'd expect there to be tanks, airplanes, and bomb, too, and keeping around ninjas seems to me equivalent to keeping horses in the modern military.
