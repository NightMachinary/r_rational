I did not expect /that/ positive of a reception. I'd already entertained the idea of releasing the second chapter, since the first and the second kind of form a natural pair and the second is a better "wait" point while I write further ahead.

I'm kind of relieved. People seem to think I should release this, and while there's only a sample size of three people so far, it seems like you like it.

Here you go; chapter 2. I'll consider these two my sample then, together. Cheers. And thanks for reading and the feedback. I love it, /love/ it, when people write reactions like that. I would love more of that. It really helps, knowing what people think of specific parts.
