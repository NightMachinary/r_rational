I have released the first two chapters on fanfiction.net. Here's the link:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10263221/1/In-Fire-Forged]]

In addition, I've decided that I'm going to start updating the story on June 1st, as I work best with a "deadline". There are more details in the author's note of the first chapter.

[Edit] Also, if you leave reviews on ff.net, you make me a happy person.
