Hey, I quite enjoyed the start to your story.

I want to second what the others said; it's better to regularly release what you have, especially if it's the first story of that size you're writing.

Some points on the story itself: "Freeze, motherfucker!" is very inappropriate in a Naruto setting. At least in my opinion. It sounds very American.

I'm also not sure why you've changed the characters to such an extent. Sakura and Naruto seem like /already/ developed characters. Naruto in the manga was kind of a dick in the beginning. He changed quite a bit for the better through meeting Haku and Sasuke sacrificing himself for him, for instance. Sakura wasn't very serious about being a ninja until she was confronted with monsters such as Zabuza and Orochimaru. On the other hand, your Izanami seems to be a bit more antagonistic than Sasuke actually was at the beginning. (Before he was broken by Orochimaru and Itachi.)

But the worst character change is Kakashi being on time. ;)

I'm not saying the changes are bad, I'm just a bit surprised.

Anyway, I'm eagerly awaiting further chapters. Are you going to release on fanfiction.net?
