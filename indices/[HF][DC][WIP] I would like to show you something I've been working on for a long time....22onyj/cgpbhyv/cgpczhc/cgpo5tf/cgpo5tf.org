  I've never seen another Naruto fic do anything like that.

There is [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8953270/1/Genin-to-Hokage]], which has a similar premise. A re-imagining of Naruto that is more serious and more 'adult'. It's closer to canon than your story though. It's problems are a bit too much telling instead of showing and the storytelling is kind of boring. So if you want to check out the competition, this is very close.
