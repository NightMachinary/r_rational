I always wondered about the fact that Naruto was considered the village pariah. It didn't make any sense to me on a lot of different levels. You'll find that jinchuuriki in general are handled very differently in this universe, in a lot of different ways that I thought seemed more sensible and realistic.

And yes, making them 15 makes things a lot easier. I've found out that I'm generally very bad at writing children convincingly. They always seem too adult. Eliezer Yudkowsky said something of the same nature, I believe. Children are difficult.
