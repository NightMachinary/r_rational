Note that there may be some very mild spoilers for the lore and background, below.

Yes, I anticipate releasing the story on fanfiction.net, so far.

I've generally "westernized" certain bits of the culture. Mostly, this is a conscious decision to make it feel more modern and down-to-earth, though I might actually slip sometimes when I don't intend to. A fair part of this is me wanting to write the story in a certain way, and this way I can get away with content that the primarily western audience I have will appreciate more. I also happen to just like it more, I will honestly admit.

However, I do also have a justifiable in-lore reason for this. In this world, there are several defined countries and places outside of the elemental nations, some of which are... western-/like/, though with marked differences. There is quite a lot of cross-cultural contamination taking place in these times. We'll see more of this eventually, most likely, though I'm not sure how deeply I might get into it.

As for character changes, I've tried to be realistic about them. Mostly this is me taking what I see as the core of the character, and thinking of how they would truly have developed during the course of their lives, with the things that have happened to them. But I strive for them to still retain that core. In some, it might not be immediately apparent - but I believe that eventually most people will recognize the characters and their primary traits. Also, the main trio is fifteen at graduation now, not thirteen. This is a rather large change from canon, and I've never seen another Naruto fic do anything like that.

So, this /is/ an AU, and some characters are, due to different circumstances, simply different. Sakura particularly has not had a Sasuke to fawn over for years, and never developed an intense feud with Ino, instead remaining her friend. This results in a markedly different character that still shares some of canon Sakura's traits. There is much more of this kind of thinking. For example, Naruto is clearly not the village pariah any more. I wonder what that has meant and will mean, down the road...?

If you feel like the characters are already developed, it's because they are, in a sense, I suppose. People don't stand still until they are fifteen. But trust me, there are definitely copious amounts of character development in store for everyone.

I don't want to just redo canon. I can do other, interesting and new things instead, while doing my best to pay my respects to the source of my inspiration.

I also point out that Sakura's POV is not neutral, and may at times be completely biased and incorrect. Make of that what you will.

Otherwise cheers, and thanks for reading the story and commenting :)
