It was kind of implied, I guess.

  The first one I started on a casual exploratory whim based on a discussion with a friend (what if Sasuke had been a girl (you can perhaps extrapolate the nature of our discussion from that idea) and befriended Naruto early on after the massacre?).

The first "version" of the story was (at the very beginning) entirely based around the idea of a fem!Sasuke and the changes that would cause. In short, me and a friend had been talking, kind of hacking a bit on the Sasuke character which, frankly, neither of us particularly liked so much any more in canon, at all, and I thought when I came home that, hey, it could be interesting to try out /this/ version of things.

However, as that story grew longer, Sakura sort of ended up becoming the actual main character, and the intended plot grew a lot past the initial, slightly silly gender-switch premise.

As for why I didn't remove Izanami in the later versions of the story, she'd first of all become crucial to some of the character development of Naruto and Sakura, and second of all, she'd kind of grown on me. Not having her in simply felt wrong to me.
