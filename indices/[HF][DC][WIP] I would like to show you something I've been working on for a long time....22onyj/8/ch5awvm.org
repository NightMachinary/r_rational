So, let me start by saying that I've read and subscribed. I like your style of writing, I love authors who can update frequently, and I really like people who make the Narutoverse more women-friendly (for instance by making Sakura the main protagonist).

What I do not get is why you decided to turn Sasuke into a girl. I think it works out in a kind of curious way, but I see no reason for it yet. You mentioned in your original post that you'd explain why you chose to make the change, but you did not really go into it. I'm curious, partially because I really like the Naruto/Sasuke pairing, and Sasuke as a girl kind of ruins that for me. I'm curious what kind of implications intrigued you in the gender-swapping.
