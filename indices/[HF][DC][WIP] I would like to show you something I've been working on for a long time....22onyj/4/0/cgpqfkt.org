Oh and that was one of the best bell tests I have read. I was unsure about Kakashi revealing right at the start that whole teams managed to pass this test in the past, and demonstrating his willingness to lie about the conditions of the test. That seemed like you were making it easier on this bunch of genin to actually figure out the real reason behind the test compared to canon. However, Kakashi managed to make it work, and I think your team 7 managed to pass more convincingly than the canon team 7, who had the meaning of the test explained to them explicitly and given a second chance. I mean, honestly, what kind of stupid team wouldn't guess what was expected of them the second time around, even if they didn't agree with the whole "teamwork is good" speech?

Edit: I also liked that you made genin graduate at 15 instead of 12. Makes it easier to relate to them for the intended adult (presumably) audience. 12 worked in canon, because it was close to the intended demographic, but it didn't seem logical without sufficient suspension of disbelief (the kind you almost automatically assign nowadays to shonen anime without even having to think about it...).

Edit2: Also, I liked the change that Naruto isn't a pariah anymore. Honestly, the fact that he was a pariah despite the Hokage's wishes spoke about the Hokage's incompetence. Why the hell would he even release such information to general public in the first place? As far as I understand, supposedly he expected that the villagers would view Naruto as a hero. Such gross misunderstanding of his people (and his inability to present facts in an auspicious light, even) is a BIG failing for a supposedly competent and experienced leader.

I don't even care how you did it -- made the supposed secret actually secret (most likely), or made the Konoha population more reasonable (though that's unlikely), or made the Hokage more competent at presenting information... the situation was designed to make the reader sympathize with Naruto in canon, but it really didn't make much sense.

So these are the biggest changes that I noticed and agreed with. And I didn't notice anything big to criticize. So that's all I can say so far.
