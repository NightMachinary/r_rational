I would like to really thank all of you for your feedback (especially writingathing for his very long and extremely helpful post). I'm definitely going to post the story. However, that won't happen just now.

I still want to write ahead quite a bit more, at least getting the second arc (10 or so more chapters) close to done before I start posting, so I can keep a regular update schedule. I also need to fine-tune the first chapters a bit, touching up on a few issues that have been highlighted here, though I'm aware that I shouldn't do that too much.

I do feel a little paranoid suddenly, though! As it is now, the pace drops a bit after these first two chapters meant to hook people, seguing into a more sedate introductory arc with a lot of character interaction and a few interludes from other character POVs, then starts ratcheting up with the next arc after that. I'm hoping that decision wasn't a mistake.

Meanwhile, as for when it can be expected, I'm hesitant to make any promises. However, in three weeks I'm heading to Tahiti for a month on vacation. I might very plausibly get some writing done there, in quiet peace. We'll see. I'd say within the next two months, very likely.

I'll post here in this subreddit again when it goes up on fanfiction.net, of course. You can also send me your email privately here on reddit, if you want, and I'll send out a mail when that happens.

And if anybody still feels like giving feedback, criticism or sharing their thoughts, please do so!
