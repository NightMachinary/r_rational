Haven't read yours yet, but I just wanted to say you should definitely check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9311012/1/Lighting-Up-the-Dark][Lighting up the Dark]]. It's based off the HPMOR Naruto omake and seems to stick closer to canon.

You should /definitely/ release yours as well ([[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_early,_release_often][Release Early, Release Often]]), if only to build a habit of releasing unfinished stuff, which is valuable for early feedback (tighten those loops!) and community building (social reinforcement helps commitment and enthusiasm!).

[edit] Wow, full realism along with keeping the element categories for chakras? You don't believe in easymode, do you.

[edit] Halfway through. Enjoying it so far!

[edit] Agree with the other commenter. I want moar.
