You touch upon some topics which I've been giving a lot of thought. I believe, from what you've written there, that you will be quite satisfied with the overall approach I've chosen for the topic of child soldiers. There are both TtS-style blurbs dealing with the topic, and the story itself will definitely also touch on it.

Now, the anachronisms, I've got the general core ideas but I have indeed had a hard time dealing with them, and had to make a few choices here and there. Overall it's a part that /might/ require a tiny bit of willing suspension of disbelief, though I'm doing my best to have things make sense.

However, generally I've tried to justify the few cases of major differences in tech level in a few different ways. Mostly either that the fields are separate enough that they could plausibly have developed in a skewed fashion, or that the technology is being imported from different parts of the world that are more technologically advanced. There are also other reasons in more specific cases.

We'll see if it all works out, I suppose.
