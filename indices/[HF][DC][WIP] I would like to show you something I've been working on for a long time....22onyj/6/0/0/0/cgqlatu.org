That's good to know - I hadn't actually considered it from that perspective. I'll try to keep in mind that I should put a few natural-sounding tech mentions in here and there, just to add to the feeling of a real world and give the reader a sense of what the different levels of technology are.

I must say, posting it here was a very good call on my part. I've gotten a lot of very valuable input that's definitely going to end up making the story better.
