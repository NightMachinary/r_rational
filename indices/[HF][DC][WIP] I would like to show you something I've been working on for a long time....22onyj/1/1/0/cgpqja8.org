You should. It really is the equivalent of HPMOR for Naruto. The writing quality is very professional (even better than this) it has consistent humor, tight plotting so far and some incredible fight scenes. Techniques like Multiple Shadow Clones and so on are properly munchikin'ed and everything is very dangerous and if I kept talking I'd just ramble.
