I have, in fact, read Lighting Up The Dark and am subscribed to updates, but I thought Black Cloaks, Red Clouds was a more apt comparison since I'm not explicitly emphasizing any rational aspects of the story. At least not at first.

I'm basically reading whatever Eliezer Yudkowsky suggests in his updates. The Two Year Emperor is also quite good if you're into DnD Munchkinry ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9669819/1/The-Two-Year-Emperor]]).
