I haven't read LUTD, partly because I disliked the Naruto omake. I mean I enjoyed it, but I wouldn't really want to read a Naruto story with the central concepts (the ninja, the demon fox) so altered. I think the original universe is interesting enough that you could make a rational fic out of it without making the ninja all about intelligence and the demon fox have a gigantic brain. That wouldn't even be Naruto, so why write it in that universe? After all, we all liked HPMOR, and wizards there aren't suddenly all rationalists -- quite the opposite, in fact, magic seems to reaist scientific analysis.

I like what OP is doing much more. Some subtle (well, maybe not so subtle sometimes) tweaks, upgraded characters and a different storyline that attempts to follow real logic rather than story logic.

Do you think someone with that mentality should give Lighting Up the Dark a try, after all?
