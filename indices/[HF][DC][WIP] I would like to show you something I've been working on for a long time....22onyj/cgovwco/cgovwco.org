There is an excellent Rational!Naruto fic called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9311012/1/Lighting-Up-the-Dark][Lighting Up The Dark]], but it rarely more is always better anyway.

It would be worth a read, I think, more for the rationalist battle tactics than specific divergences from canon.

I read the first chapter you supplied, and it's actually rather good. Seems all that preparation was worth it. 

The sidebar bullet points don't matter as much as you think they do. Rational fiction is mostly just about creativity and idea density and lacking idiocy and plot convience. 

Honestly, the real first test of this as a rational!fic would come in the Bell-test itself and the problem-solving process the characters undertake.
