There's something about this I find intriguing even though I don't really know much about the source material, maybe because [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9939806/1/Harry-Potter-s-Time-Traveling-Sister-Who-Is-Best-Friends-With-Naruto][I'm writing something not entirely unlike it myself]], featuring, among other things, a super-smart Sakura and a protagonist who attempts to understand the fundamental rules of the worlds she finds herself in. I'll offer some extensive comments on the writing. Don't take them personally; just try to extract what value that you can from them.

#+begin_quote
  On the outside of it
#+end_quote

"On the face of it?"

#+begin_quote
  the nature of chakra seems downright absurd.
#+end_quote

This a flaccid hook. It doesn't sound like a sentence from a "Science Illustrated Magazine," which sounds like something for kids. None of the excerpt seems appropriate for the title of the magazine or the specific article, "The World of Chakra," which again sounds like something introductory.

#+begin_quote
  as far as is known,
#+end_quote

You use "as is" in the previous sentence, and this would be better as an active phrase if it's for kids.

#+begin_quote
  (cutting winds, lightning sharpness, and so forth)
#+end_quote

I assume these are references to the source material, but I feel like a more involved description of the sorts of properties the elements can produce would be interesting.

#+begin_quote
  The reason for this dissonance is not known, but may, strange as it sounds, be bound to commonly held preconceptions in society a millennium ago, when these abilities first began to appear in the historical record
#+end_quote

This is awfully heavy-handed. It's reasonable to expect that folk physics/chemistry would persist across long time periods. They're based on human intuition.

#+begin_quote
  There are further chakra sub-elements, consisting of
#+end_quote

You have a lot of unnecessary commas that slow the sentences down. I tend to do that too by reflex, but it's something you need to look over when you edit your work, since it's a problem consistent throughout the piece.

#+begin_quote
  Come with us in this special issue, as we explore the strange contradictions and wonders of the world of chakra.
#+end_quote

See, this sentence sounds like something introductory for laypeople unlike the rest of the article.

#+begin_quote
  Summer, 1021 AS (After the Sage)
#+end_quote

This doesn't mean anything because I have no context. You could have picked any date and any name and have the same effect.

#+begin_quote
  it took a few moments looking at the angles of the sunlight
#+end_quote

I think your character is realizing what time it is, but this is an awfully strange way to put it.

#+begin_quote
  I turned in the bed and looked at my clock. A quarter to eight. It should have gone off more than an hour ago. The alarm must have broken. And then the hard realization struck me.
#+end_quote

This is a bunch of short sentences all in a row. I feel like the broken alarm clock is a missed opportunity. Why did it break? Did she forget to put in batteries? Do machines not work well in this world? Or did she forget to set it--e.g., is she lazy/forgetful? It's a characterization/worldbuilding chance.

#+begin_quote
  I tore up out of bed,
#+end_quote

This whole paragraph is really unnecessary. We're not learning anything about her other than that she wears clothes and brushes her teeth. This scene shouldn't be focused on at all unless there's actually something relevant happening. It's much more interesting when she puts on her ninja gear even though the style is the same.

#+begin_quote
  I instantly felt bad.
#+end_quote

This should be the start of a new paragraph. Like the overuse of commas, the problem of not knowing when to begin new paragraphs is pervasive throughout this piece. It's something for you to work on.

Also, there's a lot of sentences all near each other starting with "I" that continues for a while.

#+begin_quote
  Yesterday. The genin exams had been yesterday,
#+end_quote

This is both very cliche yet entirely unrealistic, and it makes all the stuff she'd done before seem pointless. Why couldn't you just start from her getting the note if that's really where the story starts?

#+begin_quote
  I remembered it now, a long and grueling day of the examiners pulling out all the stops:
#+end_quote

It sounds interesting. I guess I'll take your word for it that it was. I really don't know anything about this world yet, so it's not like I can fill in the blanks here. This passage throws a bunch at us in a rush, yet at the same time it really doesn't have much meaning.

#+begin_quote
  I'd stumbled home and received a mercifully
#+end_quote

This is too clumsy. I can feel the author hurrying to fill in unnecessary background information as if trying to justify the choice of the misleading beginning. It's not important information at all, so you can just skip it.

#+begin_quote
  I was going to be late. Damn.
#+end_quote

Oh, so this is why you started the story in that way. But it doesn't work because the beginning was so unnecessary and unjustified that it feels like the only reason it happened is to set up this mirroring at the end. You should try to find a way to have the initial setup contribute to the story or character.

On the scene with Sakura and her parents:

Is this necessary? Will it prove to be important? It feels awfully forced. I'm not sure if that's a problem with the writing, or because it feels like it's exactly the sort of unnecessary scene an amateur writer would include. It's just something for you to think about, whether Sakura's parents really need to be in the story at all taking up time and slowing things down.

#+begin_quote
  Drawing chakra together and shaping it,
#+end_quote

This is sort of interesting and the first time it's been explicitly mentioned that the character has superpowers. It's worth making it its own sentence. It's also worth slowing down here and describing what that feels and looks like.

#+begin_quote
  I landed running, and laughed out loud. The feeling was exhilarating. I'd done this before, in class with instructors, but doing it on my own to actually get somewhere in a hurry was an entirely different feeling.
#+end_quote

This would be more effective if you had established what this would mean to Sakura /before/ she did it rather than after. The way it is now my reaction is, "Oh, so /that's/ what I was supposed to be feeling."

#+begin_quote
  When I neared the campus of the Konoha Ninja Academy, I had to go back to running down on the streets
#+end_quote

Try flipping the order of these clauses around. It puts the focus on the appearance of the ninja school.

#+begin_quote
  The lecture room was almost full. It could hold fifty people, and there were around forty in here.
#+end_quote

You could set the scene better by including details that would be present like the noise and chatter of a group of people before a ceremony.

#+begin_quote
  eligible young ninja in Konoha
#+end_quote

Aren't these characters all like 12 years old?

#+begin_quote
  I awkwardly smiled back
#+end_quote

Third time someone's smiled in a single paragraph.

#+begin_quote
  Izanami was without a doubt the most eligible, and also the one who was the farthest out of reach, if only because she would probably castrate anybody who even suggested anything of the sort and people could tell that about her.
#+end_quote

Maybe try breaking this up into two sentences. It's too long for the final clause to have the impact it's supposed to.

#+begin_quote
  who had carried out the Massacre
#+end_quote

This speaks to a weakness in the writing, namely the character's limited voice, that is also a problem running throughout the piece. For such an interesting sentence, this is remarkably mundane. There's got to be a more interesting way of stating Itachi's crime.

#+begin_quote
  I frowned. “Don't rub it in.” “What took you so long?” she demanded.
#+end_quote

You make a very common amateur mistake here which is to think you need to change how you tag the characters with each line of dialogue. With dialogue, less is more. For whatever reason, "said" as a dialogue tag is invisible. The audience can read it over and over without noticing it. Furthermore, once you've established who's speaking, you don't even need to tag the dialogue lines at all. E.g. "Hi," I said. "Hey," she said. "What's up?" "Nothing," is just fine, albeit rather dull dialogue.

Finally, description as a dialogue tag (e.g. "Sure," I nodded) should be kept to a minimum. Generally the audience should understand that a joking character is smiling, a sad character is crying, etc. If you've established the characters and scene properly most of this description should be redundant.

I'm not sure that all the exposition about the three jounin team leaders. The exposition is both unnecessary at the point it's given and it doesn't really mean anything to us yet. I mean, I realize these are familiar characters and concepts from the source material, but simply taken the story as given it's just an info dump

#+begin_quote
  Bla bla bla shameless flattery bla bla bla obligatory speeches bla bla bla, I thought drolly as he droned on about our virtues and our indomitable will of fire.
#+end_quote

Is this how you want Sakura to be characterized? Honestly considering how much exposition Sakura was dumping out just moments ago, I would have expected her to listen a little more closely or at least not be so dismissive. Also, no one describes themselves as thinking drolly. You shouldn't have to tell yourself that what you're thinking is funny.

#+begin_quote
  A woman clad in the standard issue green armored vest with twin tanto strapped to her back and her forehead protector worn around her right arm stepped forward from the rest of the jounin.
#+end_quote

This is a lot of description. Will she be an important character? If not, this is all unnecessary. If she will be important later but not for now, you should either skip it anyway because it's irrelevant for now or you should have Sakura take greater notice of her to indicate that this character will in fact matter.

Although there's a bunch more nits to pick and a major problem to address (too much telling not enough showing), I've said enough for now. Although the writing is amateurish in a lot of ways, there's something about it that's easy to read and enjoy nonetheless. Don't mind the criticism above; it's intended to be friendly, so take from it what you can. I'm looking forward to seeing the rest of the story.
