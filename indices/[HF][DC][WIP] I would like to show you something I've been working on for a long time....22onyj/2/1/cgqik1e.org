I have to say, I love the title of your fic. I like titles that tell you what to expect. "The Bus That Couldn't Slow Down" is am much better title than "speed". I have not read "John Dies at the End", but it, too, is a fantastic title.

Unless you are 100% serious, in which case... I think all hope is lost for you ;)
