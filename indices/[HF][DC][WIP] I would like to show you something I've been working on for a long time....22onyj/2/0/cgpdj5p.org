Wow. Thank you so much for taking the time to write all of that. Stuff like this is pure gold, and I will definitely take it in the spirit that it was intended.

Another real gold nugget is the fact that you don't know much about the source material. An incredible amount is actually stuff that's meant to illustrate and implicate the many, many differences that there are between this story and original canon, meant to subvert expectations and cause interest in what /else/ has changed. As such, I think they will be taken differently by people who are more intimately familiar with Naruto canon.

However, this says nothing about how much exposition is needed, and this is a very valuable different perspective. I realize the pitfall of editing back too much, but going back over this chapter with all of this in mind will definitely help me in the future.

Thanks a bunch! :) Wish I had more upvotes to give.
