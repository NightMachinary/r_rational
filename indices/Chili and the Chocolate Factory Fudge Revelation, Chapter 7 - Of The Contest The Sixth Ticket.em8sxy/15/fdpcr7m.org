A fickle and playful attitude: maize deception.

So it was really about thinking inside the box...but did all the winners get it accidentally (or through childlike naivety)? That hurts. Especially hurts for those who thought they were smart or the best. Forcing people to confront uncomfortable truths and then making a joke out of their resolve. Bucket's still a bastard.
