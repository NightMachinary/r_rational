That title drop was worth the entire fic tbh. Also screw you, it doesn't make sense for a fetus to put chocolate inside a screen, my solution is still right and you know it.

Also, we're doing [[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/437697099383963668/664892078974697472/unknown.png][/another/ stream]] to finish up the Roald Dahl cinematic universe now that Chili's continuing. We did Charlie and the Fox last time, this time we're streaming Matilda and The Witches.

Specific info's available at that link, general info on how the streams go is [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ejgkla/d_friday_open_thread/fcycjiq/][here]].
