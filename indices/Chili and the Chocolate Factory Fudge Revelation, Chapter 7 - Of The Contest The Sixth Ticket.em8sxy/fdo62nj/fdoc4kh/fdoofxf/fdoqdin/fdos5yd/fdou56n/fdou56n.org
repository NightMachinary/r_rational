Heh, the author has certainly played with our expectations, but I've found myself more amused than a victim of cruelty. I was also unaware that the author had a reputation for troll-y works, and I don't think I'm alone.

That said, yes, part of what the author is doing is poking fun at people who call themselves [[/r/rational]], I think.
