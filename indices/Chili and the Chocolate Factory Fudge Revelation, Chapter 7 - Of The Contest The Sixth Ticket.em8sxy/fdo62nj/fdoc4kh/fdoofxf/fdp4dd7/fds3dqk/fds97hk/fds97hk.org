There were baddie aliens in space, but the only thing keeping them from coming down to Earth is the fact that they apparently can't make any tools and just burn up in the atmosphere.

In canon, they've already caused several extinction-level events on the other planets - there /was/ life on Venus and Mars, but the Knids got in and ate everything.

They're intelligent enough to form letters in order to communicate with humans, which means that given enough time (and telescopes), they could potentially convince people to send up space trash that they could ride back down to the surface of the planet.
