On a meta level, this story (and others by this author) directly address this particular community, subtly and not-so-subtly (I'm pretty sure the character "Blakin" is an homage to Makin-, and the moderator character GW is loosely based on our dear moderator and author Alexander Wales ("AW".))

From my perspective, addressing the rational fiction community directly is sufficient for a story to fit in here.
