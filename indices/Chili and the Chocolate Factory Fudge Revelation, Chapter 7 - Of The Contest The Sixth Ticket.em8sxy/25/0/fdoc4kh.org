Being "rationalist" isn't really one of the defining traits of ratfic, albeit it's a defining trait of some of the founding works.

This one strikes me as similar to UNSONG: a batshit insane world that is nevertheless a response to an existing work which focuses on the ramifications that said work ignored or glossed over. It's meta-rational.
