My thinking while setting this chapter and the last one up was that the fun readers would get from seeing something come back from the dead would outweigh the sadness of seeing something die, since it's much more rare for that to happen. I wasn't trying to leave you or anyone else feel sour in the long run and I'm honestly sorry if I did. Many of my favorite authors like/liked to horribly abuse their audience and I must have absorbed that.

This story is not rationalist but I thought it had enough rational themes (by say, the standard of UNSONG) to be posted here in spite of the surrealism. I've written works before that I haven't posted here because I didn't think they had enough to justify being here so I hope that shows that I'm not viewing it as an opportunity grab.

This story may or may not also be approaching a point where it (I think) it justifies itself further, but that's subjective and it still might not hit the mark for you. I'm not trying to cause ill will or trouble and if more people told me that they didn't think it belonged here I would stop posting it and tell other people to do the same.
