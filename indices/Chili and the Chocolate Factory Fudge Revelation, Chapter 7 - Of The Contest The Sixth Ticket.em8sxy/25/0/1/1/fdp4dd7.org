  Like the baby war, or the whole hating astronomy thing; these are not consequences derived from the original story.

The hating astronomy thing is quite supported by Roald Dahl's canon - see the events of the Great Glass Elevator. Even a wiki summary will do.

The baby wars thing might be unjustified, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's due to an Oompa Loompa breeding program or something.
