All fiction makes things up: you can still have a rational (but not strictly) story in a surreal ("irrational") world.

If you go down the checklist, the story toes the line for nearly everything. The only things that are off are:

1. the Dahliesque cast - pretty much everyone besides the chat (usually). There's agency, but most of them aren't very intelligent about it.

2. We don't know the world's rules so it's hard to tell if they're being consistent (or predictably inconsistent).

P.S. not sure what rationality has to do with playing a trick, but cruel is subjective!

P.P.S. You know what's really cruel? Playing a trick on smart people who thought they understood the riddle and making them face all kinds of uncomfortable truths only for the contest to turn out to be a lottery after all (just not in the way people thought).
