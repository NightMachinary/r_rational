I'm so confused. Chapter 7 made it feel like the whole story was a depressingly long setup for a truly ridiculous, over-the-top pun that never materialized.

There are a lot of references in this story to Dahl's works. I'm either too unfamiliar with them to get the level of humor involved, or these are just homages thrown in for the sake of it.

I'm not trying to rain on parades. I would love for someone cleverer to tell me what I missed on my read-through that made this an amazing and wonderful tale. I'm 100% certain that I missed a huge number of references or in-jokes, but I would have expected the story to stand up without those pillars.

Can someone shine a light for me?
