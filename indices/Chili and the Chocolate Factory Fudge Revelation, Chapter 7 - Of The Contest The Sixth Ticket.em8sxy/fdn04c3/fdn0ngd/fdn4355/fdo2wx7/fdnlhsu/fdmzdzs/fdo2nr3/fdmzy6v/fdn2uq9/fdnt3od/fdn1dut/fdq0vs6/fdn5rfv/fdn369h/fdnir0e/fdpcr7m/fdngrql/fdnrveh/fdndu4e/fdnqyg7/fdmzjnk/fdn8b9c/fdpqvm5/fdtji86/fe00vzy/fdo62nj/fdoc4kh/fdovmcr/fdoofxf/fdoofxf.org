Focusing on ramifications that are ignored or glossed over is pretty rationalist from my point of view. This work doesn't really do that though, it just makes things up. Like the baby war, or the whole hating astronomy thing; these are not consequences derived from the original story. It's like a giant stew of off the wall elements that only exist to make the story surreal. As far as meta-rational, is it rational to take a story that existed to play a cruel trick on the audience, from an author who apparently likes to play cruel tricks on their audience and say, "Yeah, I'm sure it won't happen again." ?

Also, what was UNSONG a response to?
