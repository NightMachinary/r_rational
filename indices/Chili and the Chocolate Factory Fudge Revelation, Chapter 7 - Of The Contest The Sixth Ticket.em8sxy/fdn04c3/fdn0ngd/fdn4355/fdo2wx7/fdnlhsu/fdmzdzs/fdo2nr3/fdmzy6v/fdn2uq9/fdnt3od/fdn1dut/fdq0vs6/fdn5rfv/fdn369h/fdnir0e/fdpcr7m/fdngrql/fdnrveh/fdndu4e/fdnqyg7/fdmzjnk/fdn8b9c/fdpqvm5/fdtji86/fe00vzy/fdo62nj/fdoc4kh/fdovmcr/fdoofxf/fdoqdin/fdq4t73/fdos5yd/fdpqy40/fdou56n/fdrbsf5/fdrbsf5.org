I greatly enjoyed the whole thing. The story didn't die a random meaningless death, it did dramatically, with meaning and purpose, to make a point!

Now, initially when reading the title about the end, I had my suspicions. This is gaizemaize after all. But by the time I had read the chapter and the discussion around it, I totally forgot my suspicions; just like a good movie you have seen before makes you forget what happens next. I had suspension of disbelief, not for the story itself, but the process of it being shared in the internet.

I'd say this story "explores goals and motivations", and "intelligent people solving problems" not of the characters (so far), but of the author and the audience.

Of course, being part of a story is at times a very unpleasant experience, so being made a part of one when you didn't sign up for it can be hurtful. But as far as I am concerned, my joy is worth your annoyance. (Not sure if selfishness or a profound philosophical stance.)
