Yes I do know about rot13, but spoiler tags are probably enough, and rot13 is probably enough. Together it's a bit annoying to navigate. Comments that are entirely rot13nd are a lot easier to keep track of, since it doesn't involve copy-and-pasting a bunch of small text segments, or copying the whole thing and toggling between what half is actually readable at any given time.
