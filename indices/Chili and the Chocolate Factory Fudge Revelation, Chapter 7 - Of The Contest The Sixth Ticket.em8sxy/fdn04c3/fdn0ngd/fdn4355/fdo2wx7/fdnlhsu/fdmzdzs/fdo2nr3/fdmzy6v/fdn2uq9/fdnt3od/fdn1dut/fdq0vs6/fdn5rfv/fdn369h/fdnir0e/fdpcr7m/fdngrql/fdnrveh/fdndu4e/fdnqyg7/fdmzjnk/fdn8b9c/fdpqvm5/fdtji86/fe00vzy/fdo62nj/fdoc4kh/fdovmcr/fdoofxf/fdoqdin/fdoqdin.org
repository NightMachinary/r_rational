The Bible. The Talmud, really. The whole premise is "what if everything in Jewish myth was actually legit, yet also compatible with our world as we observe it as the hardcore orthodox insist must be true?" The very nature of squaring that circle leads to a ton of insane shit, due to the Talmud being crazy.

  This work doesn't really do that though, it just makes things up. Like the baby war, or the whole hating astronomy thing; these are not consequences derived from the original story. It's like a giant stew of off the wall elements that only exist to make the story surreal.

That's set dressing; the author does a very good job of invoking Roald Dahl's goofy style, and all those unexpected elements are just in service of imitating that (it wouldn't be Dahl-ian if it didn't surprise you!).

The glossed over bits that it examines include how, for instance, all the winners of the original contest were white caricatures of Kids These Days, as opposed to a more normal distribution that one might expect. This new contest points this out by having a contest that /enforces/ a result similar to the original, and shows how much extra work would be required to have that outcome.

This is what I meant by meta-rational; the world itself might be insane, but the things it has to say about the work it's responding to are coherent.

  As far as meta-rational, is it rational to take a story that existed to play a cruel trick on the audience, from an author who apparently likes to play cruel tricks on their audience and say, "Yeah, I'm sure it won't happen again." ?

This is where the suboptimal naming of the genre rears its head again. Is it rational to play a trick? An action can only be analyzed in context of its goals. Is it consistent with rational fiction to play a trick? I don't think the tenets of the genre say one way or the other.
