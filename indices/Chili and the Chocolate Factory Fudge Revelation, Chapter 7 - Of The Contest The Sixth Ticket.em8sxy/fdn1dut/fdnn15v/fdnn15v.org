I think Chillenial's solution was right, but needed to be chocolate coated.

- JUROR probably had chocolate on his finger when the page loaded, and he poked the blank spot
- Vape lady was probably vaping chocolate smoke
- Ocean lady's crab had probably been eating chocolate when it poked the screen
- Good parent lady probably had chocolate coated fingers and an iPad because her parents are so good

The non-Reedus magic fetus I don't have a good answer for, since he's in a biomech right now and can't really touch anything.
