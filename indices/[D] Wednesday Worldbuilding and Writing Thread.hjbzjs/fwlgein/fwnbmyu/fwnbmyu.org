The technological aspect of this has some scary and timely implications for government response: because the intelligence agencies, after they get their hands on some of the examples you mentioned, will have to assume a lot of their non-airgapped systems are penetrated and have to presume a motivated entity can penetrate their non-airgapped systems: this means a lot more operations against technological entities will go pen and paper or human to human, management will know that this means trade-offs and facing the existential threats will have to allow more loose rules of engagement to accomplish tasks.

My brain keeps trying to think of a way to vet some eldritch entity to bring it inside the wire or at least into an appropriately padded sub-container, but I can't see any case where anything other than the most tenuous contact by the least briefed people possible is allowed, the fact that initiates have basically FMRIs of people they are dealing with and the ability to alter states is something I expect to be figured out by the first airstrike or in the investigation of how it happened.
