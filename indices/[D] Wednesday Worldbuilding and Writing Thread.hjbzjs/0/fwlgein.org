Beginning in the the 1950s various entities periodically contact people and offer occult knowledge, mysterious powers, technology, and pseudo-technology in exchange for various forms of worship, sacrifices, rituals, and actions. The entities variously present themselves as gods, angels demons, extradimensional beings, aliens but generally the all follow a similar pattern: they start with limited vague communication to a single person in the form of dreams or during altered states of consciousness; at some point they begin offering knowledge/powers/technology/pseudo-technology and asking/demanding various worship/sacrifice/rituals/actions; the contacted person often forms a Cult to carry out these demands and leverage resources, as the Cult's followers grow in number and power the entity's communication becomes clearer and to more people; as this continues their offerings and requests escalate. As the Entity gains power they sometimes change in apparent morality, often starting as benevolent but getting increasingly controlling/demanding and sometimes outright evil.

Of the things they offer:

- The Occult knowledge includes descriptions of other entities, ways of contacting them, various "magical" rituals (that often depend on the willing intervention of entities). These rituals tend to be potent but take days to weeks of planning and hours to days to carry out. These rituals tend to take the form of big dramatic single use effects: healing a sick person, raising a person from the dead, calling down a natural disaster. The rituals cannot be repeated too often or they lose power.

- The Powers often seem to take a form that has mundane explanation, for instance good charisma and salesmanship as opposed to mind control, lucky cold reading instead of mind reading, lucky prediction of the weather instead of weather control; but sufficiently careful study will show the interventions: unnatural shift in dopamine levels in a person being manipulated, consistently precise and lucky guesses in the mind reading, heat or lack of heat suddenly appearing in a weather system. A Person with powers generally only has 1-3 powers, occasionally swapping out powers as their guiding entity shifts focus or demands new things. Their powers generally start very vague and seemingly driven by coincidence/placebo affect but become clearer and more defined over time. For instance, an insect controller might barely have any influence over insects, but after months or years of practice and increasing worship of their guiding entity might be able to precisely control large swarms.

- Technology is generally just guidance on using and applying existing science technology to particular goals. The person under their guidance may not invent anything fundamentally new, but they can pull off impressive applications under very limited time pressure and resources through well optimized design assembled very precisely with little planning. Their work can be replicated with sufficient thorough documentation although this is often impractical given the speed and precision at which they work.

- Pseudo-technology seems to be advanced technology that utilizes advanced previously unknown scientific principles, and most of it behaves according to the laws of physics, but there is consistently a few hard "cheats" built into the device. To give some examples: A sentient AI may seem to be mostly real hardware and software, but careful study will show that several true random number sources act as input to the software and are responsible for all of the more impressive feats the AI can perform. A perpetual energy source may claim to use "vacuum energy" but actually just has a electromagnetic field that continuously fluctuates in a way the generates electricity. Notably, these devices cannot be easily replicated or repurposed, it requires a person under an entity's guidance to assemble them, maintain them, and often to properly use them.

Of the things they request/demand:

- Rules that often start with small, seemingly arbitrary, life style changes: no eating birds, dressing asymmetrically, always going to sleep at a certain time of night. Over time the demands escalate in number, precision required, and harshness of breaking them. In addition to not eating birds, followers must offer food to birds regularly. In addition to dressing asymmetrically, followers must inflict asymmetric scaring on themselves, possibly even mutilating themselves. The time at which the followers must fall asleep is narrowed from an hour window to a minutes window, with drugs used to aid this process and failure to comply leads to an inability to fall asleep at all for several days.

- Worship often takes the form of songs, dances, and plays. The elaboration and detail tends to grow overtime.

- Sacrifices may take the form of destruction of property, killing of small animals, and in the case of eviler entities, people (willing or unwilling varies by entity).

- Some entities may require or ask that followers allow them to be possessed by them.

The Entities themselves

- Occasionally they identify other entities as allies/neutral/enemies. This identification tends to be mutual. The entities sometimes direct their followers to take actions based on these relationships.

- For whatever form they take (god/alien/demon/angel/astral being), they typically stick with that in how they identify themselves and how they explain the world. An angel entity might explain itself as a messenger from God, its rituals as means of contacting God, its demands as cleaniniess requirements required by God, an identify it's enemies as demons. One of these enemies might identify as an Alien and in turn claim the Angel is from a rival group of Aliens.

- Although they sometimes claim association with existing religions or historical religions, their theological claims and practice heavily differ. A entity claiming to be "Athena" might have no practices matching current or historical practice of Greek Paganism and claim a cosmology vastly different than the Greeks.

- When asked about why entities all started becoming active around a similar time, entities typically describe a change in the world in terms associated with what they identify as.

- In general, there seems to be a positive correlation in how much an entity demands and how much it offers as well as trade-offs in what it offers.

A few example entities:

- One of the first entities claimed to be an Archon of knowledge sent by Ialdabaoth to guide humanity to an age of prosperity. It made few demands, it guided it's followers to produce various technology and pseudo-technology over a decade to improve the world, and after around a decade of activity attempted to possess all of them and carry out a sacrificial ritual which would kill millions of people and grant it a body in the real world before it was stopped by an airstrike. It hasn't appeared since but many governments are on the alert for any entity claiming a similar cosmology or with similar pseudo-techology.

- A rival entity, claiming to be sent by Sophia that spent years warning about the Archon. This entity makes many moralistic demands: caring for the homeless and impoverished, being kind, turning the other cheek etc. It only offers power on a temporary as needed basis.

- An entity claiming to be a Buddha, seeking to guide other to enlightenment. It typically demands meditation, self-denial, and ceremonial dances. It grants the ability to go without food/water/sleep and various powers associated with the Siddhi [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhi]].

- Mothman: A giant moth-like entity that has been active since the late 1960s. Notably, it has difficult speaking clearly despite how long it has been active, often resorting to gesticulation. Its worship includes various dances and screeching songs and preferably carried out at night. Consistently carrying out these acts of worship most typically grants precognitive powers that tend to predict disasters and the activities of other entities. Other powers include the ability to induce visions in other people, the ability to jump better (culminating in the power to fly), the ability to control moths, Notably, Mothman has no centralized cult/religion and is nonexclusive you can follow both it and other entities. Other entities will occasionally tell their followers rites based off Mothman to gain powers drawn from it.

For examples from other media that would fit well in this setting: think of Bill Cipher from Gravity Falls, Bobble the Clown from SCP foundation, The Red King from SCP Foundation (at least takes/canons in which the Red King is dependent on followers), The Machine God from SCP foundation, the 5thist "gods"/archons from SCP foundation, the way Gods operate in Pact, and the Couch Potato entity mentioned in Worth the Candle.

Prompts to consider

- What is the legal/governmental response?

- How do various existing religions respond?

- Under what conditions would you become a follower of one of these entities?

- How could these entities be muchkined?

- How would you munchking/leverage things if you were an entity?
