I didn't even think of that implication, but yeah, given the capabilities of these entities they could have their followers search for zero day exploits. Or if they can grant the right powers, have their followers guess passwords. Actually its even worse... some entities can just grant the right kind of clairvoyance/clairaudiance, and have their followers watch/listen in directly.

Some entities apparently have been consistently (relatively) benevolent since their first appearance, and they issue warning about other entities that are dangerous and recommendations about other entities so you could try building a network of trust.

  but I can't see any case where anything other than the most tenuous contact by the least briefed people possible is allowed

Each entity tends towards a relatively small range of powers, with only the most powerful/worshipped having a larger portfolio of powers, so you can be reasonably safe if you carefully track the sorts of powers a given entity tends to give out. That said, newer entities or entities that have recently grown in power absolutely do warrant the sort of paranoia you are thinking of...
