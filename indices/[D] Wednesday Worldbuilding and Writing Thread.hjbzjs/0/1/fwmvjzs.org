  What is the legal/governmental response?
#+end_quote

The government would restrict their power in several ways:

- First, they would impose/require professional licensing boards. You can't cut someone's hair without hundreds of hours of education and membership in the guild, so it seems unlikely that they'd allow you to start a business using your personal-flight powers without the oversight of a self-governing body.

- Second, labor laws and anti-discrimination legislation would limit the tasks they could complete. Even if someone /could/ work a 25/7 schedule without losing performance, they would be forced into a standard workweek. Same with lifting hundreds of pounds, skipping PPE/hazard mitigation, or other otherwise-unsafe practices.

- I don't think they would impose mandatory-disclosure requirements (think of the +sex-offender+ /X-Men Mutant/ registry), but it's too common in stories to just leave that point out.

The government could also offer low-key help in a few ways:

- Require accommodation for their observances, similar to the current laws around religious practices.

- Treat crimes against worshipers as more serious than normal, similar to Hate Crime legislation.

- subsidized education and training, similar to post-secondary education.
