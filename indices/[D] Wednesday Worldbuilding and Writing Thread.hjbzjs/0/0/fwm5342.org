  What is the legal/governmental response?
#+end_quote

At a minimum, vastly increased surveillance with improved machine learning algorithms focused on determining when people suddenly display new and unexpected behaviors, or sudden growth of a new circle of acquaintances. For example, a return of the Archon under a different name might initially be detected by rapid growth of a circle of acquaintances who all begin to make purchases outside of their usual behavior. Once flagged by the surveillance algorithm, human review of some of their internet messages, phone conversations, and/or exact purchases would likely reveal the nature of the threat, allowing for an early response before things get out of hand.

Government response could also include monthly psychological screening. Children going to public schools could be given forms to fill out at school, with random variations in the format, arrangement, and type of questions to prevent developing a routine to answering them. Companies might be required to issue the same sorts of tests to their employees to receive certain tax breaks, etc. Use of electronic forms would help to prevent this from becoming a logistical nightmare. Patterns of changes in responses to these screening forms could be used to detect less social and more psychologically-harmful threats like Bobble the Clown.
