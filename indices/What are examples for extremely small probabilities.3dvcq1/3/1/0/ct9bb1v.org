You sure? I know a couple of ways where OP doesn't exist.

- Improbable server glitch to make a post with relevant information to this subreddit.

- A virus going around and creating posts. While writing this post may seem likely to be sign of an intelligent AI, I can imagine a strange programmer combing multiple texts on statistics with a very good text analysis to create relevant posts. It'd be hard and blurs the line between sophisticated program and AI, but I think it's possible.

- A cat got on someone's key board and randomly pressed keys in a very strange pattern. Seriously, I've seen a cat sit in front of a computer and press a /single/ key at a time.

There's always alternate explanations. The question is whether or not they're likely enough to bother considering.
