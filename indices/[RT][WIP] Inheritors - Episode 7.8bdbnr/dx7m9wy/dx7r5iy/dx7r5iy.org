thanks for reading it all! i've tried to find a balance between the inheritance nature of his power and him figuring things out on his own and "cheating" so to speak. The later the story goes, the more he'll differentiate himself as he figures out tricks to express his powers in ways Megajoule never did, even if they have the same base.

I should make this clearer in the next episodes, but Houston's particularly bad for vigilante activity, which is why FIS is more shoot on sight, or immediate arrest. In other parts of the country, most vigilantes get a warning: Join OPI/give up vigilante work, or go to prison.
