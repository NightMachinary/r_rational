Hello [[/r/rational][r/rational]] ! Megajoule here. I shared the previous entry last week during the site wide issues and my comment and post got kinda chewed up. Either way, I wanted to share my serial with you, as I've grown really fond of this board the last couple of months.

Inheritors is about Gabe, a clone of the greatest supehero in the world, fighting street level crime like human trafficking, gangs, and drug runners. The serial deals with some topics like depersonalization (something that I've struggled with in my own life) and how we create identities for ourselves. I'm always open to critiques or thoughts.

If you've never read this before, and want to give it a shot, you can start here at [[https://inheritorsserial.com/2018/02/28/episode-one/][Episode One]]
