Feedback after reading chapter 7: I don't really like where the story is going.

Trying to put it into words... I feel the ideologies of the different factions here are too obvious, and presented in a way that lacks nuance.

Like, speaking broadly, it looks like there's something like four factions: the evil sex-trafficking bad guys, the "light side" vigilantes who don't like lethal force, the "dark side" vigilantes who want to get things done above all else, and the Orwellian cops who want order to uphold the law, above personal freedom and sometimes morality.

And it's like... fundamentally, these people don't seem self-aware? On that front, none of the characters felt Level 1 intelligent to me. The Orwellian cops don't seem to realize that they're Orwellian cops, the dark side vigilantes don't seem to realize they're dark-side-ish at all, etc (I'm not putting this very well).

For instance:

#+begin_quote
  “Leave that to the fish, little man.” Krater doesn't slow his advance. “Why would you even want to go after that? There's no glory.”
#+end_quote

This is a very Anime-ish line; the kind of line you'd expect an Anime character to say to indicate to the audience that they're a One-Punch-Man-style glory hound, more than what actual person who is a glory hound would say.

Like, even if the guy is glory-focused, he should still be able to model other people with different priorities, right? If only to avoid saying the wrong things to fans or to the press? He should have a vague "Vigilante" model in his head, with values attached to it, even if these values are inaccurate and non-sensical ("these vigilantes love violence", "these vigilantes hate order"). I don't think "Why don't you go after more glorious targets" is a question this person would ask.

Also, the parts about human trafficking don't feel to me like the author has researched the subject, but it's a sensitive subject and I don't know that much about it myself, so I won't go into detail there.
