I was going to mention KBDH too. It is 100% exactly what they're looking for in terms of 'figures out solution is polyamory, tries to persuade everyone else.' It is the best fanfic focusing specifically on the romance elements of a poly relationship I have read. It does the concept way less badly than most such fics.
