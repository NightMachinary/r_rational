"She's the Man"/Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night" rational fic?

Viola and Sebastian are twins from a faraway kingdom. Viola is a sorceress, Sebastian is a knight. When they get shipwrecked in a chauvinistic enemy kingdom, they become separated, each believing the other to have drowned. Viola must pretend to be a man in order to find employment. She finds work as the personal bodyguard of Duke Orsino, a jolly, insightful and unfortunately sexist older nobleman, who she eventually falls in love with. Duke Orsino however is in love with a countess named Olivia, who falls in love with both twins before she realizes they're different people. Sebastian is generally oblivious to anything involving people and relationships.

Realizing the messy web of unrequited affection and accidental deception between her friends and acquaintances, Viola must find a way to resolve all of their relationship troubles, defend Duke Orsino from assasins, thwart a plot to ruin the reputation of the household of Olivia, not be discovered as a woman or illegal immigrant from a foreign kingdom, find out what REALLY happened to Sebastian when they shipwrecked AND all this without losing her job and current residence in the process.
