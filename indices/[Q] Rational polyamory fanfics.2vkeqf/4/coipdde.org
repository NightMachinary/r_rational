It's not a fanfic, but "The Moon's a Harsh Mistress" features polyamorous relationships, is SciFi, and is mostly rational (not rationalist). A relatively plausible explanation is provided, and at least one healthy family relationship is explored.

Personally I'm skeptical about the concept of long term, committed (in the context) polyamorous relationships, particularly if the relationships form a cyclic graph. Seems like too many opportunities for factions to form with 4+ individuals intertwined.

Granted, given the current cultural norms, it seems like there aren't many opportunities for these situations to arise so it's hard to find evidence one way or another, and the deck is stacked against people who are interested in pursuing such a relationship.

Polygamous relationships usually have an external force (cultural/religious) which probably helps to mediate issues and increase the incentive to resolve problems instead of dissolving the relationship.
