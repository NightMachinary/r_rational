I might be projecting a bit from my peer-group when I say this, but I believe a large portion of the population actually has very weakly-held default values about romance and sexuality; that they're just going with whatever their parents'/society's expectations are of them, and that, if left alone in the wilderness without anyone to tell them what to be, they'd honestly not be able to answer self-reflective questions on the subject of gender or sexual identity.

These people who are just going with the defaults have /very likely/ made at least one flawed assumption about their own preferences (though some might be very /small/ mistakes---like turning out to be bidemiromantic instead of heteroromantic), and experimenting to at least get away from the defaults can only do them good.

Or, to put it another way: everyone experiments in their late highschool/early college years to find their true gender and sexual identity, right? But usually they don't /explore the entire search space/; they just experiment /a little/, never straying far from the origin, and so either learning one or zero new things about themselves.

This feels, to me (as someone who has spent years doing such experiments) similar to the ninja in Naruto who only ever bother to /try/ one technique, or one weapon, without even stopping to think that another technique/weapon might not only be a better fit for them, but also /easier to learn/ than the one they started with.
