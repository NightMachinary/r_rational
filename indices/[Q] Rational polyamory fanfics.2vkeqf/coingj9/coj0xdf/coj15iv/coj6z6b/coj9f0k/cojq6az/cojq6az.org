Effectively, I'm presuming that a sufficiently-powerful AI would be able to "talk you into" being polyamorous, as much as it could "talk you into" letting it out of a box. I'm then substituting "person with a gift for romantic insight" for "sufficiently-powerful AI."

Note that there is a definite difference between "talking someone into" being homosexual---this would require /creating a terminal desire where one doesn't already exist/---and "talking someone into" being polyamorous. Talking someone into polyamory would "merely" require getting them to rerank one terminal goal (enjoying the affection of relationship partners they already /want/ to be with) higher than another terminal goal (avoiding being in a relationship with someone who is in a relationship with someone else.)

If you're /attracted/ to a person who you could be with, save for the fact that they are already dating someone---and you have both of the above-stated values---then there's no way to /maximize/ your happiness in this situation, only to optimize it. If you decide against being with them, you'll be sad that you didn't get to be with them; if you decide to be with them, you'll be jealous that they're with someone else. In neither context do you win 100%.

The cultural bit of this---the assumption embedded in monogamous characters' heads at the start of such a story---is that while the jealousy is something you shouldn't tolerate, the /sadness/ is something you'll just have to put up with. If someone or something can talk the character into flipping those beliefs around---that the loneliness of depravation is intolerable, and jealousy is something you'll have to put up with in order to avoid that pain---then the switch can be made.

Now, some people don't really experience jealousy; and some other people don't really experience romantic attachment. For these people, the problem is already decided one way or the other. But for people in the middle---which, I would hazard, is the vast majority of people, and fictional characters---there are compelling arguments, and social contexts, that can sway them to one side or the other over time.
