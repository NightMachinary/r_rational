That's... not at all what I meant you to get from that comparison.

Less "this thing is really good", and more "So I saw this idea in a book. I don't even need to explain it to you, just show you the book, because you're all already in the right frame of mind to see what I see here. If you don't, never mind."

Don't imagine any form of "polyamory is objectively good" being implied anywhere in the text, by a character, by the narration, anything. Instead, just imagine a bunch of characters who have arrived at the conclusion that "what we're doing /now/ isn't /working/", and so they're willing to try alternatives, /whether they're good or not/---just so long as they're /different./

(And polyamory is /one/ of the things they would try. They would try /many/ things.)

Note that the point of the rational optimizer character wasn't to /persuade them to try/ these things. The rational optimizer just opens up the possibility of a character A. bucking societal trends to even /think of/ trying something nobody else is trying; and B. being really good at /helping people with the problems encountered along the way to implementation/.
