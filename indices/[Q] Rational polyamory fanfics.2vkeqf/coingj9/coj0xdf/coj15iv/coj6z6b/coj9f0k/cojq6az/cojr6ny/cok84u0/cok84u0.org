  Talking someone into homosexual is also just a goal reorientation.
#+end_quote

That is clearly not true, grammatically incorrect, and shows a blatant disrespect for the topic. Those religious extremists who think the opposite are /crazy/ (and usually in the closet themselves), unbalanced enough to try a Clockwork Orange approach to something people are born neurologically wired for.

There is no evidence preferences for polyamory have some simple genetic mechanism like that or require ripping out similarly strongly ingrained responses. Don't attempt to link the two. It's disgusting and completely unsupported by anything you've cited or logically argued.

  You can talk them into valuing not sleeping with people they find unattractive less than trying out new sexual activities, as several homosexual and bisexual men have tried to convince me I would. A mouth's a mouth and all.
#+end_quote

Your personal experiences have no real bearing on this, but I think this shows where your bias is coming from /quite/ clearly. In fact, the actual /words/ used here support OP's original thesis: that it is easier talking someone into something that adds a new dimension to...

  Maybe an AI could convince me to be homosexual. I'd likely also find that rather unpleasant and would likely become very depressed and self hating because I value sleeping with attractive partners quite highly and value an emotional connection with females quite highly.

...which is, in fact, /not/ talking someone into discarding their sexuality. What the...

Okay, this is a basic conceptual issue and I think this post displays your biases with debating this topic.

Monogamy is a complex emotional disinclination, largely linked to socialization, not a simple avoidance or preference mechanism. True, like basic sexual response it is something we may have /some/ varying levels of genetic predisposition towards; /unlike/ sexual orientation (whatever that might be), adding in polyamory doesn't involve ignoring a strong genetic imperative by cutting off a basic lizard-brain response, only dealing rationally with a complex emotional trigger, one mostly socialized. Something modern rationalists are well aware of and often skilled at doing.

You seem to disagree with this, and what I see as OPs basic thesis and brainstorming topics. Instead of a simple statement of disagreement and request for concrete scientific citation (which might not be possible), you've made a huge, unreadable rabbit hole of a comment thread.

Maybe this isn't the place to have this discussion. Or maybe a new post is in order, one that clarifies what "convincing someone to be homosexual" means. In any case, I'm having trouble thinking how I could disagree to any greater extent with your mostly disjointed arguments.

  the jealousy is a *permanent fixture* since you are repeatedly reminded about it
#+end_quote

Ah, that's how. And we see the crux of the problem. You are equating the difficulty of removing or compensating with reactions of sexual jealousy with the difficulty of removing and reorienting sexual preferences and related reactions.

Prove it. Citation seriously needed.
