  And that is... exactly what I was asking if there existed fiction where there was a character that went around to their group of friends and did that for all of them.

Your fic request has a heavy assumption that therapy or talking it out will change innate sexualities. It's a common sort of thing in fanfictions, but it tends to be handled quite poorly because it's using a toolset to solve issues with an extremely limited range- therapy is not normally that effective at dealing with major personality things so when someone monogamous reads it they will just go "I wouldn't react anything like that, that's completely ignoring my values."

  I sort of intended it to refer to the latter; or, more generally, trying to get everyone to open up their sexual and romantic horizons to the widest possible point each person's values would allow, to get more people in more satisfying relationships than would happen otherwise.

While open relationships have increased in popularity over the years statistically there hasn't been an increase in them, unlike with homosexuality and lesbianism that have seen a lot more people come out of the closet. I'm doubtful that there's that many people more who you could effectively convert without massively subverting their values and goals- most of those that might benefit from more edges may already have done so.
