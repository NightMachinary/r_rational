  What solution would be best actually would involve talking to the people, considering their issues, working out how they viewed monogamy and various issues, what their sexuality was like, lots of things. Once you understood their entire personhood you could work out the most optimal solution and which had the lowest risk. Possibly that would be polyamory. Possibly not.

And that is... exactly what I was asking if there existed fiction where there was a character that went around to their group of friends and /did that/ for all of them.

So I guess I wasn't clear in the title. "Polyamory" can have two meanings. One of them is "specifically-more-than-two"-amory. The other is "any-number-of"-amory. I sort of intended it to refer to the latter; or, more generally, trying to get everyone to open up their sexual and romantic horizons to the widest possible point each person's values would allow, to get more people in more satisfying relationships than would happen otherwise.

Spreading Bella's blood on some other girl is totally within the confines of what this person would do. But frankly, I would sort of consider Bella and that girl to be /in a relationship/ of a sort---similar to the one between biological and adoptive parents, or between a sperm donor and a mother.

I guess my more general thesis---the thing this character would think---was "adding nontraditional edges to the relationship graph will allow for the conversion of some negatively-weighted edges to positively-weighted ones." Polyamory is the /simplest/, but not the /only/, example of that.
