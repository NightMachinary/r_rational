  Effectively, I'm presuming that a sufficiently-powerful AI would be able to "talk you into" being polyamorous, as much as it could "talk you into" letting it out of a box. I'm then substituting "person with a gift for romantic insight" for "sufficiently-powerful AI."

I would count that as effective mind rape.

It wouldn't be a good thing. I don't know how well it would work long term, but to imagine a similar situation, suppose an AI wanted to turn everyone into paperclips. I wouldn't see it as a good thing if it could talk people into freeing it or not recaging it.

Likewise if, as I believe, for the majority of people polyamory would be against their values and unpleasant, being able to talk people into it would be bad and would worsen their lives.

  Talking someone into polyamory would "merely" require getting them to rerank one goal (enjoying the affection of relationship partners they already want to be with) higher than another terminal goal (avoiding being in a relationship with someone who is in a relationship with someone else.)

Talking someone into homosexuality is also just a goal reorientation. You can talk them into valuing not sleeping with people they find unattractive less than trying out new sexual activities, as several homosexual and bisexual men have tried to convince me I would. A mouth's a mouth and all.

Maybe an AI could convince me to be homosexual. I'd likely also find that rather unpleasant and would likely become very depressed and self hating because I value sleeping with attractive partners quite highly and value an emotional connection with females quite highly.

Human values aren't a matter of just weighing up values relative to each other. Many values are hardcoded, perhaps by culture, perhaps by biology, and when triggered cause aversion and disgust. If you optimize their values by trying to pressure them into a more optimal solution the end result is just a confusing mix of pain and dark happiness, not a happy ending.

In particular with jealousy and sadness for many, the sadness can be overcome by avoiding the stimuli, the jealousy is a permanent fixture since you are repeatedly reminded about it. Any jealousy related hang ups are triggered repeatedly in a polyamorous relationships. Any std or time worries can be triggered a lot more too.
