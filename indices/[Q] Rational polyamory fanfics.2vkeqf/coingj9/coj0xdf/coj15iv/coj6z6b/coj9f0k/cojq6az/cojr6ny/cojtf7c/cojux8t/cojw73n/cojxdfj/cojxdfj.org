  If you gave someone exposure therapy to take away their pain-avoidance, or perhaps even supplant it with a different reaction, you could potentially end up creating people like Phèdre nó Delaunay---people who are much more vulnerable to abuse, and might also not function as well in "normal" relationships.

Pain avoidance therapy. That sounds horrific. Causing people ever increasing amounts of pain to build up their resilience. I suspect you'd get someone depressed and suicidal like someone in [[/r/chronicpain]] more than you'd get a sexy masochist.

It's not necessarily about outside influences destabilizing the perfect system. Internal problems within the relationship could also cause destabilization. Your system is about using super rationality to convince people to enter into 'elective' goal-function self modification without considering the internal reasons people are for monogamy. Any sort of cognitive therapy or such won't work well if they frequently experience rational pain at internal issues. I severely doubt you could desensitize people to pain as such, or pain from jealousy causing situations.
