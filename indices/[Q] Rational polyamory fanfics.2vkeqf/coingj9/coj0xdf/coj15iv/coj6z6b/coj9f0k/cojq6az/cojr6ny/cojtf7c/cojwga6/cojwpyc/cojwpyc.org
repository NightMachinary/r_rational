  I could have a low exclusivity term and high relationship goal but still be sad because I was getting less physical contact due to time management issues, more stress because there were more points of failure in my relationship and more stressful situations to handle, less intense romance because of time management issues.

Not arguing against this at all. This is why I said that, even in the cases where people would be successfully convinced to try it, it could turn out to not work out. Polyamory is not a guaranteed win! It's a /potential win/ when the positive utility you get from being in given relationships is sufficient to outweigh your own jealousy, /and/ all the implementation costs.

But, to play propaganda mouthpiece for a moment, there are /positive/ side-effects to other terms in each person's utility function, too, than can actually make polyamory /easier/ than the alternative. More shared income sources; more people to raise a child; more chances that any given interest you might have will be shared by at least one partner; etc.

Really, it comes as not being a clear win or a clear loss, but rather a practice whose marginal value for a given group of people has to be individually and separately found.

  The better way to cut the knot is either to clone them, as happened in luminosity, or to make similar versions of her who are similarly attractive.

Sure. But presuming those technologies don't exist in canon, but polyamory /does/, it would at least be better than the alternative of violating the spiritual bond, right?
