A story where a non polyamorous person learnt the true superiority of polyamorousness and then spread the word to his flock who quickly and easily were converted is not really different from my scenario. It would read as incredibly arrogant to many, extremely jarring, and turn them off any rationality. It is very similar to the scenario that that lady noted that polyamory advocates often did.

Comparing polyarmory to not dying further worsens the comparison.
