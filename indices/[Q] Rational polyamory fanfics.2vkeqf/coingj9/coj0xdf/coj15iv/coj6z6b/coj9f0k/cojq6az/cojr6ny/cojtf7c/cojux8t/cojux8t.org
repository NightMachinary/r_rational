  Note that when I say "talk into", I'm meaning a very specific thing---that the AI would be able to give you facts that would force you to convince yourself that that was the better course of action.

Humans are generally aware of various pros and cons of polyamory, an AI couldn't negate your knowledge of those pros and cons. If a person says "I would prefer to have Ramma all to myself as I am rather clingy and I wish to spend lots of time with him/ her" if the AI limits the techniques they can use to ethical ones they won't be able to negate that desire.

That is a major premise of many harem shows. One guy loved by numerous girls who normally all want him to themselves. That's fairly common in the real world too, where a small number of very attractive people are valued by a larger number of people.

  Well, you'd stop, then, wouldn't you?

It depends on how the AI had reordered my goal list. There are lots of things more important to me than happiness. They could have connected those to whatever.

  The human brain is much more plastic than you give it credit for, I think. A phobia is a "hardcoded" value---and yet exposure therapy removes it.

  Any jealousy related hang ups are triggered repeatedly in a polyamorous relationships. Any std or time worries can be triggered a lot more too.

You can exposure away specific scenarios but you can't exposure away the brain's emotions. If a monkey chases you and tries to rip your face off you may be unable to avoid fear because you're in danger even if you have had exposure therapy about monkeys. If you have less time with your partner then you may be unable to avoid jealousy because there is rationally a threat to something you value.

What I suspect would happen would be that he would detach them from their aversions and then situations would occur that would cause them pain and depression and they would continue their actions because he had reordered their goal priorities away from avoidance of harm.

Like if you did exposure therapy on playing with fire.

This super rational person thinks all this aversion to polyamory is just an emotional reaction of jealousy and hasn't considered negative consequences to his victims. That could turn out as badly as a super rational person trying to use cognitive behavioral therapy to remove people's aversion to playing with fire.

Not that playing with fire isn't safe and fun for some. It certainly is for me. I do like setting things on fire. I have successfully set many things on fire and am safer because of my use of fire.
