  On a distinct-but-related note: how would you feel about someone who had hypogonadism that had caused them to reach their 20s while having never gone through puberty?

Am I a trained doctor who has diagnosed this via a blood test or am I a random person who has decided someone else has hypogonadism based on a visual inspection? Have they refused advice from a trained professional who understands and has diagnosed them more testosterone?

I'm not a fan of random armchair doctors diagnosing others and advising them to get expensive and potentially dangerous treatments, like a person seeing a pregnant woman and deciding to tell her to get plastic surgery because they perceive her as fat. I am fine with doctors giving competent advice based on the latest medical knowledge.

  is it a good thing to add an extra term to your utility function? In a eudaimonic sense, adding more utility-function terms that only require human-level-effort to optimize for can seemingly only be a good thing.

I'd prefer to evaluate these things on a case by case basis with science than say, in general, that it can only be a good thing. Most medical and biological conditions are complex things with hosts of different components and symptoms and pros and cons and evaluation of the best one requires careful study.
