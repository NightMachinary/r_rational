  ...Ahem. I think you are grossly misrepresenting both the position of the OP, and the position expressed by [[/u/eaglejarl]] [+1].
#+end_quote

Their positions seem fairly radical to me. I think our main two points of disagreement were with how malleable polyamorous leanings are and how authoritarian it is to 'suggest' or such polyamory in response to relationship problems. We both have different mental images of how this would go. It's not so much that I am trying to misrepresent them, particularly with the second point, it's that I believe people would react in a different manner from how they predict people would react.

  I'm not going to comment on this much except to note that the first reference to the term I've heard of appears here, which dates from the year 1990. If that's what you mean by "recent", then sure.
#+end_quote

The term has been in use for about two and a half decades, yes, but mostly in polyamorous communities. I'm not in polyamorous communities so I haven't encountered the term much outside reddit.

  If you have some argument as to why jealousy as an gut reaction is a good response to have in today's society (why it "expands your list of options", why it "increases your ability to get what you want", etc.), feel free to articulate it. Right now, though, I'm not seeing anything but a flat, unsupported assertion--and a bad one at that.

Your logic and reasoning sides of your brain are also subject to evolution. They are also parts of your brain. It's in your interest to ensure your logic, reasoning are all appropriately triggering according to rational scientific evidence. It's also in your interest to ensure your emotional parts of your brain are appropriately triggering. Both logic and emotion are useful in some situations, not just for motivation. Logic isn't innately more right than emotion, both use different systems to evaluate the world. I prefer to trust science, which is external to our brains, and use that to optimize logic and emotion. The closer something is to direct sensory evidence the better.

This notes some of the positive and negative sides of jealousy.

#+begin_quote
  Yes... except when it comes to relationships, at which point suddenly jealousy is "A-OK!".
#+end_quote

Sexual crushes on friends and teachers were common, and I often saw similar training on appropriate behavior for that. For example a fellow student stalked a student home after some comment was made to a favorite teacher of his whom he had been sexually flirting and his conduct wasn't permitted, he received a suspension.

Jealousy as an emotion is just fear and pain at the thought of the loss of a valuable thing. Training for jealousy with friends, also relationships, carries over to training for relationships with lovers.

  ...Okay? What does this have to do with [[/u/derefr]] 's premise? To quote from the OP:
#+end_quote

That's slightly disengeous of you. Let me put that in context. Me.

#+begin_quote
  Pushing your sexuality on others is a popular goal of fics, but, as with ones which force everyone to be homosexual or straight, is morally iffy.

#+begin_quote
  So, here are three different kinds of changes that one might make to a character:

  Alter someone's personality. For example, make Naruto not dumb, or Kakashi not lazy. Alter them physically. For example, give Naruto a byakugan and/or a sharingan, or genderbend one or more characters. Alter their sexuality. For example, make them (hetero|homo|a|poly)sexual, or make them polyamorous.

  Please explain which of these, in your opinion, are morally okay and why.
#+end_quote

Eaglejarl saying he didn't feel I answered his question.

#+begin_quote
  You made the assertion that writing a monogamous character as polyamorous is "morally iffy." I asked you to explain why, and to compare and contrast against other kinds of character changes. Did you not understand my question?
#+end_quote

Me again.

#+begin_quote
  I didn't actually make that assertion. I'm fine with changing characters to be polyamorous and other changes. What I am against are conversions in story, not before the story is written. In our world there is an extensive history of people attempting to force people to change their sexuality and it's often lead to depression, suicidal behavior, and severe problems.

  I'm also mildly against erasing sexualities or genders or races. Bisexuals are often erased, black people likewise, or only presented in a negative light. When one group is eliminated entirely that's often the result of prejudice though there are exceptions.
#+end_quote

I was answering one of eaglejarl's questions, not replying to OP. Eaglejarl explicitly talked about altering people's sexualities.

On OP's intentions- as I understand it, his premise was that a rational character realized that their monogamy was serving them poorly by being inferior to polyamory, tried to change, and then tried to convince others who had some sort of feeling that they had a problem that that reason was due to them not fully exploring their sexuality (in a nice, non pushy way) and try to show them the benefits of branching out and that this would be successful thing because most people hadn't explored their sexualities. He would then try to alter their sexualities with cognitive behavioural therapy and whatever else worked.

I see this as extremely authoritarian. Many humans have a vague dissatisfaction and sense things are wrong and so are open to any person with a solution (more nodes has to be superior, this graph says so!). This sense is frequently used by snake oil salesmen to push some non effective treatment that hurts their victims.

Rational charity shouldn't be about just asking questions as that's just anecdotal evidence, it should be about doing measured scientific studies to see what problems are common and then finding cheap and cost effective solutions to those problems that have a proven efficacy. Lack of polyamory is not a proven problem CBT is not a proven way to enable polyamory polyamory hasn't been proved to be generally superior to monogamy.

Rephrased.

While I'd be fine with an exploration of a rational protagonist optimizing romance throughout this discussion you've mostly been implying that jealousy is an irrational emotion that should be overcome for greater happiness. You haven't paid much attention to the possible failure of polyamory due to timing issues or std issues that people commonly worry. These issues often cause jealousy and people are rationally worried about them and so in promoting polygamy among people who strongly wanted to avoid those problems you'd worsen their lives. As such the majority of the experiments to promote polyamory would likely be failures, just as people would fail if they tried to convince you that you being asexual would better fulfil your values "Be happy myself" and "Make my partner happy."

  Rather, you have been using slippery, debate-team-style rhetoric to dodge his (very good, IMO) questions. Such tactics might slide if this were a debate competition, but on a subreddit called [[/r/rational]], I would have hoped for better discussion than this sort of thing.
#+end_quote

You managed to show me I was doing this by quoting me out of context and by me not explicitly saying that jealousy training for friends applied to jealousy for lovers. I don't feel it's an accurate accusation.
