...Ahem. I think you are grossly misrepresenting both the position of the OP, and the position expressed by [[/u/eaglejarl]]. My own position is somewhat more sympathetic to their arguments than to yours, so I'm going to attempt a point-by-point rebuttal of your post. Let's see...

#+begin_quote
  Polyamory is a fairly recent term that's popular among certain subgroups but normally when people talk about having multiple partners they refer to polygamy in my experience. It's like cis-sexual- most people can't be bothered to call people cis women in common conversation because it's an uncommon term. I'm fine doing it for this conversation though.
#+end_quote

I'm not going to comment on this much except to note that the first reference to the term /I've/ heard of appears [[http://www.paganicon.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/A-Boquet-of-Lovers.pdf][here]], which dates from the year 1990. If that's what you mean by "recent", then sure.

  I personally see emotions as something in your brain that can work well or work poorly, just like logic. They can help you or stop you in getting what you want. They often expand your list of options and increase your ability to get what you want.
#+end_quote

Er... what? An emotion is an evolutionary adaptation, a shortcut mechanism in your neural networks to get you to behave in a certain way. As an example: you feel anger at a perceived slight because in the ancestral environment, anger was a useful emotion when it came to punishing defectors in Iterated Prisoner's Dilemmas. Evolution is mindless; it does not promote rationality as an end in and of itself. If emotions propagated through natural selection, it means only that they were useful to survival and reproduction in the ancestral environment. /Nothing more./

This means that emotions are /not logical/. They are /not rational/. Emotions can be used to /fuel/ rationality, because they have a powerful effect on your brain which you can use to kickstart yourself into doing something, but they are /not in and of themselves/ rational. Basing your values entirely on your gut emotional responses will reduce you to little more than an animal, acting purely on instinct. If you have some argument as to why jealousy as an gut reaction is a good response to have in today's society (why it "expands your list of options", why it "increases your ability to get what you want", etc.), feel free to articulate it. Right now, though, I'm not seeing anything but a flat, unsupported assertion--and a bad one at that.

#+begin_quote
  Jealousy is an extremely common emotion- what do you do when the other kid gets more attention from the teacher? What do you do when your friend plays more with someone else? People are trained not to make a scene for these common things.
#+end_quote

Yes... except when it comes to relationships, at which point suddenly jealousy is "A-OK!". If your claim is that jealousy is not tolerated by society, much as anger isn't, then this claim seems blatantly false where romantic relationships are concerned. (Whether or not social stigmas exist against jealousy in /other/ contexts is entirely irrelevant to the current discussion.) On the other hand, if your claim is that it is somehow "rational" to be jealous when your romantic partner engages in "extra-relational" affairs, while it is /not/ "rational" to be likewise jealous if your friend plays more with someone else, then I should note that you have not provided a single shred of evidence in support of this claim. Either way, you're standing on shaky ground here.

#+begin_quote
  You noted that anger was acceptable as a result of seeing your partner cheating. As such, anger is acceptable in certain situations. As I previously noted, I disagree with your assertion that people get no training on avoiding jealousy. I got lots of it at school, I know many others who also did.
#+end_quote

Again, you conveniently take this argument outside of a relationship context, which is where [[/u/eaglejarl]] [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2vkeqf/q_rational_polyamory_fanfics/cojm4do][originally]] made said argument. I'm not sure if you just didn't understand his point or if you deliberately took said point out of context, but in the former case I'd recommend reading people's posts more closely, and in the latter case... well, that's really disingenuous of you.

#+begin_quote
  I didn't actually make that assertion. I'm fine with changing characters to be polyamorous and other changes. What I am against are conversions in story, not before the story is written. In our world there is an extensive history of people attempting to force people to change their sexuality and it's often lead to depression, suicidal behavior, and severe problems.

  I'm also mildly against erasing sexualities or genders or races. Bisexuals are often erased, black people likewise, or only presented in a negative light. When one group is eliminated entirely that's often the result of prejudice though there are exceptions.
#+end_quote

...Okay? What does this have to do with [[/u/derefr]]'s premise? To quote from the OP:

#+begin_quote
  What I've never seen is a story where some characters start as really monogamous---not just "lipstick monogamous"---but where this is causing them lots of pain that could be solved by them being not monogamous---and then it occurs to one character to just not be monogamous, who then starts trying to get everyone else on-board with this with every shred of pain that might entail. An author-granted gift for romantic insight, in this case, merely ensures that this venture won't be doomed before it even begins.
#+end_quote

This is a description of a situation in which characters have an explicit preference for monogamy, but decide to /try out/ polygamy because /they are convinced to do so/ by a /rational character/, most likely because a relationship graph involving polyamorous nodes would have more connections and thereby be more optimal than a purely monogamous graph. /That/ is what I, and (I presume) most other people on this subreddit are talking about when we say "rationality". Convincing people to try a different way of doing things, because it seems plausibly better or more logical. (It might not /actually/ be better, but the point is to at least be /open to consideration/.) /That's/ rationality. /Not/ a instinctive gut emotional reaction of "OH NO HE SLEPT WITH ANOTHER WOMAN KILLLLLLL!!!!!!!"

/Note also/ that there is /not a single mention/ of "conversions in story", "erasing sexualities", or whatever the heck you seem to have been reading into this discussion. Whatever you meant by the quoted section above, it has very little to do with this particular thread.

#+begin_quote
  While I'd be fine with an exploration of the issue throughout this discussion you've mostly been implying that jealousy is an irrational emotion that should be overcome for greater happiness. You haven't paid much attention to the intensity of the values and emotions of those with values separate from yours. The majority of the experiments would likely be failures, just as people would fail if they tried to convince you that you being asexual would better fulfil your values "Be happy myself" and "Make my partner happy."
#+end_quote

This paragraph is written in such a fashion that I can't quite extract a coherent meaning out of it. If convenient, please rephrase.

#+begin_quote
  Theoretically you could have a story where the rational protagonist tried to convince everyone that sex made people be unhappy and they'd be better off if they managed their lust, but I would have the same criticisms.
#+end_quote

I would be fine with such a story... /if the protagonist actually considered the issue rationally and came to his/her conclusion using sound logical reasoning/. However, most stories with a premise like that are /not/ meant to advocate logical approaches to emotionally charged issues, but rather meant as a mouthpiece for the author to espouse whatever views he/she holds on sexuality. Therefore, were I to encounter such a story in actuality, I would most likely give it a pass, simply because the probability of it being propaganda (as opposed to the probability of it being a genuinely rational story) is far too high.

I'll conclude by saying this: you don't really seem to have been engaging with [[/u/eaglejarl]]'s actual arguments. Rather, you have been using slippery, debate-team-style rhetoric to dodge his (very good, IMO) questions. Such tactics might slide if this were a debate competition, but on a subreddit called [[/r/rational]], I would have hoped for better discussion than this sort of thing.
