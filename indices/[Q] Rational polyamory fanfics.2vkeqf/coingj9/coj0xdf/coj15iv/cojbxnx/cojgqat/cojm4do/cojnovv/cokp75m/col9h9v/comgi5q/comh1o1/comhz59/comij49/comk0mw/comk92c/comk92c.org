I'm pro transgender rights and pro people having the right to modify themselves in non harmful ways. To me it's really important getting the person's consent to do whatever procedure to alter their utility function. We alter our utility function whenever we eat so it's normal. It's not especially important how random people alter their own utility functions to me, hence why I was strongly focusing on the consent.

My thoughts on whether to do it are a pro con analysis based on scientific knowledge. It may be good or bad depending on the situation. If it's good I have no issue doing it and no emotional bar to doing it. I can easily enough imagine utility functions where I'd want to do it and utility functions where I wouldn't.
