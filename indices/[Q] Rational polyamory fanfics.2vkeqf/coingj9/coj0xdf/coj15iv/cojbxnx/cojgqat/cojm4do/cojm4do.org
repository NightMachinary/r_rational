    "polyamory" is not the same thing as "polygamy"
  #+end_quote

  Yeah, I guess. I don't really care about the issue enough to distinguish between them but you are right.
#+end_quote

...you don't care enough about the issue to be accurate? Then why are you having this conversation?

#+begin_quote
  You are mostly seeing emotions and something to be dealt with, I and many others see them as often rational expressions of internal logic.
#+end_quote

I think there is value in being able to manage your emotions; if you can't, they will control you and thereby narrow your list of possible actions, which will most likely prevent you from getting what you want in the most efficient way possible.

On this subject, your initial comment (whitespace ellided) was:

#+begin_quote
  Given the commonness of jealousy, [creating multiple overlapping pairings] wouldn't work. You'd have to have some sort of brain washing or mind rape device which would put the story in an unusually dark category.
#+end_quote

You are claiming that jealousy exists ergo it is not possible to have multiple overlapping pairings without mind raping people. I'm trying to explain that yes, it IS possible, if people want to do it and are willing to make the effort of controlling their jealousy.

#+begin_quote
  Most can manage them [their emotions] if they had to but they have no desire to manage them.
#+end_quote

You are using "emotions" where I'm actually only talking about "jealousy." I'm pretty sure that what you mean is jealousy, though, so I'll respond to that: you're right. Most people don't have the desire to control their jealousy, nor do they have the training. I've actually said this multiple times now.

#+begin_quote
  The sort of assumption that others are different for purely irrational reasons and any views they have are purely a matter of their deficiency in reasoning is rarely an accurate view.
#+end_quote

I'm pretty sure I've actually never said that it is irrational to be monogamous. Nor do I actually believe that.

  #+begin_quote
    #+begin_example
      It's not okay to yell at people in public.
    #+end_example
  #+end_quote

  Unless others do things to you or your partner that are socially unacceptable, like, say, sleep with your partner.
#+end_quote

I literally said that people view it as okay if people yell and/or get physical due to their partner sleeping around. (Actually, I said "macking", but sleeping with other people is included by implication.) In fact, you even quote the part where I said that in your very next sentence.

I'm unclear why you're using this as a counterpoint.

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    #+begin_example
      If A sees their partner B macking with someone else and A therefore causes a scene, B will receive censure[...]
    #+end_example
  #+end_quote

  You're not really supporting your case- as you have noted people accept violence if it's a socially sanctioned cause. If you make a good scene when your partner talks to a store employee people will socially censure you. People treat jealousy like anger when the jealousy is irrational.
#+end_quote

You are, at best, missing my point. Anger is not acceptable. Jealousy is. Ergo, people get trained in anger management, but not in jealousy management.

#+begin_quote
  #+begin_example
    So, here are three different kinds of changes that one might make to a character:
  #+end_example

  I don't object to changing the personalities of people in stories, though 'mediating' their personalities to be different, realistically, is unlikely to work. If Naruto is bi making him be asexual through rational reasoning because sex is unproductive is unlikely to work.
#+end_quote

That wasn't the question I asked. You made the assertion that writing a monogamous character as polyamorous is "morally iffy." I asked you to explain why, and to compare and contrast against other kinds of character changes. Did you not understand my question?

#+begin_quote
  Suppose you highly value avoiding disease. If your partner sleeps with others then that value will often be harder to achieve. Suppose you highly value having your partner available often. If they are often attending to someone else then you'll have them be available less often.
#+end_quote

No argument on either of these points. However, most people have other values as well...things like "make my partner happy" or simply "be happy myself." The point that I've been trying to make through this entire discussion is that:

1. It is possible that a monogamous person could decide that they value the "be happy myself" goal higher than they value the "be monogamous" goal; and,
2. They might therefore decide to experiment with polyamory because they think that it could help them achieve the "be happy myself" goal; and,
3. If they make that decision, they will encounter issues caused by jealousy; and,
4. That jealousy can be managed such that they are able to maintain the polyamorous relationship in a way that they find satisfying; and,

That's it. That's all I'm saying. I am not saying that polyamory is better, or that monogamy is irrational, or anything else. Just those four things. As it happens, I have actual real-world experience with all of these things being true, and I've shared that fact with you, which makes it puzzling to me that you're arguing against them.

For the record: I agree that not everyone will be successful when they experiment with polyamory, either in the real world or in a well-written fic for this prompt. Also, I agree that some poly relationships that are solely composed of poly people will fail, just like some mono relationships will fail.

[[/u/derefr]] is, as I understand it, calling for a fic in which the protagonist attempts to convince people to try polyamory and people actually try it. S/he is /not/ calling for a fic in which it works because /plot/, but for a fic that actually explores the issues.

You, Nepene, seem to be asserting that no such series of events could possibly happen absent mindraping everyone. I'm trying to explain why the real world does not support your view.

[[/u/derefr]], if I've misrepresented your prompt, please correct me.
