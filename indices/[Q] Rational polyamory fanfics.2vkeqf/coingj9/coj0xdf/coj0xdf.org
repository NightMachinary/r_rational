  Given the commonness of jealousy, this wouldn't work.

I'm unsure what your referent is for "this", but from context I'm understanding it to mean "polyamorous relationships." If you mean something else, please say so.

Polyamorous relationships, including marriages, exist. I know one triad who have been married for over three decades -- society won't give them paperwork, obviously, but in every other sense they are married.

"Oh, jealousy makes polyamory impossible" is a common objection, and one that shows little thought. Jealousy is an emotion, not an unstoppable kaiju god. Anger is also an emotion; the difference is that we all receive plenty of training in how to manage anger.

Society provides anger management skills by default, but does not provide jealous management skills. In fact, society goes a fair bit out of its way to claim that jealousy cannot be managed -- see practically every Hollywood movie ever.

Monogamous people do not seek out training in how to manage jealousy. Poly people deal with it all the time, and it's not hard: Recognize you're jealous. Take a deep breath. Use your words. Use "I feel" statements instead of "you are" statements. It's not rocket science.

  You'd have to have some sort of brain washing or mind rape device

Are you saying that the only way people could have a polyamorous relationship is after being mind-raped? If so, that's just offensive.
