  Though in the end both are assumptions and when it come to the human psych there aren't that many things which are definite so i wouldn't say its impossible for that to work, the author will just need to show model of the human mind that on one hand will enable "conversion" and on the other will not contradict with the reality where such relationships are so rare.

I think that would be a fairly interesting premise for a story. Don't you?

(Also, considering the fact that people in polyamorous relationships in real life have not reported being less satisfied with the quality of their romantic lives overall, I don't think it's an ingrained thing. The whole issue of there being far more monogamous people than polyamorous ones seems more like a societal-norm-type issue than anything else, although of course that doesn't change the fact that it does exist. It does, however, raise the probability that someone could be "convinced out of monogamous practices", though such a conversion would probably be extremely difficult and would, as a result, require an extremely skilled writer to pull off.)
