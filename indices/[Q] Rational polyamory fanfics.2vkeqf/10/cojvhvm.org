One thought that the discussion so far has prompted is:

How do you demonstrate that a character *is* /really monogamous/? Because of the sociological 'default' status of monogamy, you certainly can't take simple assertions, actions, or thoughts that are stereotypically 'expected' as evidence. The characters would have to be put in a position where non-monogamy occupies a clearly privileged position, in societal terms and in terms of fulfilling their values.. except they reject it because they value monogamy sufficiently (and of course, that would also have to be made crystal clear.. that the rejection was not instead because X would be disappointed, or because of rebelliousness, etc).

Most universes you might look at for fanfic don't even TRY to do this (Ranma 1/2 being no exception since it runs on slapstick). It's basically only universes with invented species who have invented biological drives(eg. Twilight) where you can actually know what you're working with.

(or author fiat, but that is ugly and often inconsistent with canon)

IMO being able to establish this would be pretty important to the story premise working.
