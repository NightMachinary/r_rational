I'm presuming here that one of the constraints is that there are, at the very least, one set of two people who both are attracted to one currently-monogamous person who would be okay with either of them, but not both; and where both of the suitors have declared a deontological "spiritual bond" or somesuch that prevents them from being maximally happy unless they get to spend /some/ time with that person in a relationship context. (This is a pretty ubiquitous setup in romance settings, no? Without it, things are /too/ easy.)

Outside of polyamory (or posthuman multiple instantiation), the only way this kind of story usually ends is in tragedy for at least one party, if not all.
