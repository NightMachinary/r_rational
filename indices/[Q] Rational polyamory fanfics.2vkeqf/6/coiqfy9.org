I don't think it qualifies as rational, but I have read one Ranma fic somewhat close to what you describe. It's called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/804058/1/Couch-Trips][Couch Trips]], and the elevator pitch is "after the end of the series, Ranma meets a psychologist and begins getting therapy." It's polyamorous and you can see from the pitch why this reminds me of it.

But it's much more of a general romance/drama sort of fic and less of a rational one.
