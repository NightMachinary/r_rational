  I think that would be a fairly interesting premise for a story. Don't you?
#+end_quote

sure, if done properly it could defenitly be interesting, though my general impression would be that if i was a rational character in such a situation i would not (rationally) assume that polyamourous relationships are the solution, unless i either had background in psychology and had reasons(research?) to believe that polyamourous relations are indeed something which is reasonable for people to learn to accept.

Or if i were such a character and i knew some people(anecdotal evidence) that were poly, and i wasn't fully rational, meaning i would have made the mistake of assuming that just because i know something it is somehow applicable to other people even though i wasn't a psychologist and didnt do\read research that implied it is correct..

#+begin_quote
  Also, considering the fact that people in polyamorous relationships in real life have not reported being less satisfied with the quality of their romantic lives overall, I don't think it's an ingrained thing
#+end_quote

Why would ingrained imply they should be less satisfied? are gay\bi people less satisfied with their relationships?

#+begin_quote
  The whole issue of there being far more monogamous people than polyamorous ones seems more like a societal-norm-type issue than anything else
#+end_quote

As i said i accept that as a possibility, but i find it to be less likely to be the explanation by itself. Meaning i would presume there are practical reasons that made it the societal norm, and would not be quick to dismiss them without understanding them..

#+begin_quote
  It does, however, raise the probability that someone could be "convinced out of monogamous practices"
#+end_quote

If we assume that it is not ingrained it indeed makes it possible to convince people, i don't know if by itself that would be more likely to succeed then not, i tend to believe the probability of success would be lower then for failure, simply because if it was more likely to convince people of polyamoury, and we know for a fact there are people who are polyamourous then it would stand to reason that the public would slowly be converted. Seeing as that is not the case, unless we isolate some specific aspects that makes the conversion more likely for the given scenario(for example if you have a bunch of people that live on an island and thus are not as effected by societal norms, such as in [[http://myanimelist.net/anime/1722/Nagasarete_Airantou][Nagasarete Airantou]]) then i would have to assume the conversion would fail,or at the very least that even if people gave it a try eventually they would decide it is not for them.

#+begin_quote
  such a conversion would probably be extremely difficult and would, as a result, require an extremely skilled writer to pull off
#+end_quote

As you say, as long as the writer is good enough it could definitely be good, yup..
