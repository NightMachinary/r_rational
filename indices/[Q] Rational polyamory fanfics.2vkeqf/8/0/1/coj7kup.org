I get the impression that Nepene's suggestion is not that polyamorous relationships are impossible, but that they are not likely for people that are not inclined in that direction. In a way you could compare it to sexual orientation, and you're rebuttal of showing that polyamorous relationships do in fact exist in real life doesn't really negate that..

Though in the end both are assumptions and when it come to the human psych there aren't that many things which are definite so i wouldn't say its impossible for that to work, the author will just need to show model of the human mind that on one hand will enable "conversion" and on the other will not contradict with the reality where such relationships are so rare.
