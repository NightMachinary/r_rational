  The story prompt was about the idea of converting already monogamous people who presumably have lots of jealousy and such into polygamous people.
#+end_quote

First of all, "polyamory" is not the same thing as "polygamy", although that's a common mistake. The OP specifically asked about poly/amory/, not polygamy.

In my opinion (YMMV) there are three primary reasons that polyamorous relationship are so rare:

1. Most people don't encounter the idea
2. If they do encounter it, most people believe that jealousy cannot be managed, so they don't try
3. If they do try, then once they get into the relationship and experience jealousy, they lack something that would be necessary to make it work -- perhaps their communication skills aren't up to the difficult task of having an "I am unhappy about the current situation and want something to change" conversation in a way that is productive instead of escalating the situation. Perhaps they lack a strong desire to make it work, so they don't try. Perhaps they don't realize that that glow of New Relationship Energy is going to fade, and that it's not worth sacrificing a valuable existing relationship because of it. It could be a lot of things.

The story prompt deals with most of these issues. It assumes that the protagonist tells the other characters about the idea, and that s/he can convince people to at least try it. That deals with problems 1 and 2. Presumably, the protagonist then provides ongoing help in making it work -- most likely serving as a mediator during difficult conversations, providing support so people can process their emotions offline, etc. That won't necessarily fix point 3, but it will help a lot.

  People receive a small amount of training as a child to avoid anger at minor things and to avoid public tantrums, though they receive little training to manage avoiding anger at things that are rationally enraging.
#+end_quote

Actually, society provides a /lot/ of support for the idea that expressing anger above a fairly minimal level isn't allowed. It's not okay to punch people because you're angry. It's not okay to yell at people in public. It's not okay to curse at your spouse. It's not okay to yell at your boss. It's frowned upon to yell at your subordinates.

Do these things happen? Sure. In general, however, people receive social censure for doing them.

None of this applies to jealousy. If A sees their partner B macking with someone else and A therefore causes a scene, B will receive censure and people will think nothing of A's angry outburst. At worst, if A becomes physical people will say "well, s/he shouldn't have done that I guess, but I totally understand."

Anger and jealousy are trained very differently in our society, and receive very different levels and types of reinforcement.

  Since it's a fairly publicly ingrained and likely partially genetic emotion changing it requires substantial reworking of the mind,
#+end_quote

Anger is also publicly ingrained and likely partially genetic. And yes, we all manage it.

#+begin_quote
  Taking a deep breath and saying I feel doesn't change that much
#+end_quote

The fact that people can have arguments with each other without cursing and / or punching each others' lights out tends to indicate that emotions can, in fact, be managed. If you don't think that "take a deep breath" is sufficient, that's great -- there's a ton of other well-known techniques, the simplest of which is "go off by yourself until you're not so strongly in the grip of the emotion, then come back and have the discussion."

My point is that (a) anger and jealousy are, in many respects, the same thing, yet (b) they are treated differently by society. If you disagree with either of those ideas, please explain why.

  Pushing your sexuality on others is a popular goal of fics, but, as with ones which force everyone to be homosexual or straight, is morally iffy.
#+end_quote

So, here are three different kinds of changes that one might make to a character:

1. Alter someone's personality. For example, make Naruto not dumb, or Kakashi not lazy.
2. Alter them physically. For example, give Naruto a byakugan and/or a sharingan, or genderbend one or more characters.
3. Alter their sexuality. For example, make them (hetero|homo|a|poly)sexual, or make them polyamorous.

Please explain which of these, in your opinion, are morally okay and why.

  If rationally you dislike when someone sleeps with your partner
#+end_quote

First of all, why is it rational to not want your partner to sleep with someone else? You're assuming the premise.

It might help to read up on [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyamory#Compersion][compersion]]. The fact that there is actually a word for this is strong evidence that it exists and weak evidence that it can be trained.

  (for example because you want them to spend more time on you)
#+end_quote

Getting your partner to spend more time with you is as simple as saying "Honey, I'm feeling left out right now, and I'd like it if you would spend more time with me. Could we <X>?" X might be "schedule a couple of date nights next week?" or "go off on a cruise together" or whatever.

If your partner says "no, I'm not willing to do that for you," *then* it's rational to be angry, but that's not directly an issue with your partner having a relationship with someone else, it's an issue with them not being willing to support and care for you.

  you taking a deep breathe won't change that.
#+end_quote

My experience and the experience of literally tens of thousands of polyamorous people disagrees with you.
