  As such the majority of the experiments to promote polyamory would likely be failures, just as people would fail if they tried to convince you that you being asexual would better fulfil your values "Be happy myself" and "Make my partner happy."

On a distinct-but-related note: how would you feel about someone who had hypogonadism that had caused them to reach their 20s while having never gone through puberty? How would you feel about someone else suggesting that getting hormone supplementation therapy would be an optimization of that person's life?

There's a very underexplored subfield of epistemic rationality, concerning how to "value" various self-modifications. This question in particular basically comes down to: is it a good thing to add an extra term to your utility function? In a eudaimonic sense, adding more utility-function terms that only require human-level-effort to optimize for can seemingly only be a good thing.

On the other hand, while puberty is a process that introduces an otherwise-optional utillity-function term, so is drug addiction. We have very different feelings about these: while sexual adults claim that they would rather be sexual, and asexual adults claim that they would rather be asexual, both drug addicts and non-drug-addicts claim they would rather be non-drug-addicts. That might say something, but I'm not sure precisely what.
