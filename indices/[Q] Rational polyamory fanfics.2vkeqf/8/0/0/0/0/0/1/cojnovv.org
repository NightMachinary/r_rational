  ...you don't care enough about the issue to be accurate? Then why are you having this conversation?
#+end_quote

Polyamory is a fairly recent term that's popular among certain subgroups but normally when people talk about having multiple partners they refer to polygamy in my experience. It's like cis-sexual- most people can't be bothered to call people cis women in common conversation because it's an uncommon term. I'm fine doing it for this conversation though.

  I think there is value in being able to manage your emotions; if you can't, they will control you and thereby narrow your list of possible actions, which will most likely prevent you from getting what you want in the most efficient way possible.
#+end_quote

I personally see emotions as something in your brain that can work well or work poorly, just like logic. They can help you or stop you in getting what you want. They often expand your list of options and increase your ability to get what you want.

  Most people don't have the desire to control their jealousy, nor do they have the training. I've actually said this multiple times now.
#+end_quote

Jealousy is an extremely common emotion- what do you do when the other kid gets more attention from the teacher? What do you do when your friend plays more with someone else? People are trained not to make a scene for these common things.

  You are, at best, missing my point. Anger is not acceptable. Jealousy is. Ergo, people get trained in anger management, but not in jealousy management.
#+end_quote

You noted that anger was acceptable as a result of seeing your partner cheating. As such, anger is acceptable in certain situations. As I previously noted, I disagree with your assertion that people get no training on avoiding jealousy. I got lots of it at school, I know many others who also did.

#+begin_quote
  You made the assertion that writing a monogamous character as polyamorous is "morally iffy." I asked you to explain why, and to compare and contrast against other kinds of character changes. Did you not understand my question?
#+end_quote

I didn't actually make that assertion. I'm fine with changing characters to be polyamorous and other changes. What I am against are conversions in story, not before the story is written. In our world there is an extensive history of people attempting to force people to change their sexuality and it's often lead to depression, suicidal behavior, and severe problems.

I'm also mildly against erasing sexualities or genders or races. Bisexuals are often erased, black people likewise, or only presented in a negative light. When one group is eliminated entirely that's often the result of prejudice though there are exceptions.

#+begin_quote
  No argument on either of these points. However, most people have other values as well...things like "make my partner happy" or simply "be happy myself." The point that I've been trying to make through this entire discussion is that:
#+end_quote

While I'd be fine with an exploration of the issue throughout this discussion you've mostly been implying that jealousy is an irrational emotion that should be overcome for greater happiness. You haven't paid much attention to the intensity of the values and emotions of those with values separate from yours. The majority of the experiments would likely be failures, just as people would fail if they tried to convince you that you being asexual would better fulfil your values "Be happy myself" and "Make my partner happy."

Theoretically you could have a story where the rational protagonist tried to convince everyone that sex made people be unhappy and they'd be better off if they managed their lust, but I would have the same criticisms.
