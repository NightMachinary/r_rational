You seem to keep emphasizing the prescriptivist aspect of my questions, when I'm just trying to use it as a framing so that you don't have to try to imagine yourself as someone with a different utility-function than yourself (nearly impossible), but merely someone who knows a person with a different utility-function than yourself.

Let me put it another way: you /are/ the previously-described friend. You are now 20. You move to a new city, get a new GP, and they suggest that you could indeed start on hormone supplementation if you wanted to go through puberty after all, but otherwise you will experience no negative health effects as such---your hormone levels are enough to take care of osteogenesis et al, just not enough to kickstart the puberty process. Presuming you are completely informed and the doctor has not made any errors, what is your thought process in deciding whether to flip the self-modification switch?
