Your 1-4 was exactly my premise, yes.

As well, I was assuming that nobody in the situation was "polyamorous by default" or "poly-curious" or however you'd term it.

I was instead assuming that a bunch of monogamous people, at least one of whom is rational (in this case meaning "tries to optimize for their own happiness even at the expense of some of their cherished self-beliefs"), and the others of whom are at least able to be swayed by rational argument to try things (like e.g. HPMOR!Draco is), all end up /giving polyamory a try/ because they've been through hell for years trying the alternative (everyone in the relationship isocahedron pining for---and fighting one-another for---affection, and nobody ending up happy) and are ready to try something, anything, different.

It might not work out! They might, one or all, give up! It might anneal down into single stable pairings with some open relationships and some extra friends-with-benefits and some overlapping asexual hetero-/homo-romantic partnerships and so forth, out of everyone's mutual concern for actually trying to make things work out. But they /are/ trying, because they've decided to stop doing the alternative to trying.

Because, you know, that's what polyamory is in real life.

(On a lighter note, insofar as a rationalist might see an advantage in "killing Death", /rational polyamory/ would be the idea that there are many seemingly "unfair" advantages that can be gained by /killing Jealousy/ wherever it is encountered. There are a lot of stories where the heroes mostly win by solving coordination problems that the villains cannot; indeed, many "adventure" stories containing a heroic couple justify their mutual success by pointing out the trust they give one another, that allows them each to far go out on a limb assuming the other will be doing the right-and-necessary thing without them. When this dynamic is expanded beyond a couple, it usually becomes a "team"---for example, SG-1 in Stargate---but there's no reason you couldn't have e.g. a poly triad that all adventure under an assumption of underlying trust. It'd just be, y'know... an /unfair advantage./)
