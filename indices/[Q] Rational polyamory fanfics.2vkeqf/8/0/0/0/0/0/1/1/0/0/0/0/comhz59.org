Let's say this is your friend. The friend told you their doctor diagnosed them with hypogonadism when they were 12. The doctor asked the friend's /parents/ what they wanted to do, and the parents said they'd just let their child's body do what it does without trying to change anything. So, now, your friend is 20 and has no secondary sexual characteristics, no sexual attraction to anything, doesn't really "get" romance, etc. Also, they never had a growth spurt, so they still look kind of the way they did when they were 13.

Would you suggest to this friend that, now that the choice is in their hands rather than their parents', they might want to talk to their doctor about reconsidering the previously-discarded option of hormone supplementation, if it is by any chance not too late?

Which exposes the underlying question: are they better going through puberty, or not?
