This is the first chapter of a fanfiction of what I suspect would happen if you tried this out in real life, incidentally. It more or less demonstrates how I suspect it would happen- someone moderately charismatic presenting an idea to a group without much actual testing. In the next chapter I'd show how I'd think people would accept, with uncertain people who had vague misgivings about their life accepting his offer with the hopes that something, anything, would make them better off.
