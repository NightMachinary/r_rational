There are often negative symptoms of hypoganadism like fatigue, difficulty concentrating, muscle weakness, loss of bone mass, and hot flushes. A doctor would probably be better suited to address those and give them advice. I would generally, if they had problems, recommend they see a doctor over recommending they follow my advice. Different conditions require different treatments. I may note the dangers.

If their only symptom was lack of secondary sexual characteristics and they had no desire to change that I wouldn't push them to.

  Which exposes the underlying question: are they better going through puberty, or not?

I believe that should be their decision, unless their decision is causing them obvious pain or suffering.

Edit. But that does give me an idea for the story.
