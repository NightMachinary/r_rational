  First of all, "polyamory" is not the same thing as "polygamy", although that's a common mistake. The OP specifically asked about polyamory, not polygamy.
#+end_quote

Yeah, I guess. I don't really care about the issue enough to distinguish between them but you are right.

#+begin_quote
  Most people don't encounter the idea
#+end_quote

Not in so many words, but it's fairly widely known that some men want to sleep with multiple women and that issue comes up a lot.

#+begin_quote
  If they do encounter it, most people believe that jealousy cannot be managed, so they don't try
#+end_quote

You are mostly seeing emotions and something to be dealt with, I and many others see them as often rational expressions of internal logic. Most can manage them if they had to but they have no desire to manage them. The sort of assumption that others are different for purely irrational reasons and any views they have are purely a matter of their deficiency in reasoning is rarely an accurate view.

It's very common in fanfiction. People are shocked that everyone else doesn't share their sexuality and values and portray them as extremely irrational.

#+begin_quote
  Actually, society provides a lot of support for the idea that expressing anger above a fairly minimal level isn't allowed.
#+end_quote

For irrational reasons. It provides support for the idea that you should be angry when you have good reason to be angry. I agree that you can overcome the emotion if you have no good reason to have that emotion.

#+begin_quote
  It's not okay to yell at people in public.
#+end_quote

Unless others do things to you or your partner that are socially unacceptable, like, say, sleep with your partner.

#+begin_quote
  None of this applies to jealousy. If A sees their partner B macking with someone else and A therefore causes a scene, B will receive censure and people will think nothing of A's angry outburst. At worst, if A becomes physical people will say "well, s/he shouldn't have done that I guess, but I totally understand."
#+end_quote

You're not really supporting your case- as you have noted people accept violence if it's a socially sanctioned cause. If you make a good scene when your partner talks to a store employee people will socially censure you. People treat jealousy like anger when the jealousy is irrational.

#+begin_quote
  So, here are three different kinds of changes that one might make to a character:
#+end_quote

I don't object to changing the personalities of people in stories, though 'mediating' their personalities to be different, realistically, is unlikely to work. If Naruto is bi making him be asexual through rational reasoning because sex is unproductive is unlikely to work.

#+begin_quote
  First of all, why is it rational to not want your partner to sleep with someone else? You're assuming the premise.
#+end_quote

Rationality is about supporting your values through the use of logic and reasoning.

Suppose you highly value avoiding disease. If your partner sleeps with others then that value will often be harder to achieve. Suppose you highly value having your partner available often. If they are often attending to someone else then you'll have them be available less often.

Suppose you highly value compersion. Then polyamory will be easier for you. Suppose you have a relationship where you mutually support each other. Polyamory will be easier for you.

#+begin_quote
  My experience and the experience of literally tens of thousands of polyamorous people disagrees with you.
#+end_quote

Perhaps because you are polyamorous, and have different values from other people?
