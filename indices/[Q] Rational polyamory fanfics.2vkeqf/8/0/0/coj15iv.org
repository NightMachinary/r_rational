  I'm unsure what your referent is for "this", but from context I'm understanding it to mean "polyamorous relationships." If you mean something else, please say so.

  What I've never seen is a story where some characters start as really monogamous---not just "lipstick monogamous"---but where this is causing them lots of pain that could be solved by them being not monogamous---and then it occurs to one character to just not be monogamous, who then starts trying to get everyone else on-board with this with every shred of pain that might entail. An author-granted gift for romantic insight, in this case, merely ensures that this venture won't be doomed before it even begins.

The story prompt was about the idea of converting already monogamous people who presumably have lots of jealousy and such into polygamous people. Polygamous people and the success or failure of their relationships aren't mentioned. Your rather offended response was mostly predicated on the assumption that I was saying that polygamous people can't have good relationships and as such, there's not much point I reply to most of it.

  "Oh, jealousy makes polyamory impossible" is a common objection, and one that shows little thought. Jealousy is an emotion, not an unstoppable kaiju god. Anger is also an emotion; the difference is that we all receive plenty of training in how to manage anger.

People receive a small amount of training as a child to avoid anger at minor things and to avoid public tantrums, though they receive little training to manage avoiding anger at things that are rationally enraging.

People receive a small amount of training on jealousy to avoid blatantly unfair displays in public likewise, but not to avoid the emotion when it's rational to be jealous.

Since it's a fairly publicly ingrained and likely partially genetic emotion changing it requires substantial reworking of the mind, as say, stopping people getting angry at popular triggers would. Taking a deep breath and saying I feel doesn't change that much- that's more useful when your emotions are clearly against your reason, if say you're angry or jealous at someone for talking to another person. If rationally you dislike when someone sleeps with your partner (for example because you want them to spend more time on you) you taking a deep breathe won't change that.

Pushing your sexuality on others is a popular goal of fics, but, as with ones which force everyone to be homosexual or straight, is morally iffy.
