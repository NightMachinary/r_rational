  Pushing your sexuality on others is a popular goal of fics, but, as with ones which force everyone to be homosexual or straight, is morally iffy.

OP has already [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2vkeqf/q_rational_polyamory_fanfics/coiim95][stated that this is not the goal]], and as far as I can see eaglejarl is not suggesting it either. Success is not mandated, trying is.
