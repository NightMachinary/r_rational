OP is noting that it won't work optimally for some people, implying that most would be better off with it and a lot would be converted somehow.

Since most people have values that preclude polygamy rationally and emotions, just as people have values that preclude homosexuality (e.g. I am not attracted to people of the same gender) it's not something you can easily rationally convince most people of as it's against their current interests.
