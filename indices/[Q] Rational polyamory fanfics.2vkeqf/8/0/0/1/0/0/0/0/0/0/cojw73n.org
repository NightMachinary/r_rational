The fire thing is actually a great example, thanks. Let me try to take it further.

Some people do edgeplay: things like playing with fire, or knives, or asphyxiation, for the purposes of sexual arousal.

Most people have an inbuilt aversion to the kinds of things edgeplay incorporates, for good reason---thus why it's, y'know, called that. But a not-big-but-not-tiny portion of the population also get strongly aroused by one or more of these things, /some/ to the point of it being a deal-breaker if their partner won't explore their kink with them.

Given a relationship between two people, two people who love each-other and /want/ their relationship to work, where one of them has a strong edge-play kink---let's say they like, for example, cutting their partner---and the other doesn't: would the simplest global optimization be to make the non-kinky partner /kinkier/---to give them the same desire their partner has?

Well, it depends. But I don't think it depends on /much/---mainly, one, does their partner do the cutting in a safe-and-responsible way? And two, would the hypothetical person /they'd/ be with the kink be safe-and-responsible with it? In other words, would they both only act on the kink insofar as it increases both of their total utilities?

Now, mind you, if you gave someone exposure therapy to take away their pain-avoidance, or perhaps even supplant it with a different reaction, you could potentially end up creating people like [[http://kushiel.wikia.com/wiki/Ph%C3%A8dre_n%C3%B3_Delaunay_de_Montr%C3%A8ve][Phèdre nó Delaunay]]---people who are much more vulnerable to abuse by random strangers, and might also not function as well in "normal" relationships going forward.

But remember, here, that we're talking about taking an existing, mostly-static set of people in a one relationship graph, and working with them on elective goal-function self-modification to allow them to create a more-optimal set of edges on the /same/ relationship graph. In other words, we don't have to worry about how these people would be affected by the outside world; they've got these people as their tribe and this isn't going to change. Their only /control/ comes from what relationship they'll have with each of the other tribe members.

(It might also turn out that some people "make bad poly partners" in a /different/ way than some people "make bad [monogamous] relationship partners"---that, even though someone is good in any given pairing, some emergent property makes them a horrible member of the graph. You might have to /eject/ some of the nodes from the graph if you wanted to ensure the happiness of the rest---and for a given tribe, it might be more optimal for the tribe as a whole to not be poly, than to lose this tribe member.)
