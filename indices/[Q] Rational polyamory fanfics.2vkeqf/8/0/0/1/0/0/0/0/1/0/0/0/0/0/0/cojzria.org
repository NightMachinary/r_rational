That would be fine and fun to explore.

As I mentioned though, in trying to find a good portrayal of it seeking one where people's sexualities are converted wouldn't be a good main target. If you want to fulfil everyone's values better if therapy effectively changes a person's core personality then they'll explore pitfalls and advantages less. I've seen a lot of stories like that, though normally focused on making everyone gay or bisexual.

I'm considering doing some romance stuff in my fanfiction later like that. It's a gaming one and he gets stat bonuses for having more party members so he needs as large a group as possible.
