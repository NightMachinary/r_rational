Note that in the fic I'm imagining, the protagonist is not even /themselves/ polyamorous.

Picture it less as "Quirrelmort espousing the value of horcruxes to anyone who will listen" and more "Harry finds a tome describing how to create horcruxes without killing anyone; suggests trying this Dark Ritual; everyone who cared about Hermione immediately sees the point and some of them are up for going first in trying it out." Except, with not-fighting-over-people instead of not-dying.
