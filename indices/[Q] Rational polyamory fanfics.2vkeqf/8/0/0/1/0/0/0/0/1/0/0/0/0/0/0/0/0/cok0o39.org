  I might be projecting a bit from my peer-group when I say this,

Have you asked them in depth questions to find out these answers?

  I believe a large portion of the population actually has very weakly-held default values about romance and sexuality;

My personal experience is very different. School is a wild experience of testing and experimentation where people gain strongly held beliefs about what they like and dislike. Prejudices have some impact of course but they often just lead to stronger default values.

  they'd honestly not be able to answer self-reflective questions on the subject of gender or sexual identity.
#+end_quote

What questions? Have you asked your peers said questions?

#+begin_quote
  These people who are just going with the defaults have very likely made at least one flawed assumption about their own preferences
#+end_quote

Or possibly heterosexuals are the majority and they just steamroll over every other group and lead to them having kinda weird assumptions. 5-15% are probably a bit different but the majority are likely fairly accurately represented in those categories.

  This feels, to me (as someone who has spent years doing such experiments) similar to the ninja in Naruto who only ever bother to try one technique, or one weapon, without even stopping to think that another technique/weapon might not only be a better fit for them, but also easier to learn than the one they started with.

If so, you'd expect that technique to vary substantially in prevalence as the culture changed and that should be statistically obvious.
