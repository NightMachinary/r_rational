There is evidence for monogamy and polygamy being genetic.

The actual research on it in humans is ongoing.

That took about ten seconds of googling. I'm surprised you didn't do that- you even made the very strong claim that there's no evidence it's genetic despite ten seconds of googling meaning new scientist says there's a monogamy gene in humans.

Anyway, most of the rest of your post is based on your musings that you couldn't be bothered to support with ten seconds of googling.
