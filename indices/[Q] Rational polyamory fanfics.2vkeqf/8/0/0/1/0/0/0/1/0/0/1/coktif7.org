If it helps clarify things, I wrote that while glaring suspiciously at the possibly crypto-homophobic tone and really weak rationalism-speak invoked by spraying out lots of emotionally charged words, like the strange "my gay and bi acquaintances tried to argue me into letting them suck my genitals, but I won't turn gay because I think that would make me feel really uncomfortable to the point of complete despondency as I value the female form so much because of my raging hetrosexuality" interjection.

But I thought focusing on that would derail the discussion. I was wrong to worry about that, it seems, as little rational debate is to be had. So I feel no need to hold this sort of thing back.

All that's left is just empty text spewing and side-channel social signaling, like this out of nowhere warning message from you, my response to your post, and my own incoming response to his latest comment.

Hope that helps in your detailed internal model of me. That's the sort of thing I can't really argue against, after all.

Your post sure helped me with the same.

Love trying to apply the principle of charity to statements that were /literally tagged/ by an author as intentionally disingenuous so as to make a point, though. That's a good one. Double down on that and don't pull back from it, like you did in the original thread where you said your tone might have been off.

A little abrupt with the ostracization signaling, however. Need to ease into that sort of thing. More rallying statements of ideological unity first. Something like, "as all the rational people on this subreddit know." That sort of thing.

Shouldn't have started with a negative in you post, either. The general pattern in most western cultures is: positive praise, weak negative correction, redefining positive statement of collective future action.

And break your points up into easy to read paragraphs, even if that takes more text. Makes the first and last sentences in each more powerful.
