Right. It's going to be that way, I see. So be it.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  There is evidence for monogamy and polygamy being genetic.

  [...]

  The actual research on it in humans is ongoing.

  That took about ten seconds of googling. I'm surprised you didn't do that.
#+end_quote

Didn't read my post before responding, huh? That's seems to be a pattern for you in this thread. Then, instead of presenting your evidence, you clumsily attack the person behind it.

Very good. Things are getting clearer by the second.

What I *wrote*:

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    Monogamy is a *complex emotional disinclination, largely linked to socialization*, not a simple avoidance or preference mechanism. *True*, like basic sexual response *it is something we may have some varying levels of genetic predisposition towards*;
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

Which is EXACTLY what this says in the study summary paragraph:

#+begin_quote
  [[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK97287/]]

  /As in all animals, genes determine the underlying neurochemistry and circuitry that drive human emotions and behavior, but the manifestation of each of these behaviors is also clearly influenced by culture./
#+end_quote

It even says:

#+begin_quote
  However, despite their social monogamy, not all prairie voles display exclusive mating, since females have been reported to carry mixed-paternity litters.
#+end_quote

And then you link /this?/

#+begin_quote
  [[http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14641-monogamy-gene-found-in-people.html#.VN4CUDWshN8]]
#+end_quote

That's not a good study for this purpose. It's one of those reasoned extensions of a known fact pieces. Not even in the same league as the other article.

Also doesn't say /anything/ about polygamy or polyamory. It's about studying successfully monogamy based on genes rewarding social pressures against cheating (which it does poorly). This is something people in both polygamous and polyamorous relationships won't be feeling the same way, and will feel differently depending on their own social perception of their situation and how they mentally approach and model it.

You know, the kind of thing modern rationalists like to optimize?

Look at this waffling:

#+begin_quote
  /Not only that, men with two copies of RS3 334 were more likely to be unmarried than men with one or none, and if they were married, they were twice as likely to have a marital crisis./

  /Given that everyone surveyed had been in their relationship for at least five years, the team suggests that having multiple copies somehow contributes to commitment problems in men. Because the results were collected for a different study the team couldn't quiz the men on whether they were faithful, says Wallum./
#+end_quote

That's simply not very good. They're guessing, in a scientific sense, while maybe waiting for some more funding to actually do their own study on it. Maybe.

But here's the good part. You should try to *read* this.

Next, this mediocre article (and the much better one, but this is shorter) links this genetic mechanism to /social perception/ reward structures in the brain, not sexual responses, /which is what I said in my post/:

#+begin_quote
  /In some animals, the theory is that the brain has two "motivational" systems: one for reward, the other for social perception. In prairie voles and marmosets, receptors for the two systems sit on adjacent cells, so social activity is highly rewarding, leading to monogamy. To see if the same mechanism is at work in people will mean using tissue from post-mortems to map where vasopressin receptors lie, to see if variations are linked to the number of copies of RS3 334./
#+end_quote

But wait. They don't have evidence for this physical mechanism affecting humans /or/ for the genetic link in humans being linked to this physical brain structure. Even if this were true in humans, this is the sort of thing a lot of rational brain hacks deal with anyway.

It is not linked to a sexual response, thus the comparison between "talking someone into homosexuality" (whatever the fuck that means) and being convinced of polyamory's theoretical benefits enough to counter the possible downsides is clearly incorrect. Which is what I said in my post.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  you even made the very strong claim that there's no evidence it's genetic
#+end_quote

I don't even have words for how wrong this is.

Reading. It's fundamental.

#+begin_quote
  Anyway, most of the rest of your post is based on your musings that you couldn't be bothered to support with ten seconds of googling.
#+end_quote

If you have a problem with something /else/ I wrote, and it is so easy to disprove these things, then do so. Quit the vague, cowardly sniping. Use citations of scientific studies or even your own original, rational arguments to debate my points.

This personal attack was a huge failure. The only result is you look like (more) of an idiot online and I get another chance to reinforce my points. I'm really disappointed. Hardly a strong challenge to my arguments, which is what I need to make them more usefully based in reality and better defined in English.

In summary:

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    There is no evidence preferences for polyamory have some simple genetic mechanism like that or require ripping out similarly strongly ingrained responses.
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

Supported by your link.

Confirmed by your link.

#+begin_quote
  *you even made the very strong claim that there's no evidence it's genetic* despite ten seconds of googling meaning new scientist says there's a monogamy gene in humans.
#+end_quote

Disproven easily with my own text. Which you didn't read.
