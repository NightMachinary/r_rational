  I'm doubtful that there's that many people more who you could effectively convert without massively subverting their values and goals

Not trying to convert anyone! More than anything, I just want to read "rational optimization process vs. incredibly complex relationship jumble" because rational optimization processes are entertaining and incredibly-complex-relationship-jumbles are entertaining.

If anything, I would expect the end result of such a fic-writing attempt to be a /thorough exploration/ of the search-space of human romance and sexuality, and a demonstration of a lot of both potential advantages and potential pitfalls that a reader would be unaware of, expressed fairly and worked through with as much compassion and charity as each subject would allow.

This could also be done by having the protagonist of the fic /be/ a relationship counsellor, and giving them a lot of /little/ one-off problems rather than one big ongoing one... but that wouldn't be nearly as enthralling, I think.
