  I severely doubt you could desensitize people to pain as such, or pain from jealousy causing situations.

On that specific note: CBT actually works /great/ at getting rid of "high-level acute sensations" like idiopathic itchiness, or phantom limb pain, or disgust in response to a smell. Anxiety or jealousy or rage that come with a "trigger" are no different.

You don't teach the person to not feel the sensation; you just teach them to dissociate the feeling from the trigger, and potentially to attach the trigger to something else.
