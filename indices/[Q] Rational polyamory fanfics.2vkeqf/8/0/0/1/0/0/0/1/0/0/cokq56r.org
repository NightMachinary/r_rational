Note: while I disagree with your arguments, I would advise against getting into an extended discussion about the validity of said arguments with [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer]]. He/she does not appear to apply the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_charity][principle of charity]]; nor does he/she play by [[http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Crocker%27s_rules][Crocker's Rules]]. (Note the extremely hostile tone he uses in the grandparent comment, as well as the extremely thinly-veiled insults he hurls at you.) I should note that he/she has in fact recently [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2ul1j3/q_the_real_issue_with_friendship_is_optimal/co9o6nf][accused me of being a troll]] due to an offhand remark on my part concerning the somewhat abrasive style with which he/she comments. (To be fair, this accusation may or may not have been [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2ul1j3/q_the_real_issue_with_friendship_is_optimal/coathaa][subsequently retracted]]; I'm not quite sure what to make of [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer]]'s remarks in that comment.) I seem to remember him/her participating in level-headed, civil conversations in the past, but I may be misremembering, and in any case his/her style as of late has not at all been conducive to constructive discussion. Your parallel discussions with [[/u/eaglejarl]] and [[/u/derefr]] have covered much the same topics already; obviously this is just a suggestion, but I would recommending focusing on those two threads and cutting this one off in advance.
