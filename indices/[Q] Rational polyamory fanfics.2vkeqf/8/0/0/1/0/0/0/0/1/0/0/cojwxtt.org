  Sure. But presuming those technologies don't exist in canon, but polyamory does, it would at least be better than the alternative of violating the spiritual bond, right?

I'm not presuming a lack of creativity to support your goals.

Polyamory has various internal issues that are against some people's values more than others. Trying to desensitise them into a relationship with your superior rationality upsets more of their values and is riskier.

There are lots of ways to deal with the spiritual bond. For example a person could be smeared with the blood of Bella to improve their scent.

What solution would be best actually would involve talking to the people, considering their issues, working out how they viewed monogamy and various issues, what their sexuality was like, lots of things. Once you understood their entire personhood you could work out the most optimal solution and which had the lowest risk. Possibly that would be polyamory. Possibly not. Probably not in most cases and definitely given how obsessive these individuals are and how violent. You'd actually have to consider them as an individual, not as a potential polyamory machine.
