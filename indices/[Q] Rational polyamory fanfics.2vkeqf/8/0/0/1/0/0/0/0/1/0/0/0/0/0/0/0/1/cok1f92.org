I feel this is a helpful article on polyamory and how I feel about it. In particular.

  If there's one thing everybody loves, it's a salesman. If there's anything that people love even more than a salesman, it's a salesman who tells you that he's better than you, and will continue to be until you buy his product. Also the salesman probably wants to bone you, and that's extra fun.

  I'm neither a soothsayer nor a sociologist, but probably neither are you and even if you are, societal trends are a slippery thing at the best of times. The point is that maybe polyamory is the next stage in human social development, and everybody has a little polyamory in them. I don't know. You don't know. Nobody knows.

  Because you don't know, it's important to acknowledge that you are not automatically more evolved for having come out as poly. This isn't a magical relationship structure discovered by the authors of The Ethical Slut and we are not approaching the polylarity to become a glorious single global-spanning relationship structure governed by a monolithic Google Calendar.

  The practical thing to take away from this is that polyamory is not the natural state of humanity and it is not for everyone. Don't be an evangelist. No one is keeping score, there is no free toaster, you do not get discounts at local businesses.

  I'm not saying that you can never suggest polyamory to anyone. If you think someone you know would really benefit from polyamory, feel free to talk to them about it if you are already having a conversation about relationships. People tend to be more comfortable with polyamory when they feel that they arrived at the idea organically, and often they get there via information they received from friends. The critical distinction is that of approach. Did they invite you to speak about your relationship model? Or did you bring it to their door and try to spray it in their face?

As it noted, the spray in their face approach of the rational protagonist you mentioned has been tried a lot and people see it as extremely annoying, especially when it's coupled with some sort of view that those who are poly amorous are superior or optimal in some way.
