To me, it feels slightly like the difference between applying a Gregory House approach to patients or a common medical approach.

Most patients probably don't have Lupus, they don't have edit a problem not being able to practice asexuality or demisexuality or polyamory. They're normally just drunk or high, or having problems not from bucking society's trends but from being drunk or high or bad at communication. You shouldn't use rare conditions as a basis for what you treat people with. Most people's relationship issues would likely go a lot better with better self esteem, communication, and guidance on consent. Making them polygamous is unlikely to fix their issues.

Still, the idea amuses me enough that I am going to write a short story of the results of a charismatic ideologue opening up the possibility to people.
