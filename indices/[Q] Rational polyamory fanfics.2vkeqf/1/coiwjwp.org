Polyamory is an extra type of relationship (sub)graph and keeping it on the table would be helpful for some people, but it's weird to me to portray it as a rationalist's solution to relationship problems. It solves a specific handful of cases, but doesn't even touch the actual problem. Relationships are dramatic because not everyone's ideal relationship graph is the same. (And I like that problem; it's part of the human experience.)

Your question does remind me of [[http://qntm.org/gay][this hilarious post on Things of Interest]] where the author takes a rigid database schema that only allows heterosexual marriage, iteratively applies good database design principles to it, and finds the database's concept of marriage getting more and more liberal with each improvement. Eventually he blows past allowing gay marriage, into polyamory, and then further still into something truly strange.
