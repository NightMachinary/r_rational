Wow...looking back on history and at today's issues with marriage, there's so many possible discrimination against potential marriages. Let me count up the ones we've thought of so far. Including types of marriages we've abolished.

First started a marriage of husband and wife of the same ethnicity and religion.

Then came marriage of husband and wife. (Eliminate prejudice against race and internal beliefs)

Up came marriage of adult husband and adult wife. (Generate prejudice against marriages to anyone under 18)

Next is marriage of person to person. (Eliminate prejudice against gender or sex)

Now it's marriage of person to person to person to..... (Eliminate prejudice against number of partners)

What will we think of next?!!

Marriage of sapient being to sapient being to sapient being.... (Eliminate prejudice against uplifted animals, AI, aliens, and anything else in the set of mind space who share utility functions corresponding to the idea of intense commitment)

Is there any type of marriages I missed? I can only think of open marriages, but that's about having sex with someone you aren't married to and not who you're marrying which doesn't really fit the theme above.
