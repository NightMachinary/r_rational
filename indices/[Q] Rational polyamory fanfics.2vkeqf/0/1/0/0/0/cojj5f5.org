It's worth watching, but it's uneven in places, especially in the final season where there are sudden revelations that seem like ass pulls. I watched it on Amazon Prime, where it's one of their "free" instant video things - I don't think I would have paid much for it, but I do think it was worth watching. It has three dimensional, complex characters interacting with each other.
