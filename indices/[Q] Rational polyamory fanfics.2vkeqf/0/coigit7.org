  What I've never seen is a story where some characters start as /really monogamous/---not just "lipstick monogamous"---but where this is causing them lots of pain that could be solved by them being /not/ monogamous---and then it occurs to one character to just /not be monogamous/, who then starts trying to get everyone else on-board with this with every shred of pain that might entail. An author-granted gift for romantic insight, in this case, merely ensures that this venture won't be doomed before it even begins.

So, I've never seen that in fanfic. I'm not actually sure that I've seen it in regular fiction either - every time I've seen someone make an "open, honest attempt at polyamory" it's been in a very negative light, and either it ends in a trainwreck or with monogamy having been proven to be the One True way to have relationships.

If you were to write this, I think you'd start running into problems really quickly, mostly through derailing characters. As you've said, polyamory just isn't for some people, and if you want the conclusion to be that everyone is in one big multiple-pairing situation, you have to make the call that they're all for it, which ... is basically author fiat, which you want to avoid.

(If you want to write it, I think this is the sort of thing that would work better as original fiction. If you're having trouble thinking up characters, just use characters from your favorite shows/books and file off the serial numbers.)
