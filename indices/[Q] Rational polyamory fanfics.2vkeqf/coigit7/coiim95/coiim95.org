  As you've said, polyamory just isn't for some people, and if you want the conclusion to be that everyone is in one big multiple-pairing situation, you have to make the call that they're all for it

Ah, no, I never said I wanted the conclusion to be anything in particular. I would expect the result to be a /more optimal/ relationship graph than the original one, but not a /maximally-connected/ one. In the end, it really just wouldn't work out optimally for /some/ people (and they'll have to settle for the protagonist introducing them to someone who is almost-but-not-quite the person they wanted, and might be an even better fit for them though they might not agree, etc.)
