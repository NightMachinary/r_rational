  I'm not actually sure that I've seen it in regular fiction either - every time I've seen someone make an "open, honest attempt at polyamory" it's been in a very negative light, and either it ends in a trainwreck or with monogamy having been proven to be the One True way to have relationships.

I really agree with you on this -- you almost never see poly romances, or even ATTEMPTS at poly romances onscreen, and if you do usually either the people are shown negatively and it ends up not working.

That said, I think I may have thought of a counterexample. [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0219965/][Bandits]] is a story about two men and a woman (Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Cate Blanchett) who do crime. The bulk of the movie consists of the two men trying to get with Cate and Bruce Willis sabotaging BBT. The ending, however, suggests that /possibly/ there might be a poly relationship afterwards. That's the closest I can get.

Also, it's a good movie and I recommend it.
