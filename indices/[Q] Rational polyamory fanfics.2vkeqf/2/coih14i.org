The story "Kyon: Big Damn Hero" is the one you want to read. Definitely.

Here: [[http://soulriders.net/brian/fanfic/kbdh/]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5844698/1/Kyon-Big-Damn-Hero]]. The relationship-building starts effectively at Chapter 18, so you should read that one first. Sadly it wont be updated anymore, but I'm sure you'll find what you search for here.

Alternatively, I point you towards "Time Braid" ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid]]), but it's much less pronounced here than in KBDH.
