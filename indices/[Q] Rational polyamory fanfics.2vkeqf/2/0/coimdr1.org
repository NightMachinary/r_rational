I was thinking of mentioning Time Braid as well, as it does have a polyamoric relationship. and it does put effort into it. but then again it is a bit less then fully rational, mostly because [[#s][spoilers]].

I still think it did put quite a lot of work into establishing the relationship and showing the issues and how they were overcome, but its not 100%..
