A rational (more or less) speedster character had been (is being) done in [[http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/82363551272/fall-of-doc-future-contents][/Fall of Doc Future/]] web-trilogy; and it wasn't as conflict-crippling as you'd expect. The focus just generally moved from [[http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2305][sub-optimal stuff]] like fighting [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek][monsters of the week]] to things like preventing the world from careening into any of the parallel-universe lines in which human civilisation ends or changes too drastically (not much of a spoiler, since it pretty much gets highlighted in the Prologue).

I actually kept comparing Quicksilver to Flicker (the above mentioned speedster) in his (in)actions during my watch of /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men:_Apocalypse][X-Men: Apocalypse,]]/ and Quicksilver --- the cinematic version, at least --- never came out as the advantageous. Even on his crowning scene of awesome the portrayal of his actions was a bit underwhelming. Which is a bit frustrating because they likely had a whole group of people working on the film's scenario, while the web-novels are written by a single person.
