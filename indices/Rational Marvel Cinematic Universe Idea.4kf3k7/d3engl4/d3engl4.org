Give creative thinking to the characters who already have the most raw power and you aren't left with much of a story. Iron Man's idiot ball carries the entire franchise ([[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReedRichardsIsUseless][and setting]]).

(Iron Man also has the "tinker" rationalfic problem in that we have no idea about his limits. Whatever the obstacle, the first question becomes "could Tony build a device that neutralizes it?" and the answer is pure author fiat.)

Same problem if you give rationality to a leader or close friend of those individuals; that just passes the bucket.

I'd rather give rationality to a second-fiddle character. Ant-Man could be interesting (though you'd have to rewrite his entire origin story...). Maybe the Hulk, just because I have no idea how to best leverage the ability to turn into an uncontrollable unstoppable monster and I would like to find out. Most of the mutants/X-Men are also valid choices, if we get to cross the streams.

And rational!Kilgrave as an antagonist, for the nightmares.
