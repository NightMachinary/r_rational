I like your idea for Spiderman, especially as he is portrayed in Civil War, where he developed his webbing himself. Why stop there? A good portion of the story could be filled by Peter Parker trying to acquire resources to build even more gadgets and devices, really playing up on the 'tinker/scientist' aspect of his character in a way I haven't seen anywhere else :).
