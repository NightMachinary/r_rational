Quicksilver and/or Iron Man.

Remember how Tony has a fleet of autonomous iron suits? And imagine how much better they'd be if there was no need for life support for a weak human in it? And just imagine how much stuff Tony could get done if he didn't have to spend all his time wrestling monsters?

And Quicksilver... Dont even get me started on movie quicksilver.
