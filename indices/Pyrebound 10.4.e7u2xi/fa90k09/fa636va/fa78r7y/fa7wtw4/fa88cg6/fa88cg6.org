For starters, the setting is highly atypical and thoroughly developed--no Tolkien borrowings here. I call it Mesopotamian-flavored because it takes place in a civilization of independent theocratic city-states along a river network in a near-eastern climate. Also there are a few echoes: similar phonemes ("Rammash," "Shazru"), ziggurats, and the like. But that's just the starting point for a unique society that diverges from the real world in (I hope) interesting ways. The story is as much about the world of Ki as it is about Ram.

I think of it as a story about power--of all different kinds--what we do to get power, and what power does to us. So, for example, there's a magical disaster that strikes the world every four days, and severely debilitates or kills everything that isn't protected by a holy fire. This makes for a highly collective and urbanized civilization, with every settlement crammed with people. It also gives the people who run the fires an enormous amount of leverage over the rest of the citizenry, and distorts their whole society. We're on our tenth arc, and still exploring new aspects of the generalized cultural dysfunction at work. That may or may not interest you, but I have fun with it.
