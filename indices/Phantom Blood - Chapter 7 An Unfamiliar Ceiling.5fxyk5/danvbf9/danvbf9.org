For anyone new here: this is basically "Anime Dresden Files" with a rational take on the fights, like Jojo's Bizzare Adventure or Hunter x Hunter. I'd love to get any feedback on this, so any criticism is welcome! I'm gonna be posting chapters every Thursday from now on, so be on the look out for that!
