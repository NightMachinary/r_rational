That makes even more sense than you realize. In old comics, a character's powers could be really inconsistent and come with really bizarre weaknesses. It'd even justify Silver Age stories where spaceships filled with random magic stuff are constantly crashing on Earth. Turns out the pilots under the influence.

After the heroes and government became more organized around planetary defense, on account of the Veitnam War fiasco, they would've put a stop to alien hooligans. The only ones still empowering humans would be more careful and hand out better-made powers, or maybe some humans got a hold of the tech.

I still need details, though. What do I call metahumans empowered this way? There's no way they wouldn't form some kind of subculture after they discovered this. What are the aliens called and what's their society like? I've already made a couple alien cultures, both from other planets and other universes.

Martians are nomadic shapeshifters with advanced biotechnology who started coming to Earth as refugees in the 50s, Lyutians are imperialists who came to invade Earth during the 80s but many army deserters and defectors still live here, and The Evil Cube Army are /slightly/ less murderous Daleks.

There's also the Celestial Federation, which is a hugely diverse transhumanist society (think Samurai Jack or Gintama) ruled by the DBZ-esque Immortals. It's not too much of a stretch to say these aliens are just rowdy kids and criminals from worlds that look like a cross between Star Wars and the Avatar shows.
