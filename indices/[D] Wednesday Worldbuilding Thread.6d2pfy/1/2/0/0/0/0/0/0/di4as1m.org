  still need details, though. What do I call metahumans empowered this way?
#+end_quote

In neither case are the aliens /talking/ to their victims/experimental subjects. So I guess people would have to come up with their own names.

"The Empowered" might be an option.

  What are the aliens called and what's their society like?
#+end_quote

Well... I don't see how it really makes a difference what the aliens are called. I guess if they don't use a universal translator, then you can just go with any jumble of letters, and if they /do/ have a universal translator, then it'll come out as "The True People" or "The Seekers After Knowledge" or something along those lines.

Their society? Well - I guess that by the modern day, they've got devices that give superpowers. So, presumably they've also all got superpowers. If the superpowers are compatible, then they've got /all/ the superpowers - if the powers are not compatible, then they probably have some means of switching them, enabling these aliens to have any power they want as easily as you or I might change a shirt (as long as they retain access to their technological mcguffin - and assuming that they can afford to buy one). And... they've obtained that capability recently, so their society is probably still in a massive state of flux as it tries to adjust for this.

...on top of that, they have casual space travel. They probably never revolt against their leaders, rather simply moving out and starting a new colony somewhere else if they disagree with local policies (their means of colonisation probably involves dropping a small technological device on the planet, then ten minutes later they have a house with all modern conveniences and mutter angrily under their breath about the ten minute wait)
