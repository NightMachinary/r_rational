I've been working on a superhero setting with the usual kitchen sink approach, but I want to put my own spin on mutants rather than copy X-Men wholesale. The main reason to include mutants is so I can be lazy with origin stories and not have to explain how some characters got their powers. I'm not as interested in using them as a metaphor for racial minorities, instead I've been using metahumans in general as a metaphor for immigrants.

I want to be more creative than say mutants just have a gene that gives them superpowers, though. Every other power source I've included has a bit more detail in how it works and why it exists. I considered saying mutants are conduits for some extradimensional energy source, but I'm kind of already doing that with the Superman-analog and would at least want to use a different dimension that isn't as picky about who gets powers.

One suggestion I've already heard is that mutants were abducted by aliens at some point in their lives, but I lack an explanation for why aliens would be interested in handing out superpowers to humans seemingly at random. Perhaps some malfunctioning Atlantean technology that was accidentally reactivated and had the job of distributing powers for some reason that benefitted the civilization before it was destroyed.

Another idea I came up with is to rip off Shadowrun and the webcomic Skin Deep. Mutants are really the descendants of magical creatures who bred with or turned into humans and can change back under certain circumstances. If I go this route I'd call them Changelings and could explain them not being common before the 1900s by requiring them to be relatively well-fed in order to awaken and tap into their race's latent magic.

Now that I wrote that last one out, it's definitely my favorite. It provides a unique overarching theme, lends itself to a lot of diversity, adds to the worldbuilding of why magic became myth if it was real, explains why focus can be placed on rich countries, still provides the opportunity to hit the same notes that X-Men did about being born the way they were, and could provide some interesting drama between changelings and "real monsters".

It even ties into another part of the world I was putting a lot of detail in, the Dresden Files-inspired Underground. I originally had governments give magical secret societies jurisdiction over magical affairs just because they saved the world from an apocalyptic threat, but the rising population of changelings would be another great reason to help magical communities expand their control and fund the monster hunting police.

So it would appear I answered my own question while writing it out. Oops. Well, I'll post it anyway since I like what I've come up with and will never object to more people talking to me about this project of mine. I'm writing the setting for the tabletop RPG Base Raiders since I love the premise of the game but wasn't as big a fan of the worldbuilding and backstory. I am open to more crazy ideas and have all day free to answer questions.
