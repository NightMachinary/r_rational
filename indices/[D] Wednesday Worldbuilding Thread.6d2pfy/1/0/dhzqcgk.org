  Perhaps some malfunctioning Atlantean technology that was accidentally reactivated and had the job of distributing powers for some reason that benefitted the civilization before it was destroyed.

I like this.

  If I go this route I'd call them Changelings and could explain them not being common before the 1900s by requiring them to be relatively well-fed in order to awaken and tap into their race's latent magic.

This is also interesting.

Another possible explanation: In the comic /The One/, it's suggested that the Cold War and the associated perpetual threat of a nuclear holocaust had a psychological effect on the people of that time. It draws on some IRL psychological theory, if I recall correctly, but in the comic this is the explanation for some of the weird metaphysical stuff.

Anyhow, you could also point to that, or to similar extremes (like the stress of living in massive cities or even the rapid pace of technological change) that have only cropped up relatively recently, to explain why their magic hasn't come to the fore.
