I wouldn't mind including the Atlantean ship for something else, perhaps for my own spin on Marvel's Inhumans, but I can't come up with a rational reason why it would randomly give people powers long after its creators have died. In what way is it malfunctioning and how was it eventually deactivated?

I conceived of Atlantis as a generic precursor civilization that had spanned the globe, if not further, in prehistoric times, but was destroyed by a godlike entity called Nemesis. Some Atlantean magitech remains buried beneath the Earth's surface and is very dangerous. That's about all I came up with.

Since the premise of the game is about all major heroes and villains vanishing a year ago, it would work best for the ship to have been stopped before the game begins. There could even be an adventure hook about reactivating the ship to empower more people or destroying it before someone else uses it.
