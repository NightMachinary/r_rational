Cool idea, but it doesn't quite fit with the setting I'm going for. I want things to be goofy and silly. Applying that kind of rule to superpowers could be an awkward constraint on a world designed to be a crazy weird sandbox where anything can happen that exists for the players to do whatever they want with the resources at their disposal.
