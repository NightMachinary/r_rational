  One suggestion I've already heard is that mutants were abducted by aliens at some point in their lives, but I lack an explanation for why aliens would be interested in handing out superpowers to humans seemingly at random.

Testing.

The aliens want to see which (if any) superpowers are safe to apply to themselves, so they find a bunch of barely sapient primitives on some backwater planet that's not on the list of protected intelligent species (thus avoiding all the alien medical ethics committees) and pick out random schmucks to hand out superpowers to so they can see which powers are stable and useful. (One in five of their victims survive the process, on average, though that ratio will get better with time).

--------------

Trolling.

The aliens that hand out powers are the equivalent of a bunch of university students who went off on a holiday and had a bit too much to drink. They hand out a bunch of randomly selected powers to randomly selected planets on a drunken bet. (When the university authorities catch up with them, they will be Not Impressed and might reverse the powers presented to Earth. This could be anytime from 'tomorrow' to 'in seventeen thousand years', depending on exactly how long these aliens consider a suitable time for a holiday.)

--------------

Socio-historic research.

The aliens have long since mastered the handing-out-superpowers technology, but one particular group has recently obtained a research grant to study the long-term effects of superpowers on a primitive society. They picked out their society, carefully handed out superpowers as per experimental protocol, and are now sitting back - well out of sight, and probably cloaked as well - and observing the resultant changes to society. They're taking very good notes, but are unwilling to intervene and mess up their experimental data.
