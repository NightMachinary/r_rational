Hmmmm... yeah, and I can see how those first two could work together. The earliest aliens would be the researchers, looking to try out bleeding-edge super-power-granting tech... and then a bunch of fully super-powered students out on a bender with the by-then commonly available power-granting tech could pass by a few decades later. The first lot of supers would then have the more buggy powers - strength that's significantly greater than human norm but /fluctuates/ unpredictably, or a form of invulnerability that comes with a crippling weakness to some common or household item, or the ability to generate arbitrary heat by touch without being in any way immune to heat. While the students would have bug-free, somewhat idiot-proofed power-up devices... but probably just fire them at random people walking along the street.
