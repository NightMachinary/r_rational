  One suggestion I've already heard is that mutants were abducted by aliens at some point in their lives, but I lack an explanation for why aliens would be interested in handing out superpowers to humans seemingly at random.

Maybe it's a kind of entertainment and some aliens earn money on granting people powers and broadcasting the results? They could treat Earth as a location of their reality show.
