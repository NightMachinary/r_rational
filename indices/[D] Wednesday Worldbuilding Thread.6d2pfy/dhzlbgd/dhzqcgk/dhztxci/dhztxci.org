I had considered tying changelings to the specific event, such as a villain performing a magical ritual, but I prefer the idea that it's something that really couldn't be prevented and can't be undone. There's no person or organization to blame, it just wasn't until recently that the human population was large enough and healthy enough for changelings to start appearing in force.

The Cold War will probably come into play in plenty of other ways, but there's an arms control treaty that prevents nations from creating or conscripting metahumans. After Veit Cong sorcerers inadvertently summoned the devil and governments needed to ask vigilantes and wizards to prevent the apocalypse, everyone agreed things had gotten out of hand.

There's still plenty of other weirdness in this setting: the Gulf War was fought with large-scale teleporters and mind control towers, a cyborg samurai killed Cthulhu after it was summoned by alien invaders, the center of the Earth is a member of the UN, religious orders have been deputized to police monsters, and there's a country-sized refugee camp for Martians.
