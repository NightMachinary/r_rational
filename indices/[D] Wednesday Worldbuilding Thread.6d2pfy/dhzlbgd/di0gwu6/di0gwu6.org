How about this for a change:

All humans are actually born with the potential to develop superpowers when they become adults. However, accidents, injuries, traumas, diseases, etc. all cause this potential to disappear, so it was practically impossible for anyone to still have potential by the time they become an adult.

Until now.

With the development of scientific and medical technologies, more and more youths are being raised in extremely safe conditions, no more child labor, no more violence, no more starvation or illness. These people who have lived in such peace are the ones who develop superpowers.

It would be a nice twist from all the other superpower comics where people get their powers from stress/accidents. Would also greatly shift the plot: e.g., there can't be the standard "kidnapped superchildren in a research lab" story arc, because being kidnapped is a kind of stress that removes the potential for developing superpowers. They can only study adults who have gotten full-blown powers.
