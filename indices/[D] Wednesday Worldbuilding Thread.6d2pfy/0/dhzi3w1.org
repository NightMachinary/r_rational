What if each card is a separate contract of its own with a demon or somesuch that is not tied to a specific demonologist but, rather, to the person who's currently in possession of the card?

Things that can be explained through this:

- a wide variety of arbitrary rules and restrictions the cards have, including the amount of influence on the real world and the rules by which the cards can be “played” against each other (defined details of the contract);
- cards of singular and multiple usage (respectively demons who are suspectible to dying after being summoned into our world and demons who will just get their physical forms destroyed when they are “killed” in a card fight);
- crafting of new cards (negotiating a new deal with a new demon);

  - discovering rare and completely unique cards and abilities;

- impartiality of the gaming system in general;
- multiple units of the same type being used simultaneously (multiple dimensions, or multiple incarnations of the same demon, or both).
