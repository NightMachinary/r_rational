Some random thoughts:

There are at least two hard problems with card game stories:

- Lucky draws matter a lot. This is part of what makes real card games fun, but it feels a lot like the author fiating the result of a fight when it happens in fiction. (See: all of Yu-Gi-Oh!.)

- Readers don't want to memorize dozens of cards. This means that they're often seeing cards for the first time when they're played in-universe, which makes it feel kind of random -- "oh, OK, the author made up /that/ power to make the fight arbitrarily harder, I guess that's a thing now". It also means that it's hard to have fights resolved by clever rules interactions and have that feel satisfying, because most readers won't have enough knowledge to feel like they could have seen the interaction beforehand.

Cards as demonic contracts sounds like a super cool idea, but I worry that it would be especially vulnerable to the second problem: the scope of contracts is so large it will start to feel kind of arbitrary. (Pact had this problem, if you've read it.) If you can find a way to solve that then I think the story would be great.

(Actually, I'd probably read a story with this setting even if you /didn't/ solve that problem, so hey.)
