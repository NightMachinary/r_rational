I don't think chain reactions are going to wipe out humanity. People are already given many opportunities to kill other people and civilization doesn't collapse. It's reasonable to suppose most people will simply choose not to exploit the ROGOF offer. Moreover, even a small proportion of nonreapers can dampen reaping chains to a non-civilization-destroying level -- if 10% of people don't reap, then each natural death only results in ~10 reapings, ignoring collateral damage. Collateral damage won't be such a problem since society will adapt to the reapings and ensure nobody is in a position to accidentally kill somebody else if they die. In fact, other than while driving people are rarely in such a position already. If the Grim Reaper introduced this suddenly I expect a major worldwide roadside disaster before people figure to get off the roads, but I don't expect it will wipe out humanity and there's a decent chance it won't destroy civilization.
