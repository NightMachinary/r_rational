  For example, if someone asks the Grim Reaper to kill someone who is driving a bus, the bus would go out of control and everyone on board or hit by the bus could also die, allowing them to all choose more people for the Grim Reaper to kill.

This is easily resolved; the Grim Reaper is doing a "Reap One Get /One/ Free" deal, not a "Reap One Get One Plus Collateral Damage Free" deal. So the Reaper personally ensures that there is no /lethal/ collateral damage. Either by waiting for the driver to stop the bus and giving him a heart attack, or by magically ensuring that everyone survives the resultant crash. (Mind you, the Reaper doesn't much care about preventing, say, paralysis from the neck down).

That also allows a way to prevent the chain reaction problem - that people who are reaped 'free' do not get a vengeance target at all. (And those who name a target that's already dead simply lose out).
