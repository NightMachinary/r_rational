What if it was the exact opposite, and you had to leave /heaven/ to kill somebody?

By default, every natural death (no matter how moral/immoral the person is) sends the person to heaven, but once there you can choose to send yourself and one other person (whether in heaven or on Earth) straight to hell. Because they were never in heaven, the targets never have a chance to perpetuate the chain, leading to a x2 death rate at worst.
