I've seen a number of stories about protagonists who claw their ways out of hell to seek vengeance upon those who put them there, and I couldn't help but wonder: what if they didn't need to crawl out of hell to get their revenge?

So I've been thinking of a story where one day, the Grim Reaper decides to offer everyone a "Reap One Get One Free" deal. Specifically, whenever you die, the Grim Reaper will offer you the chance to kill any *one* person of your choice. So for example, if you died because someone stabbed you, you can ask the Grim Reaper to have that someone die.

Assume the Grim Reaper is very accommodating, so even if you don't know the person's name, you can say "The person who wished for me to die", and the Grim Reaper will either kill that person, or tell you to try something else if there is zero or more than one person that matches the description.

The problem is that as currently set up, this looks very much like all of humanity will be wiped out in a chain reaction before any story can get started. For example, if someone asks the Grim Reaper to kill someone who is driving a bus, the bus would go out of control and everyone on board or hit by the bus could also die, allowing them to all choose more people for the Grim Reaper to kill.

The Grim Reaper's deal needs some additional restrictions so that this doesn't happen. I still want everyone to be offered the deal, so I'm looking for restrictions on who they are allowed to ask the Grim Reaper to kill, or perhaps how the Grim Reaper's killings occur. I'm looking for suggestions on what kinds of restrictions would allow most people to get their vengeance, while not ending the human race.

They don't have to be perfect: some people may fall through the cracks, never getting their revenge, while others may munchkin the rules, like for example, hiring terminally ill people as assassins, giving their families large amounts of cash if they ask the Grim Reaper to kill a given target.
