I'm curious about the first draft, because I'm wondering what he'd reflect on more. It was well written, and the style differences only stuck out once or twice (awarding people points in his head, the /true/ question, etc.). It also seems slightly different with regards to Ender's conception of the war - I thought he was more like Dink was described here, seeing the teachers (or administrators) as the enemy than the Buggers.

Was this a one time thing, or will you be writing more of this?
