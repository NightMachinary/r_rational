I really like characters examining their own thinking, motivations, and social context. It's something I like to do, but I really have only been good at it since college. So it is a bit unbelievable that a ten-year-old can be so self-aware. But then again, Ender isn't a normal ten-year-old.

Your writing is always an enjoyable read. Keep up the good work!
