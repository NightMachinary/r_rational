I've read Ender's Game half a dozen times, and the best praise I can offer is that I was not immediately sure where card's work ended and your work started.

The only slightly off note to me was Ender's musing about whether he should teach the other kids the techniques, since I thought that is what he was doing when he was teaching his launchies? But the book is a little more blithe about Ender's superiority (ie he's very quickly the best at the game) in a way that's inherently difficult to reconcile.
