This is a very good imitation of the style writing in Ender's Game. A few things stood out- mentally awarding points and thinking of the true question have been pointed out, but also the way Dink has trust but Petra has respect feels off. Those are vastly outweighed by the things done very well though; "All had emerged mysteriously from the deeper parts of himself, the places where seeing and thinking and feeling blurred together into something resembling magic" came close to making me think you'd intermixed text from elsewhere in the book with yours or maybe nicked that line from something else O.S.C. had written. The description of the battle was novel but also fit perfectly with the described capabilities of the rooms and as a design the teachers might throw in. Battle School slang felt fluid, and Graff felt longsuffering as always. Plus, the reference to our favourite urchin made me smile, though that was a much lower bar.

There's not a lot of spare room in Ender's Game for inserting chapters, but if you write any more of these I hope you share them!
