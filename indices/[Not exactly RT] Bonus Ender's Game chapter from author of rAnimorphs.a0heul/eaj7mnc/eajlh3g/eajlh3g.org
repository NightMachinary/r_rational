I tried to make zero changes to canon.

This takes place in a gap year that is completely skipped over in canon, although there are events that are referenced and must have taken place (Ender being promoted to toon leader in Petra's army, Ender "talking Dink into playing along with the teachers"). My goal was to flesh out those and other related events as if the year had not been skipped in the original work.
