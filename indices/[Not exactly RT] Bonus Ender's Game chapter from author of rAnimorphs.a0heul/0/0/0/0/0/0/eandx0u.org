I read a series of blog posts criticizing the book one time. Much of it was nitpicky, but an interesting point was made that we're repeatedly told but not shown Ender's empathetic powers. He lets multiple schoolyard fights escalate to deathmatches when if he'd been more aware of his surroundings and a little less proud he might have been able to get away with a broken nose.
