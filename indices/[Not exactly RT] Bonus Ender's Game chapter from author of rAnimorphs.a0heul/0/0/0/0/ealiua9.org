In the first draft, Ender wondered what was broken in his own thinking.

My readers pointed out that Ender /never/ does that. He's perfectly happy to reflect on what's broken in /other/ people's thinking, and to vow not to make the same mistake, but he doesn't have uncertainty about his own cognition on the meta level.

Ender got a little seed of doubt from Dink's skepticism, but he always believed in the core of the war:

  The Battle School was so enclosed, the game so important in the minds of the children, that Ender had forgotten there was a world outside. Spanish honor. Civil war. Politics. The Battle School was really a very small place, wasn't it?

  But Ender did not reach Dink's conclusions. The buggers were real. The threat was real. The IF controlled a lot of things, but it didn't control the videos and the nets. Not where Ender had grown up. In Dink's home in the Netherlands, with three generations under Russian hegemony, perhaps it was all controlled, but Ender knew that lies could not last long in America. So he believed.

  Believed, but the seed of doubt was there, and it stayed, and every now and then sent out a little root. It changed everything, to have that seed growing. It made Ender listen more carefully to what people meant, instead of what they said. It made him wise.

This is a one-time thing. I might tinker with it, but there's room here for at most one chapter, according to me (the book flows fine with the gap year, and I think it would be improved with one chapter in the gap year instead, and I think it would be /worse/ with two or more).
