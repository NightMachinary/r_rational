  The nash equilibrium for a RPS game where rock wins 2 points and other wins are 1 point, I think works out to choosing Rock 20% of the time and each of the others 40% of the time - but I am not an expert on this sort of thing.

Close, but against that strategy, always-Rock wins an average of 0.4 points per game. The Nash Equilibrium is when both players choose Paper 50% of the time and each of the others 25% of the time.
