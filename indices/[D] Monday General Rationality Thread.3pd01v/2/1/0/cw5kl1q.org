  Oh, and in the Prisoner's Dilemma[3] , the Nash Equilibrium is defect-defect, even though cooperate-cooperate is better for both players. This is one way in which classic game theory fails to model the real world.

I don't see how that is failing to model the real world. What conclusion are they reaching that is false? Also, defect-defect is only the NE in a one-shot game.

In an infinite game, a better strategy is tit-for-tat (leading to both players cooperating forever).

When you get into high amount of rounds, but finite games where things get tricky.
