The Prisoner's Dilemma demonstrates how players can get a better outcome by following a non-equilibrium strategy, so the Nash equilibrium isn't a useful guide to playing the game.

"Both players always defect" is still a Nash equilibrium for the iterated prisoner's dilemma - neither player gains from using a different strategy as long as the other one keeps playing all-defect. I'm fairly sure "both players cooperate on the first game and play tit-for-tat thereafter" is not a Nash equilibrium - at the very least, you can improve on that strategy by suddenly defecting in the very last game.
