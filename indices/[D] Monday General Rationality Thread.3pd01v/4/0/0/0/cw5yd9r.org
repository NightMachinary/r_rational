Nope. the most resistant structures would be the ones with the fewest blocks which met the requirements, which basically means whatever structure has the fewest blocks. A box destabilizes on average every 12.5 generations, and a blinker destabilizes on average every 20 generations. I think it's likely that fungal life is one of the cellular automata in which everything always vanishes quickly.
