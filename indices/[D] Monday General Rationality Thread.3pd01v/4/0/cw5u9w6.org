That would be interesting, but it would also be strictly different and way less interesting in the ways that Conway's Life is. CL is cool because it's a set of four simple, intuitive rules which combined produce a turing complete system, technically capable of any and all arbitrary calculation. Fungal life would be interesting to watch a few times, but would then lose interest because it wouldn't be possible to actually construct things in it.
