Is this zero-sum? Because the two players could probably co-operate to get more than either could in competition.

More generally, I think this becomes a game of second-guessing your opponent, so there may /be/ no single winning strategy. (Just as it's strictly better to predict your opponant's moves in RPS than to be completely random.)
