  In your example - where you get 2 points for winning as the Nash equilibrium is where both players use a random strategy which plays 25% rock, 50% paper, 25% scissors.

Could you give me any advice to be able to estimate the Nash equilibrium of such a game (mixed strategy is the term I think). Did you have this example memorized, or could you calculate it in your head?
