Do the players know each other's payoffs?

#+begin_quote
  Imagine a game of RPS, to 100 points, except that every time rock beats scissors, that game counts as two points instead of one. What's the optimum strategy in that case? It's not 33/33/33% anymore.

This depends almost entirely on your opponent.

- If facing an opponent who throws randomly, the ideal strategy is 100% rock, because you'll average 2 points per 3 rounds.
- If facing an opponent who throws 100% rock, the ideal strategy is 100% paper, because you'll get 1 point every round.
- If facing an opponent who does tit-for-tat (they do whatever you did last), the optimum strategy is to pick rock, paper, scissors, rock, etc., because you'll get 4 points per 3 rounds.

See [[http://www.rpscontest.com/leaderboard][this RPS]] computerized competition for strategies - all have their code exposed. Basically, what you're asking for is /complex/ because it depends on knowing what the other player's strategy is, which at higher levels depends on trying to hide your own strategy from them.
