"Strategy" need not be restricted to computables, the arbitrary stupidity is still just a constant amount of wasted turns, and I only used AIXI to illustrate how no amount of heuristics smaller than human game-theoretic psychology is going to be optimal.

In deterministic games like chess, brute-force minmax's intractability doesn't make it less optimal, either.
