I'm currently in the planning stages of making a video game, and I'm having a bit of trouble figuring out how to code the AI to do what I want.

The simplest way to describe the problem is "biased rock paper scissors". Imagine a game of RPS, to 100 points, except that every time rock beats scissors, that game counts as two points instead of one. What's the optimum strategy in that case? It's not 33/33/33% anymore.

Now imagine that the two players had /different/ payoffs for various outcomes. How would you solve this in the general case?

Edit for clarification: Both players know the payoff matrix, and (to start with) I'm assuming that both players will play the Nash Equilibrium, and will add in the biases later. It is also Zero-sum, as it's a simple 1v1 arena battle with a binary win/loss condition.
