In terms of "able to deal with tons of weight on top of it or compressing" I think our best widely used material nowadays is concrete or maybe ceramic. From what I've heard, concrete is basically the perfect material for dealing with compressive forces and is hilariously good at the job for its weight. The reason we add iron bars to concrete has more to do with sheer or tensile forces rather than compressive ones.
