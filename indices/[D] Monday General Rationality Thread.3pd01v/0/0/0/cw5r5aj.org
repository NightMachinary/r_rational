There are varying degrees of conlangs. I'm into the ones that sound like languages, but that's only the first 2% of actual language creation. You choose which sounds you're going to be using, you pick some patterns for consonants and vowels, then you string them together into something that scans well. But /actually making a language/ is different, because you need phonology, intonation, inflection, agreement, tense, etc. Stuff [[http://imgur.com/a/G9vac][like this]] is what I mean when I'm talking about overkill.

(My friends and I are actually doing a Harry Potter themed version of D&D where one of the house rules is that you have to speak all of your spells in Dog Latin. So "Hold Person" becomes "/Holdus personi!/". So that's fun.)
