True, but if you take the time to make a language sound consistent and like an actual language instead of randomly throwing words together then you can have an extra layer of immersion to make the story flow better.

For example in /The Hobbit/ and /Eragon/, the made up languages added a nice touch to the world building without slowing things down due to how they contributed to the story and the authors didn't let it take attention away from the plotline.

As a counter-point, J K Rowling never intended her magic spells to be an actual language, so it sounds a bit ridiculous to have her characters to be speaking psuedo-Latin whenever they used their magic. It only works, because of how it's taken so seriously by her characters.
