I read /The Art of Language Invention/ over the weekend, which I found quite interesting. I recommend it if you have any interest in the complexity of language, or in conlangs themselves. I think it might have been a little confusing if I hadn't had a linguistics background, because it's trying to cover /lots and lots/ of things that a proper linguistics textbook would spend hundreds of pages on, but the advantage here is that it's not as dry as most textbooks are. (The book was written by the guy responsible for making Dothraki and Valyrian more than the minor sketches that GRRM put into the books.)

I personally think conlangs are /cool/ but usually complete overkill for use in fiction; you could teach the reader the language, but that's probably not a good idea if you also want a plot that moves anywhere. Since most readers aren't linguists or conlangers, that effort is wasted.
