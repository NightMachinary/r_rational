I think cellular automata would seriously benefit from a probabilistic component. At its simplest - how would Conway's Game Of Life change if the following addenda were added?

1) Living cells with two neighbors have a .1% chance of dying on each turn.

2) Dead cells with two neighbors have a .1% chance of coming to life on each turn.

That's just a Conway's Game Of Life mod, but I think it might be even more interesting to design entire cellular automata from the ground up around probabilities, rather than certainties.
