Oh, I'm having fun in the campaign, and Maya has no compunctions about what's going on. The issue isn't that the campaign isn't fun, it's that I don't think we're the heroes of the story. We're definitely villains. We're hip villains with good motivations to do what we do, but in the end, when we're successful, the world will be a worse place for most people. Maya is okay with this.
