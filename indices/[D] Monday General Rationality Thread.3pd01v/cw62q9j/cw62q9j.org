For once, I'm not DMing my D&D campaign-- I'm a player. The DM seems pretty good and moderately experienced. Our campaign setting is modern world + parahumans who only began emerging in the past 30 years or so. The PCs are all powered.

Following a series of violent and destructive clashes between powered humans, the government policy for dealing with this tiny minority of empowered people is effective imprisonment. The government sends parahumans to live in a walled-off section of Montana with power-suppressing machines built into the walls and ground to prevent their powers from doing anything. Also, the government has secretly added a chemical to most processed food that harmlessly suppresses powers.

The plot of the campaign is that basically we think this is a bad thing and are willing to lie, steal, kill, and terrorize in order to end this policy. It's pretty clear my character is willing to do all this stuff, but she was a criminal and a murderer before she got her powers.

Somehow, everyone seems totally on-board with the terrorism. I tried suggesting we quit our lives of villainy (since our secret identities were still secret) and start a political movement. We could write blog posts about how C41B (the secret chemical that suppresses superpowers) causes autism or obesity or something, and support Whole Foods which stocks C41B-free food. Run for local government, pass bills, etc. Maybe get started in Seattle and have our political movement work South, then East. Sadly, the rest of the party wanted the violent terrorism approach so I followed along.

During a snack break I discussed with the others that the government was doing something fundamentally reasonable. After all, if our world was one in which one in every hundred thousand people had the innate ability to level mountains and shatter buildings with impunity... well, /I'd/ want the government to shut these people into internment camps. Heck, I'd even support the idea of a secret harmless chemical that inhibits these peoples' powers. Superpowers /scare/ me. I was not persuasive enough! I don't think they're really thinking it through, though. I don't think they understand the visceral fear that they'd have if such people really existed.

I guess at some point I started viewing our party as a group of villains, even though the DM and the other players don't see that way. I don't mind this. Maya, my character, is definitely a villain. She's not even the worst. She's not the cop-killer-- that's Abigail. Baldwin hasn't murdered anyone yet, but that's more due to his power set than his will. Particleese has. Maya has.

Nobody thinks twice about the bodies we leave behind in our quest to destabilize a society that's already on the brink, a society that's barely controlling the parahuman menace. When the chips fall and we've given the empowered minority free reign to burn this world, will we be remembered as heroes? Probably not. We won't be remembered as anything, because this fledgling Democratic civilization will come to an end. We had millennia of dictatorship, a couple brief centuries of almost-just, almost-liberal rule, almost escaping despotism, serfdom, and the divine right of kings-- before being plunged back into the darkness by parahumans.
