Not really, since it still wouldn't be computable or tractably approximable.

My desired application is to sort of quantify the difference between a string that's "random" as in very compressed versus one that's "random" because it was created by flipping coins. The latter can be generated by a very short probablistic program whereas the former... could /also/ be generated by a coin-flip process but would come with greater likelihood from a complex causal process.

Or something. One reason I want the concept is to clarify my confused intuitions.
