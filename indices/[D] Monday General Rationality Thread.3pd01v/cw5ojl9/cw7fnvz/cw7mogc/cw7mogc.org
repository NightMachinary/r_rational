You're correct that the current idea is that currently there is no form of human evolution occurring......which is why this book is so interesting to me. They took a widely-held idea and gathered extensive evidence against it, and clearly and consistently explained why this idea is wrong and how humans are still evolving.

  This is a religious/political position, not a scientific one.

I feel that the idea being argued is a simple scientific question "Are humans currently evolving?", however people are motivated for political/religious reasons to choose one side or the other instead of following the evidence.

If you're curious, I currently believe humans are evolving because of the book, and the reason why I think this concept is not easily obvious is because the entire history of human civilization is shorter than the amount of time it takes for a mere handful of simple genetic mutations to spread throughout a species' population. So people look at how humans appear virtually identical throughout history and conclude that evolution has stopped instead of it being the fact that not enough time has passed.
