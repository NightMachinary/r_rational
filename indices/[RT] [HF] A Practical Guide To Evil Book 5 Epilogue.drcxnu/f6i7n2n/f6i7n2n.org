That was a beautiful ending.

Ime's warning and the conversation that followed it was convenient for me; it seemed clear that Amadeus had made a decision, and I had wondered from his wording if it was in fact to kneel and then stab Malicia in open court (like Cat when split into three by Akua). Thinking back, maybe Catherine also saw that meaning and was speaking against it, and him saying he wouldn't do that.

Once again... a beautiful ending. To this Book, that is, not to the whole story! That would be incredibly frustrating!

I am really looking forward to seeing how Amadeus fares while experiencing this /path not taken./

Ah, before I forget, Heroic Axiom 55 makes me curious about whether it applies to Vivienne or not, in which case Callow's position after the Liesse accords could be in trouble. Hm, Hanno too, though arguably he still has all his own powers.

Unrelated: Chapter 88 goes straight to Chapter 89, but in the Table of Contents to the side the 'Rise, Rise' Interlude from much earlier is displayed between them.

Edit: Ahh, and I forgot to write down how I loved the ending of the song about climbing the tower, after all those verses one by one about everything you have to sacrifice to get there.
