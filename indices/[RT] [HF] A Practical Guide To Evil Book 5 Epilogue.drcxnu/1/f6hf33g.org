Well, now we know how she's going to die. With Black saying the words "I do not kneel."

Still, Malicia raising new lords/ladies of the Steppes is a pleasant surprise. Especially considering we don't know whether or not the Reforms have been restored yet. Surprising, considering it gives orcs leaders to rally around. And giving Wither Foramen is unexpected too; Thalassina seemed more likely, considering Foramen's proximity to the Eyries.
