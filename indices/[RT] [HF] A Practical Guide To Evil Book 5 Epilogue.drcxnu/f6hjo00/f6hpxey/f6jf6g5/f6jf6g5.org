Catherine has never been much of an explorer. What drives her is the need to fix things, and I'm not sure she can put that behind herself entirely in a happily-ever-after.

I do like the idea of her being like John Uskglass from Jonathan Strange, i.e. a nigh-mythical ruler who disappeared centuries ago, but who people still take as granted as being the rightful leader of the nation.

If I were to guess, I think that the Name that's growing around her is going to be something akin to Bard's. A hands-off enforcer who stays away for the most part, only showing up to nudge people here or there if it looks like a godling is starting to develop a bit too uppity for the common good.

After transitioning away from Winter, she's already taken a much more advisory role with the things going on.
