/Putatively/ more loyal. I have a feeling that if Amadeus can catch up, he might disprove it spectacularly. And then Malicia will have a possibly fatal problem at arm's reach...

Also, Kairos may be dead for several chapters now but he still scores points with me :D

  It was a small, almost imperceptible thing. Tariq Fleetfoot saw it anyway, as did Hanno of Arwad. A flicker, a spark. When the Queen of Callow had spoken the words and meant them, something had begun to take shape.

  A Name, Gods help them all.

  Amadeus no longer had spies, or wealth or even the power of a Name. He had sent away Scribe, failed Captain and lost Warlock. Assassin was gone, if not from Creation then at least from his service.

  Alaya would see him kneeling, or forever gone from her sight.
