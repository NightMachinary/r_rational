Also, it's time to review [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/aj0qtc/2019_fiction_predictions/][our past predictions for Book 5]]:

Malicia survived Book 5 - excusable as she's pretty much done now and there wasn't supposed to be a Book 6...

Tyrant, however, did not. But he lives in my heart foravah !

Pilgrim did survive Book 5, but he did die too. Hmmmpf. Let's call it a draw.

I thought 2 of the Woe would die, but only one did (Archer).

Akua did not betray the Woe... or so I think ? So I got ~8 right out of 12. The audience's vote got 9 correct out of 12.
