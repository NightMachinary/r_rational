You're right Catherine have no Wanderlust, she would not Travel for the sense of wonder of seeing new sights, she'd travel to try cheap wines and enjoy good company and sometimes a good brawl escaping any responsibilities that otherwise would be layered on her.

Since she hates being queen and her reputation means people would bother her constantly unless she disappear by traveling incognito.
