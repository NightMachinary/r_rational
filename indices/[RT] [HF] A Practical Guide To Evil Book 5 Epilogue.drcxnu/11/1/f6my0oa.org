The series I've been reading as updates come out:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][Worth the Candle]]: (Awesome meta-story isekai based on tabletop tropes. Almost certainly you've seen it advertised here).

[[http://novelfull.com/lord-of-the-mysteries.html][Lord of the Mysteries]]: (Chinese, but translated. Interesting world building and magic/power system. Lots of inadvertent comedy to poke fun at for translation choices; eg lampooned).

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/14167/metaworld-chronicles][Metaworld Chronicles]]: (Interesting world building isekai, with a different focus than I usually see (Australian/Chinese, not European/American)

[[https://tiraas.net/table-of-contents/][The Gods Are Bastards]] (author just started book 16)
