I can see an argument for that. I do think that Big V is the one who's out of the picture, but more for being benched. I think she's going to do something stupid and get on the Wardens bad side. Hell, she already has if they find out about it. I would argue the personality changes began prior to that night and she has just dropped some of the barriers allowing her to be more influenced by Waste-chan. It does seem to be accelerating though, so... you could be right. We shall see :)
