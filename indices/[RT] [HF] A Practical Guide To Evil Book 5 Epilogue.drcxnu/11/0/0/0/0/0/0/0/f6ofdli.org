That's the tell. The show is as I mentioned above. New big V is a completely different person. Different focus, different personality, everything she might have been if the wretch had never happened, filtered through the Passenger's views. Being "in tune" with the passenger wouldn't have that effect without also making her more like Khepri. Or do you think that's where the manipulation aspect is coming from? I predict we'll have an interlude 20-30 chapters from now showing that Big V is the other member of breakthrough who's out of the picture according to Contessa's prediction and she's bem trapped in shard space since that night.
