Some explanations and further notes:

Given the conversation at the end of Chapter 5, I want to note that I finished The Library Unpublished months ago. I had no idea this chapter would coincide with this particular Biweekly Challenge :)

An explanation regarding the author's note at the beginning of Chapter 6 might be necessary. The mentioned "kudos" are ao3's version of "likes", which can be given even without an ao3 account. They tend to increase a story's visibility on ao3 and are a nice way to show an author your support. (Wink wink, nudge nudge.)

For those of you who are WMGing really hard right now: the nested story in Chapter 6 ends at the first horizontal rule, and as soon as the chatlog begins, we are reading The Library Unpublished again.

Lastly, for those who'd like to know where all the fictional works come from: /Aloof Antares/ is mentioned in the manga Akumetsu, in which a teenager dresses up as a superhero and murders corrupt politicians. (It's about as edgy as it sounds, and not very deep.)

Thank you for reading.
