  the mysterious section is over
#+end_quote

Mmmmmaybe? There'll be some mysteries left, for now---___ is not going to explain everything.

But I'll agree that the progression was pretty fast. That is, perhaps, the drawback of the accelerated update schedule. These to chapters might have deserved separate weeks; I'll rethink this for the next week.

#+end_quote

I'll admit that both The Northern Caves and the only work of mine that was previously posted here ([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/9829580/chapters/22071191][On the Continuity of Consciousness]]) share that narrative structure. Which one tipped you off? :)
