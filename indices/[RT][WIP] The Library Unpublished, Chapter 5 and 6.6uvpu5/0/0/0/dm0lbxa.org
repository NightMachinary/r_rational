(Seeing this, I've now finished reading The Northern Caves (the fiction about the fictional book, not the fictional book itself) in one sitting; it was quite interesting, reminding me strongly of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slouching_Towards_Bedlam][Slouching Towards Bedlam]], except with [[#s][]]. Perhaps because of the association, perhaps because of the rather grand language used by the report's author at the start, I found myself anticipating an ending larger in scale than what actually occurred. ([[#s][]]) The concept of the books themselves was very nice, looking back at them and understanding the life experience that they were trying to communicate.)

(It has also been fun to think about the ambiguity of whether [[#s][]].)

(I also find myself wondering about [[#s][]].)
