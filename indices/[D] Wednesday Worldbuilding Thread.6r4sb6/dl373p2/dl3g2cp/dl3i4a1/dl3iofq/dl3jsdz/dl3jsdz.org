With all this talk about Irish and Italians not being white, you're making me think of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cagot][Cagots]]: Basically, a despised French minority group who were in no easily determinable way any different from anyone else.

No doubt vampires may well have thrown their hands up in disgust - or they might have their own outcast caste.

Anarchism might be a good well to draw on! Neoreactionaries, too, maybe. (Honestly the neoreactionary way of thinking might ultimately be what would appeal most to one of my vampires, but no reason not to give others different ideas.)
