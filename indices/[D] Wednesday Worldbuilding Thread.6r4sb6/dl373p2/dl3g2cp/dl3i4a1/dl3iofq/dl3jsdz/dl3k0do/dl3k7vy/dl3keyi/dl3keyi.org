Haha.

I remember when two of my friends and I were walking through a part of a subdivision was near to where we lived but which I'd never been to, and we ended up getting lost because each of us assumed one of the others knew where he was going and would interpret small movements like "glancing in this direction" as indicating that e.g. we're going to take a turn in just a moment. Because this resulted in each of us making our own movements it somehow turned into each of us following someone else and not realizing that the other two were doing the same thing.

Maybe something similar happened here, people all persecuting the Cagots because they interpreted a less extreme action as persecution and, well, you don't want to look like an idiot by asking /why/ the persecution is going on, do you? It makes sense to everyone else, apparently, so just shut up and get with the program.

And really it's just that three guys at a bar made some jokes about their Cagot neighbor one time and then things got out of control.
