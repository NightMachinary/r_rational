I really love that idea, but I don't think I'd be game to use it.

I can see so many cool consequences of it, too. Young vampires who knew about this from the get-go would probably try and stick to a very specific type of prey to maintain their own apperance. Maybe those serial killers who target young blonde women are vampires?

But as vampires got older they'd start caring less and less about who they ate because no matter how many beautiful young blonde women they eat, their face would no longer be recognisable to them, since their own bone structure would have long since faded into mystery.

Would also explain why vampires are so beautiful, as people tend to prefer "the average face". And as a corollary, old vampires would probably have a "look".

My Vampires also run on nanites that use their DNA as a blueprint, so you'd even have a mechanism for this - the DNA from the blood they drink regularly would dilute the DNA that the nanites get from the "original" corpse. (Though a lot of face stuff is epigenetics/growth/etc but let's ignore that).

It's a very cool idea! I wish I could use it.
