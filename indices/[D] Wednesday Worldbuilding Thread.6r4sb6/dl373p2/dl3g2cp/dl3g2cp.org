  you know, "humans are different, but I was one of them once, what was important to me then? What could be important to him now?"

This could be a comedy goldmine, if he doesn't account for drift over time and between cultures.

  But maybe it would make sense to lock onto your human past in order to try and capture the subjective emotions?
#+end_quote

I don't think that it makes sense from the point of view of someone who's taking a step back and adopting the Outside View, but unless vampires become perfectly rational beings upon joining the ranks of the undead, something like "maybe experiences from my short human life will be more relevant than those from my longer, post-mortem unlife" is, if not perfectly reasonable, then at least something I would expect to see.

  And then I'm like, "for all I know he might have spent a couple of hundred years being worshipped as a sky-king by a cult in iraq c1100CE, would that sort of thing really be on his radar? and if it was, would he weep for the loss of that ancient iraqi cult just as much?". And then I'm like broody depressed All My Friends Are Dead vampires are lame and that's not what I want.
#+end_quote

There are really happy, really old people who are neither broody and waiting to join all their dead friends in the Big Sky Party, nor nihilistic and uncaring about the present despite having seen it all before. If you can find some articles or interviews that give insight into how they categorize things then that might be helpful (and I imagine that the majority of old vampires have figured out how to find joy in the present, because suicide is as easy as leaving the curtains open before you go to sleep).

  how affected do you think vampires are by their "human" lives?
#+end_quote

Some vampires may think upon it fondly, not exactly in a way that makes them mourn what's been lost but in the way that people think fondly upon their childhoods. Others may be incredibly embarrassed by their former lives. I mean, I'm embarrassed by who I was just a few years ago, so I'm pretty sure that I'd be embarrassed by who I was a century ago, had I been alive back then.

Also, how do your vampires deal with the shift in morality over time and across cultures? Among other things, I've been thinking lately about how people often make the argument that there have been "moral advances" over the centuries but, at the same time, there are people who lived two thousand years ago or more and whose positions on animal rights, pacifism, equality between the sexes, caring for the unfortunate, and so on would put most modern people to shame, despite how many people today think that the ancients were all savages. For a Jain or follower of Modi who was turned into a vampire a very, very long time ago, it's probably a weird experience to not only see mainstream morality shifting, as it always does, but shifting ever more closely in accordance with the values that everyone else once considered to be wackadoo nonsense. On the other hand, someone whose values have been left behind will likely be infuriated by that but it must give such a person pause to see how morality just keeps on shifting and to realize that morals have /always/ been shifting. It's one thing to complain about the younger generations and another to see that younger generation then complain about the next one, for five or ten iterations on, but see everything move along all the same.
