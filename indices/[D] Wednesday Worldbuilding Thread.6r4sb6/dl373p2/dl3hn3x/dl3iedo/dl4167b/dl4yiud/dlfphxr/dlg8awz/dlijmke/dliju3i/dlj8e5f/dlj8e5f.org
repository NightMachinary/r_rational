Dunno, prolly because it was the most recent worldbuilding thread at the time I joined the discussion.

The blue/orange morality thing is difficult, in my opinion. In general, I mean, particularly for viewpoint characters. You can always have incomprehensible characters with unearthly motivations, but when you derive the characters from relatively baseline humans, then their motives and morality would be informed by their origins. After all, humans drag a /shitload/ of impressions and opinions with them that they acquired early in life. It's part of the reason there's always a generation shift in various fields; holdovers of old theories aren't so much convinces as they die off and new practices can take hold.

Anyway, blue/orange: maybe look at the issues a gerontocracy (which is what you're effectively proposing for vampires) may have to deal with; I'm sure there will be treatises on that on the internet. One of the top of my head would be the age divide: if only older generations are ruling, young aspirants will never have a chance to sit on the throne themselves, so to speak.

When I read Hamilton's first /Confederation/ books, this was actually addressed in a byline; one dynasty ruler was considering opening up the higher echelons of the dynasty not to just the first two, three generations of children he sired, but to the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh, to infuse new blood. (pun not intended, but welcome nonetheless)

Lastly, I'm a bit ambivalent about the religious conflict being so transgressive it covered the whole world. For instance, at that time Australia was still undiscovered, travel times between continents was many months, and the vampires likely recruited their â€˜offspring' from all kinds of human religions.

This isn't to discourage you from using that trope; I just felt it necessary to mention possible future issues pointed out to you by readers.
