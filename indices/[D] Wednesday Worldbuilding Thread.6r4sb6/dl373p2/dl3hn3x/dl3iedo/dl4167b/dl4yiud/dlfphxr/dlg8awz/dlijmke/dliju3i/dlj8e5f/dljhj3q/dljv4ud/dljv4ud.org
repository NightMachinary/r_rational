Well, you can accomplish a lot by defining the rules by which (this) magical plague works. Does it spread by contact? If so, then more urbanised vampire societies will be quicker to be infected. What's the incubation period? Days and it will burn itself out before it can infect many vampires; if you want to have a thorough infection rate it should be years at minimum, or it's active at a very low level for a long time, fighting off the superhuman immune system (think certain cancers or magical AIDS), before it reaches sufficient inertia to kill the host. Maybe tie the plague to a certain event for going active; then it would have had decades to infect the most vampires before suddenly impacting everyone.

Hm... an idea just now was having the plague be a kind of human virus that crossed the â€˜species barrier' in the worst possible way for vampires, and in search for a magical antidote they acquire that weakness to holy symbols. I don't know the particulars for your mythology, but there's some room for speculation for the plague's background.
