I meant attracted in a physiological sense, not emotional. And yes, they would be aware of the squick issue, or at least they could be aware of it, I think.

I mean, from a broader perspective all vampires with romantic interests in humans will be essentially ephebophiles, at least judging from their life span compared to that of their prospective romantic partner.

The consent is a whole other issue I don't wanna poke with a ten-foot pole. I think this again comes to the vampire's general perspective and views of humans. Will it be something like in societies condoning and encouraging slave ownership, i.e. they're not /real/ people, and they don't have the civilisatory maturity for actual meaningful relationship? Or does it go even further, viewing humans as chattel and relationships are on the level of pet-owner, and any vampire pursuing more is viewed the same as a sodomist in modern societies?

Stuff for thought, I think. This clash of views could actually be a fault line in vampire societies, insofar as such a thing exists, with clans with shared views forming political factions and such.
