  And then I'm like, "for all I know he might have spent a couple of hundred years being worshipped as a sky-king by a cult in iraq c1100CE, would that sort of thing really be on his radar? and if it was, would he weep for the loss of that ancient iraqi cult just as much?".

Being worshiped as a sky-king would get pretty mundane if you looked at activities on a day-to-day basis.

If I met the King, I'd be having a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Adrenaline's going. And I'm imagining telling my grand-kids about what it was like to be in a massive hall.

The King is on his seventh meeting of the day. He's probably running on autopilot. "Minion shows up. Looks like generic scribe. Nervous. Tell him Joke #3 to get him to relax. Ok, he's saying his thing. What decision do I need to make here? Can I get this done before lunch? Man this chair is uncomfortable. Didn't i tell someone to fix that yesterday? Oh. Scribe stopped talking. Look serious. What was the question again?"

The experience might be like living on a cruise-ship, except with people nervously interrupting you every 30 minutes. Plus, your friends want to steal your stuff. And you have to spend large chunks of time stoically 'presiding' over random gatherings.

You'd get used to the physical perks (Food! Whenever you want!) and they'd fall into the background. Decisions are filtered through orders given to 3-10 close advisers. So the actual experience of ruling wouldn't be all that different than managing a regional chain of video rental stores.

So, becoming a God-King is almost certainly memorable. But the actual day-to-day experience wouldn't necessarily be any more intense than anything else. And I don't think it would make your vampire unable to appreciate lesser positions.

For relationships, I'd look to dog ownership. Bernese Mountain Dogs live 6-8 years. I knew a guy who lived on a bunch of land and had 4 of them at a time. A dog breeder, over their lifetime, could easily have owned 40+ dogs.

You'd never expect a dog breeder to be all broody and depressed over dog-ownership. Even after decades, they'd still be excited to see a puppy learn a new trick. And they'd still mourn when a dog passed away.

I think they'd just be kind of pragmatic about the whole thing. Lives come. And they go. You celebrate when it's time for joy. And you mourn when it's time for sadness. Experience the feelings, and know that things change.

At the same time, not all dogs would fade from memory equally fast. The dog-breeder probably remembers a bunch about his first puppy. Those experiences were new and extra intense. And he probably has a handful of really special dogs who stick out in his memory, as The Champion Show-dog or The Amazing Friend.

If you apply that to human/vampire relationships, I'd expect that the vampire has several relationships going at once. They could be staggered. You might have the 20-year-old he's just meeting. The 40-year-old who's now raising a human family / running a chunk of the vampire's empire. And the 80-year-old who he meets to reminisce about old times.

Alternately, if the vampire is a 'serial monogamist', I think they might optimize for partners who are intensely memorable in some way. Here, I'd look for superlatives. It's someone who's beautiful AND driven to achieve ___.

Finally, for reminiscing, I'd think about what it's like to explain childhood minutia to a foreign friend (or someone from a younger generation).

A few weeks ago, I was talking to a co-worker about a time that I'd forgotten my ID when trying to buy beer. The clerk challenged me to sing the chorus from the "Gummy Bear" theme song.

Co-Worker and I launched into a terrible rendition of it. The people under 30 had absolutely no idea what we were singing. And the people under 30 from outside the US were lost. Not only did they not know the show, the whole "Saturday Morning Cartoon" thing relied on a bunch of cultural context that they just didn't have.

I'd expect your vampire to have similar feelings about Gaul. He wouldn't pine for the forests for the same reason that I don't pine for the early 1990s. It's too different, and I'm too distant.

Instead, he'd have memories of really small things. The thing itself might be easy to explain ("this is a conker! We had them when I was young"), but the cultural context that made it special would be almost impossible ("You'd tie a string through your conker and then swing them at each other. No, not to hit the other player. That's 'hot cockles'. You hit the other conker. And then you see whose conker shatters!")
