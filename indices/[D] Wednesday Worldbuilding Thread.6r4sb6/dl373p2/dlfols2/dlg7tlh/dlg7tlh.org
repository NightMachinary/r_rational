Thank you for your input!

Yeah, the vampires definitely seem to have an "apprenticeship" going on, because My Vampires have such inscrutable social rules that you'd need someone to teach you. I'm contemplating whether they have periodic "mass turnings" where a group of ~20 vampires will try and turn 20 humans (about 10 will take). Those 10 successful vampires would then be "raised" in a "school" to become successful members of society.

But I'm not sure who would be motivated to do that. Maybe a fringe faction of vampires. Then again, My Vampires go through a serious population bottleneck c. 1700, so it could be that a few "cohorts" of vampires were mass-birthed "out of necessity", "to continue the species", etc. But whether the bottleneck!population would care about the proliferation of the species or not is kind of strange? I guess it gives you social allies because they owe their existence to you? But they won't necessarily stay on your side long-term. Vampires don't /need/ to be surrounded by other vampires, they just tolerate them.

Or maybe that's stupid and tropey. Maybe vampires like being surrounded by other vampires to talk with and spend time with, even if they have very tense undertones as any one could defect; but in practise once you've lived somewhere a few decades, you and all the local vampires are pretty comfy for at least a few more, just because you share the same hunting grounds.
