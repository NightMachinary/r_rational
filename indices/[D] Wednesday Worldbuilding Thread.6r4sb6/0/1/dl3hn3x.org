I like how [[/u/callmebrotherg][u/callmebrotherg]] suggests them thinking about their human lifetime similarly to their childhood, and I think you could take that a step further and treat the various identities they've taken over the centuries as careers they pursued. Some lifetimes were happier than others, but fate gave them opportunities that they took advantage of in order to prosper.

Vampires have to adopt and abandon identities in order to stay hidden and support themselves, so they might think of them as jobs they've worked. Some were more pleasant than others and some required relearning what they knew, but it was always something they had to do and helped define who they were. Of course, jobs mean different things to different people.

I don't think there's anything wrong with your vampire feeling nostalgic for the past, though if he were introspective about how he's changed as a person since then it might avoid the cliche. He's not the same person he was before and may wonder if that's a good thing, but he has been many different people over the centuries by his own choices and the compulsions of others.

In the case of him being sentimental about the past, perhaps he doesn't long for his old life but just wants to remind himself of it. He doesn't want it back, he just doesn't want to forget how important it was to him. Maybe he wants to avoid making the same mistakes or continue to honor the memory of losses he's come to terms with. For him, it's like taking an old photo album out.
