Yeah... this is something I'm personally pretty guilty of.

  However, pursuing the angle of the human reminding the vampire of happier times he'd forgotten about could be very romantic.

Yeah, I think the story is going to be a lot about transitions and adapting to your partner as you both go through different stages of your lives - though with a vampire and a human who goes through various stages of supernatural bondage to the vampire before ultimately ending up as an independent vampire himself, it's just slightly more turmurtulous than the average human might deal with.

  I don't know if comparing vampire's relationships to humans should be comparable to humans and objects

This is very tricky to handle right, you're correct. It's especially bad because I can't conceive of how a 1500 year old vampire dating a 22 year old human is going to be anything /other/ than pretty squicky when you think about the vampire's POV in any sort of depth. The human winds up adopting a dog and my partner was saying he thought the whole dog plotline was very transparent in terms of "vampire is to human as human is to dog", when all I really meant by that was wanting to give the human a dog because he would be lonely during the day otherwise. But hey, if the shoe fits... it is a pretty perfect analogy.

And like I said above, it's all about the transitions, so ultimately the vampire will be seeing the human as more of an equal - just not straight at the beginning of the story.

Thanks again for all your comments! It's so very helpful!
