The squicky part may be dealt with in a manner I just thought of, but be aware, it will significantly impact your worldbuilding.

Vampires are attracted to the age range they were attracted to as humans. You were hot for mature partners? Then you'll keep being that way, since that's an intrinsic part of your make-up. If V/V romances are a thing, only vamps with mature looks will be attractive to you, regardless if they're actually older than you or not.

Another, rather more squicky approach could be you're attracted to the age range you appear to be in. You were turned in the tweens? Well, that's your hunting ground, you better like clubs these days. You were turned in your nineties? Well, you better start prowling retirement homes. You were turned as a child? Yeah, good luck with /that/.

Like I said, rather squicky, not to mention mind-rapey.
