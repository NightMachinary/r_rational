Yeah, if I go the magical plague route, it's going to be a decades long plague that spreads by airborne transmission or something. Crossing the species barrier is interesting, the idea of it all being just a tragic accident is kind of poetic because Life Sucks Sometimes You Know?

The holy symbol thing isn't important like at all. My main vampire goes to a catholic church on occasion, so you know, he's probably OK with all that junk.

The Catastrophe, while ultimately very important to the worldbuilding in many ways, is also ultimately irrelevant to the story in many others and it kind of bores me to speculate on it because it's... not the story I want to tell, you know? Like, for an analogy, say I'm writing a setting where the South won the civil war, but it's 2091 and slavery is still going strong and the slaves all have cybernetic implants or something. And I have all these ideas about my cybernetic slaves and their struggles and whatever, and then people are saying, "okay, but how did the Confederates get enough supplies to defeat the Yankees? The yankees had access to better rifles in reality, do you think the Confederates in your timeline invented better rifles and won with technology or do you think they aligned better with Mexico to overcome it?" (or whatever: I know nothing about history). And meanwhile I'm like, "I'm really not interested, that's all background noise, the point is it happens and now I have cybernetic slaves in high school playing pranks on their teachers, which is what I actually want to w rite about".

Not to say that the catastrophe isn't important to the story, and it has a LOT more implications on vampire society than I'm letting on: but focusing on it just makes me go "okay, that's well and good, but /my vampire/ wants to kiss this human, and that's /so much more interesting to me/". I think I need to be locked in a room with no food or water until I come up with A Perfect Sketch of the Catastrophe^{TM}

Thank you for your help though! The more I think about the Catastrophe the more comfortable I get with it.

I think I sound ungrateful and I very much don't mean to.
