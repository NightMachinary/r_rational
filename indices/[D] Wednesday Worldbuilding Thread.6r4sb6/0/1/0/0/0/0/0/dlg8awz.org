It's not about who you're attracted to, though. It's about the fact that if you have a 2000 year old vampire who appears to be 13, the thought of her sleeping with a 13 year old boy today gets very rapey, very fast. Like, you hear about those 9 year old girls who are married off to 60 year old men in Saudi Arabia or wherever? Even setting aside the physical issues with them consummating the relationship and the elephant in the room of consent, the age gap is just squicky - what common ground would a 60 year old and a 9 year old possibly have?

So yeah, that's the issue. Not whether it would make sense for a vampire to want to bump uglies with a human of any age, but whether it's /appropriate/ for a vampire to seek out a human lover, whether it's exploitative, whether it's just a huge mismatch of... everything. And at the end of the day my story kind of hinges on such a relationship happening, so you know, I'm stuck with it!

Aside: [[http://jezebel.com/mens-favorite-ages-are-20-21-22-and-23-a-data-dive-1731660984][according to an OKCupid analysis]] apparently hetero men like ~22yo women, and women like men close to their own age. So the "attracted to people my apparent age" thing isn't going to look like a good option. "Attracted to people I liked as a human" would work fine, though. But it still doesn't solve the problem of a 1500 year old vampire falling in love with a 22 year old human in a way that doesn't seem to be gross on its face.
