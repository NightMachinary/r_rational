Yeah, the physiological issues of attraction are pretty easy. I'm more concerned about the ethics and whether it's even possible for a vampire/human relationship to, you know, not be horribly exploitative. There's an age gap, experience gap, and a power differential you can drive a truck through.

  I mean, from a broader perspective all vampires with romantic interests in humans will be essentially ephebophiles, at least judging from their life span compared to that of their prospective romantic partner.

I don't know; the self-professed ephebophiles I see talked about online are in their 30s or 40s, so we're talking about "only" a 20 year age difference. There's a difference between a 100 year old vampire dating a 30 year old human and a 1000 year old vampire doing the same thing.

Yeah, this is something my story touches on. The human thing is more-or-less on the pet-owner side of the spectrum. That said, loving humans goes into and out of fashion, in the setting it is currently out of fashion but maybe becoming fashionable again. The sodomist comparison is more or less apt.

Man... you've made me realise that although I gave My Vampires a feudal sort of hierarchy, they would probably also have "clans" of sorts. Likely to be around other vampires with similar sorts of views.

/Perhaps that's why vampires organise "under" more powerful vampires/. Wow. I always struggled to explain that. They support each other politically, and the younger vampires are protected from older, more politically powerful vampires. The letters the vampires are always sending each other can also include, perhaps, books and papers where they try and convince each other of political views.

Now I need to think of some "blue and orange" vampire morality things that the different "vampire nations" might have. That would be a fun thing for next week's worldbuilding thread if I can remember to post it!

Thanks for that - I am not sure why you went to a worldbuilding thread that was a couple of weeks old and posted with your thoughts but I am really glad you did. That is probably the seed of a decent worldbuilding breakthrough for me!
