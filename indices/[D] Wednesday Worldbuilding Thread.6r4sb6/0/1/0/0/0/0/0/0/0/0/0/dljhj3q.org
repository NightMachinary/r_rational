Yeah, it's tricky.

Australia was definitely discovered in 1700; the local peoples were living there for 50,000 years, no doubt including some vampires. But there certainly wasn't fast travel between them.

You're right on the world-spanning religious conflict being tricky though. Vampires who are old enough can turn into bats, which lets them fly - probably not as fast as a plane though, which means they probably will have a tough time crossing e.g. the pacific ocean.

A magical plague seems the best way to accomplish what I was hoping to accomplish, though whether 4% of vampires just happened to resist the plague vs 4% of vampires found the antidote is another question. Random resistance of the plague requires less thought, but it also stops a good worldbuilding opportunity of "what made all these vampires band together and find the antidote?"/"what made the guy who found the antidote pick these particular vampires?"

That said, has the problem of the vampires who survived the plague of 1700 being somewhat uniform in terms of appearance (i.e. the 250 chinese-origin-vampires that should proportionally exist would have mostly been living in China and perhaps not physically able to access the antidote: which is great if I want to justify why everyone is european, but I don't really care whether they're european or not, but if the vampire catastrophe centered around eastern europe (where the vampire myth originated in 1700; the catastrophe explains somewhat why that is), then a disproportionate amount of vampires are going to be from europe and the middle east.

Doing my head in!
