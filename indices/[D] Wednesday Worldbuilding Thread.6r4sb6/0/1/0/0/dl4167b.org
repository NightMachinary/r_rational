Another good analogy might be an adult finding a toy from their childhood that they long since stopped playing with, but seeing it again brings up some happy memories. Unlike other pieces of their past they got rid of, they like having it around even if they'll rarely do anything with it. Maybe they decide to put it on their shelf instead of leaving in the attic because they decide they don't want to forget again, or finally give it to someone else because they don't need it anymore.

I don't know if comparing vampire's relationships to humans should be comparable to humans and objects, though, even if people vary in their respect for their possessions. However, pursuing the angle of the human reminding the vampire of happier times he'd forgotten about could be very romantic. I keep thinking of scenes from Pixar films like Ratatouille and Toy Story 3 where we see characters rediscover their past and become better people as a result.
