Thank you very much for your comment! I really like the idea of the job analogy, as I think that's a great well to draw on too.

That's a very profound thought, thank you for putting it into words. I'm beginning to make a detailed plan for Volume 2 of my story, where Vampire meets with a person from his distant past, and the thought that they were both obviously different people back then is a great one to work with. I'm imagining some serious code-switching going on.

  For him, it's like taking an old photo album out.

Great analogy. The really rough stuff I scratched out the past few days basically has memories of the long past coming to him, unbidden, when his human partner is talking about his own life/thoughts/worries/etc.

I don't think I want to go ahead with it as written. I like the idea of it being a kind of "focused meditation", where he chooses to think those thoughts in that time and place, perhaps to gain insights into what humanity is or maybe just because he has fond memories of his long-dead wife and children.

Thank you again!
