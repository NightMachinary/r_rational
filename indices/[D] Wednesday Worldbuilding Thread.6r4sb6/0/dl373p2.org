Nobody's posted yet today so I'll put in a small question that I will of course ask in a very long winded way: how affected do you think vampires are by their "human" lives?

Like, obviously a vampire who is <200yo would probably be very affected by it. But many vampires are a thousand years old or more.

There's a thing about subjective perception of time, something like at the age of 30 you've already filled up half of your "memory space"/"subjective time space" - so would vampires have a logarithmic memory, where there are bigger chunks of "storage space" devoted to earlier stuff? Or would it be like that character in Dr Who where the brain can't hold everything and so forgets? (Probably not for My Vampires, but maybe for someone else's, since My Vampires have very good memories)

I'm trying to write more vampire POV scenes and I started having him remember his human life, to try to relate to his human lover (you know, "humans are different, but I was one of them once, what was important to me then? What could be important to him now?"), but it seems so... lame and tropey, to have a guy in the 1940s remember the forest of Gaul c.600 CE. My instinct would be that he'd have so many more experiences in his long life that the long-lost days of his youth would be less relevant than, say, a human he took pity on and spared during feeding in say 1400, or a bard's poem he happened to listen to.

But maybe it would make sense to lock onto your human past in order to try and capture the subjective emotions? But would it be something you would even think of as being part of you and your experiences in any meaningful way after so long?

Like, I was thinking of writing a little thing about Vampire, I don't know, talking to himself in his Original Language, or singing an old war-song, etc, and being sad/broody about the fact that nobody alive would understand it, that those words and syllables are the last survivors of the people he knew and loved as a human. And then I'm like, "for all I know he might have spent a couple of hundred years being worshipped as a sky-king by a cult in iraq c1100CE, would that sort of thing really be on his radar? and if it was, would he weep for the loss of that ancient iraqi cult just as much?". And then I'm like broody depressed All My Friends Are Dead vampires are lame and that's not what I want.
