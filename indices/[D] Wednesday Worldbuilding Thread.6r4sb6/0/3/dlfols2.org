Well, I can only advise you to speak to elders in retirement homes, to steer the discussion to how they relate their current life and character to who they were in school, because that's what basically the human duration of the vampires' life was, school. The learned how to be people and all that stuff, and just like school a big part won't be relevant for their adult (vampire) life, but it will still stick with them, both in hands-on as well as social skills.

A human trader will probably become a vampire with wanderlust, and they will retain lots of their methodic skills, their tradecraft, and it will be just as useful in later years.

To expand on that simile of human life = school for vampires, their first years as a vampire will also leave a large impact on them. You can relate it to an apprenticeship in that simile, I think, and not be too far off; you'll learn valuable skills and make connections, and it will impact you, but it won't /necessarily/ limit you in your character. Depending on your environment, of course; if apprenticing in vampirism is basically the same as joining a coven or cult, then â€˜graduating' would become more difficult.
