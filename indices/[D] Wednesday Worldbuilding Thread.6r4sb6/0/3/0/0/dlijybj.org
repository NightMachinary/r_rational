Be aware of the pitfalls---and opportunities---the founder effects offers to you in the case of bottlenecking populations. You're essentially reducing a broad variety of options to but a few. The surviving population will express these options much more readily and will derive sub-options based on them. This is true for genetics, certainly, but also for other more etherical issues, like political opinions. Say you have the major factions A and B, but also minor factions C, D, E, F. By chance the bottleneck affected C and E less, but killed off D. After the bottleneck the major factions are C and E, with minor A, B, and F. E goes on a power binge, extincts F, and over the result of this E splits into E1 and E2. Go ahead a couple generations and you have a political structure that looks completely different to what it was before the bottleneck.

You know, the more I think of it, the more I realises vampires would essentially be hunter/gatherers for longer than humans were, since, like for some predators-prey relationships, a big collection of prey can kill the predator. Only with the urbanisation of peoples would the hunter/gatherers settle down, since they now have a hunting ground that would be able to absorb losses with drawing too much attention to the apex predator. And while before the long stretches of loneliness drove vampires mad and killed them (madness and sun doesn't go well together), only when cities became a thing and they could socialise with other vampires did they develop an actual society.

Depending on your level of conspiracy, you can even have the whole thing flip around, of course; have vampires be naturally more social, and have them induce / reward conglomeration tendencies in the humans, which would then lead to a shift to agricultural and urbanised societies, and so on.
