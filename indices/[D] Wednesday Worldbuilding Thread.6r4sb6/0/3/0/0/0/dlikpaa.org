Yeah, that's definitely been a big thought: because it won't feature in my story I haven't done /heavy/ thought into this, but the sketch is that the bottleneck was /probably/ caused by some religious extremist vampire getting some power and converting people (or just being fabulously powerful in and of themself). The religious vampire wanted to exterminate the vampire race because it's evil, didn't work but almost did, maybe an et tu, brute? moment, etc. Helps explain the folklore about vampires being killed/scared by crosses since they were prominent in a "hateful regime". (Thanks to [[/u/ccc_037]] for coming up with almost all of this).

I picture the population going from ~20k to ~800, but in 1900 the population's back up to 20,000, a growth rate of 1.5% pa that puts the population at 40k in 1950 and 100k in 2000. About a third of the story's set in 1944-5 and the rest is "present day" (2017 vampire population: 130k).

So it does let you sketch up the composition of the demographics likely represented in the 800 surviving vampires:

- Probably some of Powerful Vampire's cronies, who converted or pretended to convert but are secretly working to kill all vampires (the latter probably v. bad idea: kill all vampires is easily accomplished by breaking the masquerade and revealing a lot of secrets that vampires still definitely have some 200 years later, so probably the only surviving vampires from Powerful Vampire's Cronies were actually defectors)

- Some vampires who believe in continuing the species and make babies as often as they can (which is every 20 years or so)

- A few individuals who, seeing the opportuntiy to seek political power by raising people in their image, turned as many humans as they can (again every 20 years or so), but in a selfish way rather than the "altruistic" way of above

- Some religious vampires who weren't THOSE religious vampires and now hide their religious-ness

- Handful of vampires who were not involved in the conflict at all (e.g. just chillin' on tahiti)

This is, of course, excluding the vampire demographics that we'd know would exist that were unrelated to any of "The Catastrophe" things. You know, like the vampires who are really into communism or something.

Speaking of vampire demos, I actually looked at the world population distribution in 1700 and worked out which country most vampires would be from assuming they were distributed by population, just so if I ever need to grab one of them "at random" I can make sure it's not all white europeans because my imagination is bad. [[http://imgur.com/a/FiIzZ][Turns out 250 of the 800 survivors would be chinese]] (of course). I randomly generated a character's nationality and age and she was from Korea, and looking into Korean prehistory and mythology gave me a hell of a lot of really cool ideas for the character concept! So it was excellent.
