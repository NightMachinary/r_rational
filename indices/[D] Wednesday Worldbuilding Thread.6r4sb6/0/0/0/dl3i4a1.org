    you know, "humans are different, but I was one of them once, what was important to me then? What could be important to him now?"

  This could be a comedy goldmine, if he doesn't account for drift over time and between cultures.

Yeah, but given the particular vampire is somewhat integrated in human society, and vampire culture is continuously "refreshed" by newly turned humans, it's probably not going to be an endless source of hilarious misunderstandings either. I'd imagine vampires would be somewhat interested in human culture (if only because they depend on it not just for food but for things like e.g. getting their mansions built), so while they might not always know the specifics, they'd be no more out of touch than the average parent, if you get me.

My partner is convinced that just being alive for 1000 years would make you more rational and analytical, because you'd have time to realise it's the best way to get what you want. But I don't want My Vampires to be rationalists, so I'm not sticking to that. But it's something he /does not like/ about My Vampires.

  If you can find some articles or interviews that give insight into how [really old people] categorize things then that might be helpful

That's an absolutely fantastic idea. I can't believe I didn't think of "interviews with a centenarian" as a proxy for "vampire perspective on time". Thank you for the recommendation! I will get on that.

Very true. I'm sure an old vampire would have moments of both throughout their long history.

#+begin_quote
  Also, how do your vampires deal with the shift in morality over time and across cultures?
#+end_quote

That's a tricky one. My first instinct was to respond with "they are a post gender post racial society who instead focuses on age differences which are an absolute proxy for power, and of course humans are only worth anything insomuch as they are considered property of the vampire who 'owns' them", but then I'm conveniently /basically/ giving vampire society Values Of My Ideal Society Probably, which seems like a hell of a cop-out. Like, they're beyond racism and sexism but they are still OK with killing humans? Society today is getting to be beyond racism and sexism and at the same time getting to be beyond killing animals for food, and the vampire-human gap is smaller (especially for young vampires) than the animal-human gap.

The thing is, I don't want vampires to be racist or sexist, so I guess I need to pull vampires further ahead of "modern" (1940s) society, or give them a weirdtopia thing (which I can't even begin to think of any candidates for, beyond perhaps thinking of religious iconography as "unclean"; they already have a superstition against touching money; but none of those are weirdtopia because it needs to be something that is proper weird or seems wrong/gross rather than "isn't this interesting")

  On the other hand, someone whose values have been left behind will likely be infuriated by that

I've recently written an interlude where Catholic!Vampire!William visits a catholic priest, does a confession, and after getting the divine forgiveness (which is an extremely long-standing part of catholic dogma it turns out), he kills the priest because he's a heretic anyway, but he's the least heretical of the many heretics who are out there practising their unrecognisable religions.

Maybe this is just my vision of William, but I view him as being amused/interested/entertained by all the various changes in human culture, fashion, and values. I've got a plot bunny where he goes to a gay nightclub in the 80s and sees a guy wearing a mesh shirt and is like "oh my god! This is amazing! who thought this idea up? I love it."

  [moral advances etc in general]
#+end_quote

I'm not sure how much of my draft you read, but the central conflict in the human-vampire relationship ends up being about slavery and their different impressions of that, and I think it's pretty weak at the moment because I have to make it a "genuine miscommunication that gets worked out", whilst at the same time having a 1500 year old vampire decide that slavery is wrong, and I'm just kind of uncomfortable about the whole thing, especially because I'm not even American let alone African-American so I'm not sure how well I've handled the topic /at all/.

So in the end the vampire objects not to slavery itself but to enslaving equals for no fault of their own (rather than enslaving lessers - eg vampire enslaving human - or enslaving war losers). I read an old SSC post where Scott is talking about how American Slavery was kind of an aberration as far as slavery goes, and many slaves in antiquity were able to save money to ultimately buy their freedom, so I might do some more research into all that sort of thing and see if that ticks some more boxes.

But then I don't want to have the vampire say, "slavery isn't wrong, but it's wrong if you don't allow someone to buy their freedom back after working for you for 7 years and also if they didn't do anything to deserve it" - because that's kind of a reprehensible thing to say, and I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with a character in a story I put out there saying those things.

So it's tricky, especially because slavery seems like the best point of conflict as it came out organically as a conflict point between the two characters when me and my coauthor were planning the story via roleplay. So I really don't want to have us pick something else (which may be difficult).

  It's one thing to complain about the younger generations and another to see that younger generation then complain about the next one, for five or ten iterations on, but see everything move along all the same.

And we end back up at jaded old vampires getting bored with life! I guess it's a trope for a reason, eh?
