  I'm not sure how much of my draft you read
#+end_quote

About fifty-percent. And I'm finally getting things in order now that I'm out of the Hell University of Idaho, so I should be able to do another read-through by the end of the week.

  And we end back up at jaded old vampires getting bored with life!

I wasn't meaning that they'd be bored with life, just less fundamentalist about things because they've seen so many changes. Like, it's hard to argue that gay people are destroying society when you have three hundred years' experience of seeing people make the same argument about other groups to no effect.

As for being post-racial, I can't imagine that the older vampires would even identify in racial terms that we'd recognize and it would be hard for them to take our conceptions of race very seriously. "Look, don't try to talk to me about how white people are better than everyone or race-mixing is bad or multicultural centers are hellholes, I remember when the Irish and the Italians weren't white, etc. etc."

You might also want to look at different strains of anarchism. I don't think that's quite where you're going with vampire society, but their society is loose enough that you might find some interesting ideas to play around with so far as professed virtues go.
