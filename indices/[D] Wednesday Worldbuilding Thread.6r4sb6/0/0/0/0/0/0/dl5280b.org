Maybe you could still use it if you made it completely optional. Vampires don't have to change their face if they don't want to and the main character never did, which isn't uncommon. It's just that most of the older vampires have at some point, due to either necessity of the time period or eventual dissatisfaction with their appearance, so they're big on encouraging others to look beyond the labels humans give each other.

Nobody wants to get caught disrespecting their elders, since ratting out such behavior will curry favor, and multi-millennia of experience tends to make their punishments more....creative. For all we know, vampires could be as old as the Stone Age or even predate modern humans, so the oldest would've needed to change faces as humans changed. Some may even remember when they were beasts who gained sentience by eating humans.
