I have a weird and probably out of place idea for how to make vampires post-gender post-racial, give them some limited form of shapeshifting. It can be like regeneration in Doctor Who where every once in a while their whole body changes, though they might have some more control over it. I like the idea of it being influenced by "you are what you eat" as a way for their species to blend into their surroundings.

So when a vampire moves to a new location and feeds on the locals, they'll eventually change to more resemble them and have to take on a new identity in their society. After spending multiple lifetimes as different ethnicities and genders, it's harder to rationalize prejudice. The older, more worldly vampires would discourage such behavior from the younger ones and encourage them to experiment.
