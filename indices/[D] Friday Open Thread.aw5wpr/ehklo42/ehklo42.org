So I finally bought the latest Within Temptation album, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7sOZ_TFUXg&list=PLBzBwYhHpqLL54JjxLKjr3R1LK5IjvY5q][Resist]]. Originally I'd been mainly interested in the opener, The Reckoning, and Raise Your Banner. Despite their Electro-leaning sounds, they delivered on what I like Within Temptation for: Awesome lyrics that paint a scene in my head.\\
The rest of the album was nice, too, even if I generally preferred their stuff from Silent Force.

However, now that I've listened to the whole album a few times, there's one song that really stands out: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JHgGD8p91M&list=PLBzBwYhHpqLL54JjxLKjr3R1LK5IjvY5q&index=7][Firelight]]. This one is /so different/ from what I've come to expect from Within Temptation. I wouldn't even call it Symphonic Metal. To be frank, I have /no ide/ what I would call it. Which is a pity, because I really like it, and wish I could find more like that.

Do you guys have any recommendations?
