I've gone looking for comments. Googling ["eaturbrainz" site:[[http://www.reddit.com][www.reddit.com]]] returns 8 pages of results, and I only looked at the first page and a half, but most of the comments I saw that can definitely be determined to have been posted by him are intact.

These comments:

Those comments were, in the order I listed, made on 9/25/13, 11/6/17, 10/19/17, 5/15/17, and 9/26/16.

Those comments were, in the order I listed, /deleted/ at (using GMT+2 since [[/u/eaturbrainz][u/eaturbrainz]] apparently lived in Israel) at 11:43pm, 12:15am, 12:25am, 1:25am, and 1:37am, all right at the border between December 31st 2018 and January 1st 2019.

So, on the night of New Years Eve, he purposefully overwrote some of his comments so they would say "[deleted]" and not be findable after his profile was deleted. (If you delete a comment before you delete your account, the comment will no longer show up on reddit, but the most recent version of it is still archived on reddit's servers so you have to edit it and overwrite what they've stored if you want it truly /gone/ gone.)

Thing is, I pretty much know what all of those overwritten comments say, and anyone else can know as well if they go looking, because those comments (at least the ones I saw) are either listed in the [[/r/slatestarcodex]] Registry of Bans or received a response which

#+begin_quote
  quoted the comment like this
#+end_quote

or sometimes both, so there wasn't really a point in overwriting those comments because they wouldn't be seen unless someone went looking for them but if someone went looking for them then overwriting them wouldn't prevent the searcher from finding them.

What I've been able to find is likely just leftovers that were searchable because of someone having pinged him during a discussion or by having been documented on SSC's ban registry. Still. [[/u/ToaKraka]]'s link contains a link to [[/u/eaturbrainz][u/eaturbrainz]]'s last (as far as I can tell) conversation on reddit, and it takes place on December 31st 2018 (EDIT: Looks like it takes place on the 29th, not the 31st).

Idk. Where he went and what he's doing are still unknown. What's known is that he participated in a conversation/debate/thing - very tame relative to other arguments/debates/conversations he's participated in, judging by the leftover comments I saw - and then took a break from reddit for a couple of days, then started overwriting his old comments to make them unfindable before giving up on that endeavor and just deleting his profile outright.

Maybe he got tired of the specific types of arguments he had been having for years in the specific set of communities he frequented, and decided as a New Years Resolution to give up on that activity, then started trying to clean up his comment history so he could interact in a different way in a different set of communities without people going through his old comments, then realized his username was inescapably connected to his old comments and decided that his username was unsalvageable and that it would be easier to delete his profile and start over from scratch.
