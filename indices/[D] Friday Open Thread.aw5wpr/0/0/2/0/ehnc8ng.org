  There are programs to mass overwrite your comments

Well, [[/u/RMcD94]], as far as I'm aware, those programs have limits, and he was on reddit for /years/ and made /thousands upon thousands/ of comments. Even if there be workarounds, people still pinged [[/u/eaturbrainz]] the way I did to you in the last sentence.

Every time somebody did that during a conversation they were having with him, that conversation became findable by simply googling his username, and it would be pretty easy to figure out what he was arguing for/against and how he was doing it, because he was pretty incendiary so people reacted strongly to him, often directly quoting his most particularly incendiary statements to call extra attention to those parts in particular.

Even if those programs were able to overwrite comments that have been archived by reddit scrapers, which I don't think is physically possible, if he were to continue using the [[/u/eaturbrainz]] username after scrubbing every scrap of his activity off of reddit and someone googled his username they would still be able to see his most controversial comments.
