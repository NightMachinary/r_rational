As no-one else has replied: I did this for a while, albeit over twenty years ago, so don't know how much of my experience is relevant. Start off by registering with translation companies in your area - they keep lists of people they can farm work out to, and will generally want you to do a short trial piece. Also register with law enforcement and courts, who similarly keep lists and will need people on short notice. Build your network from there, taking care to avoid breaching noncompete clauses in your contracts. The one issue with this approach is refusing work, or not getting it done on time, gets you moved to the bottom of the lists, so you can't really afford to do either even when already overworked and end up with periods of idleness alternating with periods of horrible crunch.
