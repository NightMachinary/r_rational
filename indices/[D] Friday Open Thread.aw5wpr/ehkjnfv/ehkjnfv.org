Hello. I wrote a thing. My writing group told me to post it here already, but I feel like I can still revise a few awkward sentences on it. Can I bother you guys to check it out? It's only about 2000 words.

If the writing is bad, half of it's because it's my first time writing fiction and the other half is that English is my second language. [[https://gaiuscoffee.gitbook.io/athenaeum-of-arcane-anomalies/read/book-1/chapter-1]]

Constructive criticism would be great.
