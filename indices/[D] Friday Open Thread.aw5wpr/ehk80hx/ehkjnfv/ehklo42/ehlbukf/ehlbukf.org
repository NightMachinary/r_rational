My personal life overshare thread GO:

1. Turns out I am still doing my fatal crash investigation job until I go on my sabattical, yay! Which is good because I was not looking forward to going to work for Evil Boss again and only for three months which is super disruptive for a project management gig I reckon

2. Corporate restructure is happening, my team is moving to another part of the org. My Evil Boss is coming with us, but my Awesome Grandboss isn't, so I'm scared. Optimistically hoping that New Grandboss will try and force Evil Boss to be competent. Also, the new area will hopefully let me diversify my skill set, which would be excellent.

3. As previously mentioned I'm going to be in Sydney ~21-23rd March with nothing to do, if anyone wants to grab a coffee
