Nice start.

My biggest nitpick would be - consider deciding whether you are writing in past tense or present tense, and sticking to it.

The room they were in *was* (...) *It's* shaped like (...) The entire area *is* (...) long flat wooden timbers /lined/ the floor. (...) Pierce *was standing* along with (...) All three *wore* (...) *it is said to be* the unofficial Athenaeum uniform. (...) graduate student *is also trying* to use (...)

etc etc - flipping tenses every other sentence kept jolting me out of the story.
