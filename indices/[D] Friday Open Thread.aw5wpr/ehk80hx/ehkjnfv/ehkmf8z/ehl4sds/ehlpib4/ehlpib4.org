Yeah, I heard the bracket problem with my writing group as well. It actually started with [[Classes]] and [Skills]. I'll think about capitalizing the Classes and leaving the brackets on skills only.

Regarding 2), I had a choice of doing an info dump for a first chapter, and that would've solved the problem. A zoomed out view of the world, showing events that give context.

However, I decided against it. I'll try to do some epistolary stuff instead, with excerpts from in-world books (Encyclopae Arcana & Anomalous Maleficarum, available on site's sidebar) for context. Just like Brandon Sanderson's Ars Arcana.

I'm going to flesh the world out more on the next chapter, including the why's of the Athenaeum. To be honest, I want those questions to act as a hook for the more curious readers, while giving others a couple of fight scenes immediately :)
