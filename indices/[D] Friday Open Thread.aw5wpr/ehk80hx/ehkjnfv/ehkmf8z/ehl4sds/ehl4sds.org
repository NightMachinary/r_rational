There were two main problems for me.

1) [square brackets].

So when the first [light] appeared I liked it, as it very elegantly communicated there was something magical about the light, but as the chapter went along I found my self dislikeing the way square square brackets were used. For me, a square bracket slightly breaks up the flow of the story. This is useful to signify something special but when used to commonly I found it just made some paragraphs hard to read.

I don't know how I would fix this apart from using bold or some other, slightly less intrusive, visually different text.

The fact that square brackets are used for both [classes] and [skills] also added to the confusion. Take this extract for example:

#+begin_quote
  The [Sergeant] and the remaining two [Seekers] drew longswords, enchanted with [Reach] and [Sharpness]. The [Sergeant] used his command skills, but it only affected his squad. All nine of them felt the [Standard-bearer's] auras when he held his tower shield up.
#+end_quote

We have classes and skills being called right next to each other and no easy visual way to tell which is which.

I would personally recommend only using visually different names for the [skills] and just useing capitals for the Classes.

2)I am a little confused.

Now this could just be me being an idiot but I felt like there was a lot of stuff I just didn't quite get. Lile I know Emerys is part of an organization called the Athenaeum but what is the Athenaeum. Is it a school? An independent magic run State? Why are they sending Emerys to fight a monster instead of someone more qualified? Why is Emerys haveing all those powers at a young age impressive? What do the characters actually do as members of the Athenaeum, apart from randomly fighting monsters? Most importantly why are the characters, risking their lives, fighting the monsters?

They say the moster can wipe out a party of adventurous but there is no explanation of how strong a party of adventurers is so I don't know how impressive that is.

I just kind of feel as a lot of context to what is going on that I'm missing.

Having someone introduce and explain stuff towards the beginning would ofeen helpful.

The main thing I liked the emphasis on classes and skills over higher numbers. The number creep is something I feel ruins a lot of lit RPGs.
