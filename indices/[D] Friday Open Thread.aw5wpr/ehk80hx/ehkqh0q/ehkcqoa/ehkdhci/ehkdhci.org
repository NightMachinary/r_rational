When you delete your account, all of your comments remain, the username is just changed to [deleted]. If you want to wipe out your entire Reddit history you have to do a script to manually delete all of the comments prior to account deletion. So thankfully in this case a whole bunch of Reddit threads haven't been decimated and made unreadable.
