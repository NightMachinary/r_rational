If you're going for technical translation, be aware that translation companies that are large and/or based in Russia can and will rip you off. As in pay you about a quarter of what you could've earned had you spoken directly with their client or (more frequently) with a smaller international company. Unfortunately, most big tech companies who care enough about Russian customers to maintain a permanent presence there are more likely to deal only with big translation companies, so it is kind of a balancing act, I hear.

As for a starting point... try ProZ, I guess?
