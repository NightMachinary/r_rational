I'm fluent in English and Russian, and I'm interested in doing freelance translation. If anyone here has any experience with this kind of job in particular, or with freelance at all, I'd appreciate advice on some general topics. Such as:

How do I start? What platforms should I use? What beginner mistakes should I look out for? How should/shouldn't I negotiate with clients?

(And yes, I'm aware that the entire translation market is likely going to be decimated within a decade by advanced AIs. Doesn't mean I can't leverage this skill while it's still relevant.)
