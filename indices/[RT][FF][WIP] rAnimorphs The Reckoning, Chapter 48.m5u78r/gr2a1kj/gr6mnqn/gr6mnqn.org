Man I've been following this fic since around chapter 15 and it's consistently been one of my favorite pieces of writing. Props for taking a huge part of my childhood and making this beautiful creation out of it.

Also a bit of speculation- I was doing some thinking about where the heck a Varnax (the yeerk-eaters, not the abstract concept) comes from. It seems like it occupies a very strange niche, being an apex predator which is hyperspecialized to pull yeerks out of their hosts. This seems like a really strange place to end up in via natural selection; extracting the yeerk is a whole unnecessary process vs just eating whatever you're wrapped around. And if yeerkflesh is such a desirable meal to the average predator you'd think the main bodies would have more specialized predators than the shards. But there is one species for which yeerk shards have unique nutritional value: other yeerks.

So my headcanon origin story of the Varnax: in the old wars on the Yeerk homeworld there were coalitions torn apart and dragged out of their pools. This is normally lethal, but out of millions of scattered shards of yeerkflesh there are a rare few whose natural aptitude for self-modification lets them force biological changes to survive both open air and separation from their main body. (The purple color is a side effect of this; the modified flesh reflects more energetic light wavelengths to prevent dessication, kinda the reverse of the green chlorophyll in plants)

It's a clumsy process and they lose a lot of the brainpower in the process, but what's left is an amorphous predator, insane both from being torn apart and from needing to repurpose too many vital parts of the brain in the subsequent metamorphosis. The change in color and consistency (I'm picturing something like a purple amoeba that can extrude appendages as needed) leaves them unrecognizable. Most of their body is repurposed for long-term Kandrona storage and out-of-water movement. They can no longer dwell in water, having undergone an irreversible adaptation to surviving out if it. But they still need some Kandrona intake, and the shattered remains of their Yeerkish instincts are screaming at them to expand. So hunting Yeerks isn't just a matter of nutrition for a Varnax; it's a twisted reflection of the sharing between pools, a desperate attempt to sate the trauma of forceful separation and isolation.

This crystalized in my head after reading Elfangor's speech in the last chapter, and I think there's a certain poetry to it especially wrt the Visser's allegorical Varnax; the tendency of conflict to lead to terrible repercussions down the line, and the dangers of crossing lines (physically destroying vs absorbing rival coalitions) even if it wins the war.
