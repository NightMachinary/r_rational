Oh hey I'm early for a new chapter!

You know what just occurred to me...where is Marco's mom amidst this whole mess? Does she know Peter's alive? I'd like to see her show up if they go pick up Cassie's parents at the Mars base...someone who has some idea of the horrors they've have gone through.

I had a showerthought yesterday, that this series really veers off the Ax-Tobias friendship in canon which I was a bit sad about. But then I realized r!Tobias has Garrett, and in some ways Garrett's kind of like canon Ax if he went human nothlit isn't he? Garrett's senses are sometimes overwhelming like taste for canon Ax, he's trying to navigate the social rules of humanity, quirky sense of humor etc.

Oh yeah, one question for you [[/u/TK17Studios]], what's with the Hork Bajir being so in-the-background? Not to be taken as an accusation, but more curiosity...I found it interesting that Han Pritcher is mentioned as an unwilling slave to V3, but not Hyruk's HB host, as a comparison.
