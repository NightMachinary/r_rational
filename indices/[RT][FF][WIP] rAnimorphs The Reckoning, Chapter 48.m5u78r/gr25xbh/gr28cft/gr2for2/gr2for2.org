If the goal was to demonstrate human-centric bias then I definitely noticed something was up, yeah. That's a big change in r!Tobias vs canon Tobias - canon Tobias was the alien ambassador of the team (shorm to Ax, namesake to Toby, somewhat favored by the Ellimist), and I think that's a role that never got assigned to anyone in the r!Animorphs team. Well, I suppose we could say it was an intentional move by the gods? A bit late for it now since Hyruk is definitely dead, but when that HB controller showed up I wondered if it was a seer or Toby. I bet a coalescion without access to human hosts would treat a seer HB as TOP PRIORITY HOST.

Edit: Actually I'll amend that a little - r!Tobias is on board a Pemalite ship doing some reprogramming right now with Maninho in his head. Alien ambassador role still there, but not as big.
