No idea what will happen now. I even [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/lzmmvm/ffrtwip_ranimorphs_the_reckoning_chapter_47/gq50rx2/][thought that]] this would be the least likely thing to happen next. A silly notion, in retrospect, to presume that the AI wouldn't be unchained in an r! fic.

Literally no idea what will happen, now. The only sure thing ("the piece on the chess board that doesn't move", as Duncan Idaho says) is that the team will have to make big decisions in furtherance of The Game.

It was annoying to see (what I thought was) Tobias' thoughts being edited in real time, when it looked like he wanted to quit playing the game. If the players will intervene to that level to preserve the game, my earlier solution (everyone just quit playing) is not going to happen.

Thank you TK for another great chapter
