  It was annoying to see (what I thought was) Tobias' thoughts being edited in real time, when it looked like he wanted to quit playing the game. If the players will intervene to that level to preserve the game, my earlier solution (everyone just quit playing) is not going to happen.

FWIW, while I intend to leave some things open to interpretation, my /personal/ headcanon-as-author is that the gods are intervening /way/ less frequently than the characters think. It's just that once you suspect there's godly intervention, you start to see it everywhere, even in the twists and turns of your own thoughts/even in things that you otherwise would not have considered particularly big coincidences.
