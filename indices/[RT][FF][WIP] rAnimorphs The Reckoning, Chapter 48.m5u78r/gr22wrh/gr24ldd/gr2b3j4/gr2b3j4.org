We've been treating the memory episodes as the aberration, and assuming that Rachel is basically fit but is incapacitated with increasing frequency. Your comment here suggests that Rachel is actually insensate by default, but gets roused to action / imbued with agency when necessary for one of the Players. This need seems to be less and less frequent.

I'm not sure which version is more depressing.
