The individual Chee aren't speaking.

Each Chee is making a fraction of a sound, not even an entire phoneme/letter.

There are 36 of them, which is enough for them to reboot, reconnect with the network, download the context of the conversation, and produce the next fraction of a sound when it's their turn before the censor catches up to them and wipes them again.

So between the 36 Chee there's a single "voice" that's sweeping around the circle multiple times a second. All 36 of them repeatedly being wiped and rebooted, cooperating to form a single voice.
