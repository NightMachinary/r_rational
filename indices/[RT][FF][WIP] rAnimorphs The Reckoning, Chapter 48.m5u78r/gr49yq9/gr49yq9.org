  WE CAN KILL THE HOWLERS.  WE WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO KILL THE HOWLERS.  PLEASE.

How does this fit together with that?

#+begin_quote
  “There's a censor that wipes any Chee that thinks a---a wrong thought,”

  A refresh cycle that wipes them every half-second anyway. 
#+end_quote

Saying that sentence alone takes longer than a half-second.\\
Not to mention, that the "set us free"-ask was premeditated. The time it took for Tobias to consider even letting all 36 holograms show up.....\\
But half-a-second is just an upper bound till the wipe happens.\\
The censor would wipe them before?\\
Also what does it even mean that a "Chee is wiped"?\\
Or "if they get stuck somewhere".\\
The Chee can hold a coversation, that is longer than 0.5 seconds.\\
Was that all on nonviolence autopilot?
