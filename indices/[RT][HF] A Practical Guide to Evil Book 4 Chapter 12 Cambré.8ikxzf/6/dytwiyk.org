Goblins /probably/ don't have an actual demon down there to squeeze the ingredients out of, so they probably farm some kind of affected matter. Do you think they'd be able to make something out of an angel's corpse in Liesse? Masego did manage to reproduce its properties for the Ivory Globe, so it's not as potentially harmful to magic, at least.
