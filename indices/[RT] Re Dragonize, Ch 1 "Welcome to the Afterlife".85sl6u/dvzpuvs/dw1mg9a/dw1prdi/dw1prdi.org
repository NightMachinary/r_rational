Essentially the Pursuit of Knowledge is trying to obtain the truth in raw, factual form. Reading encyclopedias, memorizing textbooks, etc.. that is what the pursuit of knowledge is.

Your math formula example is spot on. The pursuit of understanding is trying to derive the reasons for why things are the way they are.

The difference between the two would be that a politician pursuing knowledge would want to know how the people are going to vote, and a politician pursuing understanding would want to know why people vote the way they do.
