  Is it the difference of knowing a math formula and knowing why it is the way it is?

That's probably what was meant. It sounds a bit like the dichotomy of intelligence versus wisdom. [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/rwby-the-gamer-the-games-we-play.306381/][The Games We Play]] (a RWBY/The Gamer crossover) starts with a conversation on the topic that I think is really good:

  “Well...If I was to differentiate between Intelligence and Wisdom, I'd say that the former was power and the latter the awareness of how to use that power. I'd say that Wisdom was the ability to make good choices and Intelligence a way to give you more choices. If you're smart and have a thousand ideas, wisdom would tell you which was the best choice to make and what the long term effects would be.”
