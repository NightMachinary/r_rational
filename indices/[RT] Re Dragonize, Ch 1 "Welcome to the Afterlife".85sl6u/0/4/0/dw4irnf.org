Royal Road Legends, aka Royal Road, aka RRL, or however you want to call it, is an original fiction website (there may be loose references, but I don't recall any fanfiction).

This website has it's origins from fan translations of Legendary Moonlight Sculptor [KR], where it gets it's name, Royal Road, which is the name of the VRMMORPG in that novel. People got inspired by LMS to write similar stuff, which turned into most authors creating their own worlds. This got to the point where RRL was about original fictions more than hosting translated chapters of LMS.

Nowadays the website is basically an amateur (quality varies greatly) writer website for Eastern and game themes. I feel that RRL is more tailored for both the author and reader.

For logged in readers, you have internal bookmarking for chapters, "cover art" is prominently displayed, there are reviews, a comment thread for every chapter. For authors, I don't really know what they get, but they do have a standard way to plug their patreon, some authors use this platform to sell their Amazon book, and there are some random achievement things they could get.
