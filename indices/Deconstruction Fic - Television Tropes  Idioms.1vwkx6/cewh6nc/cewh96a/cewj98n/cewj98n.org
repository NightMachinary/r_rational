I've read some of them already. Taking Sights by Lavanya Six is a quite good Evangelion fic, though it probably won't be finished.

Unforeseen Consequences is a Zero No Tsukaima fic that's on the list but not mentioned by name - Louise summons Kyubey from Madoka Magica instead of Saito as her familiar and once she contracts and people find out that she's technically a zombie, she ends up running from an inquisition. It's quite good, but the main characters make some stupid decisions, though they do pretty well for naive, sheltered teenagers.

Shinji and Warhammer 40K jumped the shark multiple times and can't be considered rational at all, but is entertaining.

Stupid Devil Dog is a Zero no Tsukaima fic that suffers from Marty Stu.

Another similar Zero no Tsukaima fic that's not on the list but that I think is both good and fits the requirements for rational fiction is Emperor of Zero. Louise summons Napoleon, which makes the conflicts of the story more militarily and politically focused since Napoleon intends to rule the continent.
