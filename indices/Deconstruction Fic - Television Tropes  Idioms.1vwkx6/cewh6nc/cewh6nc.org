I have mixed opinions on this kind of fic. They often resort to just bashing the canon while not doing nearly as good a job as canon in terms of plot, characters, etc. and adding additional problems such as Marty Stus. When done well, they can be great, but that's not common. Granted, the fics on that page are better than the average fic due to tvtroper screening, but even then not all of them are great.
