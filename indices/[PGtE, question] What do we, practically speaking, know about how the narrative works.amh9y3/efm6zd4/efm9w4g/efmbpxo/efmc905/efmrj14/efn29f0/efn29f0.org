It was a Heroic Interlude right before the battle, when Bard tells him to challenge Catherine to single combat because she isn't a good with it as battle. Unfortunately, she didn't tell him to wear his helmet.

  “Single combat.”

  Everybody turned to look at the Wandering Bard, who'd somehow managed to shake herself out of her drunken stupor.

  “Welcome back,” the Swordsman greeted her. “Are you finally done drinking? That'd be a first.”

  “That's her weakness,” the heroine elaborated, ignoring him after an amused look. “Squire is a transitional Name, it can't match the kind of raw power a fully realized hero can throw around. Get her in a one-on-one fight and you should be able to kill her.”

  “I'll keep that in mind,” the Prince replied thoughtfully.
