Well, we know that it's /possible/ to die like that - the previous Black Knight got swarmed, and some of the crusading heroes died both at the Camps and in Vales. You're probably right in the sense that dying to a normie requires screwing up first - if the hero's advance leads into another scene, the soldiers will get the same treatment as caltrops and an inconvenient slope.

Despite that, I don't think that a Chosen's story requires another Named to run into a dead end or just lose momentum - we know that trials /technically/ aren't a guaranteed success. They are about a choice, or a test, and we've seen how cheating typically ends. Technically, if there's no narrative checkpoint ahead, a random battle shouldn't have a predetermined outcome either. Where the Named come in useful is that having another perspective adds another potential outcome - at least that's how Cat treats the tug-of-plot. The having a nemesis just means that there's a confirmed point in the future the plot is progressing towards.

As for the pattern of three fights - it had no actual significance for Catherine and so had so little impact on her (Chider's "success" literally negated all that was accomplished during the previous steps) that she /didn't notice it/.
