From the prologue we have this quote -

#+begin_quote
  Through the passing of the years grooves appeared in the workings of Fate, patterns repeated until they came into existence easier than not, and those grooves came to be called Roles. The Gods gifted these Roles with Names, and with those came power.

That's the basic concept that PGtE narrative runs on. The known PGtE timeline has written history for some 500-1000 years before the events of the story. Throughout these years, there have been so many repeating patterns that /we/ identify as tropes occurring in Creation.

Secondly we have the gods as both audience and player. Kinda like a DND player. However they are obviously biased towards their own favourite side, hence Creation has meta rules in place to keep the balance between them. For every Good side intervention, the evil wizard gets a powerful boost. For every evil victory, there is some hero that comes perfectly equipped to murder them. For every long term evil victory, the Good side sort of builds up narrative "power" that can be deployed in the form of Crusades. It's all balanced.

God's almost never directly intervene, only through Angels, incarnations, or some other middleman. I suspect this is because if they got directly involved, they would be considered as "players" and hence the laws of Creation would apply to them as well.

The majority of the time, existing stories will have more chance of repetition. Genre-savvy characters like Catherine can tie events in her life to existing stories, binding people, places and herself to whatever outcome that story has.

However, there is some chance of a "new" role occurring, as with the case of Hakram. He's the first orc in centuries to get a Role (as Catherine's right hand), and as such, the gods-as-audience find him interesting and give him a power boost in the form of his Name, Adjutant.

New stories on the other hand, are much scarcer. Because Creation has quite a decent chunk of written/oral history, there is a high chance that any given story has already occurred in the past and people just don't know it.

In this context, Catherine has so, so many "firsts". From what we know, she's the first ever Squire that didn't transition into a "Knight" Name (her Role was the Evil Queen of Callow, but the Name transition was interrupted by Black). She's the first ever Fae ruler in Creation, and now she is First Under the Night. She's an outlier that doesn't take power from the existing gods, becomes a God herself, and then abandons that mantle in favour of mortality, acquiring power from a newly apotheosised pair of goddesses.

The gods-as-players, hate her because she's ruining their game, but the gods-as-audience are throwing trial after trial onto her because she's so /interesting/ and they want to see what she will do in different situations.

Her /Story/ could, maybe, perhaps, be completely unprecedented in the history of Creation, which is why we're reading it.
