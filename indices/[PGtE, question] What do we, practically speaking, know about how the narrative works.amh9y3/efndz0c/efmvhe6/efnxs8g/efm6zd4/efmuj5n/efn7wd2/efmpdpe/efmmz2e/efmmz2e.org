So, your point about sequences of events is accurate to a point. It works perfect In Arcadia, like when cat forced the invading fae to monologue by doing the typical heroic "how could you do this?" Thing. The fae are all generic plot characters moving through the motions till mortals, Angel's, or even hellspawn disrupt them.

But there is the element of free will in it as well. They may mostly go for the tropes we know of, but they dont have to as they are people.

Also just as a possible example other could use to disprove this entire post, the crusade could be said to be a heroic powerup, and yet cat wipes the floor with it while black forces closed their only other way into callow and then invading procer himself. This could also be due to it not being started as a real crusade, but my point still stands.
