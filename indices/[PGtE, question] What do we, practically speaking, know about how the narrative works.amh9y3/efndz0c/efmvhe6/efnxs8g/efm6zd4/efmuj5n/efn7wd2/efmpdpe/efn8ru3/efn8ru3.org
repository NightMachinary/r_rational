It's been explicitly stated in-universe that "heroic stories" aren't necessarily tied to Heroic Names. Catherine gets their benefit when she acts in a way that the narrative reads as "heroic", and she's the protagonist because she manages to do that. Tariq and Laurence discuss it in Kaleidoscope, and it's explicitly what she pulled at First Liesse.
