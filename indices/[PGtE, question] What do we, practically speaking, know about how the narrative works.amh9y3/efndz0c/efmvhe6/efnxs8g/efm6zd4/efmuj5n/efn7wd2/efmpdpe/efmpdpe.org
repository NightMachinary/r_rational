  What do we, practically speaking, know about how the narrative works?

We know it works however the author wants it to work. In practical terms, annals of writing have so many different tropes that you could justify practically any outcome by saying "narrative made it happen". Hero gets shot in the throat by a mook? Well, he got careless and was punished for his hubris. Hero /doesn't/ get shot in the throat even though he is fighting alone against a small army? Well, he is doing a heroic last stand, clearly he can't actually /die/ there, that'd be ridiculous. Hero gets shot in the throat, but then recovers immediately instead of dying on the spot? Well, clearly it was just a flesh wound, and everyone knows heroes only die in one on one sword duels with the villain anyways.

PGTE seems to be simultaneously trying to juggle three different concepts. First, it's trying to make "mundane" things like logistics, numbers of forces, exhaustion and such play a major role in conflicts (Black's strategy in regards to the legions is founded on this), which is a good thing IMO. Second, while doing that, it's also trying to keep various almost shonen-tropes going (like certain characters being able to throw mountains around and such), as well as its narrative magic. And third, it's trying to make it all work in the shape of a classic fantasy story about an underdog set against the world. And in my opinion, it loses track of some of the balls and drops them on its head from time to time. The biggest trouble comes from the contradiction of needing the classic tropes of winning 80% of fights to apply to catherine-the-main-character while also stating in-world that villains lose 80% of their fights due to universe fiat. Multiple commenters get so confused by this they start to insist Catherine is either outright a Hero, is transitioning into a Heroic name, or is somehow not a Hero while still getting all the properties of one.
