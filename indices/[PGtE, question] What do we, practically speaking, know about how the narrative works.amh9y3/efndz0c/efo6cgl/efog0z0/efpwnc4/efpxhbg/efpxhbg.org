Liesse is probably the best instance of her "losing" that we're going to get. And even in that case, what did it actually change, as far as overarching plot goes? Not much, it seems to me. All it amounted to is Catherine angsting a bit and setting out to try and hammer out a lasting peace so Callow wouldn't get constantly trampled in future (which she would have done regardless). The consequences weren't shown to be much of a setback for her plans. We're /told/ it's a loss, and it superficially looks like one, but it has about as much impact on how events develop as someone killing her favourite puppy would have.
