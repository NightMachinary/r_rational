Yeah, perfect example. In-world "protagonist" doesn't make any sense, since it inherently relies on what the book decides to show us, and webnovel PGTE is in no way a subset of a hypothetical universe of PGTE, meaning it can't affect it. But people will try to claim cat has that role to justify blatant plot errors, like cat not immediately dying whenever she does a plucky hero stunt despite being a villain. She got burned doing that /once/, when she fought the demon and got her limp, but ever since it seems like it doesn't matter.
