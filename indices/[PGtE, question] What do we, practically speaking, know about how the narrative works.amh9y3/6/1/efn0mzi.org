  The biggest trouble comes from the contradiction of needing the classic tropes of winning 80% of fights to apply to catherine-the-main-character while also stating in-world that villains lose 80% of their fights due to universe fiat. Multiple commenters get so confused by this they start to insist Catherine is either outright a Hero, is transitioning into a Heroic name, or is somehow not a Hero while still getting all the properties of one.

The best resolution to this I see is to consider that Catherine's Role is Protagonist. While that's /traditionally/ a Heroic Role, it's not actually, technically, required to be. It can just only really come up during a weird phase like Callow's "transitioning to Evil after a generation of competent dominion".
