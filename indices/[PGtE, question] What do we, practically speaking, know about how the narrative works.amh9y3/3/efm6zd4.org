  Villains like Heiress think of power as something they can rain down on their enemies, but that's a false perception. She could set an entire field aflame and still die from an arrow in the throat.

But that's not true, is it? At no point in the story did anyone seriously consider the possibility that Heiress might get killed by a random non-protagonist. In fact, she explicitly has a pattern-of-three in the second book that makes it impossible for her to be killed by anyone but Catherine.

Actually, I can't think of any Named character getting killed by a nameless mook in the entire story except as a "His hubris was his end" thing. (eg the Shining Prince gets killed on Catherine's explicit order while trying to arrange a duel with her, not by a random arrow during the ensuing melee)
