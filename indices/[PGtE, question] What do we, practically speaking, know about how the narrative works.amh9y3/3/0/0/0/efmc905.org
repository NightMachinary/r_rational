The Name you're looking for is the Exiled Prince. The Shining Prince is the Callowan royal transitional Name.

And with the Exiled Prince it's actually unclear how much of it was him being full of himself, how much was about making himself a narrative speedbump in the same manner as Warlock left the story no way to progress other than over his dead body, and how much of it was the Wandering Bard setting up a test of character / sacrificing him by giving a direct advice.
