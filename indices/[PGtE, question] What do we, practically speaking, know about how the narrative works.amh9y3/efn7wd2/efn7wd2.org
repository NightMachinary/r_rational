My impression is that the narrative is an icy bridge, Names are the old minivans with poorly maintained safety features and worn out tires, and Roles are the grooves in the snow that guide you along the same path that the previous minivan used, whether that is to stay on the road or to slide into the river or a ditch.

That's where the metaphor ends. People get their minivans by driving in the grooves and the minivans get stronger as long as the person stays in the groove.

But that's role-playing xp not a situational bonus. And there's plenty of xp drain going on to offset it.

Black's strategy has been to forge a new path, which doesn't lead to death. It's a good long term strategy, GB immortality plus consistency makes for a slow and steady rise to power, especially if he can maintain it for a few centuries to where circumstances align in ways that make the story of his continued survival repeat more often. He kinda screwed it up when he started over with different reasons because that's a new role now, and apparently one that gets him a new (and therefore weak) name.

Cat's strategy is more powerful in the short term. If her groove starts guiding her off the road she abandons her minivan and finds another. Pattern of 3 where the squire loses? Gee good thing I'm not the squire any more. Redemption story that will end up with me dead? Well I'll just find the worst villain in reach and try to negotiate an alliance. The outcome doesn't even matter, I'm clearly not on my way to redemption if he's a potential ally. Ice queen is outmatched? Ok, you're the ice queen now. (In several months:) Priestess of the night meets her end? Nah that's actually a goddess of the night and also ice queen, I'm way over there.
