  The premise of the story is that for all of recorded history Good has been winning.

Yeah, but the thing is that Black's warnings were about the heroes being dangerous if you give them an opening, about stories making standard evil behaviour inevitably lethal - which we had a full book of, to no apparent effect on the protagonist. Black's methods and understanding of the narrative are explicitly noted to be a sign of professionalism rather than something unique - yet so far none of the good guys have demonstrated the same level of it.
