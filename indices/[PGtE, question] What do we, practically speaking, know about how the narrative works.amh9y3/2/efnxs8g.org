I'm kind of confused about what you are asking. The premise of the story is that for all of recorded history Good has been winning. But just in the leadup to the story, Evil has won a few, thanks to some rationalist meta-work by Black.

​

The big tension of the story is which of these trends is 'real', and which is just an aberration? Like, for the longest time stupid Good was beating stupid Evil. Now Smart Evil has appeared and defeated Stupid Good. How will it fare against Smart Good? That's your story. Will Smart Evil win because the secret sauce is Smart + Evil, or will Smart Good win because Smart is multiplicative of power, and they started with more power to multiply?

​

As far as Cat's experiences not bearing either trend out, that's not really a surprise, right? Like, if local effort couldn't overpower either of these trends (that is, if evil pragmatists or good idealists always won), then we wouldn't get anything out of Cat's fights. She could tell the winner/loser based entirely on the alignments ahead of time.
