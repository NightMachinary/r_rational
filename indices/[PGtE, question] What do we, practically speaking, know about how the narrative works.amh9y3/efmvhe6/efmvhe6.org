Fate/Luck and Magic are the things that go super wonky around Heroes and Villains, to fit *A* story. Also, the heavens literally give extra power to heroes to push them closer to the story where they win, IF they are in a story where they win. Heaven's help with direct intervention, or slightly more subtle things like leaving artifacts around, swords landing in lucky places, gaining the exact power a hero needs to counter their villain etc.

It seems that heaven and hell can only spend their power if it pushes towards a story. William got chopped down like a punk because he wasn't in the story where he won anymore, and so it was just between him and Cat.

​

The main thing about narrative power that I think holds is that the stronger a story is, the more power and bullshit luck can be poured into heroes/villains to hold to the story. It could even be the case that any story that is ongoing *must* happen as per the story - the only way to change it is to change the story, by introducing new elements that recontextualise the existing elements. Because freewill is a thing, this happens a lot without people noticing - they just did the natural thing of training, laying a trap, that leads into another story about a villain being clever etc. But if the new story is weaker, it doesn't matter what people do that should work, if it doesn't follow how the heavens and hells think it /should/ go they will tip the scales.

​

Heroes die in droves because they are going up against the Big Bads, and become warnings to the next lot - roadbumps are mentioned, and this is what happens when too many villains or heroes bunch up. The stronger, longer term story wins out.

I would also like to point out that Akua could easily have been successful from a narrative point of view. Not for long after her rise to the tower, but still could have killed all the main characters.

Well, shes the main character in the book, she's not going to permanently die half way through. But she suffers consequences all the time and often does not get what she wants. She still doesn't have what she ultimately wants. And she is a near explicit exception to the rule of what happens to villains and how they act, that's kinda the point of the book.
