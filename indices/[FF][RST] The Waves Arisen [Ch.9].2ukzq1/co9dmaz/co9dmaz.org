Idk man, her plan doesn't even take ten minutes to do. Seems unreasonable for her to not use the Byakugan during that time. Local Omniscience! Unless she planned to kill him and wanted plausible deniability. If she at any point ever wondered when she would know if Neji forfeited, she'd then plan to use the Byakugan during the final moments. (especially because if it didn't work, she'd need to be ready to forfeit asap)

Also, Hinata totally talks through her bubble to Naruto. I guess ten bubbles is enough to obscure all sound? If she can talk through her bubble, you'd think multiple bubbles would just make the sound less coherent, not silent.
