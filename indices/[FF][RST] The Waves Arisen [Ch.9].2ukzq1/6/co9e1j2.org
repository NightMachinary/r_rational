Why didn't Neji use Kaiten (Heavenly Spin) there? In my opinion, it would destroy Kekkai really easy.

Also, looking at Neji-Kidoumaru fight, Neji could probably just slice Kekkai with his fingers.

EDIT: Also, constricting strenght of barriers stacks pretty strange. At least it's not additive, otherwise if 1 barrier could be stopped by leaning on him, 10 barriers can't constrict a human to death.
