  I've done a quick search, and there indeed seem to be imperial measures scattered throughout the text.

That also /could/ have something to do with author using them. I'd bet canon uses metric, like Japan.

The characters also speak english, and their language is weirdly just like ours even though a lot of time should have passed. Or maybe we just are the intended audience?

They also have walkie talkies and computers and everything. What techlevel would need something more advanced?
