/Some/ countries in the real world still use silly imperial measures for basic physical things (like weight, volume, distance, etc.). And ninja do not appear to have much technology to need anything more advanced.

I've done a quick search, and there indeed seem to be imperial measures scattered throughout the text. I don't remember any mentions about the metric system except "milli". Do you?
