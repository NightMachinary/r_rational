I'm not sure if they understand what "milli" means. I have a feeling they may treat "milli" (and other SI prefixes) as "holy words from the ancient time", considering mentions of game theory and algebra as ancient half-forgotten arts. So Naruto may think "milli" is a just a fancy synonym to "part of".
