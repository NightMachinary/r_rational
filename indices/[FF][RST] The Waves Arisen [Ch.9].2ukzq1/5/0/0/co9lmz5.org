Could still have stopped at the point of incapacitating injury. Killing him was a choice, and at a guess, it's about taking the caged bird off the table. To get to a point where the house either leaves her alone, or kills her. Possibly also just not wanting to leave a humiliated Neji alive - he does not seem to have been the kind of guy who would have let that slide. Ever.

Fighting at all, I think was about the bracket setup and not trusting her opponent to not develop a sudden case of deafness - she is anticipating the winner of her match will be fighting Naruto. Given the theme of the tourney, if it is her, they can probably get away with sitting down and having a game of go - Because that would be teamwork! -
