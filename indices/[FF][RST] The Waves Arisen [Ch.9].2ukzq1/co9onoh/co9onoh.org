First off: I was wrong about my prediction. I confess.

But now i have to ask, is this going a story where everyone has superpowers that make it extraordinarily easy to live a stable and well provided for, with only a bit of common sense, but in the end they don't because of plot or author decisions. So far I don't see a reason why Naruto hasn't just sent his clones to learn agriculture, woodwork and other useful self providing skills. And if Hinata is anything to go by, everyone should be able to make use of shadow clones, at least in small numbers and a small periods of time.
