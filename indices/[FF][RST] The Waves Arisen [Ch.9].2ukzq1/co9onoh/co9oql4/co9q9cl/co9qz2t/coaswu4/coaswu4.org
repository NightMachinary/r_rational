Nope. Your assumption is wrong, it's not a military camp, where everyone follows orders all the time and where there is no time to think or even a possibility for a creative idea.

1 its a commando camp, where they train kids to fight, but also train them to act on their own, to gather supplies in the wild, to build their own shelters, to make decision on their own when the mission takes an unexpected turn.

2 Glorifying personal sacrifice has nothing to do with being self sufficient and capable of providing for oneself and even thinking for oneself. Even if it were, if you were expecting a part of your zealot army to become jounin, team leaders, and even a Hokage, you would have to foster some level of creative thought.

I think there was an episode of the original series where Naruto actually uses clones to catch fish. Google gives nothing, but it's at least a step in the right direction.

And maybe a farmer life is to dishonorable, but there is no reason why Ninjas can't provide for themselves, either by catching fish, or gathering berries, or getting fallen braches for firewood, or getting water from a creek, or whatever it is you need. Hard work is hard, but when you have a power to jump over buildings, move faster than a speeding animal, kill things with pinpoint precision strikes(seriously kunai throwing in a bulls-eye is Op as hell) and do other kinds of magic, it stops being hard work and becomes easy living.

Excuses for lack of said behavior include but are not limited to: prevention by a Higher Power, lack of time to think for ideas and their execution (but somehow not lack of time for creating new techniques or training of the same), masochism, mental instability, author not thinking things trough, author purposefully not thinking things trough lest he spend too much time on making the economics and society work as it's supposed to, author madness and so on and so forth.

I might think of more things later.
