If it was me risking my life for measly pay, with even more risk to get a promotion, and knowing my classmates are dying at a regular rate, and then if i get a promotion my colleagues dying even more, and then having to walk the streets as some lowlife civilian punk gets to play drink around the rosie with all of his friends, then go home to his family, basically leading a happy life, then I can honestly say that i would be miffed at the very least, if not bitter of my career choices. This could all change, provided there are significant downsides to being a civilian.
