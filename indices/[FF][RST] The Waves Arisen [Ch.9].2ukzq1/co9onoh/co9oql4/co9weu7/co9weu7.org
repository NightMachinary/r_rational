Yhea, but their origin culture is set up to provide them with.. death. And even in victory, who wants to grow up to the kind of callous ass that in turn sends their own kids into the meat-grinder?

Uhm..

Hold a sec, where are the genin coming from? Going on the casualty rates, and the requirement for a bloodline, each ninja surviving past genin would have to have about 10-15 kids. Per ninja, so that's over 20 for a couple. Errh... I think I just spotted one way this world sucks for civilians. The only way these numbers work out is male ninja are abusing seduction techniques on a massive scale. Or alternately, people are using medic-nin techniques to have random women carry their children to term.
