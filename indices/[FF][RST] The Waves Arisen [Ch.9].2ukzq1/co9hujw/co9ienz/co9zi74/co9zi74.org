Did you do the math regarding Hinata's chakra pool and regen, the stacking effects of the shield's pressure, visibility and audibility effects, continuous chakra cost, activation cost, resistance to chakra-imbued strikes, and anything else I might have missed? It's an awesome plot event, but I'd feel better about it if you showed your work.
