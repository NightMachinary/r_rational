So... blowback. Tournament or not I can't imagine the Hyuga will take Hinata killing Neji lightly, especially seeing as how she's now technically not a Hyuga herself at all. I mean it might be unseemly for them to seek to revenge themselves against another Leaf ninja, and somewhat undignified to do so over the death of a Branch family member, but no more unseemly than Hinata killing another Leaf ninja in the tournament to begin with.

I suppose, however, that this might be causing some within the Hyuga to rethink the dismissal of Hinata as heir to the clan, able to beat their shining star Neji so simply, and showing the ruthlessness that she was believed to be lacking previously. I'm sure Hiashi has opponents within the clan who would love to rub his face in such a mistake as choosing the wrong successor.

That said, given that Hinata asserted herself by killing a Branch family member, the rest of the Branch family would almost certainly resent her being accepted back into the fold as a result. Such a splinter faction that would endorse Hinata being restored would have to come from within the main family, and the fact that she's been disowned would make that a bridge too far, I expect, especially given the reason she was disowned. If Naruto could reveal his lineage, and Hinata and her supporters could frame the Byakugan transplant as sealing ties between the Hyuga and the Leaf's jinchuriki who is also a strong candidate to become Hokage someday, then they might be willing to overlook that, but failing that I can't see any sort of internal Hyuga uprising in opposition to Hiashi in support of Hinata.

I expect we might be seeing the Hyuga taking the excuse Hinata mentioned earlier, refusing the revenge by citing the waiver, but that feels kind of... unfinished. If not just for revenge purposes, surely some will interpret this as Hinata threatening the Hyuga and will want to act on that basis.

Really, I think I'm just trying to come up with some scenario where Hinata isn't found as the victim of another perfect Hyuga assassination, but the outlook isn't great.

I mean, really, why go so far as to kill Neji? Defeating him without killing him, forcing him to yield would have gotten the point of her being better than she had been judged to be across, perhaps even more strongly than killing him. Protecting Naruto from Neji? I don't think Naruto's in less danger from the Hyuga than he was before - Neji's determination to kill them is certainly shared by some of the Hyuga and now likely exacerbated by this.

The explanation that feels most right is just that Hinata wanted to feel the exercise of power, to feel that she really did have the strength to fight back against the clan that had controlled, humiliated, and abused her, and to fight back in a definitive, absolute way. Which just seems, understandable, but stupider than I've come to expect characters in this story to be, but then, so was Sasuke planning to wander into the woods and shoot up on some special magic Uchiha power juice a foreign ninja had given him.
