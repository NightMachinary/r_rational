Cussing in front of children is not okay. Children watching fight potentially to the death is. The first read through I thought it was just some comic relief, but as I considered it something else occurred to me. Was this an intentional move to highlight the values dissonance? If so, well played author.

Edit* no wait it was glancing through the comment section that made me realize this.
