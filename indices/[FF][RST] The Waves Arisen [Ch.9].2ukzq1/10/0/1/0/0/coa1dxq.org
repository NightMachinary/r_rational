Warrior culture is a real thing. It's not likely to stand up to ninety percent casualties in a group which is essentially conscripted. That's a level of losses at which mutinies are nigh-universal /when those casualties are suffered in the course of wars against external enemies/. At the hands of your own? As I said in an earlier post the only comparable example I can even think of is communist cadre -that is, active members of the party - during Stalin's purges. This is social dysfunction at "Year Zero" levels.
