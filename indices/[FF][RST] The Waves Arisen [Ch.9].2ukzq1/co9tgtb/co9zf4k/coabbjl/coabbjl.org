But they talk about 'chakra' and probably even 'chakras' all the time.

Prefixing milli is the most obvious way to show you're talking about "chakra - the unit of chakra energy" and not any of other other fuzzy meanings they have for the word.

Plus, I don't remember it very well, but maybe the scale for "1 chakra" was set at something sensible, like the amount of chakra a normal ninja regenerates during a day?
