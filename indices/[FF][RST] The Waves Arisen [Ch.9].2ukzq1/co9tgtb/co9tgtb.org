That was nasty. [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes][Beware The Nice One]], indeed. Nice to see Hinata win this -- the only two times I've seen her get a flat-out victory in fanfic are this one and one time when she activated Neji's Caged Bird seal.

On a side note, I've been a little worried about you putting actual numbers on chakra use. I'm afraid it's going to video-gameify the story too much. So far, though, it seems to be playing out pretty well. I do find myself wondering why Naruto chose to use "millichakra" as his base unit, instead of sticking to integers.
