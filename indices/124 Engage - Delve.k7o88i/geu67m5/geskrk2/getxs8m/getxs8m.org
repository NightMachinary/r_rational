  Is giving the accolade to Tarny really doing anything useful besides making him feel better? Without an interface he probably can't progress the skill, and even if he could it wasn't going to fit in his planned build anyway.

Making him feel better isn't a bad thing, he can always pass the accolade on later. Also, I think he can progress the skill.

She already has Ice Bolt
