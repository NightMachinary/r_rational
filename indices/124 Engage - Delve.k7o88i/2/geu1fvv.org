Considering how no one got any accolades, but Stint did, I theorize that Stint counted for double. To awaken and get an accolade, he needed twice the amount of essence. But that worked out fine due to there only being 7 members total in the party in the Dark Lair, so Stint was permitted to take up two "slots" for an awakening and an accolade. However this time, every slot was accounted for with 7 awakenings and 1 earning an accolade for 8 slots total.
