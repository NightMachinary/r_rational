I really don't think Rain has any use for the skill. I assume a level 0 skill has pathetic damage compared to his auras. So, it makes perfect sense why he'd give it away.

Also, maybe it's possible for the unawakened to keep swapping it to each other when one runs out of mana? If yes, then that seems like a pretty valuable asset.
