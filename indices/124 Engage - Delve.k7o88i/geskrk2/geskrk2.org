I wasn't thrilled with this update. It definitely had that meandering feel to it of an update going over the same ground again, even though objectively some things happened I guess. It's just they were mainly cleanup sorts of things .

Is giving the accolade to Tarny really doing anything useful besides making him feel better? Without an interface he probably can't progress the skill, and even if he could it wasn't going to fit in his planned build anyway.

Doesn't Ice Girl still need to swap a skill into something to get her class? I was wondering if it's Ice Bolt. Might be too convenient.
