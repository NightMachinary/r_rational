The fight between Jade and The Drug Lord isn't reciting Names to one another (or at least not entirely - I think Jade pulls out one or two). Rather it's Symbolic Combatâ„¢.

In Unsong, all of reality is a metaphor for Adam Kadmon. Every personal experience within reality is an interpretation, and Symbolic Combat is an argument about interpretations. One party proposes a vision of reality, the other combats it, and the winner is the one who comes up with an interpretation the other can't change quickly enough.

This only works for beings with a grasp of Kabbalah that reaches at least Yetzirah (the realm of Archetypes). Jade was brought up to know this stuff, being a grand-daughter of Ramiel. The Drug Lord is himself a former angel (Samyazaz, the Ziggurat Builder) and so has intuitive understanding of it.
