They're all explained. I forget if the thing about the Drug Lord and names has been explained already, but it's not a huge spoiler for me to point it out if it hasn't: the Drug Lord himself can use names, but he can't make the people he controls with peyote use them.

For any other questions about the Drug Lord or the Other King, both characters are explained in much further detail later on.
