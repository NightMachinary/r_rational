After exponents, it's [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetration][tetration]]. The most interesting bit to me is that for addition, multiplication, and exponentiation, you use algebra if there's a variable in the term. But you have to use calculus if there's a variable in tetration. My brain hurt a little when I had to find the limit of x^{x^{x^{x^{x^{x...}}}}} as x approaches number like âˆš2 or e for an infinite tower of x's.
