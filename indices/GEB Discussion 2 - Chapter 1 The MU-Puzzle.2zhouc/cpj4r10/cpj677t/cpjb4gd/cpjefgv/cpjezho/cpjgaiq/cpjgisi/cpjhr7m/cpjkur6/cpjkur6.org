I think what you're saying, then, is that the human mind can generalize in ways that logic can't -- that we can jump out of "all the systems" at the same time, even when it's impossible to define what that means.

The system you get by jumping out of "all the systems" is just another system that you haven't jumped out of yet, which is contradictory, so you can't really describe what it means to jump out of all the systems.

The claim that the human mind can do things that can never be described is a claim that some make, but you should be sure you're making it. Later in GEB you should have to think hard about this.

To indicate why it's a problem to talk about "all the levels", I'm going to make a dialogue between a ridiculously mathematically literal version of me, and a puppet version of you whose mouth I'll put words in:

- Me: So what if I want to object to having a countably infinite number of meta-levels of discussion in the same thread?
- You: They're all the same meta-level. They go in the meta^{2} thread.
- Me: I disagree, because I think it's important to clarify when you're trying to talk about "all the things" in a system from outside of it. So I'm going to have to disagree in a new meta^{ω} thread.
- You: Meta^{ω} threads are silly. You should have put that in the meta^{2} thread.
- Me: Isn't that a pretty meta^{ω+1} thing to say?
- You: No. It's a meta^{2} thing to say. What you call meta^{ω+2} would also be what I call meta^{2}.
- Me: I object to that on a meta^{2ω} level.
- You: There /is/ no meta^{2ω} level. There's no meta^{3ω} level either, or --
- Me: Apparently there's a meta^{ω^{2}} level, because you're currently arguing on it.
- You: You're going to keep naming these levels after [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_number][ordinal numbers]], and I'm going to keep saying that they're just meta^{2}.
- Me: Which meta-levels, exactly, can I name that you'd say are just meta^{2}?
- You: ALL OF THEM.
- Me: All of them in what set?
- You: The set of all the meta-levels you can name.
- Me: But my names are all ordinal numbers.
- You: All of those, then.
- Me: There is no set of all ordinal numbers. Any set of ordinal numbers you can pick defines an ordinal number that isn't in that set. You have to say 'class of ordinal numbers', or 'set^{2} of ordinal numbers', to avoid a paradox.
- You: Fine, all of them in the /set^{2}/ of ordinal numbers.
- Me: I'm just going to have to make a different set^{2} that's isomorphic to the ordinal numbers and start naming meta-levels after those.
- You: I'm not interested in talking about sets^{2} of sets of meta-levels anymore.
- Me: Which ones are you not interested in talking about?
- You: ALL OF THEM.
- Me: That's a nice set^{3} of sets^{2} of sets of meta-levels you've just defined.
- You: I'm also not interested in sets^{3} or sets^{4} or...

Apologies for the puppetry. It'd take a long time to make anything like this conversation happen naturally.

How many times could this argument escalate? Could you ever respond to "all the ways" I might escalate the argument to a new meta-level?
