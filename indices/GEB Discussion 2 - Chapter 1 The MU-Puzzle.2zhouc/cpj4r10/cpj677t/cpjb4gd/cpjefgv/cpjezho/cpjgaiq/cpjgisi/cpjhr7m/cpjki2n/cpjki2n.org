Hmm. After some consideration, I'm not convinced (at least not yet) of the logic of the collapse of metax3 into metax2. When I followed the logic through in my head*, it seemed to cause further collapses, until I eventually questioned why metax2 might not be a part of the system itself. But I decided that it would be rather odd to say that thinking about how we solve the problem (metax1) is the same as solving the problem. While on the other hand, metax3 makes sense as-is: thinking about how we think about how we think about solving the problem is a thing, and should be credited as being separate from the lower levels.

*My thought path: I thought of the problem as a series of introductions to a book. It seems to fit the definition of meta-writing. I thought of an author who writes an introduction to his introduction, (metax2) and an introduction to that (metax3). Then I realized that they are all introductions, after all, so they should all fit under metax1. And if introductions, why, they are also all part of the book! Metax0! And this is where I saw my mistake as I realized that introductions are still introductions, not part of the body text.

EDIT: But yes, clearly humans think so very rarely on the metax3 level that it is almost exclusively just a thought exercise whenever we refer to it. As examples, intros to intros to intros would be overkill, and I don't even know the symbol (although we probably have one) for what falls next in the pattern of addition-multiplication-powers-...
