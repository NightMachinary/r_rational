But the problem you are describing is that whenever I need to talk about one specific meta-level, I always have to go up another level which leads to recursing until there is an infinitely number of meta levels. Even then, your example of "meta^{2} issues, meta^{3} issues, meta^{4} issues, and so on" requires even /more/ meta levels which gets very confusing and it's hard to say what each level brings to the table in terms of telling us what more we learn about a given problem which started all of this meta-ness in the first place. It's a confusing and paradoxical mess.

If we use the system of three levels I describe, it better matches our intuitive understanding of meta-ness, where discussing the problem goes in the meta-level, and *anything* about the meta-level goes in the meta-meta-level (even about the meta-meta-level). Hence, the answer the thread your objection goes in would be the meta-meta thread.

Finally, the point is that while stating anything with multiple metas can make sense and are valid statements, they are not any more /powerful/ in a meaningful sense than simply stating it on the meta-meta level anyway. Everything above the meta-meta-level can be rephrased to be part of the meta-meta level.

I wouldn't apply my reasoning about meta-ness to strict formal logical (or set) theory because I'm not a mathematician and I wouldn't know how to prove something like this. But what I'm arguing is that the system of three levels is how humans most naturally think in a meta sense, and I thought the mathematics supported me (sorta) with the evidence I cited [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2zhouc/geb_discussion_2_chapter_1_the_mupuzzle/cpjgamo][here]] about all higher order logics being equivalent to second order logic being the same as all higher meta-levels being equivalent to the meta-meta-level.

Sorry I take so long to write my responses. I keep going over them to be sure that I'm clear on what I'm trying to say.
