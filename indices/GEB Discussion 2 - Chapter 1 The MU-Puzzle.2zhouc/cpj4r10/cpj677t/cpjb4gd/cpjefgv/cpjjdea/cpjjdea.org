Whew! Ok, it seems you have solid grounds for supposing that I am conflating meta- with simply thinking more abstractly. The definition of meta- that we seem to be referring to involves both:

- An exiting of the system to a higher level of abstraction

- Reference, from without the system, to the system

On a related note (pgs 45-47): While it's a reasonable jump to make, so far the author has not connected M/U/I thinking with the prefix "meta-". He talks about "jumping out of the system" and "surveying what the system has done" in the same breath, but hasn't firmly affixed the two together under any name that I can see. I'm not sure whether it's meta- he's referring to when he says "I-mode," or just thinking outside of the box.

That's what got my definitions crossed.
