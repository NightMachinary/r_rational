Oops. Thanks for the catch!

As a side note, I think of the I-Mode as when we think on a meta-level about the system and it sounds like a mathematical formulation of I-Mode would be first-order, second-order, and other higher orders of logic. Which means that M-Mode for thinking within the system which can be the standard laws of logic, and the first and second order logic systems is I-Mode.

In simple English, M-Mode is thinking directly about the system and I-Mode is thinking about the system on a meta-level, and on a meta-meta level.

Before people bring up the obvious extension of a meta-meta-meta-... level. I have only this to say. There is no such thing. We never have any need to do so in real life. There is no need to think in more than three levels about the system (system, meta, and meta-meta). I think it's proven somewhere that third, fourth, fifth, and etc. orders of logic are equally as powerful as second order logic and don't really contribute anything new (maybe restating some theorems in a different way can help, but that's it for their benefits).

Here's a fun meta joke:
