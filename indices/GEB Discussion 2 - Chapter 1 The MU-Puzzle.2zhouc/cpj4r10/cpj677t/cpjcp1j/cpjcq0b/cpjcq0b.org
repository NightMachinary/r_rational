  In the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_mathematics][foundations of mathematics]], *Russell's paradox* (also known as *Russell's antinomy*), discovered by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell][Bertrand Russell]] in 1901, showed that some attempted formalizations of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_set_theory][naive set theory]] created by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor][Georg Cantor]] led to a contradiction. The same paradox had been discovered a year before by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Zermelo][Ernst Zermelo]] but he did not publish the idea, which remained known only to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert][Hilbert]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Husserl][Husserl]] and other members of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_G%C3%B6ttingen][University of GÃ¶ttingen]].

  According to naive set theory, any definable collection is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)][set]]. Let /R/ be the set of all sets that are not members of themselves. If /R/ is not a member of itself, then its definition dictates that it must contain itself, and if it contains itself, then it contradicts its own definition as the set of all sets that are not members of themselves. This contradiction is Russell's paradox. Symbolically:

  In 1908, two ways of avoiding the paradox were proposed, Russell's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory][type theory]] and the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo_set_theory][Zermelo set theory]], the first constructed [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_set_theory][axiomatic set theory]]. Zermelo's axioms went well beyond [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frege][Frege]]'s axioms of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_extensionality][extensionality]] and unlimited [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_builder_notation][set abstraction]], and evolved into the now-canonical [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory][Zermelo--Fraenkel set theory]] (ZF).
