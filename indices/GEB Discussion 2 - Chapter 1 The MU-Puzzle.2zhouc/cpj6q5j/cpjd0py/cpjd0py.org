  "starting with 'M' and not having a multiple of 3 'I's" is a sufficient and necessary condition on theorems

Are you saying every string that fits those criteria is a theorem? That's really interesting. I was halfway through arguing that MUII is impossible, but it's not: MI -(R2)-> MII -(R2)-> MIIII -(R2)-> MIIIIIIII -(R3)-> MUIIIII -(R1)-> MUIIIIIU -(R3)-> MUIIUU -(R4)-> MUII.

Rule 1 keeps tripping me up. All the rest go really well together, you can make general statements based on them because they act in very modular-arithmetic ways. But you can just add a U at the end if it ends with I... I find it hard to generalize on that.
