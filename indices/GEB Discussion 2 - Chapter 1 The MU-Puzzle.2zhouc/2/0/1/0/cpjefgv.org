Sorry I didn't reply earlier. My computer shut down for a bit.

I feel like this comment isn't talking about thinking in a more meta sense, but rather categorizing simpler systems like farming within a bigger system like economics.

Using your example of carrot picking:

- System-Level - The basic steps to picking a carrot which we can easily automate a robot to do for us. Steps are of the form: check carrot for freshness, then pick or leave alone. This level is the task itself and methods to perform the task.

- Meta-Level - How well does the robot do it's job? Does it work better on sunny days than rainy days? How quick and efficient is it at its job? What mistakes does it make, or what can it do better? This level is thinking /about/ the task and what can be changed about the methods to perform the task.

- Meta-Meta-Level - How are we examining the robot's effectiveness? How do we come up with new plans for the robot? How were we thinking when we came up with particularly bad plans, or particularly good plans? How do we structure our planning process? This level is thinking about how we are thinking about the task. This is where you examine your thought processes about how you deal with problems, or in other words, how do you structure your planning to solve the problem.

- Meta-Meta-Meta...-Level - This is where things break down, because the last level was analyzing how you approach problems in the first place and is extremely abstract and is very far removed from the original problem. To go any further would be something like this very discussion where I explained how meta-thinking works. But looking at the problem from a multi-meta viewpoint is still part of the meta-meta level since it examines how you approach the problem in the first place. Therefore this level doesn't seem to offer any further insights to help with solving the problem.

The flaw you made in your comment is that you confused meta-thinking with thinking more abstractly. But meta-levels should retain the same focus on the same problem/system as the object-level, with the only differences being that you step back from solving the problem to /how/ you solve the problem to how you /think/ about how you solve the problem.

A real life example is the HPMOR planning threads:

The [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2xkbb8/spoilers_113_unified_solutions_thread/][System-Level/Unified Solutions Thread]] which is about the presented solutions to pass the Final Exam, [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2xiabn/spoilers_ch_113_planning_thread/][Meta-Level/Planning Thread]] which is about examining the problem and to see how a possible solution would be structured, and [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2xhqus/the_meta_meta_planning_thread/][Meta-Meta-Level/Meta Meta Planning Thread]] which is about discussing how to discuss the problem and its solutions.

In fact, [[/u/alexanderwales]] stated the purpose of a meta-meta-planning thread as:

#+begin_quote
  This is not a place to post solutions.

  This is not a place to discuss the problem.

  This is the place to discuss how to discuss the problem and its solutions.
#+end_quote

Furthermore, note that not a single person in a community of thousands even /tried/ posting a Meta-Meta-Meta-Level thread, because it just doesn't make sense on a logical* level to do so.

EDIT: *When I said "on a logical level" I should have said "on a intuitive level", because I'm referring to how humans think about meta-ness and not the theory of logic.
