I think what you're describing is the ease with which the human mind will jump up more meta-levels, once it's already done so once. You just don't notice it, because you're using basically the same thought patterns you used before.

In a forum, it's clear that meta-meta issues and meta-meta-meta issues could go in the same thread -- humans are not so slavishly devoted to categories that they'd have to distinguish them.

Math won't usually let you get away with not making the distinction.

Also, just because you've described a countably infinite number of meta-levels at once, that doesn't mean things are settled, because there are more than a countably infinite number of ordinals. Suppose this message board has gotten very meta indeed, and I wanted to object to the very notion of putting meta^{2} issues, meta^{3} issues, meta^{4} issues, and so on in the same thread. In what thread would I raise my objection?
