I didn't say that there was very little to say, I said (poorly) that anything we can say on a higher level can be rephrased to be defined from a meta-meta level only.

Also, I defined the Meta-Meta-Level to be discussing how to think about thinking about the problem.

The comment about meta-meta level threads is still on a meta-meta level, because it's still discussing how to think about thinking about the problem. In other words, the first level is about the problem, the second level is about how to approach the problem, and the third level is about approaching all of the possible ways to handle solving the problem. The distinction is really subtle, but one possible way to approach all of the possible approaches to solving the problem is to break it down into levels of meta-ness. Therefore, my comment about the different meta levels stays on the meta-meta-level instead of the "meta-meta-meta-level".

To best understand it, I think of it like the idea of recursion. The first level is the base case, the second level is the demonstration of the first inductive/recursive step, and the third level is the actual recursion where it even contains recursive statements about itself.

One last point is when I moved from one level to another, I clearly noticed a change in my patterns of thinking about the problem, but I don't experience any similar change when I try thinking about the meta-meta level on another meta-level, but that could be chalked up to me not knowing what such a level of thought would be like if it exists, so it's not a very good reason to support my argument.
