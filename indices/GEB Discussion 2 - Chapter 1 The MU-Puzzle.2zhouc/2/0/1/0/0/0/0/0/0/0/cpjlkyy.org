Thanks for that dialogue. I know you aren't trying to make me look silly, but it really does help me understand what you seem to be understanding from my argument and I think I understand how to clarify the difference between our arguments.

To me, all of the potential levels of meta you could ever name, 1, 2, 3, ω, ω+1, ω^{2,} ordinal sets, etc, etc... are mainly used to comment on other levels which are meta. However, the critical distinction we seem to be making is that I'm an extremely practical (almost utilitarian) person and when I use meta-thinking, I look at how the different levels relate directly to the system-level problem. I have not ever found anything higher than the meta-meta level which provide useful insights into the system-problem itself which can't also be restated somehow onto the meta-meta level. Hence it seems like how people think about meta-ness can be simplified to the bottom three levels.

The statement about my argument you said was:

#+begin_quote
  the human mind can generalize in ways that logic can't -- that we can jump out of "all the systems" at the same time, even when it's impossible to define what that means.
#+end_quote

I don't.../think/ I'm making that claim, but rather the case that the human mind can jump out of multiple systems at a time, for a lot of meta-levels (but I don't mean all of them at once). It's just that for practical purposes to solve the original problem, jumping up to the metax4 level, for example, is equally as helpful as jumping to the metax2 level. Sure, on the metax4 level, you now can make statements about the metax3 and metax2 level, but it's not helpful for solving the problem and any other possible insights can also be found on the metax2 level.

I just thought I had something really interesting when I found out about the mathematical implications concerning higher order logics which seems to back me up with the statements in how higher-order logics are more expressive than second-order logic, but are only at most as powerful as second-order logic.

I'm going to go to bed now, so if you have any more responses or counter-arguments, I won't be posting my reply for a while.
