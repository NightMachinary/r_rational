  In [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics][mathematics]], *tetration* (or *hyper-4*) is the next [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperoperation][hyper operator]] after [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation][exponentiation]], and is defined as iterated exponentiation. The word was coined by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuben_Louis_Goodstein][Reuben Louis Goodstein]], from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetra-][tetra-]] (four) and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterated_function][iteration]]. Tetration is used for the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_numbers#Standardized_system_of_writing_very_large_numbers][notation of very large numbers]]. Shown here are examples of the first four [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper_operator][hyper operators]], with tetration as the fourth (and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Successor_function][succession]], the unary operation denoted taking and yielding the number after , as the 0th):

  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition][Addition]]

  #+begin_quote
    /n/ copies of 1 added to /a/.
  #+end_quote

  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication][Multiplication]]

  #+begin_quote
    /n/ copies of /a/ combined by addition.
  #+end_quote

  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation][Exponentiation]]

  #+begin_quote
    /n/ copies of /a/ combined by multiplication.
  #+end_quote

  - Tetration

  #+begin_quote
    /n/ copies of /a/ combined by exponentiation, right-to-left.
  #+end_quote

  where each operation is defined by iterating the previous one (the next operation in the sequence is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentation][pentation]]). Tetration is not an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_function][elementary function]].

  Tetration is not an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELEMENTARY][elementary recursive function]].

  Here, succession () is the most basic operation; addition () is a primary operation, though for natural numbers it can be thought of as a chained succession of /n/ successors of /a/; multiplication () is also a primary operation, though for natural numbers it can be thought of as a chained addition involving /n/ numbers /a/; and exponentiation () can be thought of as a chained multiplication involving /n/ numbers /a/. Analogously, tetration () can be thought of as a chained power involving /n/ numbers /a/. The parameter /a/ may be called the base-parameter in the following, while the parameter /n/ in the following may be called the /height/-parameter (which is integral in the first approach but may be generalized to fractional, real and complex /heights/, see below).
