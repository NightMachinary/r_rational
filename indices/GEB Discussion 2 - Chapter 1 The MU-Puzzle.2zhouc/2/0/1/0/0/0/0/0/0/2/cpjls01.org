Maybe not to the point, but I have heard similar things before, from reputable sources, as jumping out of "all the systems." Perhaps these systems could be taken to include also the system in which the phrase is offered? In other words, 'I'd like to point you outside of the box, but it's hard because this conversation itself is within it?'

As for me, I believe the human mind is capable of things outside of all the systems humans have so far defined, which include such things as language, logic, and mathematics. (I don't mean Language, Logic, and Mathematics, the theoretical ideals of that which we now know.) We may also be able to describe those things later using means not readily available now.

Take this as you will, the thread grows long. ;)
