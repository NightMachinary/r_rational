You're right that Hofstadter doesn't mention "meta-", but it means to be self-referential which fits his themes so well, that I can't believe it won't show up at some point.

I agree that he doesn't seem to be talking about it directly in the chapter, but since it relates to so many of his themes and I-Mode looks like it is largely thinking about the system in a meta-sense, I wanted to bring up the idea for discussion.
