Hmm. No added utility from 3rd-order meta? Seems hard to prove or disprove off the cuff, but let me think out loud. Suppose the goal is to get enough carrots to eat:

- System-level could be picking carrots and eating them.

- Meta-level could be planting and caring for carrot seeds so that you can eat them later.

- Meta-meta-level could be forming tools to make carrot-planting more efficient, or perhaps hiring workers and paying them from carrot sales; there are probably a lot of branches we could follow.

- Meta-meta-meta-level could be ... economics, mechanical/genetic engineering, i.e. fields that directly improve upon your level-2 strategy.

- Metax4-level could be the scientific system itself, or other systems of thought/action which tend to develop those more directly useful fields of level metax3. It is possible that your religion/worldview could be included here, or otherwise at level metax5.

Hmm. So far I subscribe to this progression. Would you also accept it as a counterexample, or does it fit into your theory somehow?

I make no claims of this shedding light on the author's M/U/I thought theory, but at the least it's a fun side-track.
