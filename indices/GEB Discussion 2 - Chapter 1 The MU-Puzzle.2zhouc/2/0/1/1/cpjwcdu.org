You can always "go up" another "meta-level" of reasoning, forming a more-or-less infinite hierarchy. /However/, real-life reasoning is mostly abductive, and to reason "well" abductively at very high meta-levels of hierarchy, you need increasing amounts of data. So the higher the meta-level you go, the "wider" your tree of encompassed "object-level" reasoning systems/categories have to get in order to train your nth-level model well.
