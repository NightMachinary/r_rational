I don't really have the mathematics backgrounds to explain too well the bit I learned about higher-order logics, but it was from people, or academic communities, who I do trust to get their maths right.

First is [[/u/EliezerYudkowsky]]'s post on LessWrong called the [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/g7n/secondorder_logic_the_controversy/][Second Order Logic: The Controversy]] with the quote:

#+begin_quote
  Once you make the jump to second-order logic, you're /done/ - so far as anyone knows (so far as I know) there's /nothing/ more powerful than second-order logic in terms of /which models it can characterize/.
#+end_quote

And there was a neat academic textbook somewhere I can't find which also explained this, but I dug up this [[https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCUQFjAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstaff.science.uva.nl%2Fj.vanbenthem%2Fdocs%2FHOL.pdf&ei=PSMKVZ6nFYOigwTyuIOQCw&usg=AFQjCNHUip3_EkBm9lI6y4dqmOzRhfC7ww&sig2=YQWODgv5hv2St46NQv5TvQ&bvm=bv.88528373,d.eXY][PDF download]] online which makes for some really complex reading and I spent quite a while skimming it to be sure it supported me with what I /think/ is a proof for the following quote on page number 30:

#+begin_quote
  The logic and model theory of L[2] exhibit the same phenomena as those of L[omega]: a fluid border line with set theory, and a few systematic results. Indeed, in a sense, *higher-order logic does not offer anything new*.
#+end_quote

Look below to my reply to [[/u/rspeer]]'s other comment for why meta-meta-meta doesn't work.
