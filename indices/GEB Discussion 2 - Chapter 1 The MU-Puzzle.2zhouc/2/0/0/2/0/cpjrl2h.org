Ah, I see that I have again missed a crucial factor in our discussion, Mr. Jones. I must have missed this post before writing my other replies below, and for that I apologize. I see now that you have made a valiant effort to whittle down some part of what you learned from these complex texts, to make it simple enough for the layman. I cannot follow much of what is said in either of the documents you have linked, but if those quotes are in fact descriptions pertaining to the very thing we are talking about, then I suppose I also feel inclined to trust these 'expert opinions,' even before having my own understanding just yet.

I may have a go at Eliezer's dialogue there. It seems to build on top of a tower of long documents he wrote before, but with a few tricks or given enough time I might sort it out. At least his /seem/ like the more accessible writings for those lacking in formal training. Then again, it's probably not worth the time while I have so much else to read, of his and of others, on similarly engaging (and yet only theoretically useful -- sigh) topics.
