I'm loving your proofs, but whoa! You lost me at 3u+i+3k=2^{a} :

#+begin_quote
  Clearly 3u+i is not a multiple of 3. Thus there are nonnegative k, a such that 3u+i+3k=2^{a.}
#+end_quote

I guess you skipped the step of showing that for any non-multiple of 3, there always exists a multiple of three that adds with it to a power of 2. Now I'm left to try to figure out a proof for that. [thinks a bit] Okay, this should work, even if it's kind of long:

1. Powers of 2 are never multiples of three, therefore when divided my three they must have either remainder 1 or remainder 2. (I'll call these classes M1 and M2.)

2. Numbers in M1 or M2, when doubled, produce numbers in the opposite class. Demonstrations: (3x+1)/2=6x+2=3x'+2. (3x+2)/2=6x+4=3x'+1.

3. Every number 3u+i, where i is in M1 or M2, will have some additive 3y that brings it to within 1 of the the power of two above it, 2^{z.} If they are the same class (M1/M2) then choose k=y and a=z, otherwise move up to the next power of two, which will be of the opposite class, and use a=z+1 and the appropriate k. (k=2y+u or k=2y+u+1, if we're looking for M2 or M1, respectively.)

Well, that was fun, and now I can move on to the rest of your proof! [reads proof] Yes, a very nice proof of the necessary and sufficient properties for the MIU system!
