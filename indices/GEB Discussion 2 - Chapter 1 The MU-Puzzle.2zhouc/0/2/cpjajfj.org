If (b) were as simple as you make it, Lewis Carroll's dialogue would not have been anything remarkable or startling. For one thing, Achilles keeps adding rules of inference, they're just not sufficient to convince the Tortoise of anything.

Suppose Achilles simply asks the Tortoise to accept the inference rule of modus ponens, and Tortoise agrees as long as Achilles writes it down in his book. Does Achilles win?

(Edit: I forgot that in the dialogue, Achilles is responsible for writing everything that the Tortoise is asked to accept, so I had to reword the above)

I have more to say about this on [[http://godel-escher-bach.wikia.com/wiki/Two-Part_Invention][the Wikia page for the Two-Part Invention]].
