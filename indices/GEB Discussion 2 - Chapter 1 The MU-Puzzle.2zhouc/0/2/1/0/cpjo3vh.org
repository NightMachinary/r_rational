I suppose that's a reasonable way to put it.

Tortoise keeps taking the things that Achilles intends to be rules of inference, and turns them into axioms of the system, leaving a system of nothing but axioms with no deductive power.

The conclusion I come to is that, if you have some axioms and you want to make them useful, it's not enough to add a rule of inference -- at least once, you also have to add a mutual understanding that the rule has a purpose. "This isn't just a proposition to be manipulated like the other axioms. We're going to /use/ it. When it implies things, we're going to /believe/ them."
