Formal systems are pretty much the basis of all rigorous inference. I thus find it kinda important for having remotely accurate beliefs about anything.

P-sets or reading for information tend to put me in M-mode, playing Magic or working on my own puts me in I-mode, and meditation and occasional flashes of waking delight put me in U-mode. I'd put a mu-state in with the U-mode, for my part.
