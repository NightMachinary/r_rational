Had a lot of fun playing around with the MU puzzle. Took me a while to decide the problem was unsolvable, but now I'm confident it is, because:

a) you need to end up with no Is in your string\\
b) the only way to remove an I is 3 at a time. To remove all Is you need a number of Is that is divisible by 3.\\
c) the only way to generate an I is by doubling the entire string (except the M). This gives you twice as many Is as before.\\
d) no number that is not divisible by 3 can be doubled and then be divisible by 3. (x % 3 != 0 means 2x % 3 != 0).
