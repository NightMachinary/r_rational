The chapter was mostly pretty basic but an insightful thing was the "working within the system vs. jumping out of the system" idea. I think you could apply this to the rules of our society: most people work within the system of our society, never making observations of it as a whole. But some people, like clever salesmen, criminals or lawyers are maybe able to jump out of the system and observe it from a more neutral viewpoint and get an advantage because of it.

Btw, some people over at [[/r/GEB]] complained that the schedule is a bit aggressive and speculated that people would drop out at the beginning of April at the latest. I dunno about that myself, we'll see.
