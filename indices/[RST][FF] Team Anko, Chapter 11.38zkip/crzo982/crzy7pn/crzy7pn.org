No, this is short. It's 3333 words[1]; the first few chapters were 8-9k, the middle ones were about 5k, and these last three have been around 3500. As a very rough rule of thumb, there's about 300 words on an average paperback-book page, so you can get a sense of what the counts mean.

It's been getting shorter because I've been focusing more on for-sale stuff, but I'd like to try to get back to longer chapters again. We'll see.

[1] I was going to just say '3300' but the coincidence amused me.
