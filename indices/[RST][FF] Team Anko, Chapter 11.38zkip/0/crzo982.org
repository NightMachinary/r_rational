Enjoyable chapter although, correct me if I'm wrong, this seems a little shorter than usual. Or did I just read through it quickly?

I'm loving your take on Orochimaru. He's very compelling, and a lot more interesting than a lot of the standard Orochimaru's used in fanfiction. The fact that Orochimaru is the head of an entire country is never properly addressed, in my opinion. Anyone with the intelligence and power to do that has to have some depth. Overall, great story so far. I like.
