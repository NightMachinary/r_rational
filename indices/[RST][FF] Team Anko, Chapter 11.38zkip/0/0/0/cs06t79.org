Ah, I see. Cool then. Also I have to say, I thought it was hilarious how there was that little bait-and-switch type moment with Hinata, when she walks in and starts undressing with Shino in the bathroom. I'm sure I wasn't the only one who was very confused by this supposed OOC-ness, and then you brought it back around when it was pointed out and we all realize that, rationally, in a house full of people that see through walls as a matter of habit, nudity is immaterial in the Hyuuga household. I chuckled.
