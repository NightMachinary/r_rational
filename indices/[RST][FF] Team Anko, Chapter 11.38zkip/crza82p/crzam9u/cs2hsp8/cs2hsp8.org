I agree with this point. I believe this is what's happening. Even if Naruto's completely drained of his own chakra, the fox's chakra is known to be so much more massive, it's not worth comparing. There's no reason for him to try and take any chakra that's pumped into Naruto, unless it's unhealthy (maybe curse sealed or Orochimaru infected?) or it used a bunch of its chakra to do something (and, unless this is different than both canon and almost every other fanfic out there, the usage of the fox's chakra would've been noticed) And even then, I highly doubt it would bother risking Naruto's life for the petty amount of chakra he'd get in return, and I highly doubt the Fourth's seal would let it take any, regardless.

My theory here is that Orochimaru is using this as a convenient excuse to keep Naruto laid up. I presume his chakra levels had already stabilized, and now Orochimaru is having his chakra drained periodically to fill the battery. The draining also provides him with a convenient excuse to keep Naruto detained, under the guise of his chakra not producing.
