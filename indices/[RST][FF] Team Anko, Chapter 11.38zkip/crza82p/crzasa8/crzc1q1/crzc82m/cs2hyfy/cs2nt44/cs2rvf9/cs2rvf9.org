It all comes down to consistency, I guess. For me, especially in the beginning, Naruto took itself fairly seriously. Adult ninja couldn't be touched by fresh genin. It took training and determination to get strong. You got the impression that strength was earned in Naruto, as opposed to being handed to you (I'm looking at you, Gohan!)

Haku was good, but we got the impression that, despite Zabuza's bluster, he wasn't that good. Good enough to beat two fresh genin, but probably couldn't take Kakashi, so probably around chunin level. Chakra wasn't like ki. It had some pseudo science behind it, and was clearly a precious resource (cite Kakashi on the Wave mission)

So for a show that seemed fairly consistent (can't say normal. Come on, they were flinging around water dragons!) it didn't jive that you had 6 year olds who were as good as 15 year olds. It just wouldn't work, physically speaking, no matter how you train them, bloodlines and jinchuuriki not withstanding since, ya know, shonen. But that didn't even become a huge factor until near the end of Part I anyway.
