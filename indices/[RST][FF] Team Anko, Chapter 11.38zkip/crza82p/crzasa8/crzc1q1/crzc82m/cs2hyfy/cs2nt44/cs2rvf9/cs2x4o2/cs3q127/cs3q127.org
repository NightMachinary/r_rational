Yes. In a way. Even though, in the Wave Mission arc, Kakashi gave off a big line about how there were people in the world "younger than Naruto, but stronger than him", you don't see much evidence of that. Adult ninja are kicking the 12 year old's asses all over, as it should be. Zabuza's water clone (which was 1/10 as strong) took Naruto and Sasuke teaming up pretty hard to beat it, while the original stayed stationary. Orochimaru dominated Sasuke and Naruto effortlessly in the Chunin exams. Itachi beat Sasuke one-handed. Kabuto wrecked Naruto thoroughly, and was only taken down because of Tsunade stepping back into things with the assist.

Don't get me wrong, the whole 6 year old Chunin thing is established from the get go. But the evidence of it isn't displayed in the story at all. It's moreso just brought up but never actually shown. As far as actual in canon fighting, the skill gaps are pretty well defined until we hit the Sasuke Retrieval arc. I'm just saying that even though it's mentioned, there was no evidence, so you could almost ignore such a possibility.
