And once more we see how Orochimaru tries to sway people to his side. Interesting to see this Naruto was raised by foster family - no living by himself at four here! I'm also wondering what's up with the Kyuubi, trying to grab Naruto's chakra and all - honestly not something I would have expected it to do. Maybe it's badly injured from the attack Naruto used on the Sound ninja, considering it's basically a living mass of Chakra?

Nice to see consistency with how you've portrayed the Hyuuga, what with Hinata not possessing any body shame and just casually disrobing while Shino was in the room. She didn't click there was a problem till Anko mentioned it either, and then seemed embarrassed moreso for the fact she must've been making the situation very awkward for her team-mate than anything else.
