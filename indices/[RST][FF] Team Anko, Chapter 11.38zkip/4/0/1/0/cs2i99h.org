The Simurgh gets the hate she gets because of what she represents. It's a long accepted fact that free will and choice are core facets of being human. To have something that damages you and alters you to the point that no action you do is your own, in such a way that you can't even /perceive/ said alteration? It's terrifying. With pretty much every other threat in Worm (Exceptions are people like Greyboy and Bonesaw, I'm thinking) the threat is more...tangible? It's scary and threatening but, once it's over, you're good, if you aren't dead. You may be crippled or injured, but you can make it. With the Simurgh, you go through the rest of your life causing destruction, or waiting to cause destruction. Branded like an animal. Caged. And there's no defense except not being there. And considering she flies and moves at speeds most people can't react to in time, it's more like "pray to God she doesn't visit my city". Behemoth, Leviathan, S9...these threats were all fairly straightforward. Get caught by them, die or be really injured. Same as any natural disaster. The simurgh is a sentence. A sentence to what's as close to a cursed existence as is possible to get in a world without actual, magical fate and destiny
