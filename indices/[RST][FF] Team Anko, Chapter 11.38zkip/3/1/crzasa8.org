  Interesting to see this Naruto was raised by foster family - no living by himself at four here!

He lived on his own after a while -- I think I put it at either 6 or 8, I would need to check my timeline. I don't know what's up with Kishi, but kids just cannot do the things that he claims. Child soldiers at 12 after four years of study? Absolutely, right there with you. ANBU captain at 6? No way. Live alone at 4 and don't die? Hell no.

And yes, that was exactly Hinata's reaction. She has no body modesty at all, she was just upset on Shino's behalf.
