[[/u/PeridexisErrant]] makes a good point about the "no upper limit in shonen", but yeah -- a 6 year old simple cannot be a chunin. It takes four years to make genin and then usually another year to make chunin. Assume you're so good you can get that down to two years instead of five. That means you started training at age four, when you're hardly even a self-sufficient human.

And yes, I realize the oddness of saying "throwing around giant energy blasts that tear the fabric of space and time? No problem!" given that I then turn around and say "chunin at 6? Not bloody likely!"
