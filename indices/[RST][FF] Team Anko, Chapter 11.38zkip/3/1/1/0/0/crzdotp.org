Because a central conceit of the shonen genre is that there is no upper limit to the curve of human ability - if you train long and hard enough (and have enough passion), you can literally headbutt mountains in half without superpowers.

Itachi is one of the purest examples, but the whole setting is full of people so far off the curve that they can casually slaughter armies. To achieve S-rank means you have transcended the limits of humanity, and can exempt yourself from any force - physics to geopolitics - with a simple act of will.

Nietzsche would be proud.
