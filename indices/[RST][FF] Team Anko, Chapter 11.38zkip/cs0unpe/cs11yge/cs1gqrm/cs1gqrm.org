  Imagine him as The Simurgh and act accordingly.

Team up with him and take over the world?

Just because someone is a sociopath with inscrutable values is no reason to automatically assume him to be the enemy. It would really be delightful, if Orochimaru turned out to be a hero instead of a villain. Perhaps he has some well justified utilitarian reasoning behind his actions just as he says. Perhaps he really is doing the best he can to make Elemental nations a better place to exist.

Also, Simurgh gets way more hate than she deserves. To me it looked like she was primarily responsible for averting an extinction event.
