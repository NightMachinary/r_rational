And today class, we see an example of a second-level deception being perpetrated on a first-level player.

Notice how honesty is mixed with deception in an attempt to attack the target's deeply held insecurities as a method to bypass the training and pre-existing personal traits that would otherwise make him clam up and ignore anything the deceiver says. By using this method, the target listens and understands the argument - if even only to try to prove it wrong to themselves.

By phrasing it as a hypothetical and again hitting the goal state or utility function of the target - in this case, a need to become stronger, fast - the deceiver attempts to subtly influence the target's decision without actually asking in a manner that could easily be rebuffed.

Notice also the constant shift between statements intended to make the target angry, and apologetic in order to confuse the target, who is unsure of what they are feeling. The claim of psychopathy as if a disability may even instill feelings of guilt in the target. "This poor man can't help himself but to be offensive, he doesn't know any better. Why then are you so angry?"

And in the end, the short term goal is for more information about the target. With that, the deceiver can tailor his future tactics even better.

All in all, a master at work in deception and interrogation. Write this down. It will be on the test.
