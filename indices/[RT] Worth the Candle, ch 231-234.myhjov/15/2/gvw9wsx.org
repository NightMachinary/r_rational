  But I am curious why Mary herself had to risk all her forty selves to do this in person.

If Mary becomes one of the few people who has returned to life, it would likely afford her a great deal of political power. If you're a friend and she asks you to do something which might get you killed, you'd probably be much more willing to trust that she can bring you back. If you're a rival, you're probably going to think there's much less of a point in trying to kill her when she's already risen from the dead once. You might as well join her since you probably can't beat her.
