I absolutely loved this.But I'm really curious how this raid was done.Fenn makes sense, as retrieving her means another companion -> firepower.\\
But I am curious why Mary herself had to risk all her forty selves to do this in person.\\
She doesn't have the resources of the Empire at her disposal?

  A few of the tuung loyalists volunteered for descent, if it was needed, and the infernoscopes are being monitored. Amaryllis has chosen to go alone once she arrives in Omega, with Raven as her backup in case things go wrong.

In three year's time I would have guessed, that she'd control everything.\\
But this means... Esuen led a counterrevolutionary Tuung rebellion?\\
That's so awesome!\\
I always felt, that how she was handled, outmaneuvered and done dirty would need to have consequences.\\
I hope it's something like that. And not Mary making a narrative choice.

Not that this would be stupid for her to do, just that I think overly narrative-based decisions, even when ration always feel a little cheap to me.\\
Like Aerb is just the stage for Joon drama, instead of a rich and vibrant world.
