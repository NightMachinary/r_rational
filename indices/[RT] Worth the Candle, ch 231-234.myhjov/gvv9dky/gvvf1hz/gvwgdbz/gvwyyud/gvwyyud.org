On the other hand, the good guys have constant surveillance and a constant threat of immediate execution. It gives them a lot more leverage than they had at the beginning of the DFEZ.

Have 10 demons lined up in a room, execute one of them to show you're serious, tell them they'll die if they don't obey orders, give them orders they'll inevitably refuse, kill a few of them to drive the lesson home.

Send them out to capture more recruits, rince and repeat.
