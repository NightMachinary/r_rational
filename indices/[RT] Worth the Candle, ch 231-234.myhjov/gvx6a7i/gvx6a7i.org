Val's tendrils can go to hell and there is now a portal from hell to Aerb. Do we know what kind of eldritch horror is she? Can her tendrils go through that portal and dismantle Fel Seed?

Secondly, Fenn being back means more elves. And her companion quest. We're going to Celestar next, because the entity above the Fel Seed is not the DM, it's that huge Celestar gun. Pew, void beast is dead. Pew, Fel Seed is gone and door opened by Overwhelming Violence.

Finally, it is possible to convince Fel Seed that there's entity above him and it's very simple - all Juniper needs to do is to wish for a hot dog, since he still has like 96 of his hot dog wishes. Fel Seed will certainly be surprised that a hot dog appeared ex nihilo in the centre of his domain and can then be convinced of DM existence above Aerb.
