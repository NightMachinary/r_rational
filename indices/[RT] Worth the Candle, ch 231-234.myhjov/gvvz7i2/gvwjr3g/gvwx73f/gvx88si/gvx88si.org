I'd paused when that happened, too.

In-story, it appeared too good to be true, in a setting where stuff too good to be true is practically guaranteed to be a lie calculated to produce maximum suffering. The timing felt off (I didn't understand why Fenn appeared when she did, I hadn't guessed at the 3-year Fel Seed bottled time skip). Narratively, I assumed that he'd have lots more time to either acclimate as a hermit hidden away in an upper hell or to become a broken, kept mortal with no hope of escape.

My hypothesis was that the infernals had somehow messed with his perception of time, and had introduced Fenn and subsequently Amaryllis after breaking them both, in an attempt to produce maximum suffering. "Convince Juniper you're here with a grand rescue plan or we'll resume another subjective century of torture" would be indistinguishable from everything we already saw. But, of course, keyrings wouldn't help if the target was not an imitation but the actual person, fully turned against you.
