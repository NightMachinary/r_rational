in order for a p-zombie to effectively blend in with real humans, there must be someone or something smart and perceptive enough to write out a list of most possible situations the zombie will encounter and a list of responses the p-zombie must make for each one. but to actually write out those lists requires having a map of a hypothetical person to imitate in the first place. the intelligence writing those lists would need to visualize that hypothetical person in enough detail to actually write those lists in sufficient detail to fool real humans.

for all "you" "know", "you" could be a p-zombie without "realizing" it. the only way to "know" would be to find "yourself" in a very particular niche situation where you "know" for a fact that you would have a "mental", "emotional", or behavioral response to it if you were "thinking" "feeling" and acting like "yourself", but instead "you" have no response at all. and then "you" would need to "notice" that, assuming that "noticing" it is even a response on "your" list of responses to begin with.

if "you" do "notice" it, "you" may also have a response on "your" response list which says to say the following sentence or a paraphrased version of it, whether or not anyone is around to hear it: "that means there was a situation which this zombie encountered which its list of situations did not include, or which its list of responses did not include a response for."

+p-zombies aren't merely nonexistent, the very concept of a p-zombie is incoherent.+
