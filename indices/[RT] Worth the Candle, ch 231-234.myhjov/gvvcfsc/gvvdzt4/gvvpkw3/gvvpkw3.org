The only reason I can't understand the DM being Juniper is the fact that I can't see "our" Juniper creating this Hell called Aerb and sentencing millions upon millions of beings to eternal torture for any reason. Now if we say that most if not all the "beings" on Aerb are p-zombies then I suppose it's not as bad. But at the very least if the DM is Juniper then he is clearly from some alternate timeline or universe where I guess he became a sick twisted fuck on a cosmic scale.
