I don't know. This batch actually took me the other way, so that I think that's now /less/ than a 50/50 shot. And that was from a prior of >80% certainty that DM=Juniper.

Joon loved Arthur so much that losing him *broke* him. I don't think any version of Joon, especially not some future version of Joon that has gained DM powers, would do what the DM did to him.

I suppose it could all be "DiceGuy was playing the thematically appropriate role of the contemptuous DM" as [[/u/tjhance][u/tjhance]] suggested, but if the DM is being honest... No, I think the DM is someone else. I still have to sort it out (best current guess for not-Juniper DM is "one of the other Earth gamers," with an off-the-top-of-my-head ordering of Arthur, Reimer, Craig, Tiff, Maggie, and Tom, from most to least likely).
