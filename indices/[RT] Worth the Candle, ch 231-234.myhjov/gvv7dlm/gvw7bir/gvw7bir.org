  Also, was anyone else surprised at how much of a nonissue the hells were? There was still danger and drama and such in these chapters, but the "I'm in hell, what do I do now" bit didn't last long at all. I was expecting a long arc of Juniper struggling to survive in the hells and eventually finding his own solution, not for Amaryllis to just show up and go "shut up, here's the plan."

Well, having a /schloss/ be a big, borderline meta-textual, part of the solution makes sense at that level. If the rescue operation is only possible through /deus ex machina/ then using the in-world mechanisms for creating /deus ex machina/ is sound strategy.
