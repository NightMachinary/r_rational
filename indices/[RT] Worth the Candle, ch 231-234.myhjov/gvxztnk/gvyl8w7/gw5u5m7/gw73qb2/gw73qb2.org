Was going for a "counterfactual conditional" without the "if". Might be German-influenced and idiosyncratic (and wrong!) grammar.But for all I know, it might be legal, but I just can't find the rule.

Meant to say something like:"Selbst wenn Val tot wäre...", but to cite the wiki:

​

"[in English] the subjunctive is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax][syntactic]] rather than [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflection][inflectional]], since there is no specifically subjunctive verb form."

​

It's all a bit over my head, tbh:

​

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_subjunctive]][[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterfactual_conditional]]

​

Edit: Apparently, Google translates "Selbst wenn Val tot wäre" with "Even if Val were dead", but that sounds off to me for a hypothethical, instead of an unknown. Oh well, I might just be wrong.
