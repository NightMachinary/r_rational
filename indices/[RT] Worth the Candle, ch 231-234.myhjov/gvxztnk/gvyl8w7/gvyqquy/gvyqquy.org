  The regeneration would be quite a boon.

Excellent point.

  you can't teleport to the infinite library iirc
#+end_quote

I don't remember, but it makes sense to me; after all the Infinite Library resets every time someone enters or leaves. So the "place" in your worldline doesn't exist anymore.

  Probably not Celestar either
#+end_quote

Is Celestar really another realm? I mean, Joon literally flew there. But you must be right, because otherwise it would have been trivial to pick up the gold left there by the gold bug.

I imagine Mary can't teleport to p-space either.
