Previously, on WtC Chapter 175:

Juniper looked into the spirit of Speculator Masters and found a construct made by Uther that let him see the Outer Reaches, a plane of abstract ideas. The denizens of the Outer Reaches are able to retroactively instantiate modules of content on Aerb. Uther called those modules "schloss", German for castle, in honor of the story of a dude who woke up one day and apparently had been living next to a castle his whole life and never noticed it.

So what Lisi is getting at is that Mary created a way back from the hells into Aerb by retroactively making it so that way back to Aerb had always existed.

This also tells us something about the limits of magic in the Outer Reaches, since if Mary had her way, I doubt she'd have intentionally created a way back to Aerb that required human sacrifice. So it's probably something like, you can only retroactively create stuff in the flavor of what's already there.

EDIT: Outer Reaches, not Other Side.
