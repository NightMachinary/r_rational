Yeah. Personally, I thought it was a shape-changing devil come to try and give false hope/extract information, because Fenn had mentioned Amaryllis' name shortly before the demon left. I guess that doesn't necessarily make sense if the demon he was talking to was being truthful? But I still don't see why Joon would have not even checked.

E: Oh, OK, it's explained literally at the start of the chapter. Clearly not paying enough attention.
