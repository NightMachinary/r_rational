I'm mildly disappointed that no one used Face Protocols. I would be happy to see Amaryllis too, but surely Joon is smart enough not to just shrug and say "I don't know about shapeshifting infernals or hell-entads, so they must not exist."

Maybe paranoia and strings of arbitrary words make for tedious storytelling and the omission is on aesthetic grounds, but it feels like an oversight unless this is all a trick to get Joon to the Omega Hell.
