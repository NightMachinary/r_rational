  I think you lose your blade-bound ranks when you lose your sword.

I don't think there's /any/ evidence of this. You keep your ranks, especially your stats and Parry / One-Handed / Two-handed skill levels that you needed to become a Blade-bound (Onion would be a monster with those alone)\\
You just can't use a lot of the Blade-bound-specific perks like infinitely sharp swords until you bind another weapon.

Onion with a stick and some time to meditate and bind it should theoretically be as powerful as Onion with any other non-Entad sword.
