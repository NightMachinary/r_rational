Grak mentions that they can teleport to Fel Seed because it is now in their worldline. This got me thinking... Can they teleport to the hells too? I don't know /why/ they'd want to, and entads don't work there, so they would have a hard time going back. Still, this is probably something no one was ever able to try.
