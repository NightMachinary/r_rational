Nah, Joon lost 3 years between being beheaded and the start of this batch. Mary et al being unable to locate Joon in the hells + the 3-ish year time limit on souls decomposing spurred them to rune anti-matter nuke the FSEZ thus sending Joon to the hells whether he was bottled or still alive somewhere being held by Fel Seed.

We don't know if Fel Seed bottled Joon, kept him alive but unconscious, kept him alive but memory wiped him, or what, but the events outlined are that Mary's WMD got Joon unstuck and in the hells, a move they knowingly risked and got Rune Magic excluded for.

But certainly it's still unclear what exactly happened immediately following the beheading.
