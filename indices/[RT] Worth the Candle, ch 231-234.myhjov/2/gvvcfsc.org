I was not expecting that meeting with the Dungeon master. The claim that he couldn't have met with Juniper without the Helldiver setting enabled is an interesting detail. The postmortem of how the DM misunderstood Arthur and how Arthur /rejected/ the call to adventure was quite compelling. I was surprised to hear the DM speak so openly of his hatred.

Infernal negotiations take a backseat to a reunion of sorts, even if a (lack of subjective) time hasn't cured any wounds in the interim. It seems appropriate to the characters involved.

Ah, so Juniper /was/ bottled by Fel Seed. Curious. Certainly very genre-savvy. Or perhaps he had some use for Juniper's soul? But the soul magic exclusion would prevent most of those...\\
Maybe the Fel Seed entity read /Degenerate Cycles/?

I find myself curious about the failed ways to extract someone from the hells. The rune magic exclusion (I'd found the possibility troubling) was from the (non-void !?) antimatter bomb. The actual soul retrieval method might not have itself been exclusion-worthy.
