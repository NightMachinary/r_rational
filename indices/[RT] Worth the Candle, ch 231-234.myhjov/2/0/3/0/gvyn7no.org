Why would they be p-zombies?\\
Just fake all the infernoscope feeds, noone is ever escaping the hells and it's not like you can count all the 9 trillion demons. That's what I'd consider ethical game design, anyway. Had I no ethics, then I'd still do it for efficient game design. Really, given the backend portal having Schlossvolk influence, that's probably their job. To make the illusion so damn good, that everyone thinks, the hells are real. Procedurally generate and retcon on the fly.

If I was to be a player in the game, I'd also totally manipulate my internal processes, so that whenever I consider the illusion, I'll not find it convincing.\\
That's all gonna be in the sequel "We are selling so many candles! Fuck yeah!", though. It focusses on VR game design, corporate politics and the societal ramifications of readily available hyperstimuli.

[probably won't be written in this branch of the multiverse with this version of Alexander Wales, but it's definitely in p-space somewhere!]
