Yeah, they might be impossible. It's a hotly debated topic. I think you're begging the question, though, but I might be, too.

The metaphysical possibility of p-zombies implies that qualia is distinct from the physical world. I think that part is mostly agreed on, it's just their possibility that's in question. They're used as an argument against physicalism, and, if I understand you correctly, your argument is essentially 'physicalism is true, therefore p-zombies are impossible'. I only agree with the logic, not with the premise.

Qualia is not just sensations or feelings of the brain, which are both purely functional concepts. I know it's a common objection to p-zombies, but I don't understand how anyone can make that statement. Makes me wonder if people who say so are p-zombies. (Just kidding - I don't believe they're physically possible.)

Maybe it's simply too depressing a possibility to consider? If it's true that qualia is non-physical, the most likely explanation seems to be that it's generated by certain physical processes as a byproduct, since it apparently holds no causative power. That means that, if one identifies with their qualia, like most probably do, one is nothing more than some kind of completely passive, internal movie, strung along by one's body like a puppet.
