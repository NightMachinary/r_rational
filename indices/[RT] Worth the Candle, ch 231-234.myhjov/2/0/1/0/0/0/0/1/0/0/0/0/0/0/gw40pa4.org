and im saying you cant have one without the other.

also when physicists talk about physical laws to me it sounds like a map-territory confusion. like "our mental math models (which are a form of thought) have gotten so good at predicting how the universe behaves that it must mean the universe is obeying a mental math model aka one of those equations we call "universal laws of nature".

yet every time we become able to put more energy/effort/technological advancement/thinking power into our investigations, we uncover more details, we find mismatches between our thoughts and reality. every time. and i dont think well ever reach the "end" of that process no matter how many times we iterate it. as the number of iterations approaches infinity, the number of new mysteries we can uncover and explore also approaches infinity, not 1.

the very idea of a universal law of nature that is always the same everywhere and never changes, well that is a mental model, a /thought,/ which puts hash marks on reality to make it easier to measure, and then says those hash marks are a deep fundamental aspect of reality rather than merely guideposts we placed to make it easier to compress the reality we observe into a form that fits in our minds.
