Yeah, I agree about Reimer, especially since the Reimer expy ended up with another Penndraig. The big reason that I put Arthur first was because (according to the DM) Aerb was made, by the DM, for Arthur. And I think that's something someone would do for themselves or someone else they really liked, and I didn't get the sense that Reimer was that close to Arthur. That one piece of information is being weighted very heavily in my contemplation of this mystery, and that weighting pushes Arthur past Reimer.
