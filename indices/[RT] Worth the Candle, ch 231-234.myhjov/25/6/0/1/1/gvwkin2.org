For 400 to be the "center," what that means is there is an equal amount of probability mass either side of 400, so 400 is the EV. There is absolutely nothing that prevents such a distribution from existing, although you are right that it can't be symmetrical if people are known to have gone down at least 1000 after one death.

It would likely look something like the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution][orange beta distribution]] in the diagram there (a=2 B=5).
