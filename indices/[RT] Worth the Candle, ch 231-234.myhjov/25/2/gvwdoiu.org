ch. 231

There is a repeated comparison of how cold yellow-fall is in comparison to snow. First in this sentence:

#+begin_quote
  I'd landed in something like snow, except it was slightly yellow, clumped up without being wet, and wasn't nearly as cold
#+end_quote

and then a handful of sentences later say:

#+begin_quote
  It was cold, but not as cold as snow.
#+end_quote
