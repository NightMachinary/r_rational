  “What was Fel Seed's weakness?” I asked.

  “There's an entity that exists above him,” replied the Dungeon Master. He pointed to himself. “But you already knew that.” He had already heard my prayers on the matter.

  “So all I had to do was convince you to let us through?” I asked. “Convince you that he shouldn't have killed us? That it wasn't fun or entertaining?”

  “Maybe,” he shrugged. “What would have convinced you, when you were the DM?”

  “At the time, nothing,” I replied. “Except maybe if the characters had been thinking, feeling creatures, not just avatars.”

  “That didn't stop you from doing your best to inflict harm on the players,”

I take this as semi confirming the theory from the comments on the last chapter that the point of the Fell Seed encounter was that Juniper should realise that the out of game considerations should take precedence and if the game isn't fun it should stop. Though the DM stops short of confirming it. Sounds a bit like the DM, like Juniper in the original incident, didn't actually have a plan for how it would all end, so he's saying that maybe he could have been convinced, but that it wasn't what he had been planning?
