Thoughts

- it was fun to see so many chekhov guns go off! AW must have fun writing these chapters
- hell-a-copter was a real delight, not to mention doom sun, chaos moon, yellow-fall
- we could call that he'd seen Fenn from a mile away, but it was still great
- It was surprisingly fun to see Lisi! Didn't know she had it in her to do something badass like this.
- Tension was really high, first from the chilly meeting with the DM, then the frantic tension from Mary showing up and the slow reveals of all the bad shit going down

I have to wonder why DiceGuy acted the way he did. He seemed so /final/ - but at this point, the party's plan for hell extraction was already underway. Was he just lying? It all seemed just /off/, and I have some crack theories about DiceGuy not being as in-control or all-knowing as he seems, but it might just be that DiceGuy was playing the thematically appropriate role of the contemptuous DM.
