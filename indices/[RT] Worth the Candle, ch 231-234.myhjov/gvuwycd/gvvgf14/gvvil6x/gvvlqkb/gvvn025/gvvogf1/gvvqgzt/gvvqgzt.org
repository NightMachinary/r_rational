Different guy here, but I think I'm getting what you're saying. 400 can't be the peak in a standard distribution with a start point of 1 and end point of 1000, because 500 is the middle and standard distributions have equal probabilities for each bin on each side.

I can see where you're getting the 799 from, but I don't remember enough math to recall whether standard distributions had to have defined upper and lower bounds.

I mean, couldn't the bin for [Down 1 Hell] and [Down 800-8999 Hells] have equal probabilities of occurring and still be considered a standard distribution? It would shift the mean, sure, but it should still be standard, no? The range of the numbers don't matter, just the probability of a value in a population falling within them?

Is there another mathematical term you feel would be more suited to describe this distribution of probabilities?
