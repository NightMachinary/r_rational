Edit, I think I'm mistaken in thinking you were incorrect, thinking about rolling two dice, due to the fact that 2 + 4 = 6 and 3 + 3 = 6. Even though every combination of dice rolls has the same probability of occurring--e.g. rolling a 2 and a 4 in that order is just as likely as rolling a 3 and a 3--by viewing their sum, the summed outcomes have different probabilities. There are more pairs of dice rolls that equal six than equal two, for instance. So scratch my prior thought to the contrary.
