  “You go right, *I go left*?” I asked Fenn, looking at the two demons still standing on top of the hill. They could probably feel my pain, which was like ecstasy to them.

  “Yeah,” said Fenn.

  The demons descended down from the hill, moving slowly. They were wearing large cloaks that partially obscured their forms, but I could see large *clawed feet beneath the one on the left*, and something more like *a chicken leg from the one that I was going to be after*. I had never fought a bird before.

Juniper's going left, but he's going after the chicken-leg one, while the clawed one is on the left. I'm confused which demon is on which side.

  “There are people who live here, Juniper,” said Lisi. “Even before the rune magic exclusion, which is now --- I don't know, two days old? But now that it's happened, now that we made it happen by trying some things that weren't meant to be tried, there are three people dying every second, and they're coming here, or places that aren't all that much better.

Missing close quote at the end.
