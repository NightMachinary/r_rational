The memory wipe is presumably part of being reset back to being a baby - the method used just unwinds everything life has done to you, including all your experiences - which makes it ego death, of course, but that is no different from bottling.

Presumably the original conspiracy just raised the new Dahlia with a fiction that she was the sole heir of the previous one, and rode the coat tails of being the step parents of the entad hoard holder, and this conspiracy fell victim to Anglecyn intriques sometime between last reset and start of the plot.
