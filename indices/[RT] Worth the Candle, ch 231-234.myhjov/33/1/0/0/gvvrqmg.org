Exclusions are a random zone which sometimes follows natural boundaries or a geometric shape, of random size, which are centered on a random point such that the site of the exclusionary event lies within the zone. It's not explicitly stated if an EZ is created on the location of a calamity vs the origin of calamitous magic, but the latter makes more sense given that exclusions are sometimes non-calamitous ("silent" exclusions); the RMEZ could be centered on the rune forge where the bomb was created, for example. It could also be a zone that only intersects some part of the blast zone, but leaves out the center of the FSEZ where the door to the Long Stairs is.
