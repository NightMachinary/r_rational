Right, the worldbuilding doc breaks full exclusions out as a distinct category. I wouldn't count the note of relative indistinguishability as "heavily implied", and feel like the assumption that all exclusions have a zone somewhere in the world is an unwarranted one. (Certainly not worth the weight it gets in fan speculation.)
