You seem pretty confident making that statement. Wouldn't we need to know the answer to the hard problem of consciousness to say that? (I'm counting 'there is no problem' as a solution, here.) To my knowledge, nothing definitive has been discovered.

Even if you accepted that there was no problem, you still would need to prove that /any/ system that can give rise to /apparent/ sapience would also give rise to qualia to say that the simulations Joon interacts with are not p-zombies, no?
