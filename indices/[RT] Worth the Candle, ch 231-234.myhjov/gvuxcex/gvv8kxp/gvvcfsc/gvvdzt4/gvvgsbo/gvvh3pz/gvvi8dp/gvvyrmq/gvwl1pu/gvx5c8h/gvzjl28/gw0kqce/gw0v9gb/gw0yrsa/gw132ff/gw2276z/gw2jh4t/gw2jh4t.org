It's incredibly difficult to give a precise definition of 'physical,' but it's roughly 'matter, energy, the laws that govern it, and everything that supervenes on (follows from) it,' plus whatever other processes in the purview of physics there are or that we might find in the future, but that makes the definition a bit circular.

Physicalism is the belief that there is nothing beyond the physical, which I used to ascribe to. Now, the hard problem of consciousness makes me uncertain.

P-zombies don't actually have anything to do with character traits, or mind vs. soul stuff, or anything esoteric. They're functionally sentient, functionally conscious, have feelings like love and anger, and have a soul, if that's what you would like to call the structures in the brain that give rise to personality. The only thing they lack is qualia: the personal, subjective experience of those functional aspects of neurophysiological processes. It's arguable whether that would make them a non-person.

(One of the problems with talking about these things is that most terms we use are loaded with a dual meaning: consciousness, sentience, feelings, emotions etc. can all refer to the functional, physical aspect that can be completely explained with science - what part of the brain effects them, what behaviour do they cause, how do they influence the rest of the brain, etc - or they can refer to the completely subjective 'what-it's-likeness' to experience them, to the qualia they relate to. P-zombies only lack the second.)
