I don't really understand your argument. Are you saying mapping out a person would necessarily generate qualia?

It's impossible to be a p-zombie without realizing it. If you have qualia, you're not. The whole point of p-zombies is that they're physically indistinguishable from beings with qualia. It's impossible by definition to disprove someone is not a p-zombie with physical means - if it is, they're something else.
