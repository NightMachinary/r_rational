religious leaders make the same mistake physicists make but with their feelings and intuitions rather than thoughts. they notice that their feelings and intuitions are really good at helping them effectively interact with the world around them in general including other people. so they assume the world must be made of the same stuff, that reality must have feelings and intuitions. they therefore conclude that reality itself is sentient, that it has a soul and they call it God.

but reality as a whole is NOT a person. it doesnt have feelings or intuitions, just like it doesnt have thoughts. thoughts feelings and intuitions are reflections, echoes or impressions of the reality they exist in by their very nature.

so when religious people talk about gods, of the very essence of the universe itself in general as a sentient being, theyre mixing up the mirror and the thing it reflects.

likewise, when physicists talk about the universe always 100% obeying a set of universal laws all the time regardless of circumstance and /just not knowing what those laws are yet/, I hear the equivalent of "the lord works in mysterious ways". theyre mixing up the map and the territory.

how could we know these always true universal laws exist if weve never seen them?

now do you understand what i meant when i said, "define physical"?
