  How would you test if someone is a p-zombie if they are physically indistinguishable from a normal person? How would you ever know if p-zombies exist? How would you ever come up with an explanation for how p-zombies work, if there is no physical explanation nor anyway to behaviorally distinguish between people and p-zombies?

It's impossible, but that's the point of the thought experiment. Because p-zombies are /logically/ possible, it follows that there is an insurmountable gap between explaining the physical (which includes the functional components of consciousness) and qualia (subjective experience).

Chalmer's book is probably the best source if you want to read up on the precise reasoning. Keep in mind that there are some steps in the chain of logic that people disagree with. Personally, I find that any argument that stems from logical possibility very odd, but I'm not a philosopher.

I doubt anyone reasonable seriously considers the actual existence of p-zombies, but the fact that, even with a perfect understanding of the physical world, it's impossible to prove someone else is not a p-zombie is what's so interesting about them.

I agree with your second point, like I mentioned.
