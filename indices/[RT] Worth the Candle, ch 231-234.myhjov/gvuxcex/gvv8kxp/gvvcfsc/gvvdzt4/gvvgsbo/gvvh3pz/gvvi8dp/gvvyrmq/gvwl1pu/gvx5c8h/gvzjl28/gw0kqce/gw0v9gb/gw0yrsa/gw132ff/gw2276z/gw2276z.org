define "physical". as I see it, the mechanistic and fluid facets of a personality are just their mind and soul. mechanistic processes are what the mind sees because it tends to specialize more in hard skills like analysis, organization and logic. the soul sees fluid essences instead because it tends to specialize more in soft skills like imagination, intuition and empathy.

in a lot of ways the mind and the soul are just two different facets or angles/lenses for viewing the same thing. a more mentally oriented person is more likely to see themself as a physical, mechanistic process, something their brain does. A more spiritually inclined person is more likely to see themself as a spiritual, fluid process, and their brain as merely a container for it.

but there is no real meaningful/functional difference between those two views except for the format/manner in which they're expressed, and what aspects of the subject matter are emphasized more. i was talking in more mechanistic language because most rational fiction readers are more mentally-oriented rather than spiritually inclined.

i suppose if someone's right brain was removed theyd become a mind without a soul, assuming that didn't just kill them. a human being kinda needs both to survive imo. but if they do survive the loss of their right brain they probably are young enough to have enough neuroplasticity that their remaining half a brain takes over the roles/functions of the half that was removed.

still not the same thing as a non-conscious non-person mimicking sentience. even the coldest and most emotionally flat people still have some feeling in them. and if their soul is that underdeveloped they probably developed their mind a lot more.
