Yeah I can see how it can be read wrong since these chapters are specifically about hell, you're right that I meant the whole of Aerb though. Obviously the hells in Aerb are terrible, but the whole of Aerb itself is just filled with horrific realities and beings that can not be beaten. So unless there is a point to the DM having created this would besides putting Juniper into it then it just seems cruel even compared to how cruel our own reality can be a times.
