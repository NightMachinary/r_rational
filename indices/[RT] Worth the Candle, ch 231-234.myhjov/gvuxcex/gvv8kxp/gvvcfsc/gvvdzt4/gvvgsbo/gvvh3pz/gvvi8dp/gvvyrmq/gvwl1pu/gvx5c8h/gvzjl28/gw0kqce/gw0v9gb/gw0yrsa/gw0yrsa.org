p-zombies are impossible by definition too, if it looks like a human, talks like a human, and acts like a human in every possible situation, then it's a human. without either having qualia or having a sufficiently detailed and sophisticated model of qualia, your "zombie" can't imitate humans well enough to blend in with them let alone act like a human in most situations.

qualia are just sensations/feelings, which is something the brain does.

the essential "domains" of the human psyche loosely match up to functional brain anatomy:

Mind= left brain aka the more logical and analytical part

Soul = right brain aka the more emotional part of you which tends to be more involved in music and art etc.

Vision = back brain aka the part of you which "absorbs signals from sensory stimuli" which is another way of saying "sensation" or "qualia".

Will = front brain aka the motor cortex aka the part of you which outputs actions.

the very concept of p-zombies is incoherent.
