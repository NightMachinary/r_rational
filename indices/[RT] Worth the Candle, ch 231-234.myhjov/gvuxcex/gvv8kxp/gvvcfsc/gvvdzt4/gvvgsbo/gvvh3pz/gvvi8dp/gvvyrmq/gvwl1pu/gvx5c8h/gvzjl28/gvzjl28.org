How would you test if someone is a p-zombie if they are physically indistinguishable from a normal person? How would you ever know if p-zombies exist?

P-zombies are not a real thing, nor do I think it's meaningful to talk as if they are.

This whole AI simulating a person thing isn't even a question about p-zombies. There are other potential avenues to produce realistic (seeming) Human simulations that are not p-zombies, nor sentient beings. In other words, you just need to fool Joon
