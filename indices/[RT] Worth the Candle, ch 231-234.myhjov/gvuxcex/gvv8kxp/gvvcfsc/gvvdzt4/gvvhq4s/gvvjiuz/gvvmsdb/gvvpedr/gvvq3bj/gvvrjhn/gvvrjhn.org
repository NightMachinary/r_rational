It is very unclear! Joon had a perk called Dead Man's Switch:

#+begin_quote
  â—» Dead-man's Switch

  If you would suffer a fate worse than death, you die instead.
#+end_quote

It seems like between that perk and the Helldiver option, Joon was designed to go to hell upon death, bypassing torture or bottling or anything that would have prevented a trip to hell.

But yeah, I'm leaning towards your explanation, especially after reading some other comments.

Joon was in stasis, for some reason, until he was sent to hell via WMD. I don't think we'll get the "some reason" defined, but I'm still curious as to what happened there.
