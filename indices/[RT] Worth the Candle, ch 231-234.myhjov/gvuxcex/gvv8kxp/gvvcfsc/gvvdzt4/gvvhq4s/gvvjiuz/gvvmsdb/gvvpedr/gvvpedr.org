I'm a little confused as well. Is there a time dilation effect between the hells and Aerb that has been previously unmentioned; or was Joon game over'ed, bottled by Fel Seed, and nuked into hell by Mary for the 3yr time difference? Or maybe the dilation occurred during the DM conversation for some inscrutable reason?
