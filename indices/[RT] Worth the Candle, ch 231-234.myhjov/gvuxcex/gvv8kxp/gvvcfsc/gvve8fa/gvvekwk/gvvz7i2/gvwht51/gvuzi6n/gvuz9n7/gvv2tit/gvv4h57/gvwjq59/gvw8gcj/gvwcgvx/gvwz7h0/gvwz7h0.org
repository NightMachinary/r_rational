I had the same reaction, but regarding Fenn. Like, come on! That was a perfect occasion to have Feen and Joon make up for lost time, bond over shared hardships, etc. Instead Mary immediately shows up, separates them, and gives them instructions.

(Also having Joon and Fenn go doomslayer on the hells for a while would have been great)
