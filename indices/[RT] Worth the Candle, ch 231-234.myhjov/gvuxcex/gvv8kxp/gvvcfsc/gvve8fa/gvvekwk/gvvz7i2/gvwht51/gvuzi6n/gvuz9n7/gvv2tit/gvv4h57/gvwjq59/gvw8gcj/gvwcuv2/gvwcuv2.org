I mean, that's author fiat. If AW wanted to write some cool action-y stuff, there's a million things he could have done. Like had the DM let him keep one of his magic powers as a "final boon", for example.

And again, I'm not saying I wanted Joon to roll over everything and become the new king of hell, not at all. 5 minutes of doom guy cosplay would have beeen just fine with me.
