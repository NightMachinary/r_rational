Is there anyone other than Amaryllis who could show up, tell Juniper, "I don't have time to explain, kill yourself 20 times and go to Omega Hell, the worst place in the universe, it'll be fine" and have Juniper agree?

Maybe any of the companions would have done, but if you want the job done right, do it yourself. This mission is the difference between Aerb being eaten by the Void Beast and potentially reaching the Good Outcome, and we've already established that Amaryllis would make any sacrifice to get a Good Outcome instead of a bad one. Given the importance of the mission, and the fact that staying on Aerb would be ruling a doomed land, I can't imagine Amaryllis doing anything other than handling it herself.
