Wait, I'm a little confused about the infernal plot, correct me if I'm wrong. June dies, Mary spends 3 years searching for him with Val continuing to kill infernals slowly to look for evidence of him. This slow killing unifies the Hells though against what specifically, they don't know. They don't know why their being killed, only that their being killed. During this cold war, they make plans to hit back at Aerb to destroy this weapon and are questioning every mortal to find out what this weapon is. Mary eventually bombs Flesh City and this somehow tells them that someone with a connection to the weapon died there?? Within the space of that day, the information spreads to the entirety of Hell and they now know about Val.

Why are the infernals even fighting back? Aren't they notoriously selfish? And since Val can kill literally the most powerful of them as easily as the weakest, there'd be no leadership, just the vague banner of defiance to rally around. If they just give Mary and June what they want, they get to exist; refuse, and oblivion, wouldn't most make the same choice as the interrogator?

The idea of trees that tortursynthesize on nausea is demented and very interesting.

Why would Fel Seed bother bottling June?

Do dragons go to Hell? Would they be a delicacy or would they be too much trouble to bother torturing?

I know there was a 3 year gap but from a story perspective it still seemed like the Hells were a cakewalk. In and out, 5 minute adventure. For something that was hyped as flatly impossible, that's a little disappointing.

Also, it's interesting to note but 60 chapters ago, Raven mentions they got the warning that the schlossvolk had begun interfering again; I wonder if Hell to Aerb portal was the change they made. The schlossvolk kinda seem like the answer to a lot of the intractable problems. No way to do something? Schloss! Now there is! They are straight up reality warpers and if they could just be friendjitsu'd onto Junes team...
