Ah, I see what you meant. I did not consider a cap on jump length of 799 to be a problem in the first place. It's actually more fitting in a video game. You can't just skip to the "Boss" hell, need to slog through some thrash hells before that.

That said, Mary's statement can still work with a clipped curve, for example, if fall depth of 800 is outside of 3SD interval. That way the mean depth and the peak will be different, but /roughly/ the same, and the average number of jumps would not change because it's an integer.
