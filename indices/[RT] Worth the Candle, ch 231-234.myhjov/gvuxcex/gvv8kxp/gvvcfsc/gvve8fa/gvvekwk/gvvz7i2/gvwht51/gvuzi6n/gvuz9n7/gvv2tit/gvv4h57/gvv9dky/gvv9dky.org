Re first and second chapters:

Hells are just as creatively awful as we were promised, and this is supposed to be one of the nicer ones. Reminds me a bit of the hells in Iain M Banks Surface Detail. It's easy for descriptions of hell to become uninteresting as pain as an end in itself is monotonous, but details keep it concrete

Fenn being back is cool. I'd forgotten how snarky she was. And her dislike of Juniper at the point she died. Opportunity maybe to demonstrate a bit of his character development in dealing with her. The summary of all the insane things that happened in the relatively short time since she died was funny as well.

I hadn't been anticipating them at they'd be able to use the threat of Valencia to gain leverage in the hells, but it makes sense given the infernals have organised to deal with it, and the prospect of genuine death would be terrifying to them. Would be interesting to get some insight into the psychology of the infernals themselves, their design makes them pitiable and tragic in their own way. Possibly that they'd welcome the change given the option.
