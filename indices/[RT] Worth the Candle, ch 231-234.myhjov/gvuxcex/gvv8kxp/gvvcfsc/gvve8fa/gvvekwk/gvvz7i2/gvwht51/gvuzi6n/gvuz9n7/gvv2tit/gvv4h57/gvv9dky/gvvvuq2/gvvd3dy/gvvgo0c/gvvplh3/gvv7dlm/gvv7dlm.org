I'm glad to see Fenn again. I figured it would be a possibility, but I was still surprised by how quickly and casually it happened. It was great reading her reactions to all the wild shit that happened after she died, and I'm glad that she was still sort of bitter and angry at Juniper over their break up. Not that I want her to be bitter and angry, but it just makes her feel more... normal. Real. Like she's a character with her own agency instead of just a potential love interest for Juniper.

Also, was anyone else surprised at how much of a nonissue the hells were? There was still danger and drama and such in these chapters, but the "I'm in hell, what do I do now" bit didn't last long at all. I was expecting a long arc of Juniper struggling to survive in the hells and eventually finding his own solution, not for Amaryllis to just show up and go "shut up, here's the plan."
