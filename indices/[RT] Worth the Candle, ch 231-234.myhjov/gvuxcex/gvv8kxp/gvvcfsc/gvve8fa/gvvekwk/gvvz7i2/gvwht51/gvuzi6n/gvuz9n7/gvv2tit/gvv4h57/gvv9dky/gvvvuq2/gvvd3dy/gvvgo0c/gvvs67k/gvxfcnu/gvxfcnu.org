Nearly every Earth and Aerb romantic relationship Juniper has had is somehow linked to Arthur.

Tiff, obviously Arthur liked her on earth. Probably the root of a lot of this stuff.

Amaryllis, looks exactly like Arthur's daughter.

Maddie/Raven, Arthur apparently had some paternalistic feelings for Raven, Juniper acted not completely ethically with Maddie.

Arthur > Bethel > Juniper.

The locus and Fenn are the only two without some clear Arthur baggage. I wonder if when the confrontation inevitably happens if all of this will get hashed out.
