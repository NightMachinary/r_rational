I've read 1.5million words of this story, I know damn well it's not a power fantasy and I love it for what it is, but is living up to the awesome concept of "helldiver" before reality asserts itself really that much to ask?

I'm aware it's a thematic choice, that it's supposed to highlight the sheer hopelessness of the hells if even the Hero can barely fuck up a random mook in the top 1% without getting mangled, but dammit I would have appreciated even a split second of Juniper going ham. Even a paragraph of [[https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/7dHtxlgFeEa0UAes80Ss0i/d6ddd7957c71d4bd76fefd62d4e9cdfe/doom-mobile-hero.jpg?q=70][this]] and then he gets piled on and we go back to themes and subtext and allegories.
