Teaching people that are deeply ingrained to trust no one, and that any positive emotion comes from fighting tooth and nail for it against everyone else, was bought up in the Doris Finch arc and it took one of them reaching the power of a god to feel secure enough to be able to start trying to trust another. Hell pre-dates Doris, and the average impoverished demon won't be willing to trust anyone from Aerb, less so when they're actively attempting to wipe out all demons, and less so again after however many years they spent seeing non-demons as commodities rather than forging a baseline understanding required for any dialogue.
