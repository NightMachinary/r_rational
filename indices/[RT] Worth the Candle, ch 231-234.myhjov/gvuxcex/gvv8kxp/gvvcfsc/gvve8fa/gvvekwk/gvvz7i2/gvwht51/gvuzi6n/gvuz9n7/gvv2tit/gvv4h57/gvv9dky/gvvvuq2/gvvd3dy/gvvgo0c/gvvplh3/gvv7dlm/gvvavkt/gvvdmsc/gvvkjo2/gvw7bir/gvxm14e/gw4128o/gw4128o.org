Worldbuilding had already set it up to be very binary; either they locate him and all the infernals around him die, or they don't and he's subject to the full experience. There's not really an in between where he "scrapes by" in any meaningful way...although the logic applied to the devil in-story COULD have led to some interesting scenario like "let me hide here and we won't kill you + I will suffer a limited amount so you're still coming out significantly ahead of if you hadn't found me".
