The infernals reasonably suspect that the second coming of Arthur might be related to the weapon. They know June died in the Fell Seed exclusion zone and set up a system to quickly respond to his appearance in those three years, which got triggered before the team found him. The bombing would probably start their plans or at least put them on high alert. Once the descent starts, the suspicion is confirmed and they're forced to make their move.

They're fighting back because Val can't actually kill the leaders quickly enough before they unify and invade Aerb. If they don't, she'll eradicate them all eventually. IIRC she has killed them completely at random so far to mask the killings as a potentially natural or at least undirected process, because if she'd start killing just the leaders, the infernals would mobilize too quickly.
