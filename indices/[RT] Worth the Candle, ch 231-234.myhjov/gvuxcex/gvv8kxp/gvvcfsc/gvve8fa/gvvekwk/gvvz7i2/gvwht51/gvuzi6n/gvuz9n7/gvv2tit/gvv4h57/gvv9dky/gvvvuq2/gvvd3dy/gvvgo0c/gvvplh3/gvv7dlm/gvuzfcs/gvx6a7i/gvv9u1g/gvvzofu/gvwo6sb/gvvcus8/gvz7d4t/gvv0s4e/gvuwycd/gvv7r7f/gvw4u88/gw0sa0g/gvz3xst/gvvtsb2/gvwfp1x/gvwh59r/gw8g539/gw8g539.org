The Void Beast seems to eat one plane at a time. Fell Seed has infested at least two planes within his exclusion zone (prime material and ethereal) that we know of. It wouldn't be unreasonable to assume he has equally infested every other plane he could reach which may or may not be “all of them”. The question then becomes what happens to a plane after the Void Beast has eaten it. Does it literally disappear from existence, or is all matter and energy within just voided? Because if it's the second, then unless the Void Beast can eat all of the planes super fast, Fell Seed can just keep “reseeding” them after they've been voided. In fact, given how the VB seems to be attracted to void crystals, FS might be completely safe if he's managed to spread to some remote plane without any crystals and to which no one on Aerb is capable of sending crystals in their Void Beast redirection plan.
