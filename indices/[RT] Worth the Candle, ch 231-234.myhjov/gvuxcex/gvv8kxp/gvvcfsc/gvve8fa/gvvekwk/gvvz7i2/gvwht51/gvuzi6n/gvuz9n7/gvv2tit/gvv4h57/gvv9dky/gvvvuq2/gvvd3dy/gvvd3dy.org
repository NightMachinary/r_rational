Ever since the last update I've been almost constantly hyped up and waiting for what comes next. It's too exciting for me to make theories anymore, i just want to ride the hype train all the way to the end. It almost made me wish I had stopped and waited for the whole thing to finish, but too late for that now.

Final boss, round two, fight!
