Well no one can follow you down there and they've hit all the tourist spots.\\
Even with Val being dead, there might be temporarily safe options among them, assuming they don't automatically die if they visit and can teleport back without the Omega portal. The regeneration would be quite a boon.

But in the game layer, hells are another realm, I think. And you can't teleport to the infinite library iirc. Probably not Celestar either.
