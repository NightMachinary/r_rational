A 3 year time skip, the rune magic exclusion zone, this really feels like the endgame. Really no choice left but to try to beat Fel Seed fast.

I only wish that the hells arc was longer than this (dialogue with only 1 infernal in the whole mini arc...), with some POV chapters of other people too, like Amaryllis. This was competently done, but it seems to me AW wants to end the story, fast.
