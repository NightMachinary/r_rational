I think that any interaction with the infernals as presented is a losing one, it just means being tortured. So a longer arc would probably mean some torture along the way and being more explicit about the horrors of the hells.

I expected something longer, with the game layer active in the hells, but I'm completely fine with it being resolved this quickly and neither Joon nor us having to dwell on the horrors and discomfort down there.
