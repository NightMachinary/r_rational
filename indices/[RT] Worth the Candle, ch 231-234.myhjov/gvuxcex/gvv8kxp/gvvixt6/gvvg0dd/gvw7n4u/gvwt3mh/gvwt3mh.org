I don't think causality as such exists normally.

Don't get me wrong, the Plan had to have been in motion for 3 years for this to make sense.. and that could be the case. But Fel Seed bottling Juniper, really? That's the kind of 180 move you make your villain pull if the party does something to suddenly, if not deserve, open the possibility of victory.

I think the DiceGuy intended it to be final, and but he really really wanted to keep it going just like with Uther, so when Juniper asked him give them a fair 2nd round he retconned the bottling and the rest falls into place easily.
