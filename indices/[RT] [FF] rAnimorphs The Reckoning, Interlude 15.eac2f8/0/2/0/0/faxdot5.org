They bailed on Madagascar as soon as Tobias left, because who knows what would happen if he got captured or coopted or otherwise interrogated. They went to Finland as a group, and Tobias got back in touch with them there after going through an un-shown-in-text reconnection protocol that satisfied Marco's desire for security (initial steps probably involving electronic communication via several layers of proxy). The whole group was in Finland during the Ax chapter; it just didn't come up because that chapter was sort of location-agnostic.

Traveling by plane is also something that I assume he could solve by any number of means, including both stealing and stowing away, and therefore I just decided not to spend screen time on it and leave it up to the reader.
