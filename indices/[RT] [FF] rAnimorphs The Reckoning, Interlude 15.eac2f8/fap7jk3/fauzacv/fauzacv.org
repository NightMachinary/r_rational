The tone of this chapter conveys exactly the kind of effect I was hoping the sharing would have on Tobias. I love how much Maninho's voice /feels/ like Tobias, but after days of being healed by the sharing. (The fact that you can get that across in so few lines of text is definitely one of my top 30 or 40 favorite things about this story.) It occurs to me that the Collaborator model is actually better for the Yeerks' values than the Controller model. Since Tobias's brain is large enough to dominate the bond, Maninho isn't just getting new sensory experiences. He's getting to experience helplessness, trust, compassion (that he's on the receiving end of), and the feeling of human values really seeping into his soul. I bet the Aftran interlude would gone very differently if she'd been a Collaborator shard.

Theory!

From Chapter 50:

  (((Counterpoint: the Yeerks had discovered consenting cooperation through general exposure to humanity; the existence of the Animorphs had been essentially irrelevant to that process---)))

Also from Chapter 50:

#+begin_quote
  “Are there unique properties to the Yeerk-Andalite bond?” we asked. “Are Yeerks more---potent---with an Andalite, than with other species?”

  “Yes.”

  “Reliably?”

  “Yes.”

  “Why?”

  A shrug.

And from Chapter 35:

#+begin_quote
  ‹No,› we broke in---still sharply, but calmer, with less emotion. ‹Not all at once. Not with one brain. *The /human/ power*---don't you see? Separately---›

  The translator offered up a word.

  ‹---without anchoring one another.›
#+end_quote

And critically, from Chapter 24:

#+begin_quote
  Hork-Bajir, Taxxons---even the Naharans, for all their engineering brilliance---they don't have rich, internal experiences, complex personalities. The first true intelligence we encountered was the Andalites, and they didn't exactly inspire trust and friendship.”

  Essak directed Peter's gaze at me. “Of all of the pools in the Yeerk Empire, *Aftran was one of the only ones---maybe the only one---that could have opened this door*.
#+end_quote

Are humans the first species since the Pemalites to even be /capable/ of consenting cooperation? Every other intelligent race we know about has either a telepathic or physical hivemind, or instinctual personality quirks like extreme megolomania and isolationism, or a lack of internal experience, or an obsession with pursuing a single field like engineering or biology, that precludes the need for trust, cooperation, and love as terminal values in their own right. Too bad Helium didn't think to ask if there are unique properties to the Yeerk-Human bond, or the Yeerk-Human-Andalite bond.

In the mind meld, V3 was genuinely afraid of Ax-and-Temrash; he called them "The beginning of a new ending, a possibility to match his own, not one but /two/---".

And now the species that's essentially a massive API that connects every other intelligent species together has been exposed to the True Meaning Of Friendship. The race is on between V3's unity and Terra's harmony, like Father vs. the Ellimist in canon, to see who's going to gobble up all the minds in the universe first.
