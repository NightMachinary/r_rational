Well, mostly fantasy runs on translation convention - you aren't writing the dialogue in lesser west phelerian, after all, so going into the details of the measuring system is a waste of effort unless it's plot relevant - if your character is a trader and is considering defecting to the evil empire just so she doesn't have to convert to local units in every bloody city she she visits, then it is necessary to describe some of those units. Likewise, if there is a prophecy but uncertainty as to the exact date due to calendar reforms the actual length of the week they use might matter. Otherwise, SI units and earth time are fine. The same "translator" converting the dialogue from lesser west phelenian can be presumed to be converting that too.
