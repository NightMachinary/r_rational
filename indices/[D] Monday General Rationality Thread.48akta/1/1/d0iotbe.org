It goes into the negatives for me. I hate it when people try to go way out into left field, because they almost always mess it up. Worlds stuck in ten thousand years of modern misconceptions about the Dark Ages, rampant misuse of glottal stops, stupid names, deserts where there shouldn't be deserts, space-filling empires, economies that don't make any sense, entire continents with /one language/ - all classic examples of what happens when people try to make a world that's really "different" from Earth.
