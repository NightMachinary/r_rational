I generally agree but what is your problem with blindsided? I know almost nothing about sports and am from Europe so before your post I didn't know it could be about sports and still not know about which one. But does it have to be about sports? People including wizards have a limited field of vision and blindsided seems to imply getting impacted by something you didn't see coming. Either literally or something you weren't aware of.

And while we are on the topic: What do you think about things like "at wand point"?
