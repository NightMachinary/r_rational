If I might go off on a (related) tangent -- a personal pet peeve of mine is sports metaphors appearing in the speech of characters from imaginary words.

Example: Wizards X & Y are talking and X remarks that someone "hit a home run" with one of his spells.

!?!?

Do they fucking have baseball in middle earth or wherever?

Sorry. This drives me up the wall.

Other examples: characters who live in fantasy worlds should not use expressions like "blindsided," "punted," "out of left field," "par for the course," etc etc. For me, at least, this completely breaks the immersion. You would be surprised how many fantasy writers break this rule.
