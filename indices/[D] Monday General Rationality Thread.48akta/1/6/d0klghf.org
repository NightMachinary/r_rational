I've seen especially silly case with time units in one Russian fantasy (it was «Ветер и искры»//Wind and Sparks/ by Pekhov in case someone's interested in particulars) where author renamed hours, minutes, and seconds with made up words, but they were the same hours, minutes, and seconds, with the same arbitrary 60, 60, 24 divisions.
