How realistically different do you feel created fantasy worlds need to be for you to read a story without getting torn out of the story due to the improbability of earthlike similarities? Even if a planet has a similar year it probably wouldn't have 7 day weeks or months with the same names as earth. Am I overthinking this when in actuality no one cares if the world has similar dating systems for convenience of writing or is this something I should make sure is unique to the world I'm building?
