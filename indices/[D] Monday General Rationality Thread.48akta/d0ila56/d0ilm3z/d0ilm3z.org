If a world seems to similar to ours, I raise my eyebrows, get pulled out of SOD a bit, but will ultimately keep reading if I like the rest of the story. (For example, I'm a little weirded out by Log Horizon having hundreds of years of history, but barely any decay of the old pre-apocalyptic structures). IF the author tries to jam exposition down my throat for the purpose of showing off their work, I'll get bored and leave, though.
