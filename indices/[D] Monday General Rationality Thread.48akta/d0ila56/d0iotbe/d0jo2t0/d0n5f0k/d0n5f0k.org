As long as it isn't that large a continent, a sufficiently potent unifying culture could make a single language at least /known/ about everywhere. China and the imperial educational / examination system spread mandarin very far and wide. Islam spread arabic very far, the romans Latin, and so on.

A unified language does imply a setting with much greater unification than is typical for fantasy - No little kingdoms, one language means everything is recognizing at least /some/ kind of common authority.
