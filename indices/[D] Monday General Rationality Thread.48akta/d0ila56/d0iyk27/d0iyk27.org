That's one of those things that I've always struggled with. On the one hand, you don't want to break immersion by including things that are obviously taken from Earth cultures. On the other hand, no one really cares about your system of dividing up the 122-day years or the system of measurement, and it's almost certainly not going to be part of the plot, so you don't want to waste everyone's time by including it.

I generally do my best to talk around the cultural artifacts if I can and only include analogs if it can't be avoided or there's something compelling about the differences. If a culture is heavily into numerology you can give exposition on their divisions of time that way without /completely/ boring people, for example.
