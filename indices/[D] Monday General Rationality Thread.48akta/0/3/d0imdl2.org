I'm already a part of as many pen-and-paper games as I have time for, but I can offer some advice on how to play online.

The first thing you need to do is figure out whether you're going to be playing synchronously or asynchronously.

I've personally found that play-by-post or play-by-email has a tendency to fall apart, especially if you're doing a lot of combat. Where it excels is allowing for roleplaying and rich, deliberate descriptions. Where it fails is mostly in visualization (or if the people involved are bad at improv). Combat tends to be tough because if you've got four players and one DM, a full round takes a minimum of five posts. When you add in things like reactions, it takes even more. The big problem with this is that it can kill momentum and (sometimes) interest. To some extent this depends on the specifics of the system.

Synchronous sessions /usually/ mean voice chat, though I've done it over IRC as well. I currently use [[http://www.roll20.net][roll20.net]] with my group, which is free and serves the purpose of showing where walls and token are. The big problem for synchronous play is scheduling, especially since you have to schedule over and over everytime someone cancels, drops out, or a new person joins. (I also find that roll20 is a little worse for improv, partly because I'm trying to use good-looking maps and keep production values high, but that's a personal problem.)
