This [[http://meetthenewboss.info/kent/hogwarts/Harry%20Potter%20RPG%20Core%20Rule%20Book.pdf]] may help. I'd join but I'm already in a HP campaign (Set during Voldies first war) that's still looking for players.

As for advice I'd recommend either Roll20 or Tabletop Simulator for the game depending on if you wanted to use macros or not. (Roll20s Macros take some getting used to.)
