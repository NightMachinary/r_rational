The knee-jerk reaction is to go full [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/2012/01/17/buzz-7-1][Heartbreaker]] and enthrall half a dozen people into paying their salaries to me, writing fanfiction in directions dictated by me, and animating /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][Time Braid]]/ for me--but, obviously, inducing sudden and drastic changes in people's personalities probably would cause investigations, leading to imprisonment and/or vivisection. Also, I don't know whether extreme pleasure /without pain/ would be a reliable way to ensure a person's obedience.

So, a more cautious (but still rather ill-informed and off-the-cuff) initial plan of action might be:\\
- Pick an unattached female around my age who seems reasonably smart/knowledgeable and is highly physically attractive.\\
- Gradually increase her level of happiness, without her knowledge.\\
- Keep her at this high level of happiness for some weeks or months, until she's presumably become dependent on it.\\
- Reveal myself to her, explain the situation, and demonstrate my power, first by totally cutting off the flow of happiness, and then by temporarily raising it to ridiculous heights.\\
- Tell her to start giving to me as much of whatever salary she makes as she can without raising suspicion, start studying writing and animation, and get tested for venereal diseases.\\
- (If she seems unwilling to obey, or if after some time her continued loyalty requires levels of happiness high enough that their unnaturalness can't be hidden, raise her happiness so high that her brain burns out, or she lies comatose until death by dehydration, or something, and start again with someone else, perhaps using a longer initial period of hidden pleasure-inducement.)
