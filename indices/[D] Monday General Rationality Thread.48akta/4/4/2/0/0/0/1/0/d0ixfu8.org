  Have you ever cried when watching anime?
#+end_quote

Tears of sadness have started in my eyes at my first (and, so far, only) viewing of the ending of /Death Note/, and at my subsequent viewings (two or three, IIRC) of that series' first episode. IIRC, I also found three scenes in my sole viewing of /Mobile Fighter G Gundam/ ([[#s][1]] [[#s][2]] [[#s][3]]) to be similarly moving. I think there were some similar situations in my sole viewing of /Angel Beats!/, but I can't remember any specifics, other than [[#s][the final scene of the series]], and maybe something to do with the guitar-player of the band.\\
Nothing else comes to mind--and none of the aforementioned scenes were moving enough to make me /cry outright/.

  Did you ever end up trying to employ the advice I gave you?

I can't say I gave too much consideration to it. For the first option, I already (occasionally) post items of which I'm proud to [[/r/ParadoxPlaza][r/ParadoxPlaza]] and to my Facebook Timeline, and contribute in the official Paradox forums. I didn't find the other two options particularly interesting.

I think you meant to type "[[/u/Transfuturist][u/Transfuturist]]".
