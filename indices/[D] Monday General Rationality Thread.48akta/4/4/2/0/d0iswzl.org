  /Why would you not start with animators?/

  Habit-forming is done with variable-rate variable-reward schedules, while what you're proposing is about as effective as blackmailing someone with bipolar disorder.

  Please explain what your post-knee-jerk reaction is, if it's changed at all.
#+end_quote

As explained originally, the knee-jerk reaction was "going full Heartbreaker", with several simultaneously-held slaves whose sloppy creation/maintenance would quickly lead to my being found out and imprisoned/vivisected, while the post-knee-jerk reaction was the scenario in which I went into more detail.

  I also want to know if you've told any of your conversation friends about this sort of thing.
#+end_quote

"Friends" One through Six have at various points had access to my Facebook Timeline, where I've said things in this vein--but they may or may not have actually bothered to read what I posted there. I've discussed these ideas explicitly with "Friends" Six and Eight, and maybe Seven as well, IIRC.
