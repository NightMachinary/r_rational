(shrugs) Oh, well.

Meta clarification... What were my options for this comment?\\
- /Be noncommittal:/ This is truthful, since I don't care about whether or not my described course of action is moral. However, this invites accusations of being "edgy" just for attention (i.e., trolling)--and various previously-revealed pieces of information (as well as past helpfulness/productiveness) that serve as evidence against this user's being a troll may not be known by the reader.\\
- /Don't respond at all:/ This leads a reader of the thread to assume that I'm shamefully lurking in silence after previously /both/ believing that my course of action was moral /and/ caring about its morality, and then being disabused of the former notion.

So, I've chosen the first option of a noncommittal response, but also added these additional paragraphs to fend off accusations of attention-grabbing through edginess.
