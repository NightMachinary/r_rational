Kek.

Utilitarianism as the term is used in this community tends not to care about the standard definition, as it is more interesting and more useful when used as a relativist framework.

Moral antirealism is kind of the way reality is. I've never really asked about your considerations of objective morality, but I would guess that what you would claim as an objective ethics would in fact be relative to a social and liberal society. I suspect that it would only be acceptable to a certain class of cooperative and/or empathetic beings, or a larger group of slightly less cooperative or empathetic beings participating under plausible threat of force.

I don't endorse any current mathematical formalizations of utilitarianism, even less when considering the necessity of bounded rationality.
