Oh, I /so/ aced it (not sure if that's a dig at incomprehensible philosophy :P ). I am doing the opposite of acing EdX, I haven't even looked at it since. I have English to do...

It's not exactly System 2 making the decision. It's System 1 and System 2 arguing with each other over how you feel and how things are and what you should do and feel about it. System 2 is a more conscious, logical, and deliberate reasoner, which can help show yourself consequences, externalities, biases, etc., while System 1 is more intuitive and provides emotional reactions to things, including the simplified memetic models System 2 is showing it as a result of its reasoning. This is a stupid pseudopsychological metaphor. But basically what I'm saying is that free will means you are free to change your mind how you want, and System 2 knows some things about how to do that, particularly if you know about conditioning.

The genetic code does not map to a single mind, or even a single mind-lifetime. The preferences are relative to the mind (as well as the things the mind owns, which includes the body the mind is situated in), which itself changes over time.
