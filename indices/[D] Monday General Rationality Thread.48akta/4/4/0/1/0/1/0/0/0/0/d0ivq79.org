  Utilitarianism as the term is used in this community tends not to care about the standard definition, as it is more interesting and more useful when used as a relativist framework.

Uhhhh it is?

- I actually thought people were talking about a mix of conventional hedonic utilitarianism (pure-strain Peter Singer EA-types) and conventional preference utilitarianism (most everyone else).

- Doesn't using it as a relativist framework require some way to normalize preferences across individuals so they have the same numerical scales for the same subjective strength of preference?

  Moral antirealism is kind of the way reality is.

Depends which meaning of the word "realism". If you ask, "Do our moral judgements pick out real (although possibly local) properties of the world?", then basically everyone's a realist, including me. If you ask, "Does the universe somehow force us to obey morality *handwaves God, handwaves Kantian rationality*?", then almost everyone is an anti-realist, including me.

Sorry to always jump down your throat with stupid distinctions, but I do somewhat think this one counts for something? Like, if you're antirealist in the /first/ sense, then you go down the road that ends in "MUH VALUES" talk: since your morals are, at that point, not based on correspondence and fully /a priori/, it becomes /impossible/ to have a disagreement over moral facts. Everyone's just disagreeing because, so to speak, they've got a different utility function from you, and in fact, every thinking being in the universe is either "of use" to you or a /threat/ to "MUH VALUES".

And /then/ of course there's the question of how all these preferences come to be in the brain as weightings of learned causal models and all that jazz.

  I don't endorse any current mathematical formalizations of utilitarianism, even less when considering the necessity of bounded rationality.
