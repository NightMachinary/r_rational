  Do you mean that there are things that will objectively make us (in the instant) happy or sad, or harmed or helped?
#+end_quote

Yes. Or even, things which /still/ make us happy or sad, or harmed or helped, after we fully understand them. I'm expressing a belief that you can't "unweave the rainbow" by telling me that the beauty of a rainbow involves optics and brain-states, /except/ by actually /destroying/ the correspondence between those optics and those brain-states.

  I also have an issue here pertaining to existentialism and self-actualization. I think you should be free to choose your preferences by System 2, and to modify yourself so that your System 1 reacts to reality accordingly.

But then what is System 2 making its decisions based on?

  I think that moral "facts" don't exist insofar as they are always relative to some preference system, but they are facts when considering the reference frame.
#+end_quote

Gonna respond to this tomorrow morning. Summary: but where do the preferences /come from/? What are they /about/? The genetic code isn't high-information enough to code sophisticated System 2 preferences on a per-individual, a priori basis.

  I can't talk more right now, or even edit, so I'll leave it at that rather muddled run-on sentence.

:-p no problem. You realize I'm typing this "on break" from EdX lectures, right?

  For my Ethics final, I made an argument that preference relativism can be used to describe society as constituents collaborating with a preference system generalized over them all, and that trade with society is generally good because the constituents are more social than not, comparative advantage and specialization makes sociality a positive-sum game, and that this in effect can counteract the individual loss of utility for each person where they differ by raising the utility where they share.

So you're saying you aced your Intro to Ethics final?
