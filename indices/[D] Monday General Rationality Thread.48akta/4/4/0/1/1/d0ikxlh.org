Its unrealistic to assume you do not know its unacceptable otherwise your scenario would have been:

"I go up to someone I find smart and attractive and offer them wirehead-pleasure in exchange for sex, their income, assistance with various tasks, with no guarantee that it will end there due to my ability to execute them if they defect."

I can see no realistic reason for you going through the manipulation route other than that you know they wouldn't accept this deal. There is no real way in which the secretive pleasure inducement can not act as a means of creating a dependency and this, combined with the threat of execution for defecting, makes this violate any non-esoteric definition of a consensual exchange.

Also, you literally said:

#+begin_quote
  If she seems unwilling to obey... raise her happiness so high that her brain burns out
#+end_quote

So I think "execution for disobeying" is a perfectly accurate description.

(the full quote is:

#+begin_quote
  If she seems unwilling to obey, or if after some time her continued loyalty requires levels of happiness high enough that their unnaturalness can't be hidden, raise her happiness so high that her brain burns out, or she lies comatose until death by dehydration, or something, and start again with someone else, perhaps using a longer initial period of hidden pleasure-inducement.
#+end_quote
