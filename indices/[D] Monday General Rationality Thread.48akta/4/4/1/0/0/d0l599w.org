There isn't an explicit rule, but there's a strong social norm against it. It is good that there is a strong social norm against it because it drives the discussions away from particular places that I personally prefer they not go. It also makes it easier to sell newcomers on this subreddit. I did not downvote ToaKraka for his response, but I do think it's fairly scary. It is not, however, surprising.

If ToaKraka phrased his reply as a work of fiction, by the way, I don't think people would care. I probably would not. I do, however, have an instinctive wariness when these ideas are presented as hypothetical plans or suggestions rather than stories that aren't true. Most people are like me in this regard.
