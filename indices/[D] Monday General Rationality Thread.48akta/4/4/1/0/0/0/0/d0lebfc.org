Ah, I'm not actually a mod here-- that's [[/u/eaturbrainz]].

Speaking from personal experience, aside from the occasional spam link from a bot, I've never seen the mods censor or delete posts. This is a very small community and so it is not necessary. About this comment in particular: This wasn't [[/u/eaturbrainz]] saying "I usually delete comments", this was them saying "the moderation is aware of this post, and is not deleting it, but also not endorsing it or sanctioning it."

Basically, with something like this mods are under a lot of pressure to make a post saying "we are aware of this" so that people feel assured about it, and also a post saying "this is a bad post" because that also makes people feel assured.
