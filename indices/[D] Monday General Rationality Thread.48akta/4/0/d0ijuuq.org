Assuming that I could also un-wirehead them at will, recruit /informed volunteers/ as research subjects for the following lines of inquiry:

- How does this ability work? What does it tell us about human minds? (This is likely to suggest further lines of inquiry.)
- Can this be used to encourage beneficial habit formation?
- Can this be used to mitigate psychological drug dependence?

Then follow the research trail.
