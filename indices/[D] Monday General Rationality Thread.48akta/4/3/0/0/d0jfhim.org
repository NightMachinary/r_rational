"You people all seem very angry that I'm not spending more time in hospitals. Fortunately, I have the perfect solution for that."

*Zaps them all and runs*

Similarly, Panacea probably would have been better off playing chaotic good and doing whatever she wanted. A Robin Hood healer of sorts ignoring all legal precedent and breaking into hospitals to go on healing sprees when she felt like it. She'd be a villain, but as long as she participated in endbringer fights... well. Nobody fucks with the white mage.

Of course Panacea's personality, home life, and the bad PR Nilbog racked up threw a wrench in that in canon.
