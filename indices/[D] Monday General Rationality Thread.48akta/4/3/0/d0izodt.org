The main problem with that is the Panacea Effect. If you ever read worm, Panacea is a superhero who has perfect biomancy, and she uses it to heal. Outside of battles, she spends most of her time at the hospitals, even giving up sleep.

She's been doing it for a while now, and by the beginning of the story, she despises it.

If you follow your plan, you may end up suicidal, or at the very least, with depression. Also, people are going to be pissed you're going to /that/ hospital and not /this/ one.
