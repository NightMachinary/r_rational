That's because Panacea wasted her power to a frankly criminal degree. Frankly, she had one of (if not the) best powers in Worm. With a bit of work, she could have custom-designed a plague that restores everyone it affects to perfect health. Or turned everyone immortal. Or gave everyone a better sense of smell than dogs.

Instead, she fucks around in a single hospital. It's like being given omniscience, and using it to be a really good dishwasher repairman.
