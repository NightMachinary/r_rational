What do you value?

Some possible reframings:

- What do you want to improve about the world?

- What makes life worth living for you?

- What does an ideal life look like?

- What about life is unsavory and worth eliminating?

- What do you imagine life in a far future technological eutopia to be like?

I've thought about this a lot lately, and I think I've come to the conclusion that I don't really care about EA -- or at least, typical EA goals. I mean, I do of course care about people and would prefer there wasn't extreme poverty and preventable death and all that. But, like, I just don't actually care about that more than other things, among which is trying to live and enjoy my own life. It's almost like I could spend those thousands of dollars much more, ahem, effectively.

Of course for others, that could mean helping to eliminate extreme poverty asap. For me, I think that's something in the realm of exploring constructed worlds and immersive fiction, developing better technology to facilitate creation and experience of these things, etc. And then, life extention, because more of a good thing is always better. And x-risk, because you still need a society of creative individuals to create these things. Oh, and I think it's at least fleetingly possible we might accomplish biological immortality sometime in my lifetime, so I want civilization to stick around too. (That's more than a little bit narcissistic, but hey, I didn't choose to have these values.) Those aren't the only reasons and goals (obvious though, I would hope) -- just a broad outline of my thinking process.

Of course, it's not like I don't care at all about typical EA concerns. It's just that I see extreme poverty and death from preventable diseases, and then I think about what's possible, and it's immediately clear to me that the difference between first and third world on that scale is basically a rounding error.

Mostly I bring this up because in these circles, EA is rather central to the ingroup identity, and within that, EA-to-end-poverty is taken as a given. But I don't see much discussion about what people actually value, and how to effectively realize those values. As long as you have a term for other people (or at least your interactions with other people), I think "altruism" still applies and we can work towards our mutual interests.

...Or it could just be that I'm the borderline psychopathic outlier. /shrug/
