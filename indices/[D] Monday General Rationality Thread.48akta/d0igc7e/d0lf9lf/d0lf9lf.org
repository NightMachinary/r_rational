  Mostly I bring this up because in these circles, EA is rather central to the ingroup identity

I'm not sure that this is true. From my perspective, not everyone has to be altruistic. I would prefer however, that the people who /are/ altruistic know about EA and that therefore the inherent charitable-ness of humanity were efficiently channelled. As such anyone who I interact with does not get negative points from me for not being an altruist, I simply view them as normal/baseline human. I certainly would not shun someone who accepted it as the efficient way to go about such things but simply had no interest in contributing themselves.
