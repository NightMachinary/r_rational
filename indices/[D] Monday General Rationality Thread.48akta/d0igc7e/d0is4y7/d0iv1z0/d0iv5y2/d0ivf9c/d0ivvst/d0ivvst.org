  Why would we want to put energy into creating and maintaining social inequality?

Well in my opinion, we wouldn't, but you're saying, it's ok if we do.

Errrr.... I think that you were operating with a model in which we have some inequality, and that comes "for free", and that's /ok/ because we're investing our energies in boosting the upper limit of the possible for everyone's sake. My objection to this is that I don't believe it comes "for free", but instead at a steep price, and that it's actually /easier/ to expand the upper limits of the possible when society shifts to become more equal than when you assume that actually-existing inequality "comes for free".

For a concrete example, consider the issue of trying to do radical life extension in a country that doesn't practice herd-immunity vaccination for common diseases. You /can/ invest a shit-ton of resources in keeping your life-extension patients unexposed to, say, /polio/, but it's actually, in my opinion, on sum cheaper and easier to just vaccinate everyone against polio, eradicate the pathogen from common circulation, and be done with it.
