  Of course, it's not like I don't care at all about typical EA concerns. It's just that I see extreme poverty and death from preventable diseases, and then I think about what's possible, and it's immediately clear to me that the difference between first and third world on that scale is basically a rounding error.

How do you expect to have a functioning utopia with sufficiently extreme inequality that people are still stuck living Third World lifestyles while others live (-3)-world lifestyles?

  ...Or it could just be that I'm the borderline psychopathic outlier.

No, you're just not a utilitarian. AFAICT, deep down, nobody actually /is/ a utilitarian, and there's a lot wrong with utilitarianism, so I kinda just want to take all the philosophy people who've turned Displays of Utilitarianism into Displays of Virtue (ie: Peter Singer) and have them shot for crimes against humanity.

But that's just me.
