Actually, come to think of it [[https://unqualifiedreservations.wordpress.com/2007/05/20/the-magic-of-symmetric-sovereignty/][Fnargl]] might be safe from this particular consideration because he can snap his fingers and magically vanish any opposition. But most evil overlords have to worry about rebellions and competitors, so they need to put up a strong show of force / competence. They might start out by solving real (cheap to solve) problems, but as long as there are fake problems that are cheaper to solve, their incentive lies elsewhere. Just as good money is driven out by bad (Gresham's Law), genuine solutions involving real costs, risks, and innovation are driven out by fake / simulated problems.
