I do agree that it is scary and objectively wrong to want to do what he proposed to do but I don't think that such sentiments are worthy of censorship as a general rule.

Regarding newcomers, if so many of us answer in the disapproving way we did and get upvoted for it I don't see how it is any different from when something similar happens on more popular subreddits. AskReddit for instance had had plenty of "what's the worst thing you've done" type of topics that can get pretty dark at times if one is willing to scroll down.

What I'm trying to say is that I agree with most people's reaction to ToaKraka but the way you put it it sounded like as a general rule you'd have deleted his post but didn't so that people know they are dealing with a sociopath or something. The general rule part is what I disagree with and didn't notice to be part of this subreddit's rules in the first place.
