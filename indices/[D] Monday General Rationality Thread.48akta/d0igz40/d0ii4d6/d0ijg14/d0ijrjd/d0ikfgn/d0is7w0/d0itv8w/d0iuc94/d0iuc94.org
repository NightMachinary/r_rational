  Unless you're talking about John Stuart Mill and company.

JS Mill, Sidgwick, Singer et al are actually considered the standard definition of utilitarianism.

#+begin_quote
  Utilitarianism is relative to the subject. It's an ethical framework for talking about moral relativism, not a normative ethics.

That really only applies to preference utilitarianism with a number of underlying antirealist and relativist meta-ethical assumptions, and then a number of cognitive assumptions about being able to construct scalar VNM-compatible utility functions and oh boy here we go again.
