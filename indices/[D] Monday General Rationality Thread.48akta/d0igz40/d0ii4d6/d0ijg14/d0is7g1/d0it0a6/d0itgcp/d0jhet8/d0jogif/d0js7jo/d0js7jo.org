Sure. I was more referring to how sociopathy, while certainly dangerous, can actually be helpful in some circumstances. Many surgeons are sociopaths, and it actually makes them better at their jobs both because they don't have the visceral STOP feeling most of us would have upon cutting into a human and also because losing a patient, whether by chance or accident, won't cause them to choke later. They just learn from their mistakes and move on immediately. Sociopathic surgeons don't deliberately kill patients either (generally), as they went through a lot of effort to get their license and don't want to throw all of that away. They aren't irrational, they just don't have empathy.
