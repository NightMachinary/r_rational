I don't think ToaKraka is actually dangerous, though. He's mostly incapable of dissembling or manipulation, online at least. He doesn't have magic powers. He barely has normal people powers.

He reminds me of the Confessor in TWC, if the Confessor were actually more pitiable than he was before Uplift. We can't spare him unusual sympathy when the marginal gain is greater elsewhere, sure, but that's no reason to go out of our way to mistreat him.
