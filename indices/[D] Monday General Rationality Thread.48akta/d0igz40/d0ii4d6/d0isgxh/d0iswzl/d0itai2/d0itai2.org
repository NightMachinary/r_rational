  I'm not personally acquainted with anyone whom I know to be proficient in animation.

...So this means you would start with attractive women that you are personally acquainted with.

...Okay. Switching tack:

If you gained these powers, do you believe you would actually do this? Also, why? Why the fixation on Time Braid, to the point that you would literally risk vivisection in order to see it animated? Why would you not try to approach this with a legal and entrepreneurial spirit? Why would you not at least go the quasi-legal route and form an actual cult?

Some tangential questions: Do you have emotions? It's a bit of a stereotype, but do you feel happiness, sadness, anger, disgust, shame? Have you ever felt empathy towards someone, as in feeling hurt by their hurt, made happy by their happiness? IIRC, you're somewhat autistic: Do you have trouble telling what people are feeling when you see their faces? Do you have an easier time empathizing with fictional characters than with real people?
