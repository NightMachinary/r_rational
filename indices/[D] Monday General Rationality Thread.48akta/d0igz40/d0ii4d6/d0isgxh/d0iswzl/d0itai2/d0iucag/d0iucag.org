  If you gained these powers, do you believe you would actually do this?
#+end_quote

At first, I probably would be far too scared of discovery--but I think I'd feel a little more daring after some weeks or months.

#+begin_quote
  Why the fixation on Time Braid, to the point that you would literally risk vivisection in order to see it animated?
#+end_quote

This was just a minor example of the many things that I'd want done for me. /Time Braid/ is my favorite book, but I definitely wouldn't say it's the best thing of all time--I'm even partway through making an edited version for myself, so I definitely recognize that it has flaws (e.g., swearing by "God" in early chapters, but by "gods" in later chapters). An animated version of /Time Braid/ would just be a relatively minor perk, paling in comparison with not having to work for the rest of my life.

#+begin_quote
  Why would you not try to approach this with a legal and entrepreneurial spirit?
#+end_quote

I'm not even sure how this would work. Would I create a start-up company where all the people, being constantly happy, had abnormally high productivity? It seems awfully roundabout, not to mention difficult, time-consuming, and immediately obvious to anyone who looks.

#+begin_quote
  Why would you not at least go the quasi-legal route and form an actual cult?
#+end_quote

Again, this seems like a lot of complication for hardly any extra gain. /One/ oddly-happy person is weird, but dismissable--but /several/ oddly-happy people, all in the same place, will prompt an investigation.

#+begin_quote
  Do you have emotions?
#+end_quote

Oh, definitely. I'm feeling quite happy right now--look at all this conversation I've managed to acquire! I wonder whether this is what a troll feels like, when he's managed to get a rise out of his targets...\\
On the other side of the coin, I felt almost tearful while reading of the collapse of the United States in /Atlas Shrugged/, and filled with a sense of awe during the lead-up to the climactic French invasion of England in /Look to the West/.

#+begin_quote
  Do you have trouble telling what people are feeling when you see their faces?
#+end_quote

I don't think so. I could be wrong, though, since it certainly isn't as if I often see people demonstrating strong emotions.

#+begin_quote
  Have you ever felt empathy towards someone, as in feeling hurt by their hurt, made happy by their happiness?
#+end_quote

I feel crawling sensations when looking at, say, a gory [[/r/WTF][r/WTF]] image that's made it into [[/r/all][r/all]], and I certainly avoid scenes of "awkwardness" like the plague (I have a marked dislike for impersonation scenes, live theater, and call-in radio shows). I can't say that I can recall feeling /happy/ for anyone else--but I could just be forgetting an instance.

#+begin_quote
  Do you have an easier time empathizing with fictional characters than with real people?
#+end_quote

Hmm... When I cast about in my memory for "emotional person", the first match is +Alphonse+ Edward Elric tearfully shouting about something--but that could just be a reflection of the fact that I hardly ever watch anything in live-action (whether fictional or non-fictional), and I certainly don't have occasion to see many people with strong feelings in real life.
