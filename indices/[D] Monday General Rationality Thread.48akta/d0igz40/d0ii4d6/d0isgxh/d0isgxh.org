  Tell her to start giving to me as much of whatever salary she makes as she can without raising suspicion, start studying writing and animation

/Why would you not start with animators?/ I wasn't going to upvote you for honesty because you seem pretty incapable of being dishonest, but this is just beyond the pale. You do not select for animators on the precondition of attractive women, you select for attractive women on the precondition of animators. Otherwise you'll take forever to actually find an attractive woman who is also an animator!

Not to mention the total fantasy of producing an animated miniseries/movie with only one animator who is being put under extreme psychological states. Not to mention /also/ the guaranteed psychological failure of the person in question after being put in extreme withdrawal, and the actual lack of addiction. Habit-forming is done with variable-rate variable-reward schedules, while what you're proposing is about as effective as blackmailing someone with bipolar disorder. You are dysfunctional in more ways than the incredibly obvious one. Downvoting for lack of a good plan.

Oh, and just to be clear? You are not allowed to have powers. If you ever get powers, pretty much everyone involved is going to have a horrific time. Please explain what your post-knee-jerk reaction is, if it's changed at all. I'm intrigued to see if it's changed.

I also want to know if you've told any of your conversation friends about this sort of thing.
