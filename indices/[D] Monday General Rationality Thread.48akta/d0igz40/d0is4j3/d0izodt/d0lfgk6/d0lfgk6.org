Well there's a simple fix for that: maintain a normal work/life balance like doctors and other life saving professions presumably have to learn to do. Find the ones of those who seem well adjusted and ask their advice. Then, give zero fucks at all about what anyone else thinks of the situation. Your morality counter for doing good deeds is over nine thousand, so they can shove off.
