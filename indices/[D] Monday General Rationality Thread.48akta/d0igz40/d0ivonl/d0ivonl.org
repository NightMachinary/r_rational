Me personally... I think I might sell it as a mood-improvement service, naturally going to the most wealthy. I would be concerned with safety and legality, and I would certainly not want to cause addiction if at all possible. Can I modulate the amount of pleasure, or is it a digital on/off braingasm? Can I modulate it with high-frequency pulses if it is digital, or is that just going against the spirit of the restriction? I see no reason to go into wirehead territory in particular if I can help it.

My actual actions /(as always, seriously, this is my real answer to literally every magic power question)/ would be to go to an effective charity such as GiveWell, tell them about my magic powers, and wait for the people who are smarter than me to tell me what to do where in exchange for a fair salary.
