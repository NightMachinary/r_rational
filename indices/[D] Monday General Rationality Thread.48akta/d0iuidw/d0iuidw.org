As we head into Super Tuesday, I'm thinking how much nicer it would be if the political establishment were run by people who've heard of Fnargl and understand about rationally trading-off resources.

As it is, they're showing that they're willing to invest arbitrarily large amounts of resources and effort /just/ in putting a metaphorical boot to the face of anyone who would dare oppose them. That's a /Lawful Stupid/ Evil Overlord move. A /smart/ overlord /doesn't/ make a big expensive show of how impossible it is to oppose them, they /buy off/ the most legitimate and righteous-looking of their opponents for the comparatively cheap price of placating the masses' more egregious grievances.
