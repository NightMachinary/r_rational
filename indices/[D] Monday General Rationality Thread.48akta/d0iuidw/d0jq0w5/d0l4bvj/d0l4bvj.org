Fnargl comes from a neoreactionary blogger's [[https://unqualifiedreservations.wordpress.com/2007/05/20/the-magic-of-symmetric-sovereignty/][thought experiment]] attempting to demonstrate that a despot with no threats to its power and a clear goal (obtaining the maximum amount of gold e.g.) would probably not oppress anyone (because oppression is too costly in terms of that goal). The reason a lot of us know about neoreaction is that Scott Alexander [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/03/03/reactionary-philosophy-in-an-enormous-planet-sized-nutshell/][wrote about it]] [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/10/20/the-anti-reactionary-faq/][a few times]].
