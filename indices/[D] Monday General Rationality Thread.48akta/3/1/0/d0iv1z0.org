I don't think this is parsing. Wanna try again?

If you're saying what I think you are, I want to point out that I'm not advocating leaving people behind in the dust, so to speak. More or less, I think we should spend more energy paving the way forward, rather than making sure everyone's caught up, when collectively we've barely moved a meter from the starting line.
