  Social inequality is like potential energy: you need to invest a lot of energy to create and maintain social inequality, and then once you've done so, energy that you could have used for other things is now trapped as social inequality (and it still needs to be actively maintained).

Err... I'm still not following. Why would we want to put energy into creating and maintaining social inequality? And doesn't that basically apply to anything, in the form of opportunity cost? It's trivially true that you could always make another choice as to allocation of resources.
