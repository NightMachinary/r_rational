I don't think competently engineered biological bodies would be susceptible to polio, nor would virtual minds. In fact, almost all our problems stem from being squishy meat sacks in a hostile universe that we are just barely suited to survive in.

The resources spent, e.g. eradicating individual diseases, could be spent solving the biology problem, and then /all/ the problems are solved. Well, the ones we care about most today, at least.

I suppose some of the problem here is when I say "life extension" people think something along the lines of advanced gene therapy when I mean FBE or biomechanical body replacement /at a minimum/.
