  If you're saying what I think you are, I want to point out that I'm not advocating leaving people behind in the dust, so to speak. More or less, I think we should spend more energy paving the way forward, rather than making sure everyone's caught up, when collectively we've barely moved a meter from the starting line.

I think the actual disagreement is that while I understand what you're saying, I don't think the world /can/ work that way. Social inequality is like potential energy: you need to invest a lot of energy to create and maintain social inequality, and then once you've done so, energy that you could have used for other things is now trapped as social inequality (and it still needs to be actively maintained).
