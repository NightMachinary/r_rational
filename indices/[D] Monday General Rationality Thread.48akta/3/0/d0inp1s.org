  For me, I think that's something in the realm of exploring constructed worlds and immersive fiction, developing better technology to facilitate creation and experience of these things, etc.

I think an important thing to consider here is how much impact one can expect to have in these fields. My expectation is that really cool VR (for example) is going to happen because of markets, and that donating/funding such efforts would be low impact unless one has a lot of money (which could otherwise save a lot of lives; of course, funding such an effort would hopefully have returns which could later be used to save lives). If one is thinking of doing direct work in one of the fields you mentioned, there is nothing stopping such a person from donating some fraction of their income to more typical EA causes.
