It's just that Bard doesn't meddle so directly. It would be in character for her to pop up in front of one or two people and "advise" them to head to a particular place for some vague purpose, but this is a huge gathering of priests that all treat its conclusion as foregone.

Remember, the only times she gives an explicit and immediately relevant order is when she's about to write off the hero in question, like when telling William to summon the angel, or when telling the Exiled Prince how to kill Catherine (though even then it was an advice rather than a direct instruction, and she didn't outline the exact actions he should take, resulting in a pivot where the more pragmatic Named would survive). It's why I believe she's baiting Neshamah out to rebuild large parts of the board, including the ones that his pieces are currently occupying.

Compare those cases with her ensuring Capitain's death: she gave Kairos the Stygian slaves so he would turn the blind eye to the convoys and she wouldn't ever come into the direct contact with Capitain, then suggested to the Champion that she should go deeper into the city once the walls are breached. Yes, she prepared Rafaella for the altercation (see "Do you happen to like monster stories?"), and the Champion certainly expected to make contact with the Capitain at one point or another, but she didn't actually know how exactly or when it would happen.

I'm not saying the Bard couldn't or wouldn't have done it, but the point the spymasters seemed to make was that all those priests managed to discreetly organize a conclave through unknown means, which suggested that someone actually stuck for seeing it through. Bard doesn't stay in one place/scene for long enough or speak directly enough for the result to look this way.
