  when telling the Exiled Prince how to kill Catherine (though even then it was an advice rather than a direct instruction, and she didn't outline the exact actions he should take, resulting in a pivot where the more pragmatic Named would survive)

Well, you just sent me on an archive dive. It's...weird seeing names pop up that have long since died in the various wars against the Fae and Akua, like Alfobai and Sacker (or "Aunt Sackie"), as well as that period when not only was Catherine a lot less powerful and much happier (see zombie goats, simply shooting the Prince), the Empire was a great deal more stable and able to cope with the Liessan rebellion and Heiress (downright weird hearing her called that) was protected by the Truebloods (that Catherine ended up crucifying) and was just "taking Dormer for some unknown purpose". Oh, you poor fools...
