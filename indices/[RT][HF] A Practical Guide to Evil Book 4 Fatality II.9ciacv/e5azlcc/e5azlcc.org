Is it bad that I only now notice that Grey Pilgrim didn't actually /promise/ at any point to help in making peace with the Grand Alliance and to assist Callow in turning against the Dread Empire? Catherine thought a redemption plot was implied, but we know that in a given story Creation doesn't go for the same plot twice, and that /Akua/ is the one going for redemption now.

Did anyone pay attention to the timetable? I want to understand when Tariq must have called together the conclave: ather negotiations in chapter 8, after the ones in the wake of Battle of Camps (whenh he effectively threw Cordelia under the bus), or after she came to him when the Dead King invited her?
