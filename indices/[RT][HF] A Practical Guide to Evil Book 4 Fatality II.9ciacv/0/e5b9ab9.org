I was wondering why Cordelia sounded surprised in her viewpoint chapter if she already knew about the Dead King, but re-reading it, I realize she wasn't surprised, just really tense. The reason she sounded desperate was that, for a moment, she thought Catherine had intelligence on the Dead King and might give it to her.
