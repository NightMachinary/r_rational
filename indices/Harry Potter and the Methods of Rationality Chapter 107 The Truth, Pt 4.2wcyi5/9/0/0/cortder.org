Parseltongue would only prevent it if the correct questions are asked. If Harry is actually differentiating between Quirrell and Voldemort, then he's not betraying Quirrell. I just looked at this chapter, and in both cases where Harry is asked if he is betraying, the narration specifically indicates Harry seeing the question coming from Quirrell.

Voldimort does indicate that he is a disembodied soul, when discussing the possibility of a dementor attack.

When he does act, I expect Harry to explain to Voldimort, in Parseltongue. "I never betrayed the professor, I acted to free him from you." Or some such.
