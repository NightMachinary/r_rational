I wonder why Voldi always asks "have you betrayed me YET". It seems deliberate, and it's strange, it seems to me the more natural question "have you betrayed me" would be better.

Maybe it's because he doesn't want to know if Harry betrayed him later in time, to avoid "DO NOT MESS WITH TIME" consequences?

Maybe Harry could abuse that somehow?

Or he knows that harry betrayed him later, and that harry could deduce it from information he had from future, and wants to make the test false-positive proof.
