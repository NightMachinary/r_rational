the parseltongue truth restriction seems like a great hurdle but i have a few ideas to work around it . He keeps asking if tom has already betrayed him, but is it really betrayal if you are acting on what you think is the best interest of the person despite what he thinks? moreover harry could doublethink himself into accepting they are both the same person thus one can not betray oneself. any guesses on what the real solution is?
