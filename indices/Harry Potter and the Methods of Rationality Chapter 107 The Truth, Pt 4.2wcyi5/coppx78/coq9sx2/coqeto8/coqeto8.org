Trolls are /really/ hard to kill, and I think I remember some comment somewhere in HPMOR that their regeneration is done by a natural form of transfiguration; they're constantly turning into themselves. So if you overrode that natural transfiguration with your own magic, the troll would probably be perfectly fine once it completely turned back.

Plus, transfiguration sickness might take time to set in. He didn't exactly need the troll to live too long.
