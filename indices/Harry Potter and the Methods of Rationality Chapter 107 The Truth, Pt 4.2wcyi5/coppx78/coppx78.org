  Those of you with outstanding disputes about the Defense Professor's secrets should bet now.

Alright, here's mine:

He snuck in the troll by transfiguring it and having it hidden on him when Dumbles hooked him into the wards. The troll could bypass some of the wards because it was technically also a defense professor. (Amazingly, the troll was only the third worst DADA professor in hogwarts history)

I'm confident enough to give that one *70% probability*

Anyone else got any predictions?
