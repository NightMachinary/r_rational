Parseltongue is explicitly designed to prevent doublespeak. I think the only solution is speed: Betray and finish him fast enough.

Getting the time turner for an unsupervised second would be enough for example. Although it makes for a crappy ending. At any point, Yudkowsky could just write "Suddenly Voldemort was shot from behind" and then explain how Harry got his time turner an hour later.
