I think the 'troll' is a hint. Eliezer plans for Voldemort to kill Harry and he'll then transfigure himself to look like Harry, and turn the original Harry-body into a Volde-corpse. Dumbledore will show up and think he's got the storybook ending he's been looking for. 'Harry' will rule magical Britain as Quirrel desired, with Hermione at his side. THAT is the final troll.
