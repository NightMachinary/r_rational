I have a question that I think is important in regards to Parseltongue speech.

Does Harry differentiate mentally between Quirrell and Voldimort? It seems as if he might be doing so, but it also looks like that's being obfuscated by the way it's written. The author isn't specifically telling the reader that Harry is differentiating between the two, and it would seem very obvious to me that Harry really should be spending more time thinking about that.

If he can choose in his mind which entity he is speaking to when he answers the betrayal question, he can tell Quirrell that he's not betraying him, while at the same time he is actively betraying Voldimort.
