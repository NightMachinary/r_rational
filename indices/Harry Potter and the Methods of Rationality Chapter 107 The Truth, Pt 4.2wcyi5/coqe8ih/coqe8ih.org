Harry did get Cedrc's help after all. The reason he hasn't thought about it, and the reason why we didn't see anything between him wondering what to do after receiving the letter and showing up at the 3rd floor corridor, and the reason he seems so uncharacteristically unprepared, is that he had Cedric obliviate himself of that information.

Low confidence, but possible.
