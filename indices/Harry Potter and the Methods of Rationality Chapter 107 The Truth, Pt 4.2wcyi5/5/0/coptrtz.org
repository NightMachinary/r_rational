I think the best way to describe the parseltongue restriction is that *you can't say something you don't think is true*. If you don't believe what you're about to say is a true statement, you'll find you can't say it, or it comes out how you believe without your intention.

While you're speaking parseltongue, there's a magical effect on you that temporarily prevents you from wanting to say anything false.

Whether you can, with practice, get around that to any degree I don't know. Harry has accidentally said things more frankly than he meant while speaking parseltongue, but perhaps if you're used to doing so you can still word things in a deceptive way without lying. I think that would take skill, though.
