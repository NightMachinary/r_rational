Aside from my no-gambling-real-value policy (happy to, say, post a "you were right" message)...

A schelling point is not particularly relevant to this; what we're after is the geometric mean ([[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=geometric+mean+0.1%2C+0.7][~one to four odds]]). In the absence of stakes, I'm happy just to read and see if I was right :)
