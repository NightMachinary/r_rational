So is the idea for people to submit their stories through comments or posts, or through links to some kind of site? I personally feel the second option works better(specially if taken as a rule for every participant), at the very least because it allows each author to be in charge of his own fformatting and to circumvent the limitations of writing in a reddit post(which hardly helps those who read).

In a similar way, will it work with a free submission period or is it planned to aggregate the submissions and release a master post with them for voting when the month ends?
