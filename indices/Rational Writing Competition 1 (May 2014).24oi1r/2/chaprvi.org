[Entry: Original] Here's a fanfic for The Originals. It has spoilers up to episode 17. It's about Marcel trying to figure out a way to defeat Klaus, a vampire who's very hard to kill. Not sure whether it's good enough to be considered rational, but I'm open to suggestions for improvement: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10327304/1/If-They-Can-t-Be-Killed]].
