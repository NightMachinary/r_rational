But all that infrastructure and logistics in a vacuum! You need to build a massive structure in space with gate sized pieces, hardly a simple undertaking. Moving around heavy stuff on Earth is a problem we have solved pretty well. Doing the same in space we would have to start from scratch. If there isn't a good reason to do it I think building a ship on Earth would be much cheaper. Also it'll use up a lot of stargate time, time which you could spend establishing bases elsewhere.

I guess it would be convenient for lifting satellites, but why do you need so many satellites in the first place? And all the cool stuff to build in space seems like it would take a much lower priority than building ships or building bases on other worlds. The practical reasons for colonizing the solar system sort of disappear when you have an entire galaxy of habitable planets at your disposal.
