Even if you assume the delta v is negligible, it is still just plain easier to do large scale engineering in zero-g. There must be significant power, machine, and labour costs to move around heavy chassis or armor components in gravity, and that would be significantly reduced in space.

Also there is, well, more /space/. You don't need to worry about buying more land to upgrade your throughput, just build another spacedock. Get as much infrastructure in space as possible and you can keep transport costs down as well - though that is also effectively eliminated once Asgard Beaming is standard on ships.

This is really for the early game, before you have enough ships to have effectively infinite spacelift capacity. If you've only got 1 interstellar ship, and half of its time is spent saving SG-1 from the Goa'uld of the Week, you need some other way to do general background construction.

There's also the fact that although we don't see the power ever run down except in plot important moments, there is at least some kind of cost to keeping a starship up. Even if we assume it runs on completely free power, people aren't considering that eternal mother of war- logisitics.

Salaries, maintenance, repairing bullet holes, bullets, nukes, fuel for anything that needs fuel, refitting with ever-new technological upgrades, and opportunity cost all apply to using a ship instead of a Stargate for placing satellites.

And of course, the more you put in orbit, the more jobs and economic growth in orbit, the more businesses want in on that. You can start constructing O'Neill Cylinders (no relation) at L1-5, get a moonbase going, do large scale asteroid mining, etc.
