I've got another one for you: infinite free spacelift capacity.

They have two gates, the Antarctic Gate and the Egypt Gate.

Put one gate in the SGC, carry the other gate into orbit.

Send satellites through the SGC gate to the Alpha site. Plug in the DHD to the gate in orbit, making it the primary gate. Send the Satellites through the gate directly into orbit.

Create modular space-station components which just barely fit through the gate. Send those up too.

Get some power and construction stuff going in orbit. Create orbital ore-processing yards and factories for use in creation of more orbital infrastructure. Haul in some asteroids with stolen or home brewed ships depending on location in the timeline.

Put a naquadah refinery up there after the delivery of the ManThereIsALotOfPhlebotinumHere rock.

Oh, also, go public with the Stargate at some point here, so you can actually put the whole output of an industrialized world of 7 billion people behind, y'know, preventing the extermination of all life on Earth, rather than trying to make due with what can be fit into the black budget of the US Air Force.

Spacegate can also be used as a security precaution. If you think baddies are going to dial in, plug in the DHD and let them suck vaccuum.
