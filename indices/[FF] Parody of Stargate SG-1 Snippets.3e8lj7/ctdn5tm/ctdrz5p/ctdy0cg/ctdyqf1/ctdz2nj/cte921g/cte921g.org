Sam was probably rounding off. It's doubtful that it's literally that precise.

That said, a kilogram isn't really that universal; it's defined based on a particular physical object. It was originally 1000 cubic cm of water "at the temperature of melting ice", later defined as 4C, but even then a meter (and by extension a centimeter) was originally defined based on the circumference of the earth. 1000 is only an interesting number if you use base 10, which we only use as an artifact of having ten digits. Arguably, 12 or 16 are better (more useful), as they have more factors.
