Actually, with an instantaneous method of personal travel, but a method of starship travel that is much slower, you are much better off heavily developing a few systems then massively spreading to only the planets of many systems, especially if you have an enemy with an overwhelmingly superior Space Navy than you - a single Starship can reduce a dozen of your colonies before you could have the chance to even respond to the destruction of the first.

Literally the primary mission of the Stargate program is "Acquire technology and resources necessary to protect Earth from alien attack." Yes, having backup sites and offworld bases helps, but those are military or resource gathering outposts, not colonies.

And speed-of-light or superliminal-communication limits mean that data cannot be passed freely from one planet to another either, which means you are again better off keeping as much industry as possible in one system.

Hell, this is exactly what most of the Go'auld did wrong. They have thousands of agrarian and primitive worlds, and few if any major technological or resource bases - to the point that Sokar had almost complete domination over all of the others combined through the use of a single highly-industrialized world.

It would take a LOT longer to build up a whole functioning colony on another planet then it would to figure out how to build space stations (they figured out /interstellar starships/ in under 7 years) in the same system. And if Stargate time is as important as you suggest, then using it to send an outrageous amount of materials to dozens of different colonies (Earth-Gate being a heavy bottleneck in that plan) is even worse then occasionally using it for spacelift.
