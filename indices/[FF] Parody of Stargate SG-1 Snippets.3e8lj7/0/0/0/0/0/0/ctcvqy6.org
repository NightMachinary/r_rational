I would think that spreading out and controlling many stargates would be better than controlling only a few stargates and losing a large base if the go'auld find the base and blow it up from orbit. But either way you still need stargate time to heavily develop a system. The gate is super useful, even if building ships in space was slightly easier there are probably better things you could be using the gate for.

They figured out interstellar starships in 7 years, if they took a couple years to figure out space docks that's a couple years spent not figuring out starships. Then you still need to build the space stations.
