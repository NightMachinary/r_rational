Good ones.

Also, turns out that naquadah IS scarce. They had an episode in season 7 about prospecting for it and it turned out that the mine was in the sacred ground of a too-many-to-shoot group of Unas. They were all on about "ooh, this mine site is 10 ppm naquadah!" and I'm sitting here going: "don't you have this giant solid naquadah asteroid just a few fractions of an AU away from Earth?"

EDIT: oh, just realized -- the DHD got blown up when they borrowed it from the Russians.
