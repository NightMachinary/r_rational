    oh, just realized -- the DHD got blown up when they borrowed it from the Russians.

Details. /Prometheus/ is a season 7 episode, so they should have a homegrown interstellar warship at this point, go steal a DHD from an abandoned world near Earth. Grab some extra Stargates while you're at it - you never know when you'll need an extra one or two.

Hell, do like the Go'auld did in Season 1, and keep one on your ship to override the one in-system if needed for quick transport or resupply. That was actually a clever trick.
