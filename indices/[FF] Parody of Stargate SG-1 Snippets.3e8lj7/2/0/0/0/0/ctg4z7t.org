I've seen worse design requirements, though I'm unsure how we will flip the gate with hydraulic pistons made of salt. Usually this is where you say: "Okay so what you really want is . . . basis behind Gross Concept Error Design requirement."

[[/u/clawclaw]] bite wants a gate room that replicators could not effectively use for resources. So we make a sacrifical ant-replicator gate step in the back to off-site chain, lets say we put the stargate in a chamber made of something useless, but airtight, in orbit, and we put transport rings to the next gate, in another chamber in orbit, and then we put a bomb on ring transporter. Just to be sure lets put this in orbit of a black hole, at least before the replicators eat the asgard, and stage emplacements to de-orbit the chambers if the replicators get through.

Asumming it's airtight I guess we could make the chambers out of salt too.
