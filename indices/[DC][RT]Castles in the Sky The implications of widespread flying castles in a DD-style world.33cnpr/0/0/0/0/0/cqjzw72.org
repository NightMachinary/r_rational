I would argue that it's not a mild consideration at all, in the case of skyscrapers. [[http://books.google.com/books?id=v-41AQAAMAAJ&dq=Cass%20Gilbert%2C%22The%20Financial%20Importance%20of%20Rapid%20Building%22&pg=PA624#v=onepage&q&f=false][Here's the argument from Cass Gilbert]] (famous architect):

  Speaking of such enterprises from the financial aspect it is a rule that holds almost invariably that where the building costs less than the land if properly managed it is a success and where its costs more than the land it is usually a failure. The land value is established by its location and desirability from a renter's standpoint hence high rentals make high land values and conversely low rentals make low land values. The building is merely the machine that makes the land pay. The more economical the machine both in construction and operation provided it fulfills the needs, the more profitable the land. At the same time one must not lose sight of the fact that the machine is none the less a useful one because it has a measure of beauty and that architectural beauty judged even from the economic standpoint has an income bearing value. In my judgment the best equation of building and land is that the building should represent about two thirds of the land value under normal conditions.

I mean ... sure, the optimal height for the Empire State Building was [[https://books.google.com/books?id=rQ0XAwAAQBAJ&lpg=PA186&ots=P-R7EDOukI&dq=clark%20and%20kingston%201930&pg=PA177#v=onepage&q&f=false][75 stories from a purely economic standpoint]] and they added on an extra floors for observation decks and a (impractical) mooring tower. But the primary driver that got it most of the way there was economic in nature. This was not a mild consideration at all - the impractical urges don't actually push the building height that much higher.

Whereas something like the pyramids is a much better example, because it served no practical function at all.
