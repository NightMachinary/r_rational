Human beings would /totally/ have flying castles if could, for absolutely no practical reason whatsoever other than that it's cooler than a regular castle. If there's a /practical/ reason for it, that would just be an extra bonus.

(Think of skyscrapers. Sure, they save ground space as a neat extra side effect and maybe that's what first spurred the push towards taller buildings, but mostly we just make them excessively tall because it's cool and kind of a competition. Or the pyramids, which basically began as "I want a really, really, really impressive place to put my corpse". Humans are not particularly practical creatures.)
