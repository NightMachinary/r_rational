  Think of skyscrapers. Sure, they save ground space as a neat extra side effect and maybe that's what first spurred the push towards taller buildings, but mostly we just make them excessively tall because it's cool and kind of a competition.

That's not entirely true. Skyscrapers are built because putting money and people who will work with it in proximity to each-other tends to generate extremely high real-estate costs. When there's not as much money in your region and civic planning isn't completely borked, you can usually spread out quite a lot, and thus don't need skyscrapers. When there's tons of money but you feel no compunction about needing lots of people in proximity to it, you can build suburbia/exurbia, and basically California happens. When there's neither money nor population, you just have plain, ordinary rural poverty, which tends to spread itself somewhat but not too much.

This is why skyscraper construction tends to correlate so well with economic bubbles.
