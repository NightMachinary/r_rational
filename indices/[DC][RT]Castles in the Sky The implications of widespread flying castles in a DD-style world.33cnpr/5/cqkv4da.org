I think I can buy most of this, actually.

Levitated objects in this system clearly take off and land by just sort of being lowered vertically to and from the ground, so it's pretty obviously most efficient to give them a flat base. Air resistance would seem to imply a boatlike shape, but if you assume they fly "diagonally" it could still look castle-y.

I'm not an expert on pseudomedieval architecture, but I think these castles have base area as a limiting factor (there's no mention of "overloading" castles, but flying cities run into "unknown scaling issues") and "big stone tower" is the tallest kind of building around in pseudomedieval settings, right? Maybe stick some gardens on the roof, because why not.

The military potential of this sort of thing are absurdly broken, so I can completely buy that the first "flying castles" were literal castles people used to drop rocks on each other. The article seems to imply that modern "castles" still haven't quite escaped the assumption that they're military in nature, which is probably why they're not known as "flying warehouses" or somesuch.

The magitech stuff seems a tad ridiculous, but it's running on an unknown magic system in which "magic sails" is apparently a plausible explanation for how one would move ... I don't even know how much weight is implied by this, but it's a lot. It receives no explanation, but there you are.

Stuff I'd do if it were me:

- The obvious route would be to try and extend your castle out sideways and downward once it's in the air, assuming the magic doesn't arbitrarily forbid this.
- Cost aside, I don't see why you wouldn't have backup spell-engines or wizards ready to "catch" you if you start to fall. Seems like a basic precaution to take.
- Is there no teleportation magic at all? That doesn't seem very D&D-y.
- Not sure I buy that "gnomish spell-engines" and "mortal spellcasters" balance out so perfectly, instead of one or the other being much better.
- It makes more sense to build in the air and just never land, unless the magic prevents that somehow (maybe you have to set up markers on the ground to "target" the spell, or something.)
