Castles are expensive, even if all you need is a stone cup with a roof. It takes a long time for even one flying castle to pay itself off relative to an extra camel. It takes a long time to see /any/ revenue.

Maintaining a camel requires a decently skilled peasant earning a pittance. One such peasant can maintain dozens of camels. Adding an additional camel to a caravan is a small, incremental cost, and you see a return on the investment pretty quickly.

Sure, it takes twenty caravans to match the cargo capacity of one flying castle -- but you've got your first caravan loaded, traded, and returned by the time the castle's got its foundations laid. Hell, if you have the capital for a whole castle, you can have all twenty caravans provisioned and sent out. And that's probably not including the cost of lifting the bloody thing off the ground.

Housing artisans to work on finished goods? That seems kind of silly. The artisan gets to view strange cities on occasion -- but probably only three or four, ever -- but she gets a small bunk and poor rations and has to deal with the castle tilting in the more turbulent winds. The castle loses out on thousand cubic feet and a thousand kilograms of storage (the person, the bunk, professional gear, food, and water). Moving raw materials instead has a bit of latency, but it's much more efficient.

Gardens on a flying castle? That seems rather silly too. The weight of water, dirt, and wood spent on one fruit tree would feed one person for the entire expedition, probably, and it would produce far less food than that. The reason you bring livestock is to have fresh meat, so unless there was a pressing need for fresh fruit -- but it would only be available in one season.

Sending in flying castles to conquer an island with a valuable trade good? You can do that will ships, too. A flying castle is just a granite-clad battleship.

If you can build a cheaper structure to fly, and you can keep it in the air cheaply, and it moves as fast as a camel, then you have an argument for flying structures for trade. But this thing is outrageously expensive to maintain. Or if castles scaled significantly better -- one person being able to maintain the spell for anything from a flying dinghy to a small city -- you could make up for the expense with the outrageous capacity. Think one castle handling several percentage points on a major trade route, with a complement of, say, six mages keeping it aloft. But at the efficiency they're talking about, I don't see it happening.
