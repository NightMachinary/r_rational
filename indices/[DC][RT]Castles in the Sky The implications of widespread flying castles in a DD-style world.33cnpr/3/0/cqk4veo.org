Exactly what I came here to say.

If you can read windspeed and direction for various heights other than where you are, you can move the castle up and down in order to change speed and sometimes direction. But still, you're dependent on the wind at some altitude blowing in the direction you need.

It's safe, but it's pretty unreliable.
