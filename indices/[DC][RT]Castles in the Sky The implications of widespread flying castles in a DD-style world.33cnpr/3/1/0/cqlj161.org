If you have differences in wind speed, you can pick up speed by flying in circles. If the wind is moving and you're not, then from another point of reference you're moving and the wind's not, so you can turn around and be travelling faster than the wind, but going against it is still impossible. If you're already still in still air, you'll never move. Changing the point of reference to already moving in moving air won't help.
