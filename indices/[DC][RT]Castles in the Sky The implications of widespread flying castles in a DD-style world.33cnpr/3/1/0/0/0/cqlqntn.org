The speed difference can be used as a power source. You can slow air and speed water, and extract energy to speed up yourself. As long as you have limitless moving air and still water, there's no theoretical limit to how fast you can go. But if everything's moving at the same speed, you have no power source. From the point of reference where it's all stopped, there's zero energy, and no way to increase that.
