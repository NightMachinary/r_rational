I think skyscrapers are a bad example, but I agree in general principle. If a floating castle were possible, someone would build it in order to stroke his ego. But I don't think that you would see it used in trade like the article suggests, nor do I think it would be the norm.

The world is full of big flashy things that only exist for social or psychological reasons. But the world is /more/ full of things that exist because of economics, and would stop existing as soon as economics dictated it. Look at the long-haul semis that clog the United States, or strip malls, or the precision engineering that goes into an aluminum soda can. I'm totally fine with having some mad king float his castle because his wife made him a cuckold or whatever - but suggesting floating castles as the primary vehicle of trade doesn't make sense.
