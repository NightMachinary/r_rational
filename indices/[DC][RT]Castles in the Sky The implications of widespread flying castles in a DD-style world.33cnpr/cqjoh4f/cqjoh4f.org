If you want /trade/, you don't do it with a flying castle. A castle's purpose is primarily defensive - that's why you have thick stone walls and battlements, and sometimes a moat. If you wanted to simply move goods, you wouldn't make a castle, you would make something that maximizes cargo space while remaining light and maneuverable (and not bloody expensive to build). Castles are not known for their aerodynamic properties, and if you're moving them with a giant sail, you're better off making them out of something not at all castle shaped. This is true even if the base levitation spell doesn't have any increased costs based on mass.

Instead, you would make flying ships.

(If you want a justification for flying castles, you need to give some better incentives for their existence - for example, some dangerous predator on the ground, or some dangerous predator in the air that would tear any /normal/ ship apart, or a method of propulsion that explicitly doesn't have any respect for mass or aerodynamics. And then you're still going to run into problems with the logic of it, because you have limited space available to you, which means that you would have to start cutting out all the extraneous functions of a castle pretty darn quick.)
