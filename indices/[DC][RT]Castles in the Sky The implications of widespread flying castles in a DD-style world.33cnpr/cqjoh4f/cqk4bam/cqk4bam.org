If you're carrying vast amounts of expensive cargo, you'll need to protect it. I don't know if the flying castles will look like what we normally call castles, but that doesn't make them not castles. On the other hand, the lack of nobility does make them not castles. Flying fortresses would be more accurate.

Edit: Boats can't really be made of stone. Flying castles apparently can. It has downsides, but it has upsides as well. Someone can't burn down a stone flying castle. Perhaps they'd have wooden ones for flammable cargo (so burning it down removes the entire point of piracy) and stone ones for non-flammable cargo.
