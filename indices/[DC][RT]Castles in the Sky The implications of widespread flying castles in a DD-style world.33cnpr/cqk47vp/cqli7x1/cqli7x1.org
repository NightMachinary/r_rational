Boats [[http://www.discoverboating.com/resources/article.aspx?id=253][can sail upwind]]. If the wind across the castle is perfectly homogeneous and the castle is already moving as fast as the wind, you are stuck, but if there's a difference you can use that difference to do work. I'm not sure if a flying castle could move against the wind using wind power only, but I wouldn't be surprised.
