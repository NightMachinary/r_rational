Something I worked out during the first update chapter: Raven found Juniper by way of a tip /from the Library/. So when Raven leaves the Library, it should snap to the state in which Juniper vanishes from Aerb (or not, given the natural predictive error rate). When he actually /does/ enter the library, resetting it again and vanishing from Aerb, that's still merely the second time his absence has been modeled.

527 FE was when Juniper ran his 'Council of Arches' campaign. That's the only reference to the present I could find by the (case-sensitive) strings "527" and "FE".

598 is decent.

Oh right, alternate unicorn futures. For a moment I was bewildered.

What a rush. I saw the email basically right away, so it's been a bit over three hours. @_@
