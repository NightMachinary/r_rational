It depends on exactly how the library's system works. If it's possible to publish a book with a fake publication date, then all she'd have to do is Kill Marry and then write a bunch of books using her name. Everything inside the books would be fake, so she could live her life however she wanted.

Unfortunately I don't remember if the library has protections against that kind of thing.

edit: You're actually right. I forgot that June would potentially have access to other books that disagreed with whatever fake future Valencia could predict. So if he looked at other books from the time period and they contradicted, that would cause some issues with the simplified plan I laid out.
