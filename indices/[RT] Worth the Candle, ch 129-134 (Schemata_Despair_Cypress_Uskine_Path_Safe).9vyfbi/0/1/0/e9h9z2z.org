You'd need to minimise not-Valencia-related alterations to the book, and acting would be far less invasive then pulling a massive conspiracy.

That said, it would depend entirely on what Valencia wants - if It's All About Her, then she /probably/ wouldn't want to sacrifice her entire life's happiness for the sake of her happiness, in which case manipulation would be better than acting.
