Thargox was present, via entad-possession of a willing "victim", at the first meeting of the council of Arches with the group who wanted to kill Uther/Juniper. They have also been mentioned several times as a facilitator for particularly large and otherwise infeasible warding efforts (warding the druid bottle, and fel seed's domain in the fake future lacking Joon.)

AFAIK that's all we know.
