/God/, I have to say- this story could use a wiki. There are so many characters and skills and mechanics, all with their little nuances and details.

For example, I don't know the exact mechanics of sacrificing Skills with Essentialism, or what Skills even are there.\\
Also Thargox. I /think/ it's the Couch Potato God, but I am not sure. And searching requires pouring through chapter after chapter.
