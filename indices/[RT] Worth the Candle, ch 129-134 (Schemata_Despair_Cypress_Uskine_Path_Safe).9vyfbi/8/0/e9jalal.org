  Yeah, Joon is never letting this guy out again

I was thinking about it and actually there's a decent chance lvl!Joon has the right of it.

I don't think the DM has ever actually said what it is that Joon needs to accomplish in order to take the Overgod spot. We all assume that it's quest-based - he's got to do something or other and save the world.

That makes sense from Joon's perspective because the way he runs all his games is via narrative quid-pro-quo: the player does a quest to advance the story, and the DM rewards them with more quest hooks that advance the story.

The thing is, there's /two/ tangible benefits to following the narrative - you advance the story, sure, but *you also get XP*.

What if the thing that is going to get Joon the overgod spot isn't completing the story, but /literally gaining those powers through the system/? Then completing quests will get him there eventually, but there might be faster ways to go up the power curve.

Joon seems to despise munchkinry. He's avoided re-speccing his character sheet in a life where a sub-optimal build could literally get him killed.

But you know where munchkinry gets you? Pun-pun. A kobold who ascends to literal overgod status by manipulating a series of poorly-worded rules.

And then, once you're the overgod, it doesn't really matter who you betrayed or what companions you killed to get there, does it? You can just set the universe to whatever idyllic state you want.
