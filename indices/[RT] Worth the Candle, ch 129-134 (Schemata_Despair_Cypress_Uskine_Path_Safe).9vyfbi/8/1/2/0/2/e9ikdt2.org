Of course there are reasons to want to level up without the addiction, it makes him stronger and better able to protect his friends, honestly I think he has been letting leveling wane a bit simply because he keeps lowering it's value, it doesn't just lower the addiction but also the other motivations he might have to level up, I hope he can fix this through spirit, just cancelling out the addiction.
