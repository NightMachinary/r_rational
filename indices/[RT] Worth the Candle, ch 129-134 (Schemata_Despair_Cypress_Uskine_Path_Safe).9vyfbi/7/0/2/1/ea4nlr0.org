It doesn't look like Spirit Magic can do much that daily Soul Magic can't do, though.

I mean, realistically, finding your True Love is something that happens rarely, and not to everyone. I think it's realistic that, during her entire political career, Mary would never meet someone that matches her core values and tastes as well as Joon does.

They do have pretty good chemistry, to be honest. They have similar interests. Joon is always willing to listen to Mary and hear her out, and he legitimately considers and analyzes her ideas, but he also stands for himself when he disagrees with her. Their qualities complement each other's flaws.

(except for the whole "killing people" thing; they're kind of a bad on influence on each other in that regard)

I think Spirit magic can alter your sexual and romantic preferences (it could probably make Mary permanently heterosexual, for instance), but I don't think it can alter what kind of person you'd want to spend your life with, not without also changing some pretty central parts of your personality.
