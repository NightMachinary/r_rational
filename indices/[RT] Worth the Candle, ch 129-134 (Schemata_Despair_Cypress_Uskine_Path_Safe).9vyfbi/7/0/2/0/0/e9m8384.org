Based on the explanations so far, I'm thinking of this using a programming analogy. If the entirety of a being is a class of some sort, then Soul magic allows for editing the variables, and Spirit magic allows for editing the functions.

So, in theory, anything whatsoever should be possible with the two of them.

Buut some things, including age, could definitely be arbitrarily locked (the way some skills are in the Soul), just to avoid the skill being game-breaking. On the other hand, Arthur must've had a decent reason for eliminating every practitioner out there - it must be pretty damn powerful as is.
