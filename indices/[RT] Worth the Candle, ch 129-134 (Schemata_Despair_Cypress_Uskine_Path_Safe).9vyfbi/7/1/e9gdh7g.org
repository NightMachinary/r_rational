The single-letter words give a hint as to the composition of the cipher: each of the following letters was a single-letter word in the second text: "e,u,z,x,r", which is too many to support the two one-letter words "a,i".

Additionally, there are the following words with apostrophes:

​

three letter apostrophe words: "it's, he's, he'd, we'd, it'd"

four letter apostrophe words: "don't, can't, isn't, won't, she's, you'd, let's, who's, she'd, ain't, who'd"

six letter: "doesn't, there's, world's, haven't, weren't, mustn't, needn't"

yf'a

Vo'w

eyr'u

bgseu'r

Zzout'v

​

So it's not a simple substitution cipher. The apostrophe alignment hints that letters are at least in order, though. hmmmm.

​

Oh, also the distribution of letters is all wrong for it being a reordering technique -- there is substitution going on, and they are probably the same encoding.
