Except that she explicitly says she didn't think about it^{1}:

#+begin_quote
  There are things that I wish I could say to her that I would only say in confidence, and this book can't possibly be considered secure. <...> We could have done one-time pads, if I had thought about it
#+end_quote

And sure, there's no in-universe reason to believe that hypothetical Earth readers of Juniper's retelling of the story would be able to crack Amaryllis' encryption. But let's use meta-level reasoning (or meta-meta, I suppose):

We were provided the encrypted text in full; the narrative didn't gloss over it, as it could have. We got an explicit confirmation that it's not completely unbreakable, see the quote above. And it's written by an author from a community that enjoys being given such in-story puzzles, for said community.

I'm not /sure/ that it's breakable, but there's a convincing case in favour of it.

^{1. I suppose she could have lied, but all it would've accomplished is wasting Juniper's time in the hypothetical where he decides to decode it, which I don't see a major reason for her to do.}
