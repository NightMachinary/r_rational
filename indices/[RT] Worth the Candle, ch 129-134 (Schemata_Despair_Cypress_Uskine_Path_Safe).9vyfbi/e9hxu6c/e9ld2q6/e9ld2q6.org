re-editing basically the whole comment.

A few counter-examples just off the top of my head.

- Fenn's loyalty leap under unicorn blood. It makes no sense for Joon to raise loyalty under unicorn blood, and then not remember it at all. It makes perfect sense in the original model, though, that Fenn became more loyal as she got to see raw unfiltered Joon and liked what she saw.

- Amaryllis' bump at Auman's (ch 32) is a perfect counter-example to your theory. According to your theory, the bump must've happened before, or right at the very start of the assault. Then, there was no speech action because wards, duh.

- Grak's initial jump came to be after Joon simply pitched a smart idea. More importantly the second jump happened not when Joon commited to being totally honest with Grak, but only after Grak had a few moments to process it.

- Juniper never receives a Loyalty increase when he can't see the companion. Works both ways. Reading Fenn's letter did not produce a bump, although she really opened up. Oh, and by the way, the subsequent jump absolutely did happen without any words.

So, yeah. Not so strong.
