It seems like a normal thing to wonder about. If my daily interactions with friends produced 'Loyalty' values I would definitely be curious as to why certain interactions increased the value but that doesn't mean I would start valuing 'Loyalty' as a metric over what it said in the abstract about the quality of my relationships. In this example it is particularly noteworthy because other Companions revealed their status much sooner or after much less of an (apparent) personal connection; noting that contrast and speculating why seems a natural reaction to me.
