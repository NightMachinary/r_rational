This can be solved by acknowledging Ravens ultra high character level. She /has/ 30 years of Uthering under her belt.

Consider: Amy+Joon told Raven that there was a high chance of him going rogue in the library if Amy was not there with him. Dooming Aerb in the process. Amy+Raven - onscreen - just shrugged that off. This is inconsistent with both their characters.

So the inference is that they had a nice chat offscreen, Amy+Raven talk about worst case scenarios, Amy says "hes really strong. He can do this that and that." Raven goes: "I have thirty years with Uther under my belt. I can absolutely 100% take Joon right now, even if he were 5 times stronger than he is now. " - as that was what happened.
