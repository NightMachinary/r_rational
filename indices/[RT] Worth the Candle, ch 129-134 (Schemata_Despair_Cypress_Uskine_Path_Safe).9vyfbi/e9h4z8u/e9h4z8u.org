That's...really bad characterization for different value systems character.

Imagine you were a cannibal. You fuckin love skin. You crave the flesh. Everyone else in the world hates you for it. There is nearly no context where you would not only stop wanting to eat people, but /stop wanting to want to eat people/, especially not after a token "oh people don't like me eating people, better stop and then hope i want to eat people again when it's safer" self-argument. Level Up is such a high value event for Joon that it's probably akin to you convincing yourself to stop valuing breathing so much.

That's not how transitioning a value function works - they're /internally consistent and metastable/ at every point. Transitioning only happens if you also currently value having the new value function, just like how you don't spontaneously become a cannibal by imagining how much you'd love being a canninal if you were a cannibal.

The entire last chapter feels like a massive cop out, honestly. Not only does Evil Joon commit identity death, but Raven /accepts Joon telling her he's OK now/. He just tried to kill her minutes ago, and she knows how much he values Levelling Up. There's no reason she should listen to what he has to say, other than belief that anti-infohazard protocols leading to braindeath is worse than him murderhoboing. She knows he's an expert Soul mage, too, and so would have a host of way to backdoor faking going back to "normal". She not only frees him without anyone being able to double-check his soul, but betrays all her fellow librarians to do it.
