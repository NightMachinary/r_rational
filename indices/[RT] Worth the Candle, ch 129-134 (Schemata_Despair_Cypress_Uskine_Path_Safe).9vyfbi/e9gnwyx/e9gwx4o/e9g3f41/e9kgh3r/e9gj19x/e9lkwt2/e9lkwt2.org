I don't know if this would be considered a typo or something else, but...

In earlier chapters, Joon brought up the infohazards, in regards to the Actual Cannibal's name being said by Bethyl. When he described the transmission mechanism, she /immediately/ corrected him about how that wasn't a infohazard, and went into a description about the differences between comhazards, cognitohazards, and infohazards. Like this was a distinction that mattered, and should offer insight into the level of specificity she is used to in dealing with this phenomenon.

However, in the recent batch if chapters, she throws all that away, and uses infohazard as the go to work for anything memetic, including usages inconsistent with the previous definitions she hers gave.

As an example, the whole miraculous thing. That is pretty obviously a cognitohazard thing. It isn't dangerous to /know/ about the miraculous food, or to /know/ about baked chicken, or chocolate, or broccoli, or snot. It is 'dangerous' however, to be /thinking/ about snot while partaking in the miraculous.

The lazy use of the label 'infohazard' when she had made a deal about it earlier just stood out to me, is all.
