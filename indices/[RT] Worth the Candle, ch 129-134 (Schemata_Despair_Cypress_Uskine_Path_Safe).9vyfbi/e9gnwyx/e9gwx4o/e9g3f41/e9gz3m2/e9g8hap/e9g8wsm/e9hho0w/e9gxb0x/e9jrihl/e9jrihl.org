  Really sucks that not only did Joon kill or cripple several incredibly selfless and dedicated people, and then have Raven also betray them in order to get Joon out.

I've been starting to think the librarians might be part of the overall problem, and not of the solution. They do not seem to have a way to check for negative outcomes of their own involvement in the course of History, though. But I don't remember reading anything that would suggest they at the very least entertained the possibility.
