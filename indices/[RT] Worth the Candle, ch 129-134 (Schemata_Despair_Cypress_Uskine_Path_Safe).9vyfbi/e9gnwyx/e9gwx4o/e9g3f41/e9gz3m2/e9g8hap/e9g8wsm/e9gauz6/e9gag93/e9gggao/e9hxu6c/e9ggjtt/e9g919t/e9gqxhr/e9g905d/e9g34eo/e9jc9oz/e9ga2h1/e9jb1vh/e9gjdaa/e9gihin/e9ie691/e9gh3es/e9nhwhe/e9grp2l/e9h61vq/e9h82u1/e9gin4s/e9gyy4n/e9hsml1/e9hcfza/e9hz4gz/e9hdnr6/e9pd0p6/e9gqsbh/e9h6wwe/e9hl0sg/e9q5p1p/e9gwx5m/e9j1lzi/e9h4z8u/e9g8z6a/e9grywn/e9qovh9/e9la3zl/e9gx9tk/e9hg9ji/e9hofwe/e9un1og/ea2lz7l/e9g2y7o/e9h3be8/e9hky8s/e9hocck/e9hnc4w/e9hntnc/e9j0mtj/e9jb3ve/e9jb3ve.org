I'm thinking of a more pragmatic reason.

I don't think soul-magic-modified feelings would register differently from the "real ones" internally. It's possible that there's some subtle effect, but we don't have evidence in favour of it, and plenty for the contrary: Fallatehr apparently happily functioned for centuries after deleting his fear, Grak has found Fallatehr's alteration /preferable/ to his default state, Juniper's current "genuine" personality is that of a level-up maximizer we saw in the last two chapters, and so on. I don't think Amaryllis undid it because her unaltered state feels more... eudaemonic.

I suspect one of these alternatives:

- An experiment to see whether she would "get over it" (and, naturally, report her findings to primary!Amaryllis).

- An attempt to catch the DM or the narrative's attention, bring them into a timeline clearly devoid of their influence.

- An attempt to resolve Juniper x Amaryllis plot arc, or at least this particular plot point.

- Some kind of soul magic research project.

(Knowing Amaryllis, probably all of these.)
