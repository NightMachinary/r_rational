Yeah, I think LevelUp Juniper gave up too quickly also. It's a little hard to believe he would tone down his own utility function that literally defines him, but I think the author wrote himself into a corner with that one. Hard to come up something reasonable to solve that issue.

And everyone who played min-maxing psychopathic RPG character knows the best way to maximise exp is to do all the peaceful heroic quests and exhaust all dialogue first before coming back around to kill the questgivers. Going all murdery immediately locks you out of so many sidequests.
