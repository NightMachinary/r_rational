Alright, let's evaluate this theory against new companion Raven:

#+begin_quote
  “I ...” I didn't know where to begin. “I haven't told you about Maddie.”

  “Maddie?” asked Raven. “The one I look like?”
#+end_quote

And then Juniper has a pretty good paragraph

#+begin_quote
  Raven watched me for a moment, not making a move. "Okay," she finally said. "I'll get you out."

  */Loyalty increased: Raven lvl 1!/*
#+end_quote

Loyalty sort of seems to be going in the direction you describe. In this case he's volunteering something of a secret. I think it checks out.
