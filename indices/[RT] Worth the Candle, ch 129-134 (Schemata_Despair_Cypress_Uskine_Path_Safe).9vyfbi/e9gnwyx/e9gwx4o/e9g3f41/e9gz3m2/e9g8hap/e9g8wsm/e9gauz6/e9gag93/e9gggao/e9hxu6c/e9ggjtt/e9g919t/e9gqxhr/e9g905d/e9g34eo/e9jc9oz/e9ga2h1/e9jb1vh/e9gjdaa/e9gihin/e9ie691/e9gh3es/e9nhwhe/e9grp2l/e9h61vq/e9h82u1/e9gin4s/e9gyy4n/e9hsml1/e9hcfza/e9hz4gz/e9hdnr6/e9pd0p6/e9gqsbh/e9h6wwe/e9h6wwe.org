Speculation: on the companions, if I remember correctly Joon originally saw 7 different soul threads - which would make Raven the 7th and last of them. But Fenn is dead, which effectively cut her thread. Will someone replace Fenn? Or is Raven already the replacement? Right now, Pallida seems like the only likely candidate to take the last vacant spot, but there might be other changes later down the road. If companions can indeed be replaced, what would happen if Joon managed to later resurrect Fenn?
