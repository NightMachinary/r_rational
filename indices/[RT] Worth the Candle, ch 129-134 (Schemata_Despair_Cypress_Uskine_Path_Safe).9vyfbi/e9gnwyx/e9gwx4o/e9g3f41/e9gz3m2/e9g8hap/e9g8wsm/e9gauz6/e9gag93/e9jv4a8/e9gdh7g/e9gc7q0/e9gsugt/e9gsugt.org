In the first chapter of the update when they are talking about interleaving, Juniper uses the example of a "shelf of 300 books" that is triple interleaved. The first paragraph has exactly 300 characters, counting punctuation and discounting spaces (which is the default method of character counting in word). Perhaps that is a hint that there are three codes which alternate by letter?
