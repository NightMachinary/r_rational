  The solution doesn't make sense considering that Joon should have known fixed Joon would prevent level-up-Joon from returning.

  In my current state of devotion to the â€˜Level Up', I would be dependent on my social graces and ability to act innocent in order to convince Raven to let me out. To be blunt, that wasn't going to happen. However, if I was going to be subjected to their ministrations and be forced back into my old state anyway, that would likely put me back weeks or even months from the next level. The easiest way to pass the tests wasn't to lie, it was to really pass them, because I was who I claimed to be.

tl;dr lvl!Juniper was a dead man walking, and clinging to his values would just waste weeks of his life that normal!Juniper could have otherwise spent levelling up. He lost because Raven completely outclassed him, not because he gave up.
