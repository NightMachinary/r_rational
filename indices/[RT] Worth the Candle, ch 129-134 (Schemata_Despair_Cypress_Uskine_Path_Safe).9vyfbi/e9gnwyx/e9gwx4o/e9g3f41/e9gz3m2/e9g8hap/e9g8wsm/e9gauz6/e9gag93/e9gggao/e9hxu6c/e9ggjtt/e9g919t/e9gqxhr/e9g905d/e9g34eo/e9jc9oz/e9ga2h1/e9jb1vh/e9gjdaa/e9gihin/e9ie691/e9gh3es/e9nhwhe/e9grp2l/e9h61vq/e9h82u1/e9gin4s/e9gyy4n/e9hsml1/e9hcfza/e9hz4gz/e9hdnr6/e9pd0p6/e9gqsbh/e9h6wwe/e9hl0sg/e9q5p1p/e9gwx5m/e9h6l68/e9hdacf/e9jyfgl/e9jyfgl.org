Neither is addiction to level up - Juniper will still want to level up for practical reasons (and will still enjoy leveling up, without addiction), and will likely make a point of doing so sooner rather than later, seeing as how there are a bajillion different things he needs to kill in order to survive/achieve his goals, and leveling up is a major route towards being able to kill that stuff.
