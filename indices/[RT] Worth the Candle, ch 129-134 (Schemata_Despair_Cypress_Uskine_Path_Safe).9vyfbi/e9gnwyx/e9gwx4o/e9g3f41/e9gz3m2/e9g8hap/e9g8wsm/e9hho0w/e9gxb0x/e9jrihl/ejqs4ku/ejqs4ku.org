  And what a finale to the Library arc. I was specifically afraid of him levelling up from the Spirit Magic quest, and not having Raven on lockdown duty just in case was stupid. Really sucks that not only did Joon kill or cripple several incredibly selfless and dedicated people, and then have Raven also betray them in order to get Joon out.

I get why he wrote it this way because it's pretty fun, but it's constantly pissing me off that it makes absolutely Zero sense for this to have happened, why did Joon have such a lapse of judgement he risked a level up like that? I can't work it out
