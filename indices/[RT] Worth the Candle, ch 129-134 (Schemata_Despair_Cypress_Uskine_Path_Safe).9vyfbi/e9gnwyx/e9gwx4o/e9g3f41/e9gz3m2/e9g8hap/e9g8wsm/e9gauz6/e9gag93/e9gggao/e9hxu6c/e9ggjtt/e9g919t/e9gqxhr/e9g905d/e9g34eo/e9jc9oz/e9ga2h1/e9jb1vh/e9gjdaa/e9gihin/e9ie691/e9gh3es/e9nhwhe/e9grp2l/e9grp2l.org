I underestimated how terrible and dreadful that Level Up would be.

Not only a sort of personality kill, but also scores of innocent lives lost just like that. No wonder people wanted Juniper dead, given how there's a ticking time bomb in his head that gets worse and worse as he gets more powerful/adaptable.

Did Uther ever have that problem? It's quite strange.
