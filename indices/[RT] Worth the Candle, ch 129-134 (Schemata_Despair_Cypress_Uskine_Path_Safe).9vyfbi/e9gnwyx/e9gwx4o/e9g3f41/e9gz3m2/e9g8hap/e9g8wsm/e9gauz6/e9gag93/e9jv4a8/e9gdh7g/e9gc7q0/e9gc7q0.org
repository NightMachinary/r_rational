It not an obvious rot13 or Caesar Cipher, at least not one in Anglish. The Caps in "Ifmsnes Faicpp" do line up nicely with Dungeon Master but it can't be just a simple substitution, there has to be some kind of key in addition (at least) because there's at least 5 (e, u, Z, X, r) instances of different 1 letter words and English only has the common ones of I and a.

A similar bound occurs with apostrophe's, for a single apostrophe, the following letter in 99% of cases should be t or s.

I need to think more about this :) Do we have any bits of text or secret personal mottos that only Mary would know about Mary?
