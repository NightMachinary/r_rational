It's not actually true, since people do contradictory or self-sabotoging things all the time. But it's generally true, in that 1) you will never spontaneously decide to go commit a murder for no reason, because it's contradictory to your own self-interests even if it's rational in the context of a different value function 2) you won't spontaneously transition out of your local maxima of being pretty happy not killing people to the non-local maxima being /very/ happy killing people.

Agents can be preoccupied with a goal, yes, but they'll still value everything else they value, even if they aren't considering the consequences of their actions or knock-on effects that would hurt those values.

Joon by definition is editing his own value function. If that's not a transition, I'm not sure what is.
