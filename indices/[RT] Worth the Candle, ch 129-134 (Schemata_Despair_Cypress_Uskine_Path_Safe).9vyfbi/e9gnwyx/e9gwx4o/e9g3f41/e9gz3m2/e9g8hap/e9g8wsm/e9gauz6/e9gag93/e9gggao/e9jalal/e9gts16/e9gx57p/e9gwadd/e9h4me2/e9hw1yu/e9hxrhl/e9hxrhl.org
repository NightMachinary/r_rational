It's the same reason June advocates for going to the Hells instead of having his soul removed. Lvl!June sees a slim chance of his recurrence as better than none.

Also, I doubt he truly sees himself as a different entity from June, hence the talk at "future self" and not "other June." It's less Angelus/Angel from Buffy, more Lvl!June viewing the normal version of himself as shackled in a way that he will, eventually, not be.
