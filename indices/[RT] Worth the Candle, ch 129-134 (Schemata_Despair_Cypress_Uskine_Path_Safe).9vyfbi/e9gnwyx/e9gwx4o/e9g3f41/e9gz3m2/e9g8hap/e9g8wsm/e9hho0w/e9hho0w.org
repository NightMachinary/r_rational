  not only did Joon kill or cripple several incredibly selfless and dedicated people, and then have Raven also betray them in order to get Joon out.

Seriously. From the perspective of the library and any of the other secretive organisations they're involved with Joon is now an existential level threat. From their pov he just turned one of the most powerful people out there, probably with some kind of memetic weapon, or soul magic, as well as his own powers. Who is going to believe "after his mental hijacking he got better and I decided to help him of my own free will."
