Well yeah, it is a daily thing to shove it back down because it continually creeps up. Both because those things normalize over time, and that Amaryllis is very very fond of him and trusts him a lot, so the conditions are still there.

As for Queen Amaryllis, well, I can really see why she'd eventually cease that daily ritual. It was always rewriting her own soul to get rid of feelings that were causing problems, always denying an aspect of herself. And one day, knowing that it will no longer cause friction, she finally lets herself feel it. Feeling your own genuine feelings would feel liberating, I'd think. It might make his absence hurt more, but she can make peace with herself, and she's tough enough to take it and keep going.

That's my estimation of the emotional reasons she chose to stop doing it.
