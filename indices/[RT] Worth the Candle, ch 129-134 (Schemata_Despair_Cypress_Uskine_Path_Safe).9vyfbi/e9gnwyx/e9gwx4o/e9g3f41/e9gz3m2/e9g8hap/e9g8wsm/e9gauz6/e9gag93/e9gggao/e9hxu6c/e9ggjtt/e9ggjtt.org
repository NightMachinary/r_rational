Joon's level-up insanity reminds me a great deal of the bijuu possession scene in The Waves Arisen, which I think is part of why I like it so much. In both stories, the protagonist decides to kill their companions not due to cliched outside forces, but due to twisted versions of internal value change. It's way better (and more convincing) than the usual case of someone being mind-controlled and then fighting it off with willpower or the power of love it whatever. They even fix it in the same way-- by making choices that appeal to their new values but revert them to their old values.

It's a cool parallel, imo. Definitely a good way to write a rational supernatural insanity scene.
