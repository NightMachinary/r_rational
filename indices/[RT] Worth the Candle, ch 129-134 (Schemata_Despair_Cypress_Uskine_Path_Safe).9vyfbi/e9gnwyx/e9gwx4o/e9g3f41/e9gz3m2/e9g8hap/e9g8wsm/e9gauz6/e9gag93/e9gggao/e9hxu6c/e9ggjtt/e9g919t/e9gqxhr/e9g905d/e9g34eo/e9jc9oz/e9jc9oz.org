Regarding the coded messages, people are massively overthinking it. If it's meant to be solved, it's got to be easy. It's missing J, so it's a polygrammic cipher. Bigrams are too hard, so it's Bifid. Bifid needs a keyword. You just guessed what the keyword is and then thought "no that would be too obvious". (It's JUNIPER)

Your ancestors and relatives poisoned you. You were always too cautious and to manipulative. That was not your fault. Your fault lies in not recognizing that poison and working to excise it. Juniper can help you with that if you let him. I won't suggest that you need to love him or reverse what you have done to your soul, but it would help, if and when he's over Fenn.

You love him. It's a deep love. Maybe you induced it in yourself as an ill-conceived experiment in manipulating him, or maybe it was the divine will of the Dungeon Master, but that doesn't substantially change the math. Your love for him is a core part of you, immutable by any technology or magic we have. It will poison any other relationship you have; I speak from experience. I lived past a hundred years old and never got over him, not for lack of trying, and not for lack of incentives. Turn off your dampers and let yourself love him. There's no reason not to.
