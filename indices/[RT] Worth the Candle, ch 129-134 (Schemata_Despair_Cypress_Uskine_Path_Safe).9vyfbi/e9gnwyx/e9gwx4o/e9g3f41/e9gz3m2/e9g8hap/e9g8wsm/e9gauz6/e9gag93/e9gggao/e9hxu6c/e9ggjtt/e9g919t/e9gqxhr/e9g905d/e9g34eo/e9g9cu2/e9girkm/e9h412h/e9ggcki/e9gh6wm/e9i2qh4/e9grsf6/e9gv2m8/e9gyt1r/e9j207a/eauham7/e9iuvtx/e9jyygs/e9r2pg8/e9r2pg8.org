How much do you care about typos like this? Chapter 131: In the sentence "...but I had a good deal of information on the book(s)... [had] slotted into place..." for consistent tenses omit the [had]. Or I suppose you could do, "had had a good deal" and "she'd had with Raven " can't change further haha and "didn't have had slotted" like it already is.
