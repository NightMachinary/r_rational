Specifically, a zildin with a lot of eels on his face is a sign that no one wanted him for some unknown reason, similar to Western cultural connotations around an 'old maid', where as one with very few eels either let them die, or has a lot of living young already. Obviously this is somewhat dependent on other factors as well.
