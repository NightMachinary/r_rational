In regards to the value thing, people do need to remember that Levelup!Joon did what he did knowing that Normal!Joon would still want and need to continue leveling to continue his quest. Levelup!Joon was effectively making a decision to value levelups less, because he knew he would get more levelups more reliably that way. Even if Normal!Joon actively doesn't want to get another level, he has to, because he has to get stronger to accomplish his goals.
