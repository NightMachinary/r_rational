It's been months since I read it, but the biggest obstacle to LevelUp!Joon's desires was impulse control. The entire reason behind his shift is an extremely powerful desire to get the Level Up pleasure again and again and again, like a drug addict except it involves an even more powerful pleasure. This isn't an optimally rational AI with a strongly weighted terminal value, this is a human brain who is really itching to get its next high, so maintaining the charade that his values haven't changed is extremely difficult. I'm almost certain I remember Joon attacking because Raven got suspicious enough to invoke containment or something, he didn't just flip out for no reason.
