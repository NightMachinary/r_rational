Fucking amazing.

First Chapter 131 punches my heart in the dick with Amaryllis being her profoundly strong self and pushing herself for decades into a doomed future. Seriously, I absolutely adored her putting her heart on the page.

And what a finale to the Library arc. I was specifically afraid of him levelling up from the Spirit Magic quest, and not having Raven on lockdown duty just in case was stupid. Really sucks that not only did Joon kill or cripple several incredibly selfless and dedicated people, and then have Raven also betray them in order to get Joon out. She has enemies now, though now that she's an official companion she has the protection of the Council of Arches.

Seriously, amazing stuff. This story is getting dramatically better for me lately.
