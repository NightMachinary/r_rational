Really, I think it's incredibly poor judgement on Raven's part. In retrospect it is also insane that Joon didn't have more contingencies in place for spontaneous level up, it was clear that he is a ticking time bomb. He might have at least distributed a switch that would disable him if multiple trusted people press it.
