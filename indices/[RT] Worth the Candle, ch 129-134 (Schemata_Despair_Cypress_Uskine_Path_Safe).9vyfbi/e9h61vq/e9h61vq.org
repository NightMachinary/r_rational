Absolutely stellar chapters, this is probably my favorite batch of updates so far. Here's my spontaneous thoughts on them.

I felt so sick during chapter 133 that I had to stop reading and check the comment section of this thread to reassure myself. The Cypress "letters" were incredible. Everything about the library is awe-inspiring and I wish we'd spent more time there, since the bridges seem to have been pretty much disintegrated at this point in time. When the chapter ended with a "Level Up" message, I had a huge "oooh shiiiiiit" moment. In the following chapter, it's incredible just how much I was rooting for the protagonist to lose the fight, while dreading that he might win. Unicorn magic seems to be the way to go in order to unlock some of the worst achievements- basically the equivalent to save-scum to unlock a bad ending for personal curiosity. The moment where Raven opened the book with the fractal was wonderful and I felt so much relief. I feel so bad for her by the way and hope that she'll find some way to relieve herself of her inevitable guilt over betraying her comrades. She's such a relatable character and I find myself rooting for her as she has this sort of underdog vibe to her, despite how powerful she clearly is. I loved Joon's reflections on Raven being Maddie's hopeful projection of a better version of herself. I crave world-building, especially when it comes to the grittier sides of Aerb such as exclusion zones and existential threats, which is another reason why I enjoyed these chapters so much.

So yeah, thanks for the update and I can't wait for the next one!
