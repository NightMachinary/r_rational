Theory: soul suppression has a backlash effect because the rest of the mind doesn't reshape properly.

Evidence :

Amy's rejection by Juniper turns into this huge, sad, unerasible pining because she doesn't get over it normally. She hasn't known Joon for that long, there's no reason for hundreds of years to not let her get over it.

Juniper's level up turns into an all consuming drive which produces a creature too shortsighted to think of the future because he doesn't integrate the (non soul level) addiction of level up normally into the rest of his mind.

If he didn't tamper with his soul he might still be a level up maximizer, but a long sighted one.

If Amy didn't tamper she might still love Joon, but in a healthy way as you might love an ex affectionately, not in a "I'll never get over him" way.
