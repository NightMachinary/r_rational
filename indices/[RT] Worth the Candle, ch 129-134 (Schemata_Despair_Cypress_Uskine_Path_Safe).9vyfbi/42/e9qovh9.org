I just binged on this over the last week and wanted to drop some constructive criticism.

First off - I overall really like the story. The best part of it is probably the setting. I wasn't sold on it in the beginning, but it has really grown on me. There are also some brilliant parts of writing (the entire soul magic / mind control plot and to a lesser degree the episode with the illusion magic). You have a knack for pulling off plots that keep the reader guessing. You also have a knack for dialog. It works really well and it's engaging.

On the negative side, I have two main complaints - Juniper as a character hasn't really grown at all. If anything, I feel like after 134 chapters in he's almost become a flanderization of his initial character. It's very frustrating to watch because it seems like the effort goes into other characters, such at this point I'm considering that Amaryllis is either the deuteragonist or just a minor perspective switch away from being the actual protagonist of the story.

The other thing that really bugs me is the difference between the adventure scenes and the overall plot. Generally speaking, each individual adventure arc is pretty good with a lot of rising action and a payoff of some sort at the end (even if it leads directly to another arc). In that way, it's really written so that it feels like a RPG campaign. However, the overarching plot of the story is frankly, meandering. I get that as of recent events we are supposed to feel rising tension due to all of these horrible things that are on the march, but the problem with that is you just told us about it instead of showing us. It really undercuts any sense of rising action in the overall story.

I have some other minor nitpicks, like I don't think Juniper is written with a sense that he has an idealized self. Contrast that with Amaryliss and it's easy to see how he comes up short in that regard. I could flat out tell you what her idea of a perfect Amaryliss is. I also thought killing Fenn right after the breakup was too on the nose and probably the least interesting option (and it appears that we're supposed to forget about it pretty quickly because Juniper seems to be...) Valencia is kind of a Mary Sue type character, but I thought Solace had that spot filled with her "bullshit" magic??

I dunno. Maybe this sounds harsh, it's not intended to be. I feel like too many people just go "good jerb". I tried to take some time to think about the story and the characters and this is what I came up with. That's not to say I didn't like it (I do), but yeah, there are some parts that I think are well within your capabilities to do a lot better.
