Seconding this, I think that'd be fantastic.

Hyposoc, who does the great Polyhistor Academy quest over @ QQ, does some similar worldbuilding interludes. I enjoy some of them more than the main story, something that comes across a bit paranoia-riddled due to having a playerbase and being a survival quest. I could see similar being the case with WTC, which is great, but scaffolded completely to Juniper's neuroses. June's story is great, but sometimes I think the best part of Aerb are the twists it puts on traditional fantasy worldbuilding. "DND Lit," or whatever you wanna call it, is a terribly shallow genre.

Just imagine: "Desperate criminal Fireteam X, put between a rock and a hard place, choose the hard place. They go to one place they know the Empire won't follow: the ____ exclusion zone."
