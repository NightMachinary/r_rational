Did you know that you can [[https://www.patreon.com/alexanderwales][donate money on Patreon]]? We just today passed the last of the Patreon thresholds I set a couple months ago, which means that I'll be commissioning some cover art in the very near future. If you have any suggestions for further goals, let me know (ideally, ones that don't take too much time away from actual writing).

Also, if you'd like to keep track of chapter progress, [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PaLrwVYgxp_SYHtkred7ybpSJPHL88lf4zB0zMKmk1E/edit?usp=sharing][this spreadsheet]] is updated just about every night with word count for future chapters, some metrics, time since last chapter, editing progress, etc.
