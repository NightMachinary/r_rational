Only kind of, it's similar in some things, but unlike whith rokos basilisk joon can actually predict what level addict joon will do.

The right response it's still the same, ignoring the blackmail.

If leveladdict joon wants normal joon to do stuff for him he should make a reasonable trade like accepting being nicer than he would otherwise if normal joon puts effort towards leveling up. Or maybe precomiting to becoming normal joon whenever he becomes level addicted.
