I kinda don't know. Seeing the whole list of achievements he has yet to complete, the time he might need to take to accomplish them, the possibility that the resurrection would happen at the end of the game seems sort of remote. It would be be a Deus Ex Machina at that point, which is the direct opposite of the organic arcs the author comes up with.

If he actually waits all that time till the end of the game, by the end, his experiences might shape him into a type of person with different priorities.
