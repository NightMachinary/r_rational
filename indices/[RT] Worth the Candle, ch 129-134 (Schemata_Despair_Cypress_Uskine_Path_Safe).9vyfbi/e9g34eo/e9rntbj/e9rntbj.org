In chapter 46:

#+begin_quote
  Fenn winced. “Okay, okay. So.” She looked around for a bit. “So I was mostly solitary, following the official end of my childhood, but I did have, oh, let's say five proper boyfriends in my time as a young woman, which extends to this very moment. Males, for whom I was more than a fling. Two were ‘any port in the storm' types, who found my hybrid nature off-putting but not so much that they were willing to give me a pass, and those relationships both ended because whatever I was getting from them, it wasn't worth the occasional abuse I got in return, or the way I was hidden from their friends and family, or ... yeah.”

Is this supposed to be "but not so much that they were*n't* willing to give me a pass"?

Edit: Unless pass means to pass on Fenn?
