Fixed!June and Levelup!June aren't different people, Levelup!June is a June that wants to maximize leveling up experienced in the future and doesn't want to be Fixed!June only as much as that impedes leveling up.

Levelup!June will still get to experience Leveling Up when Fixed!June does, because they are the same person.
