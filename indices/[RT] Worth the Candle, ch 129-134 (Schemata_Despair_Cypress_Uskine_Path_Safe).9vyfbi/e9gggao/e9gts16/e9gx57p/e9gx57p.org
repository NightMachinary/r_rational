LevelUp!Joon is clearly not thinking in the long term. He's like a drug addict who doesn't consider that by getting a good job and getting high on weekends he will be able to get high more often then by robbing people, blowing all the money on drugs, and then either dying of an overdose or going to jail for 10 years.
