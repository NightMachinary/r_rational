Re:Re-specing anything - Joon only has 2 floating points in his attributes. Any further changes will sacrifice those points for temporary boosts in other attributes, which is unacceptable.

Re:Surprise Joon didn't do X.\\
I think Joon just fucked up because of his immense desire for a level-up.

  I should have taken the time to get into my armor when I left the house, I realized that now, I should have taken the time to think and plan, I should have put my two points from the level up into something, but in the moment it had seemed like I needed to do something concrete to get me closer to my goal. Values had a metric for time sensitivity, and it was clear, now, that â€˜Level Up' had a perilously high time sensitivity, so high that it had compromised my decision-making.
