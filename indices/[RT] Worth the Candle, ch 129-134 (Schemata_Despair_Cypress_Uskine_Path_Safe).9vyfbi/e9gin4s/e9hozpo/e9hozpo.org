Wouldn't SOC be completely useless to LevelUp!Joon long-term, since his solution to people is extensive soul-fucking?\\
If anything, burning all his SOC for MEN and PHY would work better, since then he'll be able to kill everyone.\\
Though there are a wide variety of skills that use SOC, so it's not that great idea either...
