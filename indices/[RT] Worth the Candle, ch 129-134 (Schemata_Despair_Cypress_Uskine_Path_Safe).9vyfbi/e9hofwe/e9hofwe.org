I am now honestly wondering whether or not Joon will go back into the library. He certainly got enough firepower (alongside his team) to wipe out the librarian cinammon buns. I know- a real shame to kill them, BUT we are on a schedule, after all.\\
A skill at 30 is a sad thing to throw away, and I get the feeling he only got the bare minimum out of this adventure (the planned, expected minimum - not bad, but not great either).

And I do wonder if Library Magic will leave any traces/retain any uses at all in non-Library dimension. Maybe the Bookworm part of Library Magic will finally rear it's head, causing a minor problem, or at least an interesting insight?
