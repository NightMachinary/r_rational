Decoding 'Ifmsnes Faicpp' to 'Dungeon Master' with Vigenere would require key flzmjqftaqjly (up to cyclic permutation since Ifmsnes Faicpp is not at the start of the text). Sadly, the rest of the text remains gibberish with this key, so it's probably either not Vigenere, or alternatively, Ifmsnes Faicpp is not Dungeon Master. I tried padding the key with a few letters; no luck there either.

Also, the key is gibberish, so Mary wouldn't be able to guess it.
