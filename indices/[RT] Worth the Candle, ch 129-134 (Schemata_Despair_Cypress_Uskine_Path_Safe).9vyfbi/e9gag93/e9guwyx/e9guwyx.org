We know, or could infer, two more valuable pieces of information about the encryption that we can't get from the encrypted text itself:

1. This text is encrypted by future!Amaryllis for present!Amaryllis without prior arrangements. Future!Amaryllis, presumably, picked an encryption such that past!Amaryllis would be able to figure it out, but Juniper and the others wouldn't. It's likely based on a keyword.

2. Meta-reasoning: It's likely that it's Alexander Wales' puzzle for us^{1}, meaning that we would be able to decrypt it given Earth cryptography knowledge and our knowledge of the story/Amaryllis' character.

^{1. Though not certainly. It's possible that we can't actually decrypt it, and that the text's contents will be revealed to us in-story. Not very /Fair-Play Whodunnit/, but it would make sense.}
