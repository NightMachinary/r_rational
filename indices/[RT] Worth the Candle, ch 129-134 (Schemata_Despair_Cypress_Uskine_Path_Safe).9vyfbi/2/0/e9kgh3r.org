If you build it (and keep building it, slowly painfully, and with great art) they will come. Congrats on meeting the next milestone you set.

Time to give my unasked for opinion again--Having read your back catalog there often seems to be an inflection point in your writing where you start the back half of the story and start increasing the pace (closing the plot threads that were opened and not starting enough new ones (which has the indirect effect of setting a timer on the work )) from the scope of what you have set out to be Juniper's quests it may be a little to early to go down this route. You've hit gold with this story, a deep wide vein in a copper molybdenum mine, in a way that most authors hope to do at least once in their life. Enjoy it. Don't let yourself get bored, or rushed, take your time and let your following grow. We love this work (it resonates deeply with many of us and we want to be able to keep reading it for another couple of years as you cross the $5,000 mark). Thanks for writing and enabling us to give you our money. You are earning it in spades.
