The problem is that "best-friends-forever" might be fine for Juniper, but it dooms Amaryllis to never finding happiness.

It's a very real possibility she was /created/ to be with Juniper. In fact I suspect the first princess that was created was the girl Juniper saw at the start of the story that he got the cowardice debuff for not even trying to save. After she was killed by zombies it probably rolled up princess number two, Amaryllis. She may have not existed at all until that instant. Being a smart girl Amaryllis has already figured out that there is a possibility she was created to be with Juniper, and even openly commented on it when they were in the time chamber.

Given this possibility, and now the messages from future-alternate-timeline Amy who became the best Queen ever but still wasn't happy because she pined for her missing one true love her entire life, it's clear she needs to be more aggressive to win the Juniper-bowl. There can be only one.
