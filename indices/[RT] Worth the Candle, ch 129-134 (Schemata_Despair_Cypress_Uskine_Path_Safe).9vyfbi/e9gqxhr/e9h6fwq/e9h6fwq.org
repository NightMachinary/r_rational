I understand that sentiment, but for me it's the opposite- somehow the more the idea of them being together is explored, the less appealing it becomes to me. In a way they would be really suited to each other, I know, but they both have this unpleasant manipulative callous streak sometimes that putting them together seems to be a disaster in-the-making. I would appreciate it more if they stayed best-friends-forever in a sort of more intimate and platonic form of love.
