My read on that choice was the DM throwing him a bone by implanting the idea to do that into his head (as precedent, Library Magic has been doing just this for the last week straight, then we've got the Tower of Probity in Parsmont, and I assume other cases that I don't recall). He wasn't exactly thinking straight, so it wouldn't have taken much of a nudge for him to accept it either. Possibly "justified" by some form of saving throw.

This comes after it seems to me the DM put his finger on the scales to cause all this in the first place: the Spirit Magic quest was only added /after/ Raven pointed out that it could work as a solution to the level up problem, presumably for the precise purpose of giving the DM an excuse to cause a level up before he could make use of it to fix the problem. What other quests has he been given whose sole quest step involved reading a single book? (Sure, he had to go into the Infinite Library and learn Library Magic to do this, but he was already going to do that, so why would he need a /quest/ for it?)

Why would the DM do this? Well, the DM seems to love fucking with Joon so maybe the payoff for it was simply the horror Joon experienced after returning to normal and realising what he'd done.

(There's a fine line between "DM" and "Author", but I'm just not gonna think about that.)
