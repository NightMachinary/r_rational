To be fair, way back in Parsmont this /is/ how he solved the problem of... being a soul mage under scrutiny. "Soul magic? Who has that?"

Also consider that /to LevelUp!Juniper/, normal Juniper is not so different. Goes around, fights people, learns old secrets, gets quests for some of those things, levels up. Just not 'fast enough'.

Maybe he's learned how to lose, HPMOR style. It was quite the meme.
