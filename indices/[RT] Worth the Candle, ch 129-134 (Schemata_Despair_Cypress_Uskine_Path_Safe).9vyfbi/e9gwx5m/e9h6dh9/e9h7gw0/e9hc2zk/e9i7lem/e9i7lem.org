I'm not sure what you're specifically saying can't be done with soul magic.

Soul magic can adjust value levels, since that's what it does all the time. You target the "desire to reduce leveling up" instead of "desire to level up" directly.

Soul magic can remove memories. Joon tries to do it literally in this chapter.
