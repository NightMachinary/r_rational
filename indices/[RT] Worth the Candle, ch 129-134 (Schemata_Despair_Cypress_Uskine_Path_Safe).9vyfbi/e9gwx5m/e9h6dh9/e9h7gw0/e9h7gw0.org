When I say trap, I mean pushing leveling down after he's modified himself so that he won't maintain it low. He won't remember doing it (if you erase the memory), and he'll slowly turn back into a Joon that's controlled by level ups without maintenance.

The only trick is that you have to drop the value of leveling /last/ otherwise you're not calling the shots anymore.
