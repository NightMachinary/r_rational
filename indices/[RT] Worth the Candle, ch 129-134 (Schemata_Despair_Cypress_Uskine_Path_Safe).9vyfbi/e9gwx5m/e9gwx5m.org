I'm annoyed with how easily LevelUp!Joon gave up. It strikes me as completely unrealistic, and turns LevelUp!Joon into a caricature. If the /most import thing/ is leveling up, then he would never give it up without having a much better plan than just trusting game theory.

For a comparison, Normal!Joon wants to bring back Fenn. Can you imagine Normal!Joon having the ability to bring back Fenn, but first he has to convince someone that he doesn't want to bring her back, so his solution is to eradicate all desire to resurrect Fenn? Heck no. He would look for any literally any other way to trick or circumvent that person, because it's something he values very highly. He wouldn't just trust in game theory with Future!Joon to keep to the bargain. He knows first-hand how different Current!Joon is to Future!Joon, and knows he can't trust Future!Joon to act in Current!Joon's best interest.

Remember that at no point during the Fallatehr arc did Joon consider "maybe I should be fine with him completely adjusting everything I care about" as a viable option, because nobody would ever do that.

--------------

LevelUp!Joon had options. He could try to lie, which most people will do before adjusting their utility function (plus soul magic into SOC). He could try to do a measured adjustment. Eg, set 'level-ups' to 1/2 or 1/4 or some other fraction of their current values, and try to convince Raven from there. (Though this may lead to a Ghandi murder-pill situation with the same result.)

Or he could have put a trap in his utility function, similar to what Fallatehr did. He could push his "desire to use soul magic to perform daily maintenance on my utility function" lever all the way into anathema territory, then erase the memory of doing so. This would make Normal!Joon unwilling to do daily soul maintenance, and give a chance for LevelUp!Joon to slowly retake control later.

Instead he just gives up, throws his hat on game theory, and drops a nuke on his utility function.
