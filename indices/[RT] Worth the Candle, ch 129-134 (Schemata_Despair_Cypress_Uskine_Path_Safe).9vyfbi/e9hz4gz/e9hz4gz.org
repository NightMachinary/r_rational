I'm really not very clear on those last few events. Are we to conclude that Raven willingly potentially killed two additional librarians in order to break out Juniper, and that we're leaving the additional five catatonic ones for dead? If so, that's a harsh turn from the god-what-have-I-done mode we were in.
