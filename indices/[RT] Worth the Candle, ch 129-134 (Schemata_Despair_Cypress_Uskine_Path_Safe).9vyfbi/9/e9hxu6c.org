Got sick, did a reread while recuperating. Here's a theory I waited for the next chapter thread to post, though it may be a literal fever dream.

The "Loyalty" stat runs the other way from what Juniper assumes and the party accepts. Loyalty tracks his loyalty to his companions, not theirs to him. He is not earning Loyalty updates through being a good guy, he is performing speech actions of loyalty to earn them.

Drop back to [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25846587#workskin][chapter 2]], ctrl-f for "To my surprise" for the first Loyalty popup. "Cypress" hands over a pistol, demonstrating trust and loyalty, no popup. Then:

#+begin_quote
  “Seven souls,” I said. “I'll be back when I have them.”

  *Loyalty Increased: Amaryllis lvl 0!*
#+end_quote

Grab the full epub from the "Download" link at the top of any chapter on AO3, ctrl-f for "loyalty". Popups all happen immediately after Juniper says something to demonstrate his loyalty. (One exception: Amaryllis willing Loyalty, discussed below.)

The model is simpler:

- Just like skills go up based on practice with a "lvl" message, so does Loyalty. It's not feelings, it's speech actions.
- It's not 1. Juniper does something, 2. companion feels good about it, 3. ding. Middle step is gone.
- It removes an exception from the washater, where Loyalty was the lone stat of a companion's that Juniper sees on one of his pages rather than by connecting to their souls.

Things that feel like they're explained better:

- Companion personality/behavior doesn't change when Loyalty does (remember all the early worries about it being mindrape).
- Loyalty to Grak starts negative because Juniper thinks from Fenn's "heist" intro that they're pulling a con on da. It grows so slowly because Juniper pays little attention and does nothing for Grak. "Grak's loyalty increased four times, mostly from the two of us idly speaking with each other, usually for no clear reason." - because his model is wrong.
- Loyalty to Val leaps up because she's Joon-bait and it works. She is the superstimulus version of Maddie.
- The instances where Juniper gets Loyalty updates for multiple companions at once are when he's doing something (or apologizing + recommitting) affecting them all, like on the train getting Amaryllis's planning back on track by pushing the group to respect Grak's privacy. There's never a place where he does something for companion A and companion B is moved to a Loyalty increase, which makes no sense if the stat is tracking B's feelings.
- Bump to Amaryllis in ch 94 when Juniper offers to do chores.
- Twinned Souls and Symbiosis are a benefit from Juniper to the companion, not the reverse.
- First message about the Doe appears when he sees the deer, not when the deer sees him.
- After that, every on-screen increase for the Doe is when he makes a genuine effort to see the world from its perspective. Especially the blade of grass (lvl 3) and riding (lvl 7) bumps, that entirely happens in his head: if Loyalty tracks the Doe's feelings, it must have the totally-unmentioned power to read his mind.
- Feelings and demonstrations of loyalty that don't get a lvl:

  - Amaryllis chooses Juniper over Poul, and takes him out of Comfort, and tells him about the secret teleportation key, and nothing happens; he's thoughtful and takes his turn answering questions, ding.
  - All the companions say things in support of Juniper, or step into harm's way for him, or drag him out of bath fights, or do nine million other things, and there's no lvls srsly I'm not listing all these. If Loyalty tracks their feelings, somehow they never realize their feelings just before, in doing, or after an action; only when Juniper says something.
  - Pallida pledges her life. Even if this is less of a commitment for renacim, it's more than any companion has pledged. The next day, Pallida gifts the Egress and a crate of entads.
  - Raven tells the secret of the Inifinite Library and the conspiracy to repeatedly save the world around it. The next day, she offers Uther's buried treasure and agrees to let Juniper into the Infinite Library.

- More broadly: Juniper never receives a Loyalty increase when he can't see the companion. If it's based on their thoughts about him, never once did any companion chat with another in a different room and learn of or reflect on something he's done and feel more loyal about it? Even Fenn reading his letters in the time chamber?

Equally unexplained:

- Loyalty doesn't decrease. I'd expect Val's to drop at the funeral, but I also would've expected Amaryllis's to go down after she soulfucks herself out of love or Fenn's to drop before the breakup, so this is a wash.
- Amaryllis gets three bumps by thinking about it in chapter 50. This one's weird in either model, and Juniper calls it out as such.
- Passives are irregular. Only Val and Bethel get custom Companion Passives at lvls 10 and 20. Val gets an error about Twinned Souls (makes sense, she has no soul), but Bethel doesn't. (Juniper mentioned he wants to see how Bethel's soul would present via essentialism and but he forgot and apparently hasn't been in his soul since.) Val doesn't get Symbiosis or an error at 20 and no one comments on it.

Explained worse:

#+begin_quote
  *Loyalty Increased: Amaryllis lvl 22!*

  “What does it feel like, internally, for your loyalty to go up?” I asked.

  “Oh,” said Amaryllis. She sat and thought about that. “It feels like learning something important about you in a way that makes me like you more. I'm trying to think of all the times you told me it happened ... usually there's some element of surprise, even if it's affirming something that I already thought about you. Sometimes it's a reminder about the sort of person you are.”
#+end_quote

This is the only time a companion shows awareness of increases. Maybe it's wishful thinking on her part. Bethel even asks a "light and airy" question in ch 127 implying she's totally oblivious to them. (Grak and Bethel only comment on the new powers that come with lvl 10, not the updates themselves.)

So, there's my theory about Loyalty. Kind of wrote a lot but I kept looking for counter-examples and didn't find any. Loyalty doesn't track or change a companion's feelings, it's Joon's speech actions. Hope folks kick it around and figure out if I've missed evidence either way and that you all join me in shipping the most pure romance in the series, Amaryllimechamber.
