cuz shes said a bunch she doesnt wanna be

i think of it as like a cross between druid magic and porn. you can play with words all you want, but you know a house when you see one. and i think them trying to push the boundaries of house would just make her more stubborn. the best she'll submit to (without some sort of coercion or something) i'd guess would be a mansion/dormitory situation, hundreds of residents maybe thousands kinda deal.

  She apparently didn't take much enjoyment from having what was effective a small town inside her, but she went along with it. She had merged with Ropey shortly after I had failed to come back, which put her on a more even keel, at least according to Amaryllis.
