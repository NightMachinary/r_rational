Joons theories about how the library work are too complicated.

Because they miss something important - The price of the computing resources the dungeon master is using, are approximately, nil in baseline reality.

The library almost certainly /does/ just run a sim of the entire setup until book production stops, every time the library is reset.

Why do I say this? Because everything about Aerb has the feel of an obsessive hobbyist being handed simulation tools of extreme power and just going berserk.

The world he is in is not the result of a corporate, government, or other collective effort. It is too ad-hock, derivative (from Joons campaigns) and focused on Joon for that.

Parts of the tools which underlay it have the right feel for a bigger, organized effort - The safety mechanism that punted him from the meme, for example? That entire bit reads like an error report from a conventional development project. So does the intelligence overflow.

But the world? That is one person - the dungeon master - who is, effectively, playing the sims 4264.3, and ripping out all the books written from a simulation run, then reverting it? Ten lines of script code. Faking said simulation run? Major code project, if it is even possible at all, and it is not likely to be a standard package in the tools the dungeon master has.
