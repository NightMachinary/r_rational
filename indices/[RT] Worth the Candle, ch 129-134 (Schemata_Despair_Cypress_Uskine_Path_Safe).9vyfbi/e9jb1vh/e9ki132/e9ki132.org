I dunno, the emulation software might have some configuration options akin to LoD in rendering, eg, the simulation is rougher and less fine-grained the further away you go from the player, with some duct-tape measures like having mind-hacking everyone in the mid-LoD distance into not questioning the way they're railoaded.

That might explain some of the library's problems too, if some of the solutions they implement only work in the simulated reality because the simulation fails to account for emergent phenomena that would derail the plan.
