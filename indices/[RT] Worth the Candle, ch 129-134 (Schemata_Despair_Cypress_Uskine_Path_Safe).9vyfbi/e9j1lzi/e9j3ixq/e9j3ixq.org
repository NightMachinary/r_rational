Only by cthulhuraejepsen's high standards. For me it's still 100% worth reading, and well above most books out there. Certainly above what I can write.

I think there is a trade-off where an Author trades their motivation and time for speed, planning, character development, and other qualities in the writing. The rationalist community demands a lot, and you end up with writing that's only appealing to a small audience (hopefully the community grows). In particular I imagine the revising the plot involves very heavy rewriting time, but I'm not a writer so I'm not sure.

With girlfriends, my approach is to find one who's had a terrible boyfriend. Now I can easily exceed expectations :p If I was cthulhuraejepsen, I would do the same - a few lower standard chapters, so that he can enjoy exceeding them :p
