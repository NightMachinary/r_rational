I have to agree with the others that the ending of the LevelUp!Joon arc has been rushed.

One, LevelUp!Joon gives up on his very identity in a way that's extremely casual. It would be like if Amaryllis had gone "Well, if I don't struggle I'm less likely to get killed, so I better let Fallatehr capture me again".

Two, the way Raven just takes him at his word from then on is incredibly weird. For all she knows, "Watermelon" could have been the beginning of a deadly infohazard that would have freed him and killed everyone in the room. She shouldn't even have talked to him before Amaryllis got a chance to look him over.

Three... well, it was kind of supremely irresponsible of Raven to bring Joon in knowing he could very well snap and go on a rampage at any moment, without giving her colleagues any advance warning, having him disarm, or keeping him under escort. They're pretty lucky Joon was in junkie mode and didn't, say, slit Raven's throat by surprise.

Four, breaking Joon out and hurting / killing additional librarians in the process is... I mean, it's pretty cold. It's murderhobo problem-solving, where you take a complicated problem and just use overwhelming amounts of violence to solve it, and don't worry about the collateral damages, burnt bridges and future retributions. And these people have worked for Raven for /centuries/. That's even colder than what we've seen Amaryllis do.
