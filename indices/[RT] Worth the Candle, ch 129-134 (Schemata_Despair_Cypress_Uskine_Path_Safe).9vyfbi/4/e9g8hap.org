  As for you, Juniper, know that I love you. There's a part of me that wants to be soppy and romantic, and say that I'm doing all of this for you, but of course the truth is that I'm doing my best to keep my world alive and I would smash your head in with a hammer if it would accomplish that. You always liked that about me, didn't you?

I always see characters in story's give 'teary eyed chuckles' but this, and the preceding content of the letter, allowed me to experience it for the first time myself.

The whole sequence of Amaryllis' books from the abandoned timeline was so terribly sad; picturing Amaryllis committing her existence to this endeavour even knowing she will never see the payoff, rediscovering the depth of her love for Juniper yet knowing she'll never see him again...ughh. I want Juniper to give her a massive hug when he next see's her and am irrationally annoyed at him for being the type of person who wouldn't do that.

I feel a little sorry for Raven as well, seeing her idol chipped away at and coming to terms with the sort of imperfect person he really was. I think that whole process has been very organic and well written.
