Honestly, I don't think it is beyond Juniper at this point to give her a big hug next time he sees her, he is in a pretty shitty mood overall at this point and it isn't likely to get much better anytime soon unless he can start relying and depending on others for emotional support, Joon's biggest problem right now is his rediculously low SOC stats, I honestly think he should bump them up purely for the self analysis abilities they would give him.

I honestly wonder which stat would give Joon better empathy, so he can dump some points into it and we can get NEW TYPE Joon.
