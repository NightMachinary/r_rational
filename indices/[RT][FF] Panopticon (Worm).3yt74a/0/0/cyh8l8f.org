How did you model the combination of Coil and Dinah's powers? It seems like Coil could ask Dinah questions all day to figure out all of his enemies. Eg. "Chance the person who will pose the largest threat to me is in North America / will attack today", etc. Coil seems like he should be in the same position that young Coil mentions of taking down all enemies. I know Wildbow restricted it somehaw but that seemed hand-wavy to me.

Worm is a universe where people who try to work together or to make things better are inhibited by the powers that be.

- Shards influence parahumans towards conflict and reward those who participate. (Eg. Rewards of shards budding and stronger powers.) Shards also influence parahumans to not look too much into shards themselves. (Panacea avoids brains likely for this reason)
- Contessa is focused on keeping Cauldron a secret at almost any cost. This means anyone who would reveal Cauldron and their wrongdoings gets taken out or scared off.
- Endbringers destroy anyone who looks to improve the world. Eg. Sphere's family was attacked by the Simurgh, turning him away from helping the world and making him into Mannequin.

Etcetera. If you don't have these, it might be nice to know why things don't just snowball into massive factions that can beat the Endbringers, ala Weaver 9 or Amelia. Also how Contessa's goals are different (if she's being rational) and why you can't just produce a bunch of Eidolon / Kherpi-level parahumans to take down Scion. In canon, the dilute the vials with Human shard, but if Contessa knows how it'll turn out, she could Path or dilute less to produce a proper parahuman.
