Okay - well reasoned.

If you want more internal consistency, fetter Eidolon's shard. That resolves Contessa being able to view him in her Paths, as well as enables you to make Eidolon a rational character, in that the psychological limitations that prevent him from optimizing the use of his power (arbitrarily defined "need" and use-limited power access) become hard-coded restrictions on his shard's power.

An in-universe explanation to explain the now-fettered power follows.

His shard has always-on foresight that determines Eidolon's actual future need for the next /x/ amount of time, and unceasingly offers powers for Eidolon to take up. If he accepts a power, then his shard starts accessing the borrowed shard's power. He can borrow more power the first time he accesses the shard; subsequently, the borrowed power's shard more quickly identifies, fights against, refuses, etc. Eidolon's shard's attempt to access its power. Eventually, the borrowed shard becomes so immunized against Eidolon's shard that in no situation will the borrowed power be what Eidolon needs, and so his power stops offering it up for potential access.

When the Beings reform and collect their shards, the rearranging process wipes clean shards' immunity, thus the lack of lingering effects from use of Eidolon's shard in previous cycles.
