Eidolon, as is, doesn't fit rational stories. Eidolon use his Thinker powers, for example, even though Thinker powers has the greater utility. Given that he has Thinker powers, and has less restrictions than Contessa, why is he following her? There is nothing Contessa can do that he cannot do. Rational!Eidolon, as is, is going to stomp the setting.

Changing aspects of the story is inevitable. There's a lot of things that I like about Worm, but let's not pretend it's perfect, in terms of character development, internal consistency etc.. If Worm is perfect, it is still more interesting to branch off it, building on some aspects and not others. If I develop aspects has no been developed in canon, our interpretation of canon and out extrapolation from that canon is going to differ, because on our different models of reality. Then other things have to change to accommodate prior changes, so that the change has meaningful impact, yet the story doesn't become unbalanced.

I hope I still have your trust in this story. The story may be flawed (/cough/toomuchtelling/cough/), but I plan to go interesting places. Chapter 1's POV is going to be Lily, and is going to jump straight to a Leviathan battle. Lily's powers are going to be expanded a bit, and I hope to greatly expand her psychology. I also hope to greatly expand the organisation/politics of Endbringer battles
