You're right, it's a huge flaw. Dinah had not initially been in the chapter, and I added her at the last minute, so I failed to consider her, in the midst of all the other variables. Coil can probably spend five minutes checking the probability of his death in the near and middle term, since his death or lack thereof is fairly straightforward. One slightly cheat-y way Sarah might have around it is to just have Dinah lie. But I suspect Sarah can probably find another way around it, I just haven't thought of how.

I'll have to fix it, but that'll take some time, and will probably have to be done after the next chapter.
