Well it all depends on the timeline in your story. In canon Coil didn't acquire Dinah until the bank heist arc. He didn't have the opportunity to kidnap her before because he needed a distraction for the PRT.

You can just have Coil not in being in possession of Dinah yet. Whose to say that Dinah didn't do the rational thing and told her parents and the PRT all about her powers. That neatly sidesteps that problem.
