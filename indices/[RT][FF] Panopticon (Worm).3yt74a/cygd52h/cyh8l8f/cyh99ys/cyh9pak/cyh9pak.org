  Coil might also not bother to spend one or two hours every day checking for every threat.

Yeah, maybe he just didn't ask chance of dying a week from now. (Pulling a Panacea) If you have that power combo, it should your main strength if you are using it at all intelligently.

Eg. When planning your next move, you'd find anyone who's likely to be a threat to you in the next month, 6 months, and year through questions. Then you work to take them down or turn them away. Then, Tattletale wouldn't have been able to target him because then he'd see that the Protectorate has X% chance of capturing him in the next month -> determine that a main player is a new parahuman or someone who isn't on their roster -> someone born in north america, etc. And he can also use this asking how his recruitment actions pan-out long term for Tattletale.
