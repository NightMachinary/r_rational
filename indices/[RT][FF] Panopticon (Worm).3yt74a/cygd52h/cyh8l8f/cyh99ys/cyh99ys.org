Contessa is acting against Scion, but Scion and the Endbringers are her only blindspot. She does not have prior knowledge how Scion is going to react to her actions, so she cannot go too far too fast. Anti-Endbringer defenses are much stronger in this story, but the Endbringers are also much stronger. On balance, for industrialised countries, it is as if the Endbringers are more destructive natural disasters. Simurgh is still free to sabotage humans. Factions don't necessarily unite against Endbringers due to co-ordination problems (e.g. if one faction loses most of their parahumans to Endbringers, they cannot defend themselves.)

As for Dinah, I forgot to consider her in-story. But my first impression is that it still depends a lot on Coil asking the right questions, and thinking of the right interpretations (e.g. largest threat can be political or military, ten years from now as opposed to now, if he takes out the largest threat that might cause an even greater threat to emerge that the previous largest threat had been suppressing, etc.). Coil might also not bother to spend one or two hours every day checking for every threat. Five minutes asking questions like 'am I going to die today?' I can imagine, but it's probably not productive to check for every contingency.
