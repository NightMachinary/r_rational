I have always wondered about the following, related to this. Maybe someone with more specific math and physics knowledge can answer.

is it possible to avoid entropic heat death by continuously slowing yourself down? The universe will never actually reach total equilibrium, but approaches it as a limit right? So if you keep slowing down forever, it would subjectively seem like you never hit the heat death.

But, it depends on the relative strength of approach to different limits, like the Gabriel's Horn problem. Can you slow down fast enough to outpace the entropy issues? Which limit dominates?
