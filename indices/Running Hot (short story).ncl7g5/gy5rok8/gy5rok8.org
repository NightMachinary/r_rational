Lockstep, by Karl Schroeder. They use advanced coldsleep to run their civilization a few months a century with subsapient AIs managing their worlds in between. The parent civilization has passed through singularities and ... gone somewhere... multiple times.

A civilization like this is encountered in Diaspora, by Greg Egan. They use subsapient "Contingency Handlers" to watch for problems and contact the parent minds when they're discovered.

Personally, in your scenario, I'd get volunteers to take realtime vacations and then return to the parent civilizations after 20 years or so while nothing happens in the real civilization. Heck, you'd be able to get people to pay for the rest.
