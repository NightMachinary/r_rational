  By comparison, near every computing technology ever invented works better the cooler you run it. With MOSFETs, you get smaller feature sizes, lower energy usage, and fewer errors to correct.

A pedantic criticism, but this isn't actually quite true. MOSFET technology, in particular, relies on higher temperatures to allow free charge carriers to escape their dopant atoms in order to provide bulk conduction. The essential nature of semiconductors is such that charge is not freely able to move without at least some activation energy. At T=0, they do not (generally) conduct.

Now, there are technologies that obviate this issue, mostly using III-V materials, and do run better the colder you get. However, MOSFET technology as it is generally used is not one of them.
