I think that that probably wouldn't end up working out in your favor. You will have some nonzero entropy leakage over time even if you are running at arbitrarily slow speeds, so eventually the majority of your negentropy spending will be on that, rather than your increasingly slow thinking.

From another angle, there is only a finite amount of negentropy in the universe. Even if you could use all of it, 100% efficiently, that will still put a hard limit on how much computation (and hence thinking) you can do. This then implies an unavoidable horizon where a certain amount of subjective time would use all the negentropy that exists, regardless of what rate you ran it at.
