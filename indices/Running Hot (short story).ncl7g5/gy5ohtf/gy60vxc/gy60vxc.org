Theoretically, by disassembling all stars and waiting for the ambient background temperature of the universe to +warm up+ (EDIT:) [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.03394.pdf][cool down]], you can spend entropy more efficiently; the numbers I remember suggest that if you stop the civilization's runtime until very late, then run sims in that environment rather than the modern one, you get ~3x-5x the total subjective runtime.
