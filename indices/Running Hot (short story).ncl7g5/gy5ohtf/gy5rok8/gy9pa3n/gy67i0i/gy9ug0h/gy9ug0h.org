This was a lot of fun.

My only point of improvement is that you shouldn't use an acronym without defining it first. Yes, I easily changed tabs and Googled what a MOSFET was, but until then, I didn't know whether you were referring to something real or not. And having to Google it made the story less immersive; thankfully, that was near enough to the beginning that it didn't really affect my enjoyment.
