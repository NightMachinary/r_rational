This is why you have starworks; the primary goal is to stop all your useful matter being on fire, and stick that in stable storage. Then the natural energy losses from that storage are just another factor in efficiency. If 99.9999%+ of your energy is on fire, entropic heat death comes sooner, and running hot is extremely important to make the best use of the timespan available. If, say, 90% of your energy use is wasted in battery leakage from a more stable source, it might be better to run slightly hotter and faster, just to up your efficiency. If only 0.1% of your energy use is in leakage, then running 10 times as efficient at 10% the speed will leave you running longer subjective time.
