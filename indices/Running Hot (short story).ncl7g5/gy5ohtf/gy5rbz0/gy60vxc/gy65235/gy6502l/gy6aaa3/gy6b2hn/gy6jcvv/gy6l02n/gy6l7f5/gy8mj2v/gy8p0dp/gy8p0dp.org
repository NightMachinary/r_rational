Unless I've missed it, that comment is not part of the paper, and not all that relevant to the core point being made, that it is not more thermally efficient to wait before using available negentropy. The paper does not rely on any economic arguments, or make any claim of what an alien civilization might want to do, beyond saying there is no physically mandated thermodynamic efficiency incentive to do it later.

Dismissing this on the back of Hanson briefly giving an example task that might incentivise early activity that you think is poorly chosen seems really weird. If the example were wrong it wouldn't invalidate the argument in any way, and honestly it's not some absurd example anyhow.
