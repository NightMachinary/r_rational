maybe not on Mary's side, so much as wanting to use Mary as a valuable piece in her game. But yes, I agree for the most part. I suspect she had some small % reserved for Joon pulling through, after seeing Mary's confidence in his escape and adjusting her plans accordingly. I wonder what those adjustments were? Taking inventory of Mary's potentially available entads and helping Onion build his setup accordingly? ;)
