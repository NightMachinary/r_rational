  Have we heard of the wiffle exclusion zone before? Or the lower cthonic?

I did a text search and we have not.

Lower cthonic seems to be a deep underground cave system full of monsters. The name doesn't tell us much

Wiffle sounds amusing, so is probably horrific. Only definitions I can find online are related to wind or to wiffle ball.
