  Aside from the natal souls, new people in the hells were a rarity, enough that if there were sufficient levels of unification, it might be possible for them to interrogate anyone who fell within certain criteria

I hadn't realised that the rates of soul collection on death were so high that they meant new souls were rare. I had assumed it was at best 50/50,with the tight time window and the number of civilisations that werent integrated into the "international community". I suppose that the deaths we see are fairly unusual, as even in a quasi medieval society more people die of disease than violence. And forms of assisted suicide are probably a common way to make sure the soul is bottled. Does raise the question of how the runic spikes are widely distributed.

  he's got some kind of registration, which means that he can make some changes and then make some other changes to set them back later,

So it seems like the restrictions on soul magic are less strict than we thought, if such a glaring loophole exists. At least for royalty. Would think the known presence of soul mages would provoke some paranoia. But maybe they've been successful in convincing people that what he's authorised to do isn't "Soul Magic" but something different thst doesn't hit the tabboo.

  It's training,” she said. “You don't try to resist the compulsion, you ignore it. You just follow the script

Interesting countermeasure. Basically training themselves to respond to interrogation in a very specific way to the point that its entirely reflexive. Seems like it would be vulnerable to other ways of disrupting someone's concentration, or just waiting long enough they eventually have to do something that interacts with their values. But perhaps the idea is to just delay giving out useful information long enough. As discussed in the flashback with Arthur talking about torture

The fact that these two have seemingly been trained for so long to resist interrogation implies there's people within the court who are arranging this sort of intensive training for the young royals. Since it seems like this would take literal years of practice. Which seems very different from the relatively low responsibility lifestyle most royals seem to lead.
