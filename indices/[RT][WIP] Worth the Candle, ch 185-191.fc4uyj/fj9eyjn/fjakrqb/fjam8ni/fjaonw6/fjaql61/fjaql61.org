Amaryllis mentioned it was 92% in On the Merits of Oblivion. The vast majority of deaths are going to be caused by illness, or generally something where you're surrounded by other people. There are about as many spikes as there are people. In addition to that, first responders will obviously carry spikes, and velocity mages are mentioned to work as first responders a lot. Revision mages can undo deaths in a large area at range, so long as the deaths aren't caused by magic. "Bottled suicide" is mentioned as being a thing, so if for example you get lost in the wilderness and think you'll starve to death, you could bottle your own soul, so long as you think to bring a spike and bottle.
