Commenting as I go along:

185 * having the mirror room be a mirrored room, rather than a room full of mirrors, is a nice little twist, of the sort that AW is good at. Little details are part of why I like this series so much.

- Grak's comment about Amy's family making her worse is very true. For all she frame's herself as dispassionately calculating she is a human, and these are the people who have in effect abused and manipulated her her whole life. Psychological realism yay.

- Hyacinth being emotional is interesting. I almost wonder if it's genuine and the idea that everyone here is manipulative is all in Amy's head. But unlikely. It is still worth noting that Amy almost never considers genuine emotion as an explanation for people's actions.

- Have we heard of the wiffle exclusion zone before? Or the lower cthonic?

- Onion is a fascinating character we've only had hints of previously. Could be a primary character in another story. Definitely has layers

- My first thought with the contracts is that they don't say anything about what happens if the signatories die

- Interesting to see in Hollly someone in the court who seems to actually care about the law

  He was undoubtedly the most important though, above and beyond even Solace, though that would be impolite to say out loud

- interesting that Amy ranks Solace second in importance after juniper. Wonder how much that's the pseudo child thing vs her being the last druid

- releasing a rare and incredibly dangerous monster seems a level of escalation we hadn't seen before, particularly as they used non lethal means for the capture. Possibly hints that there's a third party who doesn't care about getting hyacinth killed in the process.
