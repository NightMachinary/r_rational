I really liked Onion, and kinda wished he had survived (if time ran out at a climatic moment say). We don't get many chances to meet really exceptional fighters or top level characters. Frankly Joon's utter disrespect was a bit annoying -- this guy got his skills the hard way. Onion struck me more as a hardass (and reformed bloodknight) than a complete snake like Hyacinth, and could plausibly be convinced to play nice.

Now that Anyblade is all rusted can Joon claim the Everyblade? I mean who is going to contest him walking out with it?

Also I really agree with Joon: Hyacinth has organized a repeated, insidious and very dangerous campaign to flat out kill them, sick dragons on them, and most recently (while at truce talks) kidnapping them, murdering Solace, and torturing Joon and Pallida. Letting people like that live is just bad policy.

I am getting a bit annoyed by the power up mechanism where if Joon wants to do anything important he has to sacrifice points to amp something up to game breaking levels. It takes away from the progression fantasy for one thing. That one mechanic makes all his standard abilities kinda pointless.

What on earth was Joon's plan with letting Yarrow and Zinnia go? He knows they can kill all of them with Shia Surprise, and were seriously considering using it already.
