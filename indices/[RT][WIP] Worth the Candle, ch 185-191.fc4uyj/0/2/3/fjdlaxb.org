  What on earth was Joon's plan with letting Yarrow and Zinnia go? He knows they can kill all of them with Shia Surprise, and were seriously considering using it already.

I don't thikn it was a concrete plan, but more of a self-safety check. My feeling for Joon's aversion is that if you can avoid consequences of soul raping someone by killing them after the fact, it may be harder to prevent yourself from using soul magic again. In that way self-imposing consequences to acts of great evil as a way to dis-incentivize any future repeats makes sense.
