  I am getting a bit annoyed by the power up mechanism where if Joon wants to do anything important he has to sacrifice points to amp something up to game breaking levels. It takes away from the progression fantasy for one thing. That one mechanic makes all his standard abilities kinda pointless.

Hard agree. I really like this story, I don't mind restrictions like 'no magic' coming into play, but it feels like the repercussions of sacrificing skills lives in the background at best. He has multiple abilities that he's able to dump in order to achieve these effects, let alone scraping souls for their abilities. Realistically the world is already scaled to his ability, with individual quests scaling up as needed, and the parts where he's thinking about how things could've gone differently are interesting. But when the only cost he pays is not tangible, mostly from explicitly chosen dump stats/skills that get trained offscreen, it doesn't really matter.
