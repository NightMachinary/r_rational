It seems like a coin flip to me. Could be open, could be elder wand rules, could be any Pendraig, could be Amaryllis endowable (as the closest heir). Onion is supported by Hyacinth's faction whose entads probably have good odds of being usurpable by Amaryllis. If not, then he can potentially force or bargain with someone to endow it.
