  I really liked Onion, and kinda wished he had survived (if time ran out at a climatic moment say). We don't get many chances to meet really exceptional fighters or top level characters. Frankly Joon's utter disrespect was a bit annoying -- this guy got his skills the hard way. Onion struck me more as a hardass (and reformed bloodknight) than a complete snake like Hyacinth, and could plausibly be convinced to play nice.

Onion murdered several people for his own ambition. He called everyone in the chamber insects because they didn't have his power. Onion was a powerful monster that needed to be put down, no more, no less.
