Excellent chapters!

Did anybody else think that Simuryllis was actually the real one? I mean, Mary pretending to be a fake copy "so Juniper can test things out" seems like exactly the kind of thing she'd do.

(I was a bit surprised when the next chapter began with Simuryllis turning into dust. I suppose it's possible that they swapped at some point, but I'd expect that to have come up already if that was the case.)
