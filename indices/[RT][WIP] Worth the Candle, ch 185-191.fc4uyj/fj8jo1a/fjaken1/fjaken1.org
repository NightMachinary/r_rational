On the AO3 front, I noticed, when I started reading the update there, that the story is in two collections, so I figure it's worth warning you: [[https://kedreeva.tumblr.com/post/189911215708/shamelesslymkp-kedreeva-kedreeva-people][whoever runs a collection on AO3 can, at will, hide stories in that collection from readers]], so you might want t be careful about that.
