Decent nitpicks :)\\
* I'll give you the hand deflection thing, it's still insane, but possible without magic.\\
* I imagine a Soul Mage will do a post mortum on Onion after he gets Rune spiked (he was very influential after all) as standard procedure to confirm his identity and death. Unless they are very inexperienced they should be able to tell his soul is mangled. Hell magic the Rune Spike just won't work because his soul is too f*cked up to be collected.
