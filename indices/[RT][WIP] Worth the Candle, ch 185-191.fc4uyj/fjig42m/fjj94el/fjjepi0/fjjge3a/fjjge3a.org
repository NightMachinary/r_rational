Sure. That's also how Uther's enemies treated him. I don't think it worked out for any of them. These are Uther's descendants. They should understand better than anyone that if Juniper is really Uther reborn its pointless to try and oppose him in any way.

I do agree that it will make things more complicated, but Juniper has no particular plans for Anglecynn. All they want is for Hyacinth's faction to stop fucking with them. Maybe in the future they will do something to stir up the desperate corrupt opposition you are predicting, but I doubt it. Based on the Cypress timeline I think its quite likely that Amaryllis will easily handle Anglecynn politics. Hell the quest text all but confirmed that no one wants to screw with them anymore.
