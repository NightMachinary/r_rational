"What on earth was Joon's plan with letting Yarrow and Zinnia go?"

I dunno that he had a 'plan' per se, he is just, you know, an ordinary person from earth. Those of us who aren't, like, double war criminals don't typically kill helpless prisoners.

If you want to stretch for a possible plan you can say that he knew Yarrow would come around in a while, due to the spirit work he'd done on him. He could have intended something similar for Zinnia. As far as the world and their own self image is concerned they were impressed by his nobility and magnanimity in victory.
