I'm not going to make the layer pun for the 19th time, but I think you are only seeing his outer... stratum. From what we know he provoked people who attacked him first, then he killed them. We don't know the details of these people or encounters, and they were a long time ago. He apparently largely reformed after surviving the cthonic exclusion zone.

Calling everyone else insects is a worrisome trait perhaps, but strikes me as in line with a warrior (who has survived the nigh impossible with guts and skill) dismissive of cringing, backstabbing politicians and panem et bloodsports observers with no personal skill. He is disgusted by them, yet forced to play their games. Now he finally met someone who can appreciate the power and art of this fight, and offers a snide remark on the bloodthirsty crowd safe in their seats. It makes for an interesting character trait, not a 'powerful monster that needed to be put down, no more, no less.'

All that isn't to say that Joon was wrong to kill him. That was clearly morally allowable, and pragmatically necessary at that point.
