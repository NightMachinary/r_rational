(Just FYI, AW retconned Ring of the Broken World, so the scene scything through Harold's mooks now doesn't have to have the inconsistency with Joon being trapped under a net and by a revision mage despite his ability to teleport.)

Such good chapters. The humor was amazing, I loved the character moments, and legitimately the best fight scene in years. Well worth the wait, and it's a huge batch as well.

Kinda disappointed that they didn't get more info from Y&Z, but made up for by Joon rolling a nat 1 on his insight check on Pallida.

Joon fucking with Onion is immensely funny. "You'd be a vegetable for the rest of your life." "You're leeking." "That is a very rude way to speak to your beloved nephew who is alive." I was cracking up at these. And this is /after/ he dropped the comedy skill.

Onion using the flickerblade confirms that Amaryllis got it back after Li'o.

Gotta say that I didn't expect a marriage in this batch. Luckily, Juniper Penndraig already has a flower name, so he doesn't stand out until he opens his mouth.

  “Juniper knows everything,” said Amaryllis. This was pretty much true, with only one glaring exception that she could think of, and that one thing was interpersonal rather than being relevant in an information security context.

Kind of feels silly to mention this after talking about them literally getting married, but Amaryllis is all but confirming her attraction to Joon.

Such a great batch overall, lots of important things happening, a bunch of big reveals to the public, and I have no idea how it's going to end but the writing quality seems to consistently be improving.
