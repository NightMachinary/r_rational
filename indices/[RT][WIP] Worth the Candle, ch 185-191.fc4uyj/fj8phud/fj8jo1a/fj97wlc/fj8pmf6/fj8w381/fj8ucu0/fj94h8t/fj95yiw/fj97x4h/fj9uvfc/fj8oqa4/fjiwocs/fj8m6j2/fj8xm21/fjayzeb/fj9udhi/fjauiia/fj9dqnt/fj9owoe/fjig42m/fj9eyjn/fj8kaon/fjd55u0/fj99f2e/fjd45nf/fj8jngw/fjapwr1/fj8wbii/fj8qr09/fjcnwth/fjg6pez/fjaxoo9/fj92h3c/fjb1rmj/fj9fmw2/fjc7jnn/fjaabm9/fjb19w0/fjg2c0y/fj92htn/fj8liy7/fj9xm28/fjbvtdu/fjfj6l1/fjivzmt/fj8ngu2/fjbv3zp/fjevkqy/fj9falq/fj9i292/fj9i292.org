I guess I'm the only one that didn't like the fight.

There's no tension or excitement in the fight, Joon is going to win because he has access to impossible powers. He just scoops some points from souls and adds them to his own, gets a bunch of op, broken ass perks and wins handily. It's all so undeserved and unsatisfying. A drawn out fight scene between him and someone that much weaker just feels so unnecessary.

Joon's cocky attitude rubbed me the wrong way too. It felt like a boxer taunting his opponent in the ring because he'd brought a pistol.
