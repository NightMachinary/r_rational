There are a lot of people with a lot of influence that stand to lose that influence if Joon starts throwing his weight around. Quite of few of those people could be willing to risk a likely death for the unlikely reward of being able to hold onto their corrupt power. Especially if Joon makes it clear by his actions that he won't tolerate those kinds of people in his new order.

And it doesn't matter if Joon says he is not interested, people won't believe him.

In fact the worst issue might be people 'on his side' trying to prop him up as a new ruler and getting in the way of the quest. Joon is strong, but its too early for him to be safely famous. Now no one will underestimate him, when they come at him it will be 110% overkill nuke from orbit levels of force.
