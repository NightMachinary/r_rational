So, forget the technicalities of using undisclosed magic in a trial by combat (because as you're about to read Juniper is in FAR worse trouble because he can PROVE he didn't use other magics). Forget the insanely impressive things Juniper has done which are arguably technically possible with the right entads, no, let's focus on the important part.

Here is a list of literally impossible things that an audience of hundreds and at least a half dozen warders have witnessed Juniper do:\\
* Juniper can instantly teleport at lightning speed to avoid an undodgeable blade. He can do this repeatedly. The witnessing Warders will confirm he did this without magic or entads.\\
* Juniper can begin to dodge attacks before he should have any legitimate way of knowing an attack was coming.\\
* Juniper can deflect a bladebound's sword edge with his bare hands when it has been shown to cut through literally anything. Again, without magic or entads as Warders confirm.\\
* Juniper can strike people through armor with his fists without even needing to touch the armor. No magic, no entads.\\
* Juniper can directly kill someones soul by punching them in the head, overpowering an entad that should be able to resurrect them. With no entads, or magic.\\
* Juniper can levitate in the air and glow without magic or entads.\\
* Juniper can regenerate lost limbs. Without Magic or Entads.

This is not everything he can do, this is just the things he did during this fight for which there is no possible explanation other than "I follow different rules to regular mortals".

He's is also likely the greatest multi-mage on Aerb (confirmed in front of the General Council) and just went blow for blow with the best bladebound there was and actually got the first lethal hit on them proving he was better than them at their own specialty.

Juniper won't have to say he's Arthur reborn, everyone will already think it.
