  He switched swords again, this time to what was clearly Amaryllis' flicker blade, and let the blade disappear as he swung at me. There was fuck-all that I could do about it aside from trying to dodge, but I could tell that I wasn't fast enough, and right at the point when the hilt was pointed at my heart --- nothing happened. Onion's helm tilted down as he looked at the sword, only for a moment, and that was when I struck, using my remaining hand to drive straight forward, fingertips all aligned right at his heart.

Onion is using the flickerblade but at the crucial moment it stops working - either Amarylis broke it, took it out of range, something like that.

It's subtle and I epxect it'll be highlighted in future chapters
