1. Why didn't still magic stop Onion's blade? Even if Joon isn't "allowed" to use it, it should still be passively active to anything that actually harms him? Or /did/ it stop the blade, just only the one aimed at his heart and not the arm, because it's smart enough to know which stills benefit him?
2. If Joon's magics were actually disabled, why did Joon take the risk of fighting onion over fleeing? Did he have a way to avoid dying in the event of losing the fight?
