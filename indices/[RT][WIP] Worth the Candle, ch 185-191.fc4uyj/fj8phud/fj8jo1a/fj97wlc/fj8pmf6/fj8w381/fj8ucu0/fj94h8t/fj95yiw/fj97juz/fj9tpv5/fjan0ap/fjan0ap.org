This is brilliant, but I fully expected him to turn his unarmed attacks into /specific/ weapons - such as Onion's weapon, to make this entire "No u" battle even sillier...

Or, if we really needed one last hint that we're nearing the Endgame, he'd just choose the strongest weapon he ever designed (Some reinterpretation of the Vorpal Blade?) with the assumption it made it to Aerb - and slice Onion's head / soul off by just gesturing in his direction.
