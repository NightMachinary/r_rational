  What the referee told Juniper was basically "If you manage to find a loophole and use magic anyway, we're executing you".

Right, so if you're going to die anyway from losing the fight why not kill Onion with spirit as you die?

  Although, really, if he'd been desperate enough to break the rules anyway, he could have pulled additional entads out of Sable to kill Onion, and then bailed with another entad. The arena seemed kind of unprepared for that possibility.

  Like, yeah, okay, the character made some really poor decisions, but I can kind of buy that after a lifetime of being completely, utterly unconcerned about any kind of physical harm, he'd just get into the habit of assuming he's going to win any fight he gets in.
