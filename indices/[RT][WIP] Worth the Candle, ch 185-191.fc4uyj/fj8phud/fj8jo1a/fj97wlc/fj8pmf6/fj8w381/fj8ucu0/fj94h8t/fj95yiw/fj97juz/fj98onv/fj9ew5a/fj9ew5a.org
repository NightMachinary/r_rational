idk. He doubles SPD and PHY with extra bonuses to dodge and parry, and Monkish Ascendant makes him inviolable, so as long as he wants to be attacking with magic it seems almost strictly better. In this particular fight it would have meant having an extra entad, and since the difference in attack power seemed less high than one might expect when he went unarmed even without Blade-Bound, that might have been enough.
