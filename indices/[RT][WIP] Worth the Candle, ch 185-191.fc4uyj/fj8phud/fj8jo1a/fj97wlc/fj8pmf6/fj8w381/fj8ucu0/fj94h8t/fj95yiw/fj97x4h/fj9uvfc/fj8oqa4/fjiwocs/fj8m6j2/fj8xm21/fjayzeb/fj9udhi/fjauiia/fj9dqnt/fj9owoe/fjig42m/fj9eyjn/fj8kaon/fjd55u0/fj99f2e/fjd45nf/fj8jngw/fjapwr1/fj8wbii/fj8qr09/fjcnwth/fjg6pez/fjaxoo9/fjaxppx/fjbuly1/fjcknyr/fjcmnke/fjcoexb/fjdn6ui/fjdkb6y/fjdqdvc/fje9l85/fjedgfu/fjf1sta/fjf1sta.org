The death penalty is for using exotic magic that you didn't tell them in advance you had and they hence didn't set up wards for. For example the wards wouldn't have protected against Joon using Spiritualism since the warders don't ever know that type of magic exists, but if Joon had used it the warders would have seen it and called the match.
