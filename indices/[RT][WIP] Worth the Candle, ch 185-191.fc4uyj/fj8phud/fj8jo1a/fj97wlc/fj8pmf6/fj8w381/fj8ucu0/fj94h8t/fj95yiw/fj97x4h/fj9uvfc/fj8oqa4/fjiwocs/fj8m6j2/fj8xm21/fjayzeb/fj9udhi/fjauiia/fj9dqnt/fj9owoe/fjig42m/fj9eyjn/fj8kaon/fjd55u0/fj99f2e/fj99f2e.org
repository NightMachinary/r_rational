Haven't finished all but jfc thank the heavens Pallida stepped in and called Joon out for his stupid hypocrisy. It was getting unbearable trying to read through that.

Oh god now I'm starting to root for Pallida and it always felt like she out of all of them will get shafted the most given her attraction to Amyrllis being her only notable storyline so far. Probably her or Solace because really it doesn't seem like the Locus thing is ever going to get fixed. Not sure why that was introduced when there's been no development on that front.
