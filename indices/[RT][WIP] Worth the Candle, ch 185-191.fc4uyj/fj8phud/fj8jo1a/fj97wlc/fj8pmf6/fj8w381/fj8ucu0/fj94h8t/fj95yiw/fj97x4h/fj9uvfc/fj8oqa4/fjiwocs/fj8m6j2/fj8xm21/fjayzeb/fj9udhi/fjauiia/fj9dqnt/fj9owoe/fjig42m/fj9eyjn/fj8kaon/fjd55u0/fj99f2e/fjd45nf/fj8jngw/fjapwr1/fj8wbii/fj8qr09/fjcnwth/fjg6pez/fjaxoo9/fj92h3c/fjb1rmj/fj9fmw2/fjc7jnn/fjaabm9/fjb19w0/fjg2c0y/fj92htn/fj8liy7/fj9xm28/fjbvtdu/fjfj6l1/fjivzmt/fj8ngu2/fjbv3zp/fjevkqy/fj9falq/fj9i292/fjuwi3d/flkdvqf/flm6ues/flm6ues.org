Sometimes I get trapped in these stray remarks of Mary's, where I'm wondering why she said what she said. Of course it fits with her ISTJ personality type of do-it-myself, but said aloud, it feels directed. Who's the intended recipient: herself, Joon, or Rosemallow?

  Pretend, for a moment, that I was created /specifically for interpersonal reasons/.

Layers! Besides my paranoia for DMNPC flags where Mary's entire existence is depressingly deterministic up until Joon fell out of the plane, that kiss is a deficiency of character! Save points and test runs in romance?! So many bittersweet puns triggering memories of Fenn and it feels like so long ago that I thought a dwarven romance would be great for A&J- that nuptial was certainly a big, dramatic moment in the vein of dwarven pulp novels.

Aha, story of Joon's life?

Did Onion's soul just get condemned to the souls by that armor? Meanwhile Tommy old boy flying up there watching the duel questioning whether he fucked with the wrong guy.

Random aside: how does Valencia see her past when she has a devil? Devils probably don't really point their high-powered perception at themselves, but when controlled by a normal person like Val, does she reanalyze her memories in "light" of the devil's thinking? Or is it muddied because memory is imperfect? Previously it was hinted that there could be iterative degradation/change of the brain's wiring; for Joon, it's concerning whether choking Spirit threads result in a similar drift.
