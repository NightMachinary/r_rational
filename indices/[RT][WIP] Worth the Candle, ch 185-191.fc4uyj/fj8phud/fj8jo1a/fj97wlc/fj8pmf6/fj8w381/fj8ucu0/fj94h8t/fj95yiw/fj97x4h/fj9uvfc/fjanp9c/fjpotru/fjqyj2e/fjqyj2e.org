What I really wonder is if some of those Virtues are actually meant to be achieved by Non-"Players"...\\
Evidently the Bladebound ones are, assuming Onion didn't cheat into them through some Uther shit.

The reality-altering Retroactive / Star Body dodges though, or the Ricoshot's "+10% Surprise bonus because this is stupid and should not work", seem like only Juniper or the Gods could realistically obtain them.

Aerb is a beautiful work of jank.
