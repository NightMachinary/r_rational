I think this is one of my few major gripes with this story overall: his min-maxing so often ends up feeling pointless because no matter what he does, when it's him fighting directly, he consistently makes it out on a sliver that amounts to a lucky dice roll, regardless of where the natural odds of the situation should lie. Correspondingly, this takes away from the times he does lose things, as it generally feels like merely a forced choice of the narrative.

But in this case I was fine with it. This fight didn't need to have tension, because it's his violent stress relief from a stressful arc, and I would expect the hypocrisy is there fully intentionally. It is certainly at home with the wider narrative.
