Still mages don't seem to care about the sharpness of a blade, only the force behind it. So long as they can touch the blade, and have enough power to stop it, I think they would win, assuming entads aren't in play.

Vibration mages can vibrate someone to death pretty quick when they're close, and a bladebound would need to have some form of protection against the pressure wave for them to not be killed almost immediately. Though you're right that it comes down to who can hit who first, as neither really has defense against the other.
