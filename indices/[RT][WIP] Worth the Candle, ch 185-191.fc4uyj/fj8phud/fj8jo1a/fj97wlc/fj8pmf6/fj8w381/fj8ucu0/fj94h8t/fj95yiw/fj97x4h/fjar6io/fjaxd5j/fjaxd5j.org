This is good comment! I sadly wont give it the justice it deserves, as I had a full debate on this subject in the previous thread and I feel like its good practice not to re-litigate things (I emphatically do not want to become "the harem guy"!), I just found this update hilarious in that context.

All I will say is that I totally agree that the harem elements in WtC are weird and parallel-universe-y, and in particular they are super meta, all about trope & media awareness and how it impacts the relationships. I would just separate that from a subversion - they are a weird harem, also a very adult and plot focused harem (so it doesnt look like a slice of like anime ofc), but still very much a harem, with all of them having romantic potential with Joon and his back-and-forth on the romance topics a big part of his plot.

But hey, media vocabulary is vague for sure, I think everyone has conflicting definitions of words like "subversive" or even "meta". We all will find different words that fit what we see.
