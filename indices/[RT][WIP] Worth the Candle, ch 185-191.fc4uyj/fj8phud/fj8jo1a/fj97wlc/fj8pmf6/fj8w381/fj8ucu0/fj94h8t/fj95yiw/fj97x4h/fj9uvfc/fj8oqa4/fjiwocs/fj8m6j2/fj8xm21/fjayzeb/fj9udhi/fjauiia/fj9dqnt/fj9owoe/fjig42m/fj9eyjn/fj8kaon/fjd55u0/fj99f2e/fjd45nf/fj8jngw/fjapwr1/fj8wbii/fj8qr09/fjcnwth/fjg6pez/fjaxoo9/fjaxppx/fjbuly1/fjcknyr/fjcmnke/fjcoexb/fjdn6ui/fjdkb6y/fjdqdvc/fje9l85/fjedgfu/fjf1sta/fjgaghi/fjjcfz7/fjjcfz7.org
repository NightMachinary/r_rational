I mean maybe? I'm not sure how he could have possibly accomplished such a thing while sitting in hostile wards. Its not like spirit is a good offensive weapon and thats the only magic they wouldn't have warded against. Also I'm pretty sure if Juniper felt things were hopeless he would have just tried to flee. I'm not sure that would have actually worked though considering they probably surrounded the arena in either blood or bone wards.
