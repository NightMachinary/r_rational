Onion doesn't have the Dodge capstone, and I really don't think two degrees of reasonableness is enough to parry your head being vibrated, or something being loud.

Mainly though, I just don't think that the mages and other fighters are balanced in 1v1 battles against each other. An epic level vibration mage doesn't have any real defense against being shot, other than to break the gun or the person holding the gun before being shot. An air mage could suffocate a grandmaster still mage at range, despite being otherwise fairly weak. Void has been noted to bypass a ton of defences, and still and gold mages don't have any real defense against them. Revision mages don't have much innate offense, but could probably outlast a bunch of other mages, forcing a stalemate.

Fireteams seem to exist partly because any single mage can't cover all their weaknesses.
