It's possible, but seemed less likely after the stuff with Onion. He was clearly in direct contact/control of the attack and kidnapping, and Rosemallow seemed happy to support taking him out. Maybe she is just very deft at playing both sides, but if she were behind Onion and orchestrated the attack, it would be foolish to discard him as he represents a lot of power. maybe she assumed Joon would lose, or she's fine giving up on Onion's gambit once she learns from Amaryllis how much confidence she is Joon's the real deal.
