That's true but Uther is known for bullshit.

If some multimage appears after already impossibly breaking out of my blacksites then I personally wouldn't take chances.

If it turns out they have some irreconcilable political goals then fine, but Onion seems like a practical guy who doesn't have a lot of political opinions he'd put above his life or his liberty.

A guy like Onion would be useful in the new order.

Plus in this fight the whole point is that the wards kill you if you break the rules so if Juniper ever thought he was going to lose he could kill Onion with magic.

Perhaps that's why he had the armour, so fine the fight up until he kills you once or twice.

Still doesn't rethink? Not even an attempt?

Why? Bbeg are always so suicidal but at least they usually have a clear if stupid motive
