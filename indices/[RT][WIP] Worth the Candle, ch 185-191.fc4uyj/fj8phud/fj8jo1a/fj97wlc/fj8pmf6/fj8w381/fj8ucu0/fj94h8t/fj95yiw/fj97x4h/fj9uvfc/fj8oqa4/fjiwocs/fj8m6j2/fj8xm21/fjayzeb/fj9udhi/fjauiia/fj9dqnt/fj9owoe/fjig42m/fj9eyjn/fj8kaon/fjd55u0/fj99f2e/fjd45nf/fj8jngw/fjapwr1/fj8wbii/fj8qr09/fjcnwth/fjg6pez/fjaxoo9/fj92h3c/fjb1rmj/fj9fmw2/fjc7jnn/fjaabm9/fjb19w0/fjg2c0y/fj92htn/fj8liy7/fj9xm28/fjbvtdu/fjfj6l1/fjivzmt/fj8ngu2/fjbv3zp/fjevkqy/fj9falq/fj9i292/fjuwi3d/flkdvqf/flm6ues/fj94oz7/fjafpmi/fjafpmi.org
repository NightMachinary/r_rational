It's probably fair to call this batch the climax of the current arc. There will almost certainly be another set of chapters to finish that off, but those will likely be more about denouement and establishing the upcoming direction than anything else. Most of the major issues have now been resolved.

Though some new ones were introduced to suggest future complications, they're separate enough to be dealt with later in another "arc".
