Wow what a great set of chapters. There's a lot I want to say but I just blazed through them all so fast its hard to get all my thoughts in order. Holy hell I loved the Onion jokes, and that was an excellent fight scene at the end. Every interaction with Amaryllis and Simuryllis was great as well. It's incredible how you continue to write better and greater fight scenes and continually top yourself. This peak at a what if physical Juniper is just amazing because I'd been thinking for awhile that mundane seemed underpowered compared to magic. They might still be from a utility standpoint but god damn they can scrap.
