I've seen some people use Still mages as an example... can a level 100+ Bladebound even beat a mid-tier Still mage with reactive stilling? All it takes is for the devils to drop one good counter or trap on him like that, and he's done.

Not to mention that Demons themselves are all implied to have insane combat stats and skills, so they won't all be fodder.

If he actually gets a sword down there, I'm sure he'll survive for a while before the Infernals mobilize against him - but probably not up until the council starts abolishing the Hells.
