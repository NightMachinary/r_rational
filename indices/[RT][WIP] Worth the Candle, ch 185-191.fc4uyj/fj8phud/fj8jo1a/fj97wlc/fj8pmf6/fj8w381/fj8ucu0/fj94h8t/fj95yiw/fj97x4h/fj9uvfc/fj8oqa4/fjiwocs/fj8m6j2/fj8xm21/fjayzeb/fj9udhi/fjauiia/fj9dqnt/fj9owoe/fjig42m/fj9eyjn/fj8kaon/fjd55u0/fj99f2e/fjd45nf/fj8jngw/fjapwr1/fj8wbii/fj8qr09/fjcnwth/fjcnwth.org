Superb chapters. Here's an interesting tidbit:

#+begin_quote
  I would have laughed at the stupidity of trying to shoot a blade-bound, if I'd been in my right mind, but I would have eaten that laugh, because what came from the gun was a cannonball
#+end_quote

Repetition of entad effects (Bethel as Kuum Doona had eaten an entad that was a smallbore gun which shot cannonballs).

For a moment I thought it was a hint that Bethel and Val were somehow in the crowd, but of course that would require that Onion's Everysword could mimic non-swords, or swords that had been absorbed into meta-entads.
