The multiblade's meta-effect was extending outside of the arena, and Grak could probably sense it whenever it borrowed from their weapons. He just had to Ward around the flickerblade against the meta-Entad's magical effect to prevent Onion from accessing it.\\
Nothing against the rules, probably.

*EDIT*: Oh right, Grak probably made the anti-Entad ward somewhere ASAP, then Amaryllis pushed the flickerblade into it the moment they needed to.
