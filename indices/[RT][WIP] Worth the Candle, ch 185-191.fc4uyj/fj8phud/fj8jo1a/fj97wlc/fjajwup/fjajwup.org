  Amaryllis is so deep into Earth culture that "Fucking Christ" has a genuine response from her when pissed off.

Not just earth culture in general, she's deep into religion and Christianity in particular!

Juniper constantly avoids interacting with the fact that both Mary and Fenn had bible studies and genuinely seemed to get something out of the religion he dislikes so much, so I can't wait to see that brought to the forefront at some point.

/Especially/ with this whole "haha we're married but I'm not deeply in love with you baka... unless?" thing thrown into the pile.

Nothing about their relationship makes sense and I love it.
