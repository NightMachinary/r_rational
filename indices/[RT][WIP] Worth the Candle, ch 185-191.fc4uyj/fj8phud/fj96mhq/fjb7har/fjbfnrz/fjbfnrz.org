Joon's dodges transcended time and space. He had two degrees of reasonablness on his already obscene parries (at something like 10x his normal speed) and a super-instakill attack with a two-minute charge-up.

I know bones and blood are pretty good but how could he get the speed he needs? Presumably Onion has other entads. Passion, air and water aren't that useful. Stilling and unicorn magic for defence, vibration and gem magic for offence.

It all comes down to whether he can still a super-inviolable attack or not because I don't think he has the stats to fight sword to sword. Even if he did, Onion would cut straight through with 2D sharpness.
