I know, that fight was amazing. As a fencer (skill 8-10), I remember getting into a few short riposte loops (though that was partially down to the way fencing awards priority for simultaneous hits). It was great, intense fun that I could honestly see happening between superhuman masters.

I wonder how good Onion would be in a real fight with unboosted Juniper. Would blood and bone magic give him the strength and speed to beat him? Does still magic beat bladebound, since it's' only pseudomagic? I assume that 'in the real world' metamages would trump even the best swordsmen, especially revision mages.
