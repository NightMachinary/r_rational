I found the fight pretty fun overall, both sides were fairly OP.

My main gripe was a total lack of using Sable creatively. Once Joon was backed into a corner, he shouldn't have just had another backup set of OP combat stats. It would have been compelling if he were just pulling all the tricks out of the Glove, throwing bizarre shit at this oncoming deadly force while unarmed and dodging frantically. The godlike "punch him to death" finish doesn't really allow for much tension or growth.

Maybe the final win comes from Monkish Ascendant, which he thought would be useless - he fills the arena with acidic cloud/vapor, but his Inviolable body renders him immune while he holds his breath with Body Statis.
