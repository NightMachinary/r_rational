That's fair. I don't want to quibble but I can think of a couple more examples of easy direct fights. Juniper vs Fallahter was a trivial fight once it actually started. His fight with the mooks tuung on top of the train was also easy.

Funnily enough I think Juniper shares your view on the munchkinry. He's said a few times himself he finds it annoying.
