IMO that's the exception that proves the rule, especially as permanant invulnerability ended up being a random perk he got rather than one the team deduced through careful munchkinry.

There are definitely stakes despite the extreme rubber-banding. The lack of tension I got from this fight resulted primarily from the whole parlay being obvious from pretty much the moment they started planning. There could be a hell arc, but it wasn't going to happen here.
