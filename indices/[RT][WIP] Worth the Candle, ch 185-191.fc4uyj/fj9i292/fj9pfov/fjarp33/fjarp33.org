Umm. We just had an arc where he was so broken that he slaughtered every enemy involved and thought "huh that was easy, what was the point of all that?" (Back right after Mome Rath)

I personally thought the fight was tense. Even if you don't think there will be a hell arc, there are still a lot of potential consequences besides the protagonist dieing. We even got one at the end when he leveled up in front of a thousand people.
