  I hadn't realised that the rates of soul collection on death were so high that they meant new souls were rare.

The soul collection rate doesn't need to be that crazy good for this to be true. Just running the numbers, if there's billions of people on Areb, an average life expectancy of 60 years, and only a 95% soul collection success rate -- which is probably a low bound -- and 5000 hells, that comes to just a couple souls per hell a day. Something that happened twice a day on earth would be a rarity if it happened near where you live.
