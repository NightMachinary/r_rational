So Essentialism doesn't allow to remove memories? Because that I think should have been a good start towards a solution of Zinnia problem.

And I am pretty sure with Spirit it should be possible to block forming long-term memories, giving the victim anterograde amnesia (reversible only with the Spirit) but still leaving the possibility of interrogation. Should be a good tool to hide soulraping.
