It wasn't used, which was part of the reason it was removed I'm sure.

  Ring of the Broken World: Despite the weird title, it was really just a limited form of teleportation. Instead of having a set distance, it could teleport me such that I was still touching the place that I had originally been standing in, preserving my momentum. I could teleport up so that my feet were where my head had been, or I could teleport to the side so that my left hand was where my right hand had been. In other words, the maximum distance was pitifully short, but it was activated by thought, and could be used many times in rapid succession, which meant that it had combat utility.
