This is surprising to me. For the first two layers, it didn't read to me at all that Onion was weaker and that Juniper was winning handily? Onion had the same broken perks regarding swordsmanship, better attributes, and a better sword. The flame thrower was a good trump card that made the second death exciting.

Third part did maybe have the feel of things already being over - I did in fact miss that Joon only won because Amaryliss tped out at the right moment.
