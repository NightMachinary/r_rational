I had a thought while going through these latest chapters: is it possible the Court tradition of flower names was started to enable some sort of flower magic working with the Court? Perhaps a sufficiently high Horticulture would allow a perk for metaphorical flowers?

Ch.53 says that what flower magic requires is "patience, insight, and dedication" - all things that someone manipulating a court would need to apply as well.
