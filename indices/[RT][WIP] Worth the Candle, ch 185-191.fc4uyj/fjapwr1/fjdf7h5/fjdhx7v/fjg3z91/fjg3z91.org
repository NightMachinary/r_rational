I would say, if you are Rosemallow, you would have been 100% confident that Joon was going to lose that fight. It was only a day or so before the fight itself that Rosemallow even slightly believed that Joon has anything of the spark of Uther in him, and as we saw Onion turned out to very much live up to his name as the best fighter in the world. I don't think Rosemallow was behind it personally, I think she is on Mary's side, but the facts arent conclusive I would grant.
