Great stuff. The trial dragged for me a bit, particularly the Rules of Order stuff, but I still enjoyed the entire experience. Just some parts less so.

When June was tempting Fate continuously just before the fight proper - man. He's the protagonist, so a part of me was sure he was going to come through the fight fine, but he could not have racked up the Overconfident-Idiot flags any faster or harder.

Not sure how I feel about the romance. It's well written, no qualms there, and true to their characters. Still, the parts of WTC that get heavily focused on relationship dynamics are the low water mark, for me, and I sort of hope this doesn't foreshadow a shift towards that narrative paradigm.
