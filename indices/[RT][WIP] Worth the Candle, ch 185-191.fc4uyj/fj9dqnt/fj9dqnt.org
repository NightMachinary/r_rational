  I went through small demonstrations of each, leaving aside ink magic, because it took too long, water magic, because it needed more room, and skin magic, because it was excluded.

Soul magic isn't on the list. How would anyone even demonstrate that before a hostile audience?

I assume we are just meant to let its omission go without remark.

You know what /major HPMOR/ spoiler Chapter 188 reminds me of? HPMOR Chapter 081, but it didn't work for Mr. Potter.

The character developments continue to be a delight. Signing in Gimb for the occasion is inspired.

The twist in the last chapter, of a player character having a 'phase', is great. I am a big fan of how the whole fight unfolded, and I enjoyed the plant matter puns, but this is a different kind of catharsis.

That armor of Onion's doesn't seem reusable, given how it collapsed. Maybe if it's not fully depleted orbs can be replaced?

More and more of the hidden pieces falling away in this update. Last Druid. Fast learner. Raven.
