Upthread, someone observed that when Joon "turned off" his pain reception to resist torture, he actually just grabbed a whole bundle of threads in his Spirit and disabled them. In theory, he could've turned off a lot more things than just pain, and that's why he's so lighthearted about going against the Court -- all the Onion jokes, going directly to murder to solve problems with Hyacinth, etc

I agree that it's a pleasant change of pace. I wonder if it'll persist when some of the shoes start to drop -- like the reunion with Bethel, interacting with the horrors of excluded monsters or further World Lords, etc
