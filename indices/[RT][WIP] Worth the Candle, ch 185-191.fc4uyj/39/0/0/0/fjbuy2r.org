That's fair;

That said, it feels a bit like a traditional TV show in the sense that there are specific focuses that change significantly from arc to arc or episode to episode, in the same way a tv show would change focus, while still having a through line that links everything up.

Kinda like how Buffy the vampire slayer or a lot of the CSI procedural shows work

Edit: wanted to add that web serials seem to lend themselves to that type of storytelling really well, now that I'm on that train of thought
