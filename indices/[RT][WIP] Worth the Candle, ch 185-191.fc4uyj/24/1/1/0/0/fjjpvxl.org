Oh, those are really good points. I guess we don't actually know how difficult it is to ascend through the Hells, compared to descending.\\
And Valencia might be keeping the ones that /can/ do that easily from being too bold.

Assuming Onion can destroy anything in the first ~3000 hells with a bonded stick, while also gaining a regeneration ability, he has better odds than I thought.

Which means the DM is /absolutely/ going to give him those odds and place him in a good spot for a reunion / callback!
