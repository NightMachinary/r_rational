I love the idea of the Hells arc starting, and Valencia just happens upon Onion going Doomslayer on an entire level... but I think that might be underestimating devils, or rather overestimating Bladebounds.

They're great in an arena with no magic allowed, but Infernals have their own unique magics in the Hells and I'm sure one of them can just shut him down from range eventually.
