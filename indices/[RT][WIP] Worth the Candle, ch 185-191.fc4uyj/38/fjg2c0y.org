Joon mentions a hypothetical social fatigue meter to match the mental fatigue meter he has because of gem magic. I'm going to predict that social fatigue is the resource behind gold magic because it would make it the matching pair to gem magic and explain why it has poise as it's secondary stat. I hope we get to see gold magic from the inside before the end of the story.
