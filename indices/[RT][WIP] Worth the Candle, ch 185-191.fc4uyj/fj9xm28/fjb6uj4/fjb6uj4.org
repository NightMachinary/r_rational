In the last batch, the party went to Anglecynn to resolve Amaryllis' issues with her family (her "cousin" Hyacinth sent the Dragonic Confedaracy at her and Miunun). While Amaryllis negotiated (in Chapter 185), Juniper, Pallida and Solace were captured by Allies of Hyacinth and brought to the Anglecynn black site, from which Juniper fought his way out. Edit: with the help of Solace.

Edit2: There also was a chapter showing what Val and Bethel are up to, which seems to be talking, manning a sweets shop, and local gang-busting/-reassignment.
