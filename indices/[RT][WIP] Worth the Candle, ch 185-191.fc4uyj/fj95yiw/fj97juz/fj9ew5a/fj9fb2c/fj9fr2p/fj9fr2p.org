If Juniper was unarmed bladebound he would have been attacking five times as fast as we saw him as a Monk, one degree less reasonably, and rolling twice the effective attributes. I don't think the balance you saw in that fight was a clear indication of the actual balance between these strats, especially as being inviolable opens up strategies he didn't use like simply flooding the whole arena with corrosive acid.
