Part of the reason it worked out for Juniper was that his change in tactics caught Onion off guard and didn't give him time to cycle for a counter sword. Even with that Juniper would have died if Amaryllis hadn't denied Onion her entad at the key moment. Maybe a different entad would have made up for it, but Juniper didn't actually know all the details going into the fight about how strong Onion was or all the virtues he would have.

I do agree that unarmored and unarmed would be the way to go if he has access to magic and the monkish virtues. Alas unless he's using the soul scaphism trick again later that probably won't come up.
