Here is the exact wording: "Unarmed Combat 70, Weapon Emulation: Your unarmed attacks may be considered weapons when it would be beneficial for them to be so. Also, your unarmed attacks may be considered short-range melee weapons (e.g. daggers) for the purposes of entads, magical effects, or pseudomagical effects, even when this would be unreasonable. Further, your unarmed attacks may be considered specific weapons, even exotic ones, even when this would be completely unreasonable."

Now it doesn't specifically say he can't copy entad effects. That is true, but then you have to answer the question of if he could do it, why didn't he? He never used this to copy an entad effect even though it would have made the fight a lot easier. Furthermore, if I saw this wording in a pen and paper rpg I would understand it to mean he can temporarily copy weapon keywords like in DnD.
