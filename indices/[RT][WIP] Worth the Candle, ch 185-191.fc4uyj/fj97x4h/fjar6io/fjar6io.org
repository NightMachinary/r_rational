A lot of the harem stuff is played straight (only for incredibly discomforting results instead of wish-fulfillment ones), but I still feel like there's an element of subversion here...

- You have the "Fated Heroine" being the second choice, with every interaction between them underscored by an existential dread that they're following the plan of an eldritch god

- The "young, innocent one" starts off as /dangerously, horrifyingly/ innocent, and progresses to an opposite kind of terrifyingly hyperaware of every social interaction that makes the MC seem innocent in comparison

- There's one that was both raped by his best friend and then raped the MC in turn - which holy fuck, I can't begin to unpack, is there even precedence to compare it to in other harems?

- Grak is surprisingly the most Harem-like, with a one-sided attraction that the protagonist returns half-heartedly as a friend (but is complicated primarily by issues of non-binary gender. Not a subversion really, but fairly uncommon)

- Raven is still not fully established, but there's an odd mix of "childhood friend I wronged and want to atone to" and "a way for me to get over the thing I sort of had for the ~30 year old man when I was 12 but not really" - classic Harem tropes!

- Joon is implicitly suggested to fuck the Doe by an achievement. What the fuck. I'm hoping there's some "Spiritual Druidic Soulbonding" bullshit equivalent to that, but judging by the DM's sense of humor... probably not.

And just looking at your example in particular: The clone feels a lot like a deliberate callback to the /previous time/ Joon fell in love with an alternate, doomed version of Amaryllis. This might be the start of a strange pattern for them... I have thoughts about the marriage stuff, but suffice it to say, their relationship is a strange meta-clusterfuck.

...Then there's *Fenn.* The "Upbeat second stringer that almost never wins but makes the entire harem work by just being there" which won easily, then had their relationship get so thoroughly broken that a supersocial therapist couldn't find a conceivable fix for it, and then she immediately died.

I don't know if "subversion" or "deconstruction" are really the words for it, but this harem sure is working on some 4D parallel universe logic!
