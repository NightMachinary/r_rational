I had a conversation on this subreddit a while back about whether or not the "harem" or more accurately the multi-person romantic elements of WTC were a subversion or not, with me firmly on the 'not' side. The idea on the subversion side being that while it has romance elements it never really goes into romantic tropes per se, its meant to deconstruct them.

Anyway Mary just had a clone herself made so that Joon and her could make out such that it "doesn't count", while they got political-married but it totally doesn't mean anything, baka! Give me any given year of harem anime and I swear I will find both of those plots somewhere on the seasonal chart!

Which is all praise btw, I find the romantic/personal elements of WTC to be some of the best parts of the story that really set it apart (prob said this before). Ratfics have a high tendency to dehumanize the characters via focus on the plot, and perhaps adopt an over-serious tone. The best characters always have the full spectrum of human problems to tackle, and sometimes they are tackled in patently ridiculous-while-also-serious ways.
