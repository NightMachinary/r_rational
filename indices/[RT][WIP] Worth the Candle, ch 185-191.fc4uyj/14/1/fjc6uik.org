In the reddit discussion for the world building the author mentioned they are saving description about the Gods for when they become relevant to the story... implying that they will become relevant enough in a future arc that an early description might be a spoiler?

I guess if a stadium of people suspect he is a god, then the story exposition will need to explain gods...
