Yeah, I think this is what it was. Onion could cut him, but the flickerblade thing isn't cutting. Void effects can damage inviolable objects, but this wasn't a /void/ voiding effect, it was an entad voiding effect that probably teleports the matter to another plane instead of just removing it from existence.

So as you can see, Aerbian magic is completely logical and consistent and not confusing at all.
