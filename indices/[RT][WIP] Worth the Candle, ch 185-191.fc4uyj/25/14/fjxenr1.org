In ch 190, we are told Joon has this virtue (emphasis added):

#+begin_quote
  *One-Handed Weapons 80, Diamond Blade:* */One-handed weapons you wield never break/* or dull, even if they would do so due to magic, magical effects, entads, or entad effects, though they may still suffer other conditions and effects. Your one-handed weapons do twice as much damage when they hit.
#+end_quote

But in ch 191, Joon's one-handed weapon breaks (emphasis added):

#+begin_quote
  I pulled a sword from Sable, completely non-magical and unbound, and parried the attacker from behind at the same time as I parried Onion in front of me. Unfortunately, the non-bonded blade wasn't infinitely sharp, and couldn't properly block the sword behind me, and I felt the bite of a blade before “dodging” ten feet away, my movement far more like teleportation than actual movement. */The sword I'd been using to parry with had been sliced in two/*, and I dropped it to the ground, with the probability blade held in front of me.
#+end_quote

How does a sword that can "never break" get "sliced in two"? Is that not a typical example of a "break"?

Or does the Diamond Blade virtue not apply to a one-handed weapon wielded in your offhand?

Or is there some inconsistency between the Diamond Blade virtue and the Grandmaster Blade-Bound virtue that is implicitly resolved in favour of the latter? (For reference, the latter provides: "Your bonded weapon is infinitely sharp ... Your bonded weapon can cut inviolable materials.")

In the case of an attack on "inviolable" armor, there is a clear corresponding exception in the Grandmaster Blade-Bound virtue ("can cut inviolable materials"). But in the case of an attack on an 'unbreakable' weapon, there is no such clear corresponding exception (eg "can break unbreakable materials"). I think that difference in language or approach is where my confusion has come from.

The significance of the precise language used in those virtues is highlighted later too (emphasis added):

#+begin_quote
  I saw my probability blade flicker once before materializing into a rusted, pitted sword. ... I swore at what complete bullshit it was that my sword wasn't actually inviolable like my armor was. */I had the Diamond Blade virtue, but it only said that my sword would never break/* or dull, and apparently two degrees of reasonableness wasn't enough for me to argue the point. */As I looked at the rusted out probability blade, it/* *hadn't* */actually broken/*, and the cutting edge was as sharp as ever, it was just that whatever magical effect had been applied to the blade, it had stopped it from doing its probability thing.
#+end_quote

In the first passage I raised above, the blade has actually broken.

PS I love everything about your story and your writing and I can't wait to read more of it and this comment is not intended to be critical in any way. The time I have spent dwelling on this reflects how much I love it.
