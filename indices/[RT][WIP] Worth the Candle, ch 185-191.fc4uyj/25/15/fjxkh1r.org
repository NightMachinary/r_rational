Ch 191:

#+begin_quote
  I was actually a /lot/ worse at swordfighting */while holding something in my offhand/*, and not just because I was really worried about the fire soaker suffering some malfunction or leak that would end up fucking me.
#+end_quote

This confused me at first, because the Off-handed virtue means there is no penalty for Joon holding items in his offhand:

#+begin_quote
  *One-Handed Weapons 60, Off-handed:* When wielding a one-handed weapon, using non-weapon items in your off-hand(s) can be done as easily as if you had both (or all) hands available, even when this is unreasonable. This applies to shields. For the purposes of this virtue, pistols and other one-handed ranged weapons are considered one-handed weapons.
#+end_quote

I think the original passage should read "while holding */a weapon/* in my offhand".

(I had initially thought the fire soaker was an item rather than a weapon, as it cannot itself inflict any damage --- it just sprays a liquid, which could be on an enemy but could also be on the ground, and the liquid so sprayed may ignite in particular circumstances, and the resulting fire may cause non-magical fire damage --- but given the properties of chlorine trifluoride I think it can reasonably be described as a ranged weapon too. And googling revealed to me that flamethrower weapons are apparently a thing in D&D anyway.)
