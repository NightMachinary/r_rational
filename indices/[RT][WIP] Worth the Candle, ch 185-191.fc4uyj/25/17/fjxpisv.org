Chs 23, 56 and 78 contain the following respectively:

#+begin_quote
  I'd gotten the “Nascent Blade-Bound” virtue by increasing Parry ...
#+end_quote

And:

#+begin_quote
  *Neophyte Blade-bound:* You have unlocked the ability to bond with a melee weapon, given a few minutes of meditation. You may only bond with one weapon at a time. When wielding a bonded weapon, double your effective skill with it, double your chance to parry, and you may cut with it as though it were twice as sharp.
#+end_quote

And:

#+begin_quote
  *Monkish Warrior:* While unarmed and unarmored, you may parry attacks as though you held a weapon, dodge at twice your effective skill, and automatically re-roll injuries if they are in the lowest five percent of outcomes (you keep any lower rolls).
#+end_quote

For consistency with these latest chapters, they should read "*Combo Virtue, X Blade-bound*" and "*Combo Virtue, Monkish X*".

We also still don't know the text of the Nascent Blade-bound virtue, which is curiously absent from the otherwise comprehensive list of skill virtues given in Ch 105.
