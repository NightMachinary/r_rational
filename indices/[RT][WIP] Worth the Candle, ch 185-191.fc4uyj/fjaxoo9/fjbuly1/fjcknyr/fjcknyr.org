I don't think he realizes that's Uther's heir until the battle starts.

Previous to that, there are hints, but there's been a lot of fakes before, so his estimated odds "This guy is the next Uther" have to be ridiculously low.

Also, he still almost kills Juniper. If Amaryllis hadn't teleported out to disable her sword, Joon would be dead.
