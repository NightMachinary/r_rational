  Plus in this fight the whole point is that the wards kill you if you break the rules so if Juniper ever thought he was going to lose he could kill Onion with magic.

No, the wards stop you from using most magics.

What the referee told Juniper was basically "If you manage to find a loophole and use magic anyway, we're executing you".

Although, really, if he'd been desperate enough to break the rules anyway, he could have pulled additional entads out of Sable to kill Onion, and then bailed with another entad. The arena seemed kind of unprepared for that possibility.

They could have warded the area against teleportation keys, but 1 that doesn't work against other random transport entads, 2 they clearly didn't since Mary managed to teleport out. Prior to the skin exclusion, they could have given Juniper a Fool's Choker, assuming the wards could be tuned to stop him from using skin magic without disabling the choker (and even then, that doesn't work if Juniper teleports to a place with a ward against skin magic).

I think the assumption was that warders would check that the contestants only brought two entads, and that none of the entads were teleportation related, but that obviously doesn't work with Sable since it can be used to smuggle additional entads.

Yeah, when you think about it, the opsec of this duel was kind of terrible. There wasn't much stopping either contestant from bailing if they thought they would lose, save for the fact that both of them completely expected to win and made no effort to prepare the other eventuality.

  If some multimage appears after already impossibly breaking out of my blacksites then I personally wouldn't take chances.

I dunno.

This seems like when people complained about Superman losing the fight at the end of /The Metropolitan Man/. Like, yeah, okay, the character made some really poor decisions, but I can kind of buy that after a lifetime of being completely, utterly unconcerned about any kind of physical harm, he'd just get into the habit of assuming he's going to win any fight he gets in.

(although, yeah, some kind of line where he goes "Oh shit, you might be Uther's successor after all; I might be fucked" would have been nice)

I was more annoyed about the dragon lady explicitly recognizing that Joon was like Uther, explicitly saying that Uther kept slaughtering his enemies no matter how much they prepared for him, and she still thinks it's a good idea to blackmail him.
