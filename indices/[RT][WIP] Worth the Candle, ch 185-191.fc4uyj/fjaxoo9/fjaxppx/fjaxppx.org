  Onion was so completely fucked. As I read through the virtue list, I was practically laughing.
#+end_quote

Well, hello there, Juniper's hubris. You're showing up more and more often lately.

Seriously, the first thing that occurred to me when reading that virtue list was "Oh, so that guy /did/ cut a car in two with his sword". Juniper not noticing that Onion probably had most of the perks on that list seems really extremely overconfident of him.

  “Assume that this is the most deadly serious fight of your life,” said Amaryllis.

  “When I kill him, can I put ‘World's Best Swordsman' on my business card?” I asked.

I feel really sorry for Mary.

  I ran forward to attack this work in progress, and was brought to my knees by a glow of green magic that shrieked in my skull. It didn't stop until Onion was back together, gasping within his armor, whole once more, even the fingers that I'd cut off back on his hand.
#+end_quote

Oh wow, the boss fight armor even has a way to enforce cutscenes built-in. That's convenient.

  The only difference was that one of the three green lights on his chest was burned out.
#+end_quote

If I were Onion, I would have added some decorative bit over the life-counter gems. That way, even if my opponent managed to kill me, they'd assume I was immortal and probably lose some morale and/or try something reckless instead of wearing me down.

On the other hand, Onion really wasn't expecting Juniper to kill him even once, so that's an understandable mistake.

  There was a gel made by an aquatic plant that firefighters would smear themselves with before running into a fire, and chlorine trifluoride set it on fire at the moment of first contact. It was impressive, seeing chlorine trifluoride burn through a piece of starmetal, which was supposed to stop dragonfire, but it really made me think that I was playing with something way beyond my paygrade
#+end_quote

Okay, so I looked for videos about chlorine trifluoride on Youtube, and holy shit this stuff is bad. It can kill you on contact even if you wash it away /and also amputate the affected limb/.

Like, I'm a little mad at Juniper for trying it in an arena where hundreds of people are watching.

  “What was that?” he asked me.
#+end_quote

Occupe-toi de tes oignons.

#+begin_quote
  “Oh come on,” I said. “You're going to hide, you miserable coward?” [...] “Are you seriously going to make me come in there?” I asked.
#+end_quote

Wow. Juniper is really acting like a generic video game boss now. Getting mad at his opponent for using smart, prudent tactics? What an ass.

#+begin_quote
  The level up had been witnessed by about a thousand people, and I was guessing that was going to complicate things.
#+end_quote

Oh yeah, that's what's going to complicate things.

The DBZ fight where you just killed the best swordsman in the world, with your bare hands, in underwear, everyone was going to accept it. But a glowing yellow light healing you? That's crossing a line.
