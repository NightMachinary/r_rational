  Onion was the kind of man who there were always rumors about, which made it hard to separate fact from fiction. It was said that he'd parried a car once, using his blade to sweep it aside. During his time in the Golden Cete, he'd reportedly killed fifty men single handedly when his company's position had been overrun. His blade was supposedly so pseudomagically sharp that it could slice clean through a person in full plate without so much as slowing down.
#+end_quote

Can I just comment on how bullshit Onion's own life must have been, from his perspective?

Like, at first the guy starts murdering people, and they send him to a deadly wasteland in what other countries consider a particularly barbaric form of execution. He survives that, starts murdering people again, then gets sent to a deadlier wasteland.

And then, through the process of escaping /that/, he becomes so good at killing things that it's considered legally impossible to arrest him, and physically impossible to kill him.

Like, seriously, look at the virtues Juniper lists, and consider that he probably has most of them.

He can /parry cars with a sword/.

He can parry bullets shot by a sniper from behind him /even if he has no awareness of the sniper/, and his sword is sheathed when the sniper pulls the trigger.

This is a guy who has lived his full life with the power available to a late campaign player character, and who acts exactly the part. His analysis of Juniper was amazing.

And then, despite his lifetime of training, despite the fact that he brings one of the most overpowered entads his country has to offer, he gets punched to death by an asshole in underwear.

Too bad, I liked him.

  “I'm afraid that's not the offer,” said Hyacinth. “You agreed to my terms once, then went to Rosemallow and decided on renegotiating. I'm not going to let you leave here so that you can use this meeting as leverage.” There was an unspoken ‘again'. Amaryllis had used Hyacinth as leverage over Rosemallow.
#+end_quote

It seems a little strange that Amaryllis doesn't even consider checking in with Grak and Juniper, considering what she said earlier about them being stakeholder. That was a really easy trap to avoid.

On the other hand, maybe it's the kind of mistake that's a lot easier to see in hindsight, since we already know what happened to Juniper.

#+begin_quote
  “I'm with child,” said Hyacinth, placing a hand against her stomach. “My little boy will grow up not knowing his father.” She shook her head, and a real, actual tear slid down her face. Crying on command was, Amaryllis knew, difficult, though easier if you were drawing on actual emotions. Who knew whether the pregnancy was real. It was never a lie you could call someone on, and if there were no baby, then she could simply claim a miscarriage. “I know that what Larkspur did was wrong. I said as much to him. If you killed him in self-defense --- all I want to know is what happened.”
#+end_quote

It's interesting that the thought that Hyacinth may be sincerely grieving doesn't even occur to Mary.

On the one hand, given what we know about Hyacinth, her previous actions, the fact that she's very much in the process of screwing Mary over, and what we generally know about how deceptive Penndraig can get, it seems very likely that this was a bait on some level.

On the other hand, Mary watches a woman cry about her dead husband and their unborn child, and the only thought that comes to her is "Okay, so what kind of game is this?"

I can kind of see what she said about her family making her a worse person.

#+begin_quote
  “No,” said Pallida. “That was the thing that pissed me off, and what's pissing me off now. I was given orders that would require killing people, sometimes innocent, sometimes not, and then, when I killed people in order to do the thing I had been sent to do, I would get scolded, just enough so that Uther could put up this paper-thin pretense.”
#+end_quote

Oooh, nice. Don't think I didn't see that parallel with Welexi.

Uther's "probably the final villain" meter just went up a few notches.

#+begin_quote
  Amaryllis nodded. “We just went to get some answers from an expert. Things heated up considerably.”
#+end_quote

"Do you /ever/ go anywhere without triggering a public firefight?"

#+begin_quote
  “That's classified,” said Raven.

  “Classified by what authority?” asked Phlox.

  “Uther Penndraig,” replied Raven. “And by classifying authorities that must themselves remain classified, for the good of Aerb.”
#+end_quote

This is completely dumb and I love it.

"Fuck you. What I do is so classified that you don't even get to know why it's classified."

#+begin_quote
  “Yes,” replied Amaryllis, almost as soon as the question was out of my mouth. “Per the Decency Acts, Juniper and I have been cohabiting for the past three months and qualify to waive the wait time. I need a witness to vouch.”

  “I --- I vouch,” said Lisi from her place on the council.

  [...] Phlox called out, “Silence them.”

  I wasn't good enough at vibration magic to out-compete both of the vibration mages at the same time, though I sure gave it my damnedest. Fortunately, Amaryllis was prepared, because she started rapidly signing in Gimb.
#+end_quote

The fact that any of this has any legal validity at all makes me wonder what kind of shenanigans the people who designed these laws got up to.

#+begin_quote
  “So,” I said.

  Amaryllis looked at me. “Just so we're clear, this is a purely mercenary arrangement.”
#+end_quote

*DON'T YOU DARE! The ship will not be denied!*

#+begin_quote
  “Her as she was when she died?” asked Amaryllis. “If through some magic the Dungeon Master just plopped her right down between us?” Amaryllis waited a beat, as though willing that to happen through sheer comedic value alone.
#+end_quote

Prime Omake material right there.

#+begin_quote
  “I can help with that,” said Rosemallow, who had crept up on the room we were using, and was standing in the doorway, watching us all at the table.
#+end_quote

Wait, when she did get here? They were discussing some pretty sensitive stuff, notably the game logic, why wasn't Juniper muting the conversation?

#+begin_quote
  “These are terrible,” said Amaryllis. “Amarlikeness?”

  “Pot, kettle,” I replied. “Simuryllis?”

  “Oh, that's very good,” said Amaryllis with a smile.
#+end_quote

I think the first Amaryllis should be "Bmaryllis", and the second one "Simuryllis", to keep up the running gag.

#+begin_quote
  "Now, I won't tell you things that the other me wouldn't want me to: I'm on Primaryllis' side, fully and completely. But she has explicitly had the thought that interpersonal issues could have a better chance of working out if I, the simulation, made the promise that I would keep confidentiality. Think about it like the library timeline. There, I was free to do what I wanted and experiment without fear of destroying the world or hurting the ones I loved. It's a tool for conflict avoidance. It's save scumming for hard conversations."
#+end_quote

Amaryllis is a /serious/ munchkin.

The idea of using clones for social save-scumming didn't even occur to me.

#+begin_quote
  “Sure,” I said. “I think it's ... basically exactly what I wanted, or what I didn't know I wanted. I really care about you, and it sometimes feels like we've been married for months already, since there's a level of commitment we have that feels eternal. Like we're platonic life partners? And this way I get bonded to you, and I have an excuse not to push it, because it's just a platonic, fake thing, but you know that I care about you, and in public we just have this comfortable pretending. I think it's hard, otherwise, to let people know that you have a platonic lifemate. They would get the wrong idea, one way or another.”
#+end_quote

Wait wait wait, this is all great character exploration and stuff, but I think we're missing the bigger question here.

What the hell is the etymology of "Platonic" in Anglish?

#+begin_quote
  “I used to imagine having sex with you a lot,” I said. “You were in my dreams. It was a distraction. Sometimes I would get angry with you for being so good-looking. It was like an assault on my senses, this unwelcome intrusion.”
#+end_quote

I know that everyone involved in this conversation is aware that this is irrational and Not Something You're Supposed to Think, but I still wish they'd acknowledge it a little more.

#+begin_quote
  “I don't know,” I replied. “It's low stakes, no offense. Getting back on the horse, but it's a small horse, and it's going to disappear in less than a day, so if I fuck up, or can't handle it, or it goes terribly, then I can just pretend that it didn't happen, because the horse will be gone.”
#+end_quote

... wow.

Didn't put a lot of points in SOC lately, did you?

#+begin_quote
  Amaryllis and Simuryllis had a private conversation early the next morning
#+end_quote

Who is this Amaryllis you speak off? Clearly the only people here were Simuryllis and Primaryllis.

Also, we /are/ assuming that at least half of that "private conversation" was them making out, right?

#+begin_quote
  “I have a question,” I said. “Let's say that I murder Onion, proving my innocence. What's to stop me from committing another crime, declaring trial by combat, and then going up against the second greatest swordsman of all time, or whoever takes his place? Do I just kill a person for every crime I commit?”
#+end_quote

Wow, being in Anglecynn is /not/ doing good things to Juniper's mental state.

They need to go back to more dignified matters that he can address with the seriousness they deserve, like murdering Captain Blue-In-the-Bottle.
