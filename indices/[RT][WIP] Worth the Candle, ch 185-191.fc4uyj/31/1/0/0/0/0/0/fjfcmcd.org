I agree with you.

I really want more Onion and I am kinda upset that this character existed for so short a time.

On the other hand, the character clearly think that he is going to win right up until it becomes impossible to escape. Don't discount the sheer /momentum/ that people have in their own lives. It really does just take time to update ones opinions and how easy it is to do things by rote.
