On this episode of /Onionball Z/:

Amaryllis is so deep into Earth culture that "Fucking Christ" has a genuine response from her when pissed off.

Two people who spend literal hours thinking over the narrative implications of their decisions literally sit next to each other and say "This is definitely a farce of a marriage - conveniently we can supply true testimony of our many hours cuddling, taking long walks together, and that time I was in love with you as evidence of its validity."

In the ultimate clash of Final Fantasy 3 classes, the Onion Knight takes on the Black Belt!
