Also wanted to say: I was tense/thrilled the whole time reading all these new chapters, for constantly new reasons.

Was anyone else expecting a dramatic Amaryllis#1-was-Amaryllis#2-all-along twist, or a subversion of that twist? I was sure it was going to happen (despite that not being at all an Amaryllis move) or Joon would bring up the possibility.
