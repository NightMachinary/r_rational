  we had no way to permanently kill his revision mage besides Mary's sword

So... just so we are clear on what happened there...

My understanding is that Mary's sword materializing inside the mage's head could not be undone because, as mentioned in chapter 11, "generally speaking, magic cannot be reversed [by revision magic]".

I wonder what would have happened had she killed him with a regular sword. Would the mage just keep auto-reversing time on death, further and further back, even against multiple assailants? Or is there some limit to it?

Also: I'm a fan, awesome story, please keep writing :)
