Still a fan.

Two things though, first, the text was unclear. Was Juniper one of the things Amaryllis went out of the way to avoid mentioning or not ?

Second, the dwarf character. I can't put my finger on exactly what my issue is but he's acting way too confident and sure of his standing in the group. And, though I may have missed it, why did he get such a good deal when joining up with the group. I didn't miss the unenforceable part of the contract, but for the moment the group is acting like it's a binding contract.
