  but for the moment the group is acting like it's a binding contract.

It's not binding, but Juniper has loyalty numbers next to the guy's name that shows he /intends/ to follow through. Those numbers literally enforce /good faith/, which is almost as good as binding consequences for breakage of the agreement.

Dwarves have a stereotype for being blunt and cutting through the crap, and if Dwarf Guy had something he's unsure of, he doesn't really have a reason /not/ to raise it, unless it's something to hide. So there's not much to surprisingly wreck the arrangement barring unknown unknowns.

And finally, the relationship is mutually beneficial - it sounds like gold mages are a blight on society, and they're genuinely doing the world a favour by robbing the gold mages of their gold. More importantly, they're pocketing /half/ of said gold. Which to be fair, will make enemies, but enemies who were just massively (permanently!) depowered and should be fairly easily killed.
