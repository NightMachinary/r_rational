So what you're saying is you want a really exotic and angsty love triangle, yesss? The one thing it won't be is glossed over since there have been frequent hints that the characters are aware of their relationships shifting the party dynamic.

Joon only speculated that Loyalty can't go down. I'm interested in how the Companion mechanic seems to go both ways. The unnatural intensity of Joon's emotions toward Amaryllis (beyond just physical attraction), his increasing willingness to open up to Fenn as her loyalty grew, or even just jumping the gun once he saw Grak had a loyalty metric. He's essentially letting the game dictate who his companions are, but it feels like he can't help it. Part propinquity, bigger part [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_(social_psychology)][reciprocity]]. Imagine knowing someone's loyalty to you is growing, your natural inclination is to trust them more. The system is pretty insidious.

I wouldn't mind seeing a defrosted Amaryllis, but her being this beautiful girl perfectly tailored to Joon does seem like an ideal setup for the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNotLoveInterest][not-love interest]]. There's only been evidence of her using Joon, but it doesn't seem like he'll just be led along and manipulated. He's been repeatedly annoyed at Amaryllis trying to own him, so the fuel's been cast for some fireworks later.

I think it's likely that Fenn is feeling both and Joon just (conveniently) happens to satisfy both. She's been living under the stigma of being a halfie where neither race is willing to open up. Then suddenly an extraterrestrial with no preconceptions appears with whom she's compatible. Natural or unnatural, it's like a divine neon sign: sign me up for this kharass.

I think Grak's fine. Bluntness is inherently proactive. His motivations are more clearly defined (and purely economic) than the others right now, so one day isn't enough for him to "fit in".
