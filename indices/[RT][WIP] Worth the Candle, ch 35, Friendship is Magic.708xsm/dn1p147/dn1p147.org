Gotta say, I do hope Joon doesn't end up sleeping with either Fenn or Amaryllis, or at least that if he does, it's not glossed over as either relatively normal, or cause the usual intra-party drama that Grak is hinting at.

The point is already made that the Companion mechanic seems to affect these three's cognition regarding Joon. Maybe it's just putting a number on natural friendship and affection, but the part where it appears unlikely to go down, and Fenn's own observations on being unnaturally forgiving toward Joon mean there's probably something more to it.

It really does seem to me that Amaryllis, despite Joon's sudden insight into her potentially vulnerable side, is genuinely pretty emotionally detached from him and sees him primarily as a tool for her own ends. Maybe it's just wishful thinking on my part, but stories are so often told from the other side of the coin, that getting to see Joon deal with being led along and manipulated would be far more interesting than having him just defrost the Ice Queen over time.

Fenn's whole situation is pitiable - she appears to be developing feelings for Joon, beyond just playful flirting, but it's not clear to me whether it's a desire simply for companionship without fear of abandonment or a desire for a romantic relationship. And I imagine it's not clear to Fenn whether they're natural or not. There's a couple different ways this can go for her, and none of them seem unambiguously positive.

Hoping we get more depth out of Grak soon, though. For now he's blunt almost to the point of feeling like a tool for the author to inject plot-focused progression, rather than a character in his own right.
