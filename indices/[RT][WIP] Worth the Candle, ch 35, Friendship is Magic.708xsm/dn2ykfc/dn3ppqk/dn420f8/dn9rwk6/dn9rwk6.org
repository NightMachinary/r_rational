He has no examples to work from. With Blood Magic he was taught directly, with Skin Magic he gained skill by actively trying to move a magical tattoo around (which is a core ability of the skill), with Bone Magic he got a crash course from a practitioner, and with Gem Magic he had the raw materials and a guide provided.

If he was going to try to learn Revision Magic, where would he have started, given his resources at the time?
