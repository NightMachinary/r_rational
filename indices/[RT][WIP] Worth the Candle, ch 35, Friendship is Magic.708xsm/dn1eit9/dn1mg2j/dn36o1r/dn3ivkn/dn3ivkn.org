I actually like the more sedate chapters a little more than the actiony ones; I'm interested in the overarching plot, but I'm /invested/ in the characters, Joon's old gaming group as well as his current adventuring party.

So you definitely shouldn't feel like the sedate, slice-of-life chapters are going unappreciated, because they aren't.
