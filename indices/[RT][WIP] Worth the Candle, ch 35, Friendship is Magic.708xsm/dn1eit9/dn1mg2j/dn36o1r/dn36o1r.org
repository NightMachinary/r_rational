I'm hopeful that the rapid update schedule makes these more sedate chapters a little more bearable, because if there's just some slice-of-lifeish stuff like this for a chapter you're not thinking "well I need to hibernate for a month while I wait for the next one", it'll just be another two or three days (probably more on the three days side this time, if not a bit longer).
