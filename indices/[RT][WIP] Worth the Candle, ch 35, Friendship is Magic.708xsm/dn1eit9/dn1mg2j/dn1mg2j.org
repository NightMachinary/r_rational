Yep, this is a chapter that is hard to get excited about reading by itself but is a necessary interlude for the plot and characters.

I envy the binge readers who will read this later on as they plow through these kinds of chapters without waiting as opposed to those of us reading one chapter at a time.

Still, sounds like the party got some cool new items which will have some tactical flexibility for them going forward. I am still just waiting on pins and needles with excitement in wondering how Juniper will invest his stat points. :)
