It's not a matter of /avoiding/ exposition, it's making exposition /interesting/. You can give dozens of pages of exposition, so long as it's engaging. There are a number of people that do this in the real world, but I think it's a very difficult skill to learn and master. If four million people are willing to sit down and watch this video on [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kF8I_r9XT7A][how to become pope]] or something -- if people will seek these things out and watch them for entertainment -- then the real issue with putting exposition in isn't that people dislike exposition, it's that most exposition is boring. But I don't think it has to be.

One of the ways to do this is your fourth point; you can add exposition in the form of character conflict, which is inherently more interesting than just a boring monologue. I think a study of real-world exposition-as-entertainment is probably the way to go, if you want to make exposition into something that people /want/ to read.
