No specific points to add, but overall I really enjoyed the expository style used here: [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/777002/chapters/1461984]]

Essentially each chapter begins with excerpts from news articles, encyclopedia, books, etc. There are quite a lot of flashbacks to important events, and quite early in the story there are even two fairly lengthy chapters dedicated to one character watching a movie about notable events earlier in her life which has just been released to cinemas. The plot events and experience of watching (in pseudo-virtual reality) are described in detail. The movie is my least favourite of these expositions as I felt it dragged a bit, but it's fairly ingenious in the abstract. I loved the encyclopedia entries, especially those where sections are marked e.g. /only available to those with level three clearance/. This creates an interesting dynamic where the reader discovers what information (at a minimum) various characters are privy to by knowing their security clearance level. Hope some of this is useful.
