I'm currently trying some meta-exposition via the use of a wiki appendix.

And I do love the use of news stories in world as a way to get the background feel.

Although I feel like I might have accidentally overdone some of the realism of "you are not important, the world is as huge and vast as our own and every little part is full of people dealing with what you are dealing with"

However I have some plans to actually 'datestamp' parts of that wiki so that there are actually entries/versions of it that sync up to particular stages in the plot.

In that particular case though all of those exposition bits are from my perspective considered 'optional for the reader' and I don't want to depend on it to allow the story to be enjoyable.

Essentially it's slightly polished versions of already existing world building notes.
