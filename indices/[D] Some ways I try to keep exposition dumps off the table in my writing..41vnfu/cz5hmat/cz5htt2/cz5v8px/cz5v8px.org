One idea would be to disguise exposition as progress. Say for example I haven't really gone into the geographic or political makeup of the world. To remedy that I could have a character describe a list of items they need for a trip, and have those indirectly describe how the world works (... We need bug repellent for Barten, bear repellent for Zajer, lichen repellent for Neb).

You get the idea, have exposition in such a way it doesn't slow the story.
