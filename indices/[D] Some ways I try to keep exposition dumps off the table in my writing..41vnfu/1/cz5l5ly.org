The big literary innovation of cyberpunk as a sub-genre was the way that the characters, and the narrator, take all the new technology for granted. It happens /after/ the big changes, so it doesn't waste time having anybody explain them to a newbie. Instead we figure out what has changed by watching how the plot has that tech being used, or worn, or manipulated, or broken, or repaired.

The same way we might write about the use of a cell phone, a video streaming service, or a hybrid car.

Magic can also be treated this way, or the details of a character's backstory, or the politics of an imaginary country. Basically it's exposition as dramatic irony in reverse: Everybody understands except the reader.
