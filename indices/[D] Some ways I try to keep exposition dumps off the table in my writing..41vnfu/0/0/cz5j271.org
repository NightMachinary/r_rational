Indeed, the term for real life exposition is teaching and as I said before I'm quite thrilled by it across LOTS of forms. But I've seen that there is important degrees of 'buy in' you need in order for teaching a subject to an audience.

I like exposition perhaps a bit much and I've noticed that it seems to be rather common in rationalist fiction authors to like it quite a lot too, so in this case I am avoiding exposition as a counter to my own perceived bias. And as I said above, I think I'm still calibrating the adjustment to actually hit the sweet spot.

Thank you for the point of fun exposition! It's easy to get caught up in a hole of trying to not do things and forget about the fun!
