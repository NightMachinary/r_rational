I don't think the story mentions any age, but the characters clearly aren't 11. They talk, act and think as near-adults. Somewhere between 15 and 18. I dont know about their age in the source material, but that's not really relevant anyway.

The scene with Ino and Sasuke happens very early in the story, when there's only been aimited number of short loops. The main character is still basically the same age at the point.

Later in the story she has lots more sex, but as far as I recall only with adults or other loopers.
