I'll agree Timebraid's ages are weird, and it definitely requires a disclaimer before being recommended. His Daniel Black series also has a high amount of sex, but lacks the whole squicky age problem.

But it's source is pretty weird about ages too. Ninja are typically given minimal training and enter a death match to try and become Chunin at age 12 or so.

It's a world where valuable magic users, even the children of the powerful leaders of communities, are made into child soldiers and have their lives, IMO, wasted frivolously.

They shouldn't act like normal children, because they haven't had anything like a normal childhood. It's also possible Chakra changes how people mature mentally.

Kakashi became a Chunin at age 6. Frankly, I don't see how else to make sense of that without Chakra making humans have some pretty big biological differences.
