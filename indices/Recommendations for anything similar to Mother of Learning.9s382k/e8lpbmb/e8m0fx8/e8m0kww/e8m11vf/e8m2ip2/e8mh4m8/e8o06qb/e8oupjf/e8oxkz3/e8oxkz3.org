Well, in no particular order:

1. Sakura was locked into her mind and tortured moderately early on, by creating a smaller virtual time loop starting from a particular moment where the torturer has godlike controls. It hints at rape, directly mentions being dissected while still alive, and a good number of tortures that we don't have words for because it is not possible.

2. With these tortures he created a second trick by "releasing" her, and then giving orders, and putting her back into the other full torture system any time she slightly failed so as to condition her to be as perfectly mindless of a slave as possible.

3. Straight up mind control happens at several points in time.

4. As she is sneaking into a house she gets attacked. casually murders the guy trying to protect his family. This was basically a single sentence, but when murder is such a common occurance "opps, well moving on" is your answer, that is a bad sign.

5. Locking hinata's very soul to be always owned by demon sakura, for eternity. But that is alright, because over the past few weeks they "fell in love". ( for those keeping score, this is pedophilia, followed by claiming an immortal soul, pleasure pain conditioning, and controlling her to harm others and herself because the demon said so)

6. The plan to literally carry every soul in the world physically into hell, along with the world itself, to be tortured for all time.

After that it gets foggy. Does wanton murder count? Stripping someone, tying them up and carving their skin? How many different ways of losing your free will? They carved a guys eyes out early on, so she could wear them. Manipulated pretty much everyone, including kids, into having kinky sex? Throwing kids into basically a pit fight with knives to murder each other? Does the training of child soldiers count as worse? How about the Caged Bird seal?

hell, even canon has mutilation of babies by parents, powerful drugs, mind control, suicide, training of child soldiers, and pit fighting them to death.
