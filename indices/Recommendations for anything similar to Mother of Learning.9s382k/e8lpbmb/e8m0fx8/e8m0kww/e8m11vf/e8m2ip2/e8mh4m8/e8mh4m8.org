Just to tack onto what Aardvarkeating101 said and forestall arguing about definitions, not only is pedophilia usually condemned for the power imbalance (which is present in this example), but even when young children (who are usually abused and are essentially using what they've been taught) have sex play with their cohorts, the other children then generally show trauma afterwards. Time traveler having sex with 11 year-olds ticks all the components for what makes pedophilia objectionable.
