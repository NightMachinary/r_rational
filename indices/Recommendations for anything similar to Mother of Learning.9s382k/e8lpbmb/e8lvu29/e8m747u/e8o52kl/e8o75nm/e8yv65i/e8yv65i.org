I tried watching Naruto, but I absolutely hated it. The characters were absolutely horrible and cliche, the animation was mediocre and the whole thing was weirdly sexist. Didn't make it past 5 minutes into the first episode.

I do seem to enjoy Naruto fanfiction. Read both Time Braid and The Waves Arisen. Had to do some reading up on the setting initially, but after that it wasnt a big deal.
