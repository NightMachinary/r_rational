I watched and enjoyed naruto, but nothing about MoL specifically screamed "NARUTO REFERENCE" to me... Even now that the connection has been pointed, it's not obvious to me that shaping exercises were adapted from chakra control exercises. I've seen similar things in a bunch of different fictional universes.

For example, one of Andur's books (I think it was Agent of the Realm) has a mana control exercise in a classroom setting where students have to try to hold an floating object in place without anchoring it to the position of their hand, just like in MoL. Isn't stuff like that fairly standard training fare for fantasy?
