What I loved about MoL is the gradual improvements Zorian made throughout the story. Cradle by Will Wight and the Arcane Ascension series by Andrew Rowe. The MCs in both stories start weak and gradually improve their strengths to overcome challenges.

If you like the time travel aspect, Time Braid, which is a Naruto fanfiction and is complete is written pretty well. The MC in there is Sakura, but Naruto gets enough screen time as well. She is not stupid or annoying as in canon either. You need a little familiarity with the series to enjoy it though.
