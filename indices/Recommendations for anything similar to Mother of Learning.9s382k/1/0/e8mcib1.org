I felt that the later chapters of [[http://moodylit.com/index.php/the-good-student-table-of-contents][The Good Student]] were less clear, replacing precise descriptions by vague concepts. While I think a sense or lack of clarity is merely a stylistic choice, it is something I always appreciated about MoL. Apart from that, I do think it is worth reading.
