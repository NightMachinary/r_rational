If you're starting out, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index][the wiki]] is a good place to start.

Personal recommendations: "Worth the Candle" and "A Practical Guide to Evil". Both are quite popular around here.

If you have more specific things about MoL that you enjoyed, we might be able to narrow down some recommendations.
