Firstly, I'd recommend exploring the various time loop stories. Time Braid and Purple Days are good examples.

I also felt like litrpg's scratch a similar itch. Rowe's Sufficiently Advanced Magic is more of a litrpg lite but still great, Ascend Online is a good example of a solid traditional litrpg.
