My favorite thing about Mother of Learning's worldbuilding is how obviously Naruto/Chakra-system-inspired it is. I absolutely love that aspect of Naruto, and it adds so much depth to Mother of Learning. A world in which magic is literally omnipresent, bloodline limits exist, the huge focus on (ahem) chakra control, etc.
