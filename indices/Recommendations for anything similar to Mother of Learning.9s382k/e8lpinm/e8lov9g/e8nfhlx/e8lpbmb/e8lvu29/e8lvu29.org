Or, if you want the badfic version of Time Braid, you can read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411/1/Chunin-Exam-Day][Chuunin Exam Day]], which is inarguably its inspiration.

I mention this because I'm fairly sure Mother of Learning owes its existence to Chuunin Exam Day - the author was active in the Naruto fandom before writing it, and a lot of worldbuilding elements and themes are similar. (Chakra control exercises versus shaping exercises, the long time loop in specific, the emphasis on finding different masters and learning things from them, and Zack in particular, who is basically Naruto with Sasuke's backstory.) I'm not certain, but that's definitely what I had in mind when I was reading it.
