I think it's a level divorced from that. It's "Naruto-fanfic" inspired rather than Naruto-inspired. Again, read Chuunin Exam Day. Or don't read it since it's pretty garbage, quality-wise, but it was certainly influential.

Many of the elements from Arc 1 of Mother of Learning have the same "flavor" as the powerups in Chuunin Exam Day. For specific examples, basically all of Zorian's work with working on (the basic 3) shaping to make your attacks invisible and modify magic/techniques fall into that category, including the idea of a "basic three" techniques for training/needed to progress to better magic. The numerous shaping exercises (in Arc 1) that improve control were clearly inspired by it and had analogues in Chuunin Exam Day in terms of how they were described. Some of the later ideas like bringing people across loops and some of the mind technique stuff also have a similar style to how those ideas are implemented in Chuunin Exam Day or Time Braid.

Edit: Another thing that comes to mind is how Zach claims that people are willing to train him due to being the last Noveda when explaining himself to Zoria- this is basically what people do for Sasuke (or rather, Naruto impersonating Sasuke) in Chunin Exam Day and is phrased in a very similar manner. It gets actual further development later on in MoL, when we actually learn about the Noveda, but the initial shorthand explanation in Chapter 8 of Mother of Learning definitely feels like it's straight out of CED.

Another minor thing that gives it the same feel is the one-month time limitation. Both Chuunin Exam Day and the early parts of Time Braid use time loops that only last one month (more accurately, just over 5 weeks, with one month of training before the end of each loop), due to primarily taking place during the Chuunin exam arc. Most other groundhog day/time loop-type fiction uses a different timescale- some have each loop last for a full lifetime, some are a single day like the titular movie, some are loops that slowly progress forward in time, etc.
