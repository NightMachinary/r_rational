I enjoyed it for the first 4 books of escape death but after that it started falling off, and that hard. The main character keeps being an unbearable twat, which is fun for the first little while but becames grating once we got further in and the group stays rather immature despite several life and death situations. And the whole thing wiht that dead god that wasn't actually dead was just sprung so randomly that it kind of ruined it for me.
