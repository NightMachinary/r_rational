I've had dreams (for /years/) about strange movie theaters, and strange bathrooms, and strange jumping that's kinda like flying but not.

Like, the theaters will have a few quarter-wide rows of normally oriented seats pointed at a strangely angled screen that's like a quarter of the size of a real screen, and then in the same room will be seats pointed like 45 degrees widdershins aimed at like a row of smaller screens all showing the same movie but the screens are like five feet in front of them and like 10 feet up in the air and beside the bigger screen, and then beside the normally oriented seats will be seats pointed backwards and it's always just a weird mess with randomly sized screens in random locations and little clusters of seats randomly scattered around, and half the time I have those dreams there's actual /stuff/ that /makes sense/ happening on the screens and I'll watch for a few minutes and then /that'll become the new dream/, like one second I'm watching a first-person perspective on a screen and then it morphs into that actually being my perspective, and half the time /that/ happens it's a strange map of Call of Duty Nazi Zombies. Sometimes the theaters are less weird, like one time it was a few normal-width rows but with another set of rows a dozen feet in front of them and facing them with screens behind each of the sets of seats, or maybe two normal sized screens directly beside each other but angled so they're somewhat facing each other and there'll be multiple levels of seats with some of them facing one screen and some of them facing the other.

The bathrooms always have weird layouts and there's usually like door in a weird place (like between two urinals or behind a secret wall) that leads into a huge bathroom/locker-room combo that has multiple levels connected by stairs, and just room after room, and it's always maze-like and the rooms eventually lose their bathroomishness and become like generic industrial rooms with lots of long 5-foot-high walls that aren't really connected to each other.

The jumping/flying ones are always the most vividly vivid, it'll be exactly like real life except there'll be situational context that requires me to jump, and I'll jump like 10 feet straight up, then like 30 feet straight up, then just keep jumping forwards at like 30 to 50 feet up and it feels super real.

Except for the jumping, it's always weird architecture with a ridiculous floor-plan. And it's always vivid, but never quite crosses over to lucid, and it happens at least three times a week.

I'm not sure why I told you all that, probably because I ought to have gone to sleep like 9 hours ago but I'm staying up the rest of the day to reset my sleep schedule.
