  I also really appreciate all the work that went into the story and aesthetics of Opus Magnum, which really didn't need to be there given that it's a puzzle game. Like in Shenzen I/O, I think it adds an extra level of investment and progression.

I strongly disagree. The fancy graphics, story, and sound effects angered me significantly more than they amused me. In playing the game*, I was constantly wondering how much cheaper /and better-looking/ a no-frills version of the game (looking and sounding like /The Codex of Alchemical Engineering/) would have been. (+IIRC,+ Zachtronics even posted on +Facebook and/or+ [[https://twitter.com/zachtronics/status/979112047689396224][Twitter]] some [[https://i.imgur.com/EIJdJQz.gif][concept art]] that looked more like /Codex/, and I significantly preferred it to the final art.)

*Disclaimer: I haven't played it in several months and I haven't finished it.
