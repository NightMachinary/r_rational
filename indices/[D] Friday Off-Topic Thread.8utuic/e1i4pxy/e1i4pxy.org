I picked up Opus Magnum of the Steam summer sale. It's been a while since I've played a Zachtronics game, and I had mostly forgotten that feeling of "here are mechanics, here's what you need to produce, if you're so smart, then you figure it out". Starting up each level gives me a feeling of disbelief, because the problem always seems so big, but it's really just a matter of breaking the system down into component parts, solving each part one by one, than getting it to run together. It really scratches the same itch that programming used to scratch for me, only more so.

I also really appreciate all the work that went into the story and aesthetics of Opus Magnum, which really didn't need to be there given that it's a puzzle game. Like in Shenzen I/O, I think it adds an extra level of investment and progression.

Factorio was much the same sort of game for me, but I burnt myself out on it after finishing it, then finishing it with Bob's Mods, then doing Bob's + Angel's.
