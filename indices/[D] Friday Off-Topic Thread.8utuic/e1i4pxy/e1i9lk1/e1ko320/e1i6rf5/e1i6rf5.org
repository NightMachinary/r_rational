I have been playing Sundered myself this week after going months cold turkey without any gaming. It started when I saw a feed saying it had a new update and decided to give it a go - I found myself three days later hitting the end game content.

It has got to be one of the more satisfying metroidvanias I have played. I adore the lovecraftian aesthetic. Great skill progression too.
