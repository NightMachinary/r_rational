I really liked how the gameplay didn't undermine the story.

The tutorial didn't fall into the "As you know, captain..." trap:

#+begin_quote
  "Herr Einstein! We're so grateful to have a genius of your level here.

  Now... I'm sure you remember 'addition', yes?

  Well let me remind you, just in case..."
#+end_quote

The tutorial made sense, and characterised the protagonist effectively.

The main character is more focussed on the alchemy than the automation, so good or bad solutions are equally in character.
