That was why I never finished TIS-100; it was very pure in its programming. For the others, it's mostly about getting the thrill of programming without any of the garbage that goes along with actual programming. I don't have to deal with incompatible libraries, functions that don't work like they're documented to, hidden assumptions of either the language or the code I'm working with, etc.

I guess if I had to make a comparison, it would be "romance novel:romance::programming game:programming"?
