  Sleator's House of Stairs
#+end_quote

OH MY....I've read that book in middle school! It was from a shelf of 1970-1990s books which were all clearly published before I was born. It was a great story about the confusion and search for answers in a maze of stairs.

It turned out that the mysterious machine in the center of the house of stair was being used to train the kids in a Pavlovian way to automatically carry out certain physical actions and listen to the wielder of the red light. It was very creepy where the kids were learning a very specific dance which seemed to have no purpose. It turned out that they were the prototype group and learning the dance was just to demonstrate the complexity of what they could learn.

The novel ended on a sadistically hilarious plot twist where after the survivors were released, they were stuck repeating the same dance after seeing the red light of a traffic light!
