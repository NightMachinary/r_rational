Interesting ,the watching something that becomes another dream thing also happens to me often , though usually the other way around , me noticing something that doesnt make sense (or that I decide in the dream that doesnt make sense for whatever reason ) and the dream changing to me complaining about it while watching a movie or something that was the previous dream (or just "waking up " into another dream ).
