Just finished reading /Beautiful Fighting Girl/ by Saito Tamaki. It's an interesting (if somewhat unfocused, and with some Freudian/Lacanian psychoanalysis) book about 2000s otaku and the popular success of beautiful fighting girls in manga and anime. Saito sees the otaku's way of consuming media as an adaptive strategy in a hypermediated world, where they are ahead of the game.

He also states that their defining trait is the ability to achieve sexual release from a drawn image, and this is why real society must reject them, because they do not privilege reality over fiction. So there's that.
