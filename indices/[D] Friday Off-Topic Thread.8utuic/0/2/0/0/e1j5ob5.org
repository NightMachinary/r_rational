I haven't had the chance to play Hollow knight yet.. but I'd say compared to Ori it was definitely more flexible in terms of gameplay - once you get around to powering up your character through exploration. I am so in love with my new teleporting ability. Instead of puzzles the focus is more on cutting your way through relentless mobs. It keeps you on edge - but it was really satisfying getting to the powerups and watching your gameplay change.

Both are artworks with beautiful design. Sundered is handrawn with 3 different regions - an abandoned military base sprawling with automatic defenses, a lovecraftian dimension with hordes of tentacled horrors - and a vertical level the Citadal. The monster designs were also really refreshing on the later levels.

A good game with focus on platforming and puzzles would be Inside. It is by the creators of Limbo. I.. love everything about it. The breathtaking dystopian world building, every single scene animated with loving care. I was blown away by the sheer amount of attention to even simple things like jumping and running.  It drew me into the world as I rooted for this young boy facing insurmountable odds -  as he jumps out of a ledge gasping, on the run by security dogs. Stalked by discarded test subjects as he swims through submerged office buildings.. 

And the ending - it  completely blew me away. I did not see that coming at all. I did ended up wishing it that it didn't finish so soon. Compared to difficulty, was much easier than limbo while the puzzles being still creative. It did not have the same  frustrating feel as Limbo, with its relentless death traps. Very smooth gameplay.
