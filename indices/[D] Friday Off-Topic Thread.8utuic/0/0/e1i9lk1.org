  It really scratches the same itch that programming used to scratch for me, only more so.

I've played a couple "programming games", they usually feel too much like work for me to have fun. As soon as the work I need to do to beat a level gets past being trivial, I start feeling I might as well do some actual programming and get something useful out of it. I do like the ones with short levels that are far more about the puzzle aspect though, as opposed to having to sort 9000 different items which ends up being mostly busywork.
