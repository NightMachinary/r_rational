I tried doing a quest once (under pseudonym). It wasn't really to my liking, as I'd thought that it might not be, but part of that was that I was writing for an audience of like three people. I abandoned it pretty quickly, before those three people could get super invested in this thing I wasn't having too much fun with, and didn't have the time for. I generally consider it an artform not that suited to my particular tastes as both an author and a reader, mostly because I care more than average about narrative flow. Quests, even more than web serials, will sometimes just randomly introduce a character and then just never resolve it because the plot gets directed in another direction.

(The pros of a quest are basically that you get higher investment in the characters, because you're controlling their actions, and there's a more 'real' risk of failure which can heighten tension, especially if you're one of those people who wrongly believes that authors won't kill their characters.)
