Nah, it's cool. I know what it's like to ramble when you're sleep deprived.

I've been thinking a lot about writing a quest where the players are stuck with an unnaturally realistic dream of a maze. The maze is a city where the streets loop on themselves and there's no clear way to get around. It's going to be really fun writing it.

Here's the summary of the story:

/You walk down the sidewalk of an abandoned city. Implicitly you understand that time is running out, anxiety blooms in you chest as you look about frantically for what's coming. In an instant a white screen of light surrounds your vision. Sound disappears from the world except for a ringing in you ears. All sensations including touch vanish from your body, you feel as if you're floating in a void of light. When it finally ends, your vision slowly returns and with a burning sensation runs across your skin. The air is tinged a deep red, clouds running across the sky faster than you've ever seen. The city is melting, glass seeping into pools on the street as building deform and twist from the heat. Your skin too, is sloughing off in great chunks even as you scream your throat dry. The last thing you'll feel are your eyeballs dripping./

/Time is of the essence. You need to make use of what little time you have at the beginning of the dream to escape before it occurs. Car doors are rusted shut, bicycles are beyond repair, the roads go in circles and the layout is nonsensical. Through trial and error you might discover a method to escape beyond its boundaries. You have an unknown number worth of attempts before the nightmare becomes real, and there won't be any escape then./

I really wish I could take the credit for this masterfully written piece of purple prose, but it is a writing prompt posted somewhere months ago that inspired my maze-related ideas.
