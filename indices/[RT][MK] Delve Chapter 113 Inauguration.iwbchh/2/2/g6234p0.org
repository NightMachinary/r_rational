Eh. There are virtually no stories that get posted in this sub that wouldn't benefit from an editor, or could be cut down in length quite a bit without losing much. I find this one fairly charming in a kind of quirky way. The author just feels genuinely excited about his world building, set pieces and occasional navel gazing, and the system is genuinely well done litRPG bait.

Is Rain cringey? Oh yeah, he sure is. But I read this in the same way I'd play a walking simulator... I don't think it's meant to be exciting, it's just engaging, laid back isekae comfort food.
