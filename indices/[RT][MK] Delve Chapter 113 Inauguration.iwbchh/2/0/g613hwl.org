It reminds me of what Will Wight said about his writing process for Cradle, where he cuts as much fat and chaff off as possible and only leaves the essential information. And with all the worldbuilding you see him provide in his comments(as seen on AbidanArchive), he could add so much more to each volume.

On the other hand, I feel Delve has way too much unnecessary and frankly boring information in. The pace is dragged down because every single detail is expounded upon. Was that chapter on Kettel necessary? We already knew he was a weak ordinary fire mage and an idiot and that his party was irrelevant to the story. For this chapter, half of it focused on the tank-thing, but I don't think it needed that much detail. Same when covering every single aspect of preparing to travel, or the 4+ chapters of him training in a cave, or every other time a long chapter only covers one semi-important event.

I think if Delve cut down on all these unnecessary details and insignificant conversations with insignificant and boring characters, we'd be a lot further along and have something of substance. I'll be frank, every chapter it feels like nothing important happens. In Cradle only the necessary details are included to continue the story, while I feel like Delve constantly retreads the same topics every chapter. I don't want to be mean, but I was initially excited to read this new chapter and almost fell asleep at the end.
