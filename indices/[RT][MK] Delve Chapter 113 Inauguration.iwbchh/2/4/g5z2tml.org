The entire first half about the wagon was so fucking boring and useless.

At least the second half dipped a toe back into the System. We haven't interacted with the System in dozens of chapters. Everything else about the story (characters, dialogue, prose, plot) is so dull and flat and uninspired. Or filled with cringey memes.

But I really enjoy the System the author created so I'll stick with the story
