There is no way that is going to happen. Rain is the third highest levelled member of Ascension and with Tallheart being a crafter that would be expecting Amelia to Deus ex machina power boost Rain. No the only blue we can expect to see for the next two arcs, (Getting the team to work together while crossing the zone, saving the town) will be a low level one maybe up to level 10 that will probably be used to awaken some of the new people and maybe allow one or two of the awakened to increase their cap.

Even after that when they start hunting lairs there is no way they will go straight for a 25. First they will need to try for a blue in the mid teens to get a party together that is about the same level as Rain. I suppose in theory this could end up being 19 to 20 if they get a much harder blue than they expect though if it is I would hope for some consequences.

After they get a team of mid teens then they can go for something 20 - 24 which will give Rain a chance to level. Only then when they have a party of 20+ characters would I expect any reasonable chance of them hunting a blue that will let Rain reach Silver.
