You're right. It was an exaggeration, but only slightly.

For dozens of chapters, Rain's character sheet has been exactly the same with slightly higher numbers. It's been 80-90% character interaction and dialogue with characters that are, frankly, not interesting and mostly forgettable, and dialogue that is cringey and full of awful memes.

The System is awesome though. Hopefully we eventually get back to it.
