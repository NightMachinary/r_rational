This isn't /technically/ true. We got paling stuff / soul damage, synchronization (IIRC), pets, a few new monsters including crystal slimes, glimpses at various high-tier skills including metamagic, rank shift, linksight, the Majistraal artifact, and various soul-program thingies. Though yeah, it was all qualitative and we couldn't do e.g. build analysis and hypotheticals.
