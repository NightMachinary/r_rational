A few chapters ago when the author went on holiday, I finally broke and checked what was on yiff party. Not much, it turns out. I still decided that's how I'll consume Delve from now on, in blocks every two or three months. Otherwise the pace is... trying.

Which, to be fair, isn't much different from the other two dozen stories I'm keeping tabs open for. It'll be fine once it's complete, but it gives Palus Somni a run for it's money in terms of plot pace per month.
