Disagree. Occasionally (rarely thank goodness) parts of this story feel boring, useless and filler. Steampunk tank wagon wasn't one of them.

If the reality of the tank wasn't enough awesome for you, Tallheart's obvious delight matched with Rain's gushing fanboy squee was such a nice bookend to a long arc of tension, anxiety and responsibility. These guys have a relationship that goes a long way to keep the story out of boring litrpg meme territory and seeing them relax enough to express delight to each other is plenty rewarding.
