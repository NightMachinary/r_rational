One, it's a fantasy setting. Normal physics getting smacked upside the head and told to go home is a regular occurrence.

Two - The perspective character from the first chapter is equally baffled about what the heck is going on. I suspect that the main reason it's referred to as a star is that it showed up at the same time a notable named star disappeared from the sky, and a magic spell to analyze light gave a result consistent with stellar emissions. Given those two facts I think it's perfectly logical to refer to the object (whatever it is) as a star until he has the time to gather more information and try to come up with a more accurate noun (assuming one is even needed).
