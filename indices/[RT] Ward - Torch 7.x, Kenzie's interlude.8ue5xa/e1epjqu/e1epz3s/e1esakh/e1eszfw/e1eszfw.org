Ward is popular or well known enough over here that it doesn't need signal boosting to be honest. Neither does aPGtE and that gets every chapter linked. There's plenty of discussion to be had about rational elements in Ward's chapters even if, and I'm not saying it isn't rational, not all of Ward is considered rational fiction.
