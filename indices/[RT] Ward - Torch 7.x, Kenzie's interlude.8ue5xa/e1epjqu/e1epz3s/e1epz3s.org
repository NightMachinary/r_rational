Although excellent writing, and although I love both /Ward/ and [[/r/rational]], I can't see this anything but shallow signal-boosting that has no place in this subreddit.

Edit: to me, putting Ward in [[/r/rational]] is a common case of not all “good fiction is rational fiction,” that's all. It's very good, but it is not the something like /Twig/ or /A Practical Guide To Evil/.
