Ward has been sparse on clues, but it features a thoughtful protagonist examining a posited but unspecified negative codependency somewhere within the social network of a small group of troubled children. Wildbow is still adjusting the balance between action to defuse the codependence and the protagonist's anxious speculation over the possibility.

I suspect that the finished work will qualify for the sub, even if the serialized version is a bit of a reach.
