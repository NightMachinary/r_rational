It's a contentious issue. See [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1ryg4s/worm/][here]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/34e51q/q_what_do_you_dislike_about_worm/][here]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3q4uod/d_mr_yudkowsky_on_the_lack_of_munchkinism_in_worm/][here]], and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3o2czl/qso_im_finally_getting_around_to_reading_worm/][here]], for a start. Also, note that [[/r/parahumans]] is linked as a related community, not an endorsement for or against Worm (or Ward) as "rational fiction". (I'd argue strongly for that subreddit as a related community, while also arguing weakly against the works as being within the genre, but I don't want to rehash those arguments again.)
