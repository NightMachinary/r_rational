This is why I'm curious to see how our new definition of rationalism will look like. I just spent a little time looking through several posts, and many of the arguments people make can be rationalized by the opposing party and so on.

It creates such a diverse discussion because people's definition of rationalism seems to be highly subjective (excluding a few points, such as being evil for the sake of evil, for example).

I worry that our rebranding will be a result of the louder people trying to limit what is, in my opinion, a subjective discussion that /can't/ be nailed down to a science.
