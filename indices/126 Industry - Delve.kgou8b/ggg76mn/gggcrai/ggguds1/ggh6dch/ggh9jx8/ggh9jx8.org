Putting together the info from the passage set in the city of lights (chapter 82) and the val perspective stuff talking about unlocking his father's class, the light/illusion aspect of his power set etc (think after rain saves him in the sewer dungeon some of this was revealed) it seemed obvious to me that this was what was being foreshadowed the whole time. I would have to go back and reread stuff i first read months ago to properly cite the connections/inferences, but will leave that up to someone with more energy. Imo there is no other mysterious in-universe class or power set which has been revealed so far that fits val anywhere near this well. I disagree with the assertion made by the original comment i replied to, i think the world building IS there, it's just slow to be revealed/connected. Val gaining/having the powerset which enables the city of lights to function and exist within a ranked area would be very useful for the current cast of characters in their current location (in an area suffering the effects of a rank shift)
