Wow, that's an awesome comment! I agree with most of what you've said, but I still think there's a distinction between lightbringer's class and the illuminates of X-whateverthefuck. It might be as simple as his class is literally called Lightbringer. That could be kinda cool, IMO. The fact that we don't know definitively what his class is yet is kinda lame.
