His lvl 25 build will deal more damage per second than full low-level party per day. So unless there will be a time-skip its likely he will spend a long time babysitting relatively useless parties until a big part of his company is in silver. I hope +when+ if he levels, this process will be mostly off-screen.

Its also possible SenescentSoul will pull numbers out of his ass and his builds exponential scaling will turn out to be standard silver numbers, but I doubt its where this is going.
