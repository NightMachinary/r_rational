  Everything Rain has done was in part because he was lucky enough to make friends with people who'd help him out with his inane, suicidal, and poorly implemented plans.

That, and every threat Rain has faced has, by slim margins, not been quite focused or quick enough to kill him. Either the monster is just barely killed by some one else's effort immediately before finishing Rain off, or someone just happens to come along and save him in the nick of time. It was fine for the first few encounters of the book. At this point, though? It just highlights how few interactions actually have any semblance of planning and preparation by Rain.
