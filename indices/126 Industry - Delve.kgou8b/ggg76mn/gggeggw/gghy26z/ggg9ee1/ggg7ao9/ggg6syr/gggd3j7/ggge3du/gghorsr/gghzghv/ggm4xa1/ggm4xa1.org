  I think the author thinks Rain is being punished sufficient for his mistakes, but overall it's not that believable.

I agree with this. There's a bit of a disconnect, because Rain is dealing with trauma and character growth from his mistakes. But it's not very meaningful to us because Rain doesn't lose out on any /resources/ which would make more of an impact, so it feels like Rain has too much plot armor.
