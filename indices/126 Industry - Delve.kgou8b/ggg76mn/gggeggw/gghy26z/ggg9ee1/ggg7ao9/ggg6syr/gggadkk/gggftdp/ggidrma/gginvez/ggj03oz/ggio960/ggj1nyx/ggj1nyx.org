Again, who cares what sneerclubbers think? This place isn't a family or community. Most people who come here never comment.

Someone spending their precious heartbeats defending a subreddit's honor, (or worse, advocating other people do) seems a lot worse, to me, than people on other forums having poor opinions about this one.

If you want to tilt at windmills to please internet randos, you're welcome to do so! But most people have better things to do, so I don't predict you'll find many (worthwhile) comrades in arms...
