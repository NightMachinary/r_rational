The fact that people exist and adventure and level up and kill blues without utility auras means that, in the end, they're useful nice-to-haves. Everyone's accustomed to /not/ dumping their entire mana pool, or missing out on stuff, or just dealing with gas attacks - like, literally, the city was built around people dealing with that lair without purify.

Rain doesn't actually have a build or a skill that allows him or his party to do anything /new/, they're just somewhat more effective at the stuff they could already do. In TTRPG terms, that's a bad support build - good supports should allow the party to do things they otherwise couldn't, instead of just being a quality of life thing.

Really, the only enabling "skill" Rain has is the fact that his massive clarity allowed him to remember enough about the details of IRL technology to allow the creation of a steam generator, and even that was an accident.
