  The fact that people exist and adventure and level up and kill blues without utility auras means that, in the end, they're useful nice-to-haves.

If your criticism of Rain's build is that ultimately it just makes them more effective at stuff they can already do, then its quite simply a bad criticism. A build that multiplies a parties effectiveness at what they already do is a great build.

Heck, your criticism would apply to a typical RPG healer build. A pure healer doesn't let the party do anything new, but it is a must have for any good party.
