Yeah, I did; I didn't like it. Things actually happened, sure, but the primary narrative driving force was the main character's inability to plan a response to a known antagonist and the only reason it wasn't the end of the story was pure luck. Luck is not a particularly compelling hook to hang a story on this late in the plot.
