So, I paid the patreon cost to read the advanced chapters, and... nothing worthwhile happens. I've been enjoying this story and defending it, even during the borings parts, but somehow it's really rubbing me wrong at this point. It has a lot of potential and I like the world building, but the mediocre writing and lack of compelling main character is just reaching a critical point for me. I think I might be done with it.
