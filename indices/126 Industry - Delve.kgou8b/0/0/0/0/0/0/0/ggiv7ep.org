While that may discount 'illuminator', the rumored 'light mage' mentioned in the same passage is a better fit and more likely to refer to Val imo. He also struggled to solo that blue to the point where he nearly died.. Maybe the only difference between the unlocks for those two classes is whether you get help for your blue?
