Val definitely does NOT have that class. The illuminators that allow the City of Light to function are a crafting class, its mentioned in that POV that they need help killing blues and are therefore usually sponsored by the city/nobility. Val is going for his father's class, and the Lightbringer is a terrifyingly power individual fighter. Val had to solo a blue to unlock his class, that is in direct contrast to a crafter who needs a sponsor to help kill blues.
