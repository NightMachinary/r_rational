I will grant you that Rain should have looked more at the seasonal and imperial auras before some of his metamagic and a second attack aura. (And he should have gone for Darkness if he did take two combat auras because there's no mageburn from that).

That said you're significantly underestimating his party utility, because support skills matter outside of combat too. Rain's overcharged Winter comboed with essence well is not just a "nice to have", but completely frees a mage from having to conserve mana. It allows them to unload their strongest spells every fight, it's a huge advantage to a party.

Detection can foil ambushes (I believe the essence monster Val killed to unlock his class was foiled in this way). Which is a very useful support skill to have. Purify is also a counter to poison or gas attacks, more situational than the others, but a viable support skill that saved a life in the swamp lair they visited.
