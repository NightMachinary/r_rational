Yeah, this is a big part of it. Too many close calls with death with no actual meaningful cost coming of it just makes it seem like bad writing after a while. I think it's also that the author is writing in these close calls and cliffhangers to try and increase the stakes, but that again is just a tool of mediocre writing.
