Yup, this is the main issue, exacerbated because the story keeps trying to tell us that Rain is smart. At this point, he just seems arrogant and delusional, while somehow skating by through luck.

I think the author /thinks/ Rain is being punished sufficient for his mistakes, but overall it's not that believable. The expected outcome at this point should be Rain dying. There's just been way too many close calls that resolved only due to plot armor and luck.
