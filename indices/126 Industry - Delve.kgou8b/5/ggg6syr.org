I don't see why everyone is complaining about Delve so much. The pacing slowed down, sure, it's slightly fillery, sure, the prose is mediocre, sure, but it was really only terrible around 115-123. The writing of the romance is fucking atrocious; that is definitely the worst thing. Rain being quirky is kind of annoying, but I don't find him to be out of character; he basically has severely magic-induced ADD due to having Clarity much higher than Focus.

It doesn't bother me that Rain hasn't leveled in a while: it makes sense that the resource that bottlenecks the entire setting also bottlenecks the protagonist. They're going to recruit a few more high level people in Ascension later, go caving, then level. It might take 20 chapters but that is reasonable considering the in-universe difficulty of the task. I think the problem people are having is the lack of feeling of progression; SenescentSoul could probably fix it by focusing less on slice of life writing and more on the other ways Rain is progressing: growing Ascension, travelling, building up resistance to soulstrain from his ring, doing technology, etc. But yeah, if you want to desub from his patreon, you probably should. 5k words per week way too little considering his current profit.
