The thing he's using isn't democracy; it's collective pirate government. This is something the previous threads have mentioned. Rain's system is actually smart (especially the DKP system based on videogame raids) but his calling it "democracy" is misleading and makes him seem stupid.

The problem isn't that the romance is awkward. It's supposed to be awkward, due to Rain's brain damage and social awkwardness as well as Amelia's commitment problems. It's just BADLY awkward; Amelia's thoughts are told instead of shown and the whole thing feels very trite. Amelia and Rain are both fairly competent characters; at this point, one of them could have just said, "Hey, the level difference and consequent power different is difficult, and we might die soon. Wanna date though?" and then we could watch them deal with INTERESTING RELATIONSHIP PROBLEMS instead of shitty pre-relationship problems.

I find this sort of dynamic very unrealistic; in my experience, romantic relationships are one of the easier domains in which to apply rationaly to change my own decision making in real life. However, this may different for other people who may easily use rationality on themselves to do chores (with which I struggle) but struggle to do it to overcome interpersonal fear, embarrassment, and status anxiety. YMMV.
