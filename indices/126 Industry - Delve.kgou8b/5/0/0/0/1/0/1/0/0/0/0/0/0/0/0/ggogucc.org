I mean for now even as numbers-munchkining go his build is meh. Yes he can charge 50k mana stone, but all this regen is still useless in battle. Eventually it will be high enough to go 'Endless' but for now he has 190 useless stats multiplied by useless rare class.

Should he went animus, he would not have leveled 3 times a day 100 chapters ago, but at this point he would have being multiple times stronger in fight. And with ring and winter his regen would still be ridiculous.
