My point is that he /doesn't/ multiply a party's effectiveness - his utility amounts to a quality of life improvement, not a combat multiplier.

Typical RPG healers do that as a /bare minimum/, while also unlocking more options - druids can talk to animals, clerics can hard-counter a specific set of nasties, both of them can also off-tank and cast situational save-or-die spells.

Rain, without Tallheart's equipment, can maybe tank one blow with force ward, or minorly inconvenience an enemy with velocity. Or, again, /kill himself and everyone around him/. Those are his options.
