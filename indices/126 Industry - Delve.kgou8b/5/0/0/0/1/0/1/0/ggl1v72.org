A) deciding to go for a support build without understanding the local culture is ill-advised. Worst case, you're in a "I don't have to outrun the bear, I just have to outrun the healer" area. Turns out, that's where Rain is.

B) Rain's build /isn't actually a support build/. Rain has, like, /one/ universally combat effective support aura (force ward), one debuff / buff if you've trained for it (velocity), and a probably not combat effective mana regen (essence well).

The rest of Rain's skills are either out of combat nice to haves, metamagic wankery or DPS skills that will literally kill him and everyone around him if he's not careful.
