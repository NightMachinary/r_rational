Character POVs work well when they show a different aspect of the world, tell an interesting character arc that adds to the world or story, or is another viewpoint on progressing a certain plot in the story, which Worm excels in, with even interludes from Brutus, Sophia, and Blasto being interesting and meaningful, much less the plot-important ones like with Kevin Norton or Chevalier.

The problem with Delve is that these perspective changes are damn pointless. Like, half of them are from random tag-alongs in Rain's company and none of them are memorable or interesting or even unique, much less add anything meaningful through their perspective. Did we get anything meaningful through that Samson or whatever guy's POV? Or from that archer dude? Even Kettel's POV was meaningless, all it told us was another group of idiots being idiotic. Even the fucking dog interlude from Worm was more interesting, informative, and important than any of the Delve POVs we've seen.

Delve, more than any other web novel, confuses me with its pace. And I've read some reaalll shitty Chinese web novels. In this chapter alone we spent a page or so detailing the pointless monsters Rain's hunting, and there's countless more examples throughout the story. It drags on and on with a lot of trivial and pointless details and on uninteresting characters. I generally like fluff and more lore and knowledge on things, but Delve even fails on that front by expounding on completely minor and boring things like all the minutiae of getting supplies, and then talking about the intricacies of said supplies.

Thoroughly disappointing. But you know I'll be back next week.
