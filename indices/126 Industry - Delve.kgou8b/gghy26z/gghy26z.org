I'm not among the people that begrudges the pace of /words/, I think it can be really hard to keep a serial going strong. But there are definitely ways to shore up the problem of it seeming slow without actually writing a lot more.

I think the biggest issue is the constant perspective swaps. Ever since GoT on HBO, this has become really popular in all media, but it slows progression to a crawl and makes it harder to really get going. If you mix it with a serial pace, you get these munchkin 1000 word segments that leave you wanting more even if you get a couple of them at once. IMO you shouldn't be switching perspective if you don't plan to stay put for at least 10k words, but maybe I'm crazy.
