I went through a whole series of depressive episodes like that where I found every reason I could to despair about the state of my life and the world. You hit the nail on the head with feeling "humanity's collective suffering". This whole thing has been me wondering how connected I should be to that when it hurts so much but was such a key factor in how my views on morality and politics have changed.

I do find it reassuring to think that just showing compassion towards other people means there is more compassion in the world. It's certainly a worldview I've admired in others, but have always felt like I fell short of it due to the prejudices I couldn't root out of myself. Maybe now that I finally have peace of mind again I can start working towards that. Thanks a lot, this really helped.
