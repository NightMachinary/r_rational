  So does that mean I should do it out of a sense of obligation towards my "religion" because it will mean I will have made a net positive decision?

Sure, why not. Encouraging yourself and others to engage in prosocial behaviors is what religion is for. If you can do it without compromising your epistemic rationality, even better.

  If I accepted that about myself, it means I accomplish an objectively good thing without improving myself

You are stuck in a weird paradox because you think charity is supposed to be about improving /yourself/. The whole point of charity is that it benefits other people and does not necessarily give you any benefit. Sometimes it gives benefits like reputation, fuzzy feelings or strengthening your own empathy, but that is supposed to be a side effect. Most people you help won't care about how much empathy you have and how virtuous you are.
