That's kind of the problem, though. I actually don't want to donate any money because having it makes me feel more safe and secure. The prospect of giving it away, rather than making a transaction or supporting a someone on Patreon who makes things I like, makes me feel anxious. This is a way I have always felt about money even before my financial security was a risk.

At the same time, that self-centered view is preventing me from doing something that would be objectively good and would not cost me a significant amount. So does that mean I should do it out of a sense of obligation towards my "religion" because it will mean I will have made a net positive decision?

I want to want to help people, but I find it easier to not feel empathy for the disadvantaged now that I am not at risk of suffering in a similar way. The idea that I would only do it because of selfish reasons, either out of a sense of social shame from not doing it or out of a sense of pride at having done it, is not a prospect my morality finds comforting.

If I did it as a signal to myself or others, that would imply that I can't or won't do it out of empathy for people who lack the privileges I possess. If I accepted that about myself, it means I accomplish an objectively good thing without improving myself. If I do not accept that, it means I am prioritizing my desire to be more virtuous over the well-being of others.
