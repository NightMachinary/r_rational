*So TL;DR, I offer a re-interpretation of the golden rule: “Where possible, act as though your life followed the rules of your ideal society. Slowly, over time, this will build the society you're picturing.”*

Oof, you just described my struggles with my first depressive episode. I realized that I was coming out of that state because I noticed myself thinking hard about the same issues that I felt were characterizing my depression but without the all-consuming existential despair that I associated with them. The depression made these issues so very urgent for me because, through my (comparatively mild) suffering, I felt connected to humanity's collective suffering.

If you still believe that the status quo is a horrifically unjust equilibrium, then I hope we still agree that changing it is important. In my process, I have had to make peace with the fact that I don't have access to the entirety of the system, and I can't change what I don't have access to. At the same time, however, I have started to think of how to subvert the system to make it behave more compassionately at every scale that I have access to.

For example, at an individual scale, I tidy up more often than before, and I clean even when it's not my personal responsibility. As I do this, I have to consciously remind myself that I can't actually change people's opinions on this, but that by simply cleaning up more often, people will notice that it's nice to live in a cleaner world and see that it's easier if we all help. I think social systems are self-replicating, and that each system's rules imprint on and pervade every individual and action in that system. Consciously acting in ways that subvert the negative rules and outcomes of our current social systems is, for me, a way of slowly building systems in which the rules are compassionate, rather than punitive; generous, rather than greedy. I think all of this sounds obvious in hindsight, but I also think that this framing has been more helpful to me than any other discussion about personal and social change I've heard.

I guess what I can say is: give if you can and feel comfortable; focus on what you can do; and think in terms of your relationships to other people and how they shape and are shaped by our current societal structure.
