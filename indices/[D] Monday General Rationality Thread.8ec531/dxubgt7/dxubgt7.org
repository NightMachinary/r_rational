I've been feeling pretty good lately, to the point where I've noticed how little I'm thinking about things that caused me so much anxiety and depression. Part of me is concerned about that, though, because I had rationalized my self-loathing with self-awareness of how privileged I am as a middle-class white person.

When I was afraid of becoming impoverished I started to feel empathy towards people who live in poverty that I had never thought about before, which meant the pain I felt was nothing compared to what so many others had gone through and my utilitarian self-righteousness compelled me to think about that pain all the time.

I was on the verge of becoming a Marxist because I saw all the ways the system causes suffering and all the ways I had enabled it without realizing. However, now that I have regained the privilege of financial security, I find I no longer hate capitalism. I feel comfortable where I once felt ashamed and am not insecure about how that comfort in the status quo enables suffering.

I feel the same way about basically every political issue, I have the privilege to not need to care about being abused by the system and I prefer not caring because caring was painful. I still support causes that reduce suffering, but now I feel like I do it more out of group loyalty than empathy. I don't think this is the way my morals should work if I want to be virtuous.

I'm thinking the way I did when I was younger, where everyone can get along just be deciding to be nice, which I had concluded was naive. Nothing has changed my mind about how culture has instilled prejudices and biases that enable discrimination and abuse, even among those with privilege who think they're helping because they don't really understand the disadvantaged.

The status quo is still a horrifically unjust state of affairs where suffering happens all the time and I believe everyone is culpable for allowing that to occur, but I'm not very concerned about it. I'm happy in my corner of the world and don't want to jeopardize that by worrying about systemic injustice. Feeling constant anxiety isn't healthy or virtuous, but shouldn't I want to help more than I do?
