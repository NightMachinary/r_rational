It's an open source project that uses machine learning similar to Google's Alpha Zero project. It's going much slower since even with many volunteers donating their computing power they have a fraction of the processing Google has, but it still has seen remarkable progress. In less than a year I believe it's gone from knowing nothing except the rules to beating human grand masters. It is still significantly worse than the best chess engines like Stockfish and presumably Alpha Zero however.
