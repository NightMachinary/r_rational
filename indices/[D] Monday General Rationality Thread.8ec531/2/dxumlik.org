The Chess engine Leela played against GM Andrew Tang in a series of bullet and ultrabullet games, with time controls of two 15+2 games(fifteen minutes a side plus two seconds every turn), four 5+2 games, eight 1+0 games, ending with a "freeplay" phase where Andrew was free to choose any time control he wanted. this week end. Tang won once, drew 6 times, and lost 41 times. Take into account that the way Leela plays as a engine that uses machine learning is something that people have not trained themselves to defeat and it is likely that as her weaknesses are further discovered skilled chess players could manage to exploit them.

The one win was in the time control fifteen seconds to each side.
