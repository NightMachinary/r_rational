I am not sure if it is exactly rational but it is fairly reasonable. The Way of Choices/Ze Tian Ji has characters with actual motivations for what they do. There are alliances, different factions with political maneuvering, and it has amazing world building. There are reasons for character successes and failures.

Power scaling is actually really well done imo. The overpowered people with top tier strength are established right away and always exist within the world so you always have them as a frame of reference. People of different power levels exist in the story at all times. It's not like once the main character reaches level 5, everyone is level 4-6. Then when the main character is level 7, everyone is level 6-10 like it is in most wuxia/xianxia.

Characters have histories from before the story started, there are established rivalries and alliances, but each individual has their own goals and dreams as well. It gives characters a lot of depth that 99.9% of wuxia/xianxia don't. It's a slow read at first as it sets up the world and gives the main character time to establish himself from a no name instead of just handing him OP powers from the get go. However, I highly recommend it.
