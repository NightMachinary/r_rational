Does anyone knows any LitRPG that explores how a ruleset would incentivize difference from classical fantasy? As much as I love WtC, the setting is intentionally disjointed from the level system.

Examples of things it could include:

1. I want a group of people who gather information about classes which the MC asks about classes before selecting their class.
2. A toddler being allowed to get the last hit on a bound monster, being told to invest in intelligence, and now having adult-like intelligence.
3. Psychotic serial killers being very high level and guards finding solutions to handle such high level individuals without relying on adventurers, either with ethical or less ethical means. Possibly guards being rewarded with the honor of killing a caught criminal for the XP.
4. Ways of getting XP being sold on the market.
