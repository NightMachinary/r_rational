1. What are you seeing as being consequences of everyone being at perfect health until they hit 0? It doesn't unintuitively strike me as having severe consequences even if it does seem wonky.
2. After more thinking I think that exploiting a world in which xp is given for kills probably is strawmanning the litrpg genre. I feel that the problem of xp in most litrpg is that xp is given out in a way that implies that there's a sentient intelligence that watches everyone all the time to prevent abuse.\\
   If XP were given out by 'challenges' or 'accomplishment', then you would get worse XP the better equiptment you had, and you would expect people to deliberately not use their powerful equiptment in some cases to get more XP.\\
   If equiptment didn't count in that equation though I could see a coloseum style XP grind in which people paid to borrow silly strong equiptment for the match, baring high requirements of said equiptment.\\
   I wonder. Can you think of any coherent 'usual' XP system for litrpg in which you wouldn't see the following XP for gold trade: the buyer being granted (temporary) ownership of a deadly trap to then use food to bait farm-monsters from a steel cage into the trap?

You mentioned degenerate a few times in this and the other post. What would you predict to be the degenerate conclusion?
