If you know Russian, stuff by [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMJNta-okRw][Complex Numbers.]] Though this particular song [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DynLBcmOTGs][has a French version too.]]

edit: Also some [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdbBM_ENnHk][songs]] from Soviet movies, from the space-race era.
