If the trope, [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld][Crapsack World]], is grimdark, then the trope, [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousseauWasRight][Rousseau Was Right]], must be its opposite aka [[https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Noblebright][noblebright]]. The trope basically assumes that everyone must be fundamentally good when they were born and are only misunderstood. Hence every villain can be redeemed or is an example of Good vs Good.

The rest of this comment is me meandering into the differences between grimdark and noblebright.

Just to clarify the difference between grimdark and noblebright, grimdark is about a world/setting which is horrible and miserable and the main characters can't or aren't doing anything to change things aka WH40K. While noblebright is about worlds/settings of wonder and amazement where the main characters are actually accomplishing things of importance aka Star Trek.

Someone might ask about nobledark where we have terrible worlds with characters achieving good things or grimbright where there are amazing worlds with no one able to do anything, but these sort of stories are rare. One example for nobledark is Bezerk the manga, since while things can get better, it demands everything the main characters can possibly give. The other example for grimbright is Sandman by Neil Gaiman where the world is amazing and incredible, but not even the main character who is basically a god to other gods can change anything worthwhile.
