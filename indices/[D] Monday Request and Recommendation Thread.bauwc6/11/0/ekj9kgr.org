Well, the obvious recommendation is [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Worm]], where PTSD comes with superpowers as a consolation prize. That's hardly "earning" it though, and you've likely already read it anyway.

It's not urban fantasy like Worm/Delphic, but [[http://alexanderwales.com/shadows/][Shadows of the Limelight]] is a world where the strength of magical powers is directly proportional to how famous you are; anyone can become Superman if they just become famous enough.

Those probably aren't very helpful recommendations. I started typing this initially because I read your question and felt like I knew a few you'd like, but I'm drawing blanks when trying to remember them. Hopefully someone more useful replies as well.
