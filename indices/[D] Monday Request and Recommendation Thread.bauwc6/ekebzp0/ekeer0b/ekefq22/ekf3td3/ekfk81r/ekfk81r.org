I remember a sci fi short story in one of those "year's best sci fi" books. Something about a sentient military K9 unit that is able to communicate through a paired implant. The dog was taken to a military parade, discovered and knocked a bomb into the water and a sentient dolphin carried it to sea. The dog and dolphin didn't communicate, but the dog thought the dolphin was arrogant. The dog remembered watching a documentary about the barbaric past where dogs were considered property. Eventually, the K9 handler was killed somewhere (in an implied act of treason) and the dog went rouge, defending the villages in the area his old handler was killed.
