I haven't read Worth the Candle before; I'll bookmark it for later. Also, sorry I've worded it wrong - English is not my first language. Thank you for correcting me though.

Also, I don't hate zero-to-hero as a plot device, but the way it's developed in most Japanese novels. A lot doesn't fulfil their objectives or just pure power fantasy. There's no zero; there's only a hero after a few chapters. Also, the authors spent so much time in midpoint - dungeon delving, food tour, and harem collecting - that I completely forgot the goal of the story.

Maybe the ones I've read are just bad.

I don't mind Konosuba as well. I like Grimgar too.
