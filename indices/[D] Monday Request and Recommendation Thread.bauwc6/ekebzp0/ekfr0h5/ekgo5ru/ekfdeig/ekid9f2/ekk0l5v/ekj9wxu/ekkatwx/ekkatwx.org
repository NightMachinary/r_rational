Andrew Sieple's Generica novels do this a bit - the Threadbare series is kind of an intro to the world and the system from the perspective of a toy golem, while the (still being written) Small Medium series is more of an examination of the cultures that spring up as a result of the system.

For example: halvens, the local halfling knockoff, eat a lot. Because halflings eat a lot, right?

No, it's actually because one of the only ways to gain Endurance is by levelling up your racial class. Endurance is the stat that controls stamina regeneration. And the "halven" racial class grants zero endurance per level. So to regain stamina at a reasonable rate, they need to eat a lot of food - because food provides a stamina regeneration buff.
