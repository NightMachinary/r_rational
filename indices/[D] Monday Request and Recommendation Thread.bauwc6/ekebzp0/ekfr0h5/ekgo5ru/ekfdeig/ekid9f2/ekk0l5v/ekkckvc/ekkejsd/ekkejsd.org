1) Classic RPG health is basically inconsequential until you've lost your last hitpoint. The reasons for this are pretty readily apparent, because otherwise it's a negative feedback loop, and those aren't fun (e.g. you get hit, you break or injure your leg, that makes you easier to hit, injuring you worse, making you easier to injure, etc.). But in terms of how it would work in an actual world, it's totally wonky; everyone is apparently in perfect health until they're unconscious/dead. You get all kinds of knock-on effects from it, most of which are just silly, not actually compelling on a society scale. (And there are a bunch of ways to modify it, some of which are used by actual games, but then you're running away from the premise a little bit. My preferred method is a division between HP/WP, with HP being something like a slowly regenerating shield, and WP being your physical health, but that's enough of a variant that it feels like a cheat.)

2) XP for kills leads to a bunch of "cheating" that most games will do their best to sand away, because a lvl 60 character killing things for a party of lvl 1 characters isn't usually that fun for anyone involved, it's just people following incentives in unfun ways that proper game design attempts to avoid. It's difficult for games to approximate "XP for challenges" or "XP for accomplishments" or "XP for fun", but that's what they strive for in various ways. There are, again, a lot of ways to tweak this, but you get further away from the premise of following MMORPG rules. You /could/ set up a broken world where everyone hits MAX lvl within a few days, but if you're going to do that, it's nearly equal to just removing the leveling system entirely, except as an exercise in worldbuilding wankery.

3) Discrete attributes /mostly/ work, or are at least sensible most of the time, even if they're in defiance of how humans actually work and the nature of physics, but the degenerate case is that the rich get richer, which seems like from a narrative standpoint lends itself to a story about oligarchies, which ... okay, sure, that would be fine, but doesn't actually interest me that much.

I don't know, it would be easy to just take things to their degenerate conclusion, but the risk is that I end up with a world that I don't particularly feel like writing about, or one that isn't actually that interesting, or which isn't actually saying anything about anything, and instead is just an exercise in running simulations in my head.
