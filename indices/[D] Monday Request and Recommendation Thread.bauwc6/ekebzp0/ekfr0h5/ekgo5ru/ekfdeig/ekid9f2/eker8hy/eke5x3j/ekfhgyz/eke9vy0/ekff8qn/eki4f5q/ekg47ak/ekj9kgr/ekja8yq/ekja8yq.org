Thanks for the Shadow of the Limelight recs. I'll give it a try later tonight.

Yes, I have read worm. Sort of. I don't think it gives me the value I seek. Once I reached Slaughter House Nine I started skimming it. That arc just put me in distress without any reward afterward. I finished it too and conclude it a waste of time: Taylor did not end up better than what she had starting out. All those suffering is for naught.

Eh, I'm rambling. Anyway, I hope my rambling illustrate better that I dislike being put into stress without reward.

Edit: I tried Shadows of the Limelight. I don't have problem with non-urban setting. Setting won't matter much, as long as it done well. That said, the fic doesn't exactly fit my request. The power is still mysterious thing that got granted to certain individual. Still like a lottery for me. I like it when everyone can have a shot at being powerful. Also, the writing quality is not quite nice. Expositions are pretty forced early on.
