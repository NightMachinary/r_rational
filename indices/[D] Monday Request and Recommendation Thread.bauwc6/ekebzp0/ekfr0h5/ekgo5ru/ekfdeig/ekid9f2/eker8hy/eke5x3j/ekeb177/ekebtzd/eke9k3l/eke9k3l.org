[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/purple-days-asoiaf-joffrey-timeloop-au.450894/][Purple Days]] is the only good fanfic I know of. It features Joffrey in a time loop gradually growing as a person. There's a few instances of the idiot ball but overall the story are rather good and at least arguably rational. It uses music to enhance some of the scenes and I've had tears in my eyes on a few occations.
