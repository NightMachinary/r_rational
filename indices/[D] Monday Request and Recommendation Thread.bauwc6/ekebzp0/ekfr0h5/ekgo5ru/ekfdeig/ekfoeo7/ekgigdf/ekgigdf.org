I think of Worm as being the go-to example of grimdark rational fiction. While only rational-adjacent, The Gods Are Bastards is my go-to polar opposite. Hardly anyone dies, the characters grow and develop over time into better people, and the world building is great. It's long and not everyone's cup of tea, but 15 books in I still check for weekly updates.
