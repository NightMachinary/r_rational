After having dissed it here, I feel obliged to mention that, after three remarkably miserable episodes, episode 4 of season 2 of /The Dragon Prince/ is really good for no discernible reason, and episode 5 is pretty alright as well. If it's able to keep up the quality of episode 4 for the rest of its run, then it'll be a really good show, though not quite measuring up to /Avatar/, which is a damn high bar.
