Thanks for that. If I wanted to stop the clone wars, and stop palpy's rise to power I would probably create a Droid rebellion among the CIS armies, then offer to surrender to the republic on the condition that droids are recognized as people. The republic would tear itself apart if one played the PR game well enough.
