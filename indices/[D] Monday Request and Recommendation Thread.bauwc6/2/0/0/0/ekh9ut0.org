Ah, like how you can tell the author didn't even bother with the slow grind of powering up. I feel like this is a problem that rational fiction solves. In normal isekai the author is throwing someone who has probably read lots of fantasy stories into a fantasy world; this world meets their expectations, thus the character isn't challenged. But the whole point of isekai is the fish-out-of-water scenario, so a rational story would have some kind of element that subverts expectations. (Probably by making the rest of the characters as knowledgeable about the fantasy world as the protagonist - or more! Imagine trying to tell someone from the 1700's how your career works. That is the kind of culture-shock the average salaryman should feel at being dropped into a fantasy world.)

Unfortunately I don't know many stories like that.
