Thanks for this rec - I found the central conceit of a SI through others' eyes super interesting!

This reminds me of a similar Naruto SI through others' eyes (of a young girl born of one of Jiraiya's conquests who's evident as a SI but seen through the eyes of her mom/other characters) - it was likewise quite interesting, but for the life of me I can't find it T_T
