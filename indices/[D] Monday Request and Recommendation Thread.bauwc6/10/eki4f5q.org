I'm getting through the "Drifters" manga and would reccomend it. (So far; I'm 33 chapters in.) If I told you it was a mass isekai into a generic fantasy world I would be technically correct, except the people getting isekai'd are historical personalities like Scipio Africana, Oda Nobunaga, Hitler, and [[#s][]]. Even better, the conflict is between the isekai'd people, with them serving as ethically grey antagonists and protagonists. (I'd say "heroes" and "villains", but that would technically make Hitler a hero, so those descriptions don't map onto the story well.)
