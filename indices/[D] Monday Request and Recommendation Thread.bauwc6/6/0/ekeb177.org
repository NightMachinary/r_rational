Copy Pasta of a rec I gave a while ago.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11861559/1/Wearing-Robert-s-Crown][Wearing Robert's Crown]]* - ASOIAF SI, who SI's into Robert Baratheon's brain at some point during his rebellion, with a mixture of memories and personality. Truly unique thing of this one is that the PoV never enters Robert's head, it is always from the people around him, so if it wasn't for the reader recognizing the clear evidence of both Earth knowledge and foreknowledge of canon, you'd never know this was a SI. It's honestly a great approach, Robert is genuinely clever in how he maneuvers. He has funded tech development into directions he knows are important, introduced various improvements anonymously through a third party so only the reader can recognize that he was responsible for it, takes several large actions to prepare Westeros for the Long Night, it's fantastic stuff. One of the better implementations of uplift.
