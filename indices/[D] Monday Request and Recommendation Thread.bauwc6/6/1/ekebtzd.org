Recently stumbled upon [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-king-in-the-long-night-asoiaf-got-stellaris-uplift-project.578392/][The King in the Long Night]], where the Commonwealth of Man (xenophobic Human colonist upstart empire from Stellaris) discovers the world Westeros is set upon shortly before/during canon. They begin a covert uplift project, in order to recruit the relatively powerful espers. Told from varying viewpoints, split between the canon protagonists and members of the Commonwealth.
