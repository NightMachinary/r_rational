Not a jerk, clueless, /and/ absolutely good? Or, not a jerk, not clueless, /nor/ absolutely good?

/Worth the Candle/ is the only one that really plays with those tropes on a rational level, and it violates a lot of your principles. You could argue (poorly) that his party is a harem, or that he's a jerk, or that he's progressed from nothing to something really quickly.

(Actually, what's wrong with the zero-to-hero developments? It's not that I find that type of plot super convincing, most of the time, but if you're reading isekai that's basically the /point/. If you go to a fantasy world only to go native, all you've done is make a normal fantasy story with a protagonist that is entirely unrelated to the world-building.)

Non-rational honorable mentions: in /Konosuba/ everyone is a loser but it's a comedy so that doesn't matter. /Re: Zero/ doesn't have contempt for its own fantasy world-building, even if the plot punishes its protagonist a lot. (I dislike it when a protagonist is isekai'd into a fantasy world that the author has clearly created as some kind of bizarre revenge fantasy)
