Can anyone please recommend me a rational isekai series? I'm slowly getting into this genre, but I also hate the awful characters and zero-to-hero developments.

I want to read an isekai story with a clear plot, a rational protagonist who's not a jerk, not clueless, nor absolute good. No harem, please.
