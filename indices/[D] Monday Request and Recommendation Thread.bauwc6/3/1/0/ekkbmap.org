I dislike calling Worm grimdark. One of the main points of the original Grimdark world, Warhammer 40k, is that there are no good guys. The Humans are literal fascists, the Orks are savages, the Tau are communist fascists...

Worm is different. Most people there /are/ actually trying to be good, or trying to be /better/. Taylor had an extremely jaded view of authority, and it's influenced a lot of readers, but if you look at how interlude characters describe the world, or what Victoria from Ward says about Earth Bet, its people and its institutions were largely /good/.

That said, The Gods Are Bastards is a really nice counterweight to Wildbow's works, and I recommend it as well.
