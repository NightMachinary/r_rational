This is one of the things that I've been working on in my spare time for quite a while, though I don't think that I would go so far as you seem to want (which, from what I'm getting, is a wildly alien society). Mostly, it would be a method for making all of the mechanics of a traditional MMO into diegetic elements of the world, and without the actual "online" stuff in it. I've got a worldbuilding doc going for it, but probably won't write it anytime soon, and I need to find the plot.

Edit: Sorry this isn't a recommendation, I forgot which thread I was in.
