Eeh...it started out really well with Ren developing his crafting class and getting by with his abilities in crafting instead of fighting like the other players, but then it starts to go downhill after a while.

First is the massive harem where every girl he meets falls in love with him because he's such a competent individual, tragic figure, or too cute to resist. Second is when he starts being able to beat fighters with a crafting class which ignores the original starting premise. Third is the behavior of the gaming company where they are too eager to help Ren with all possible 'issues' in the game which is so unrealistic for me that it's SOD-breaking. Finally Ren doesn't really face any truly difficult challenges after the starting chapters and falls into the classic issue of an OP protagonist being kinda boring to read about. Stop when you read up to chapter 19 or 20. The first arc was the best part of the story for me.

I mainly included it because despite all of the above issues, the story is fairly popular on royalroad and it's an excellent example of a story that was abandoned and later completed by a totally different author.
