The only time I've seen it happen was with [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/8220/mythrans-master-of-all-continued][Master of All]] where the original author posted about 70,000 words or 16 chapters and then someone else decided to continue it to completion for another 2 million words or 794 chapters.
