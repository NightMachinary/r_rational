It's /extremely/ rare for anyone to pick up an orphaned work and finish it (or even continue it without finishing it). Most of the people who have the chops to do it have their own stuff they'd rather write, and there are all kinds of headaches that come from filling in for the other person, even if you do have a detailed plan in place.
