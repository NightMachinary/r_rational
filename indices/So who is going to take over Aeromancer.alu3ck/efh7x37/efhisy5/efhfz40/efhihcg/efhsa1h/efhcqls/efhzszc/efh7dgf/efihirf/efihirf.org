To be honest its quite sad that the author stopped writing, but i think its not a good idea to have someone else continue ... its not going to be the same , the worldbuilding was still not really complete nor anything else , hoping for the original author to return is definitly the best bet even if its highly unlikely.

And to some extend the story is done ... Seti wanted to be a mancer and be part of their world and now he is ... everything else can stay open and unfinished ... but the story as such got at least a soft ending.
