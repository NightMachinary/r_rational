Thanks for letting me know. I can definitely understand how the large number of characters can be problematic.

HSTW is an experiment meant to push me out of my comfort zone but, in hindsight, it might have been better to run an experiment that isn't going to last so long. >:]

(Except, that was /also/ part of the comfort zone thing. My thinking was, if I push myself to write something /this/ big, with /this/ many characters, and so on and so forth, then everything that I write thereafter will feel less daunting.)

While you wait for that, though, you might be interested in knowing that I also write worldbuilding resources and other nifty things. You can check out one of the books that I've written [[http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/200950/Strange-Nations-A-Worldbuilding-Resource][here]], where you can pick it up for free.

(If you like it and want more of that sort of thing, then [[https://www.patreon.com/WMBsaltworks][check out my patreon page]] and see if any of the rewards intrigue you. I wouldn't mention it out of the blue, ordinarily, but since you said that you aren't checking the updates regularly, you might have missed it when I made the announcement last month.)

Thanks again for reading!
