Git seems like massive overkill for backing up a story unless you are doing something really unusual like writing multiple versions of the same story in parallel.

I mean, if you are familiar with it and already have it set up for other projects, sure, but if not I'd say dropbox gives you all the features you want for like 5% of the hassle.
