so lately in my writing I've started aggressively doing this trick where if i spend more than 15 seconds stuck on a word or a phrase I'll write a TODO and then just move on. Usually the TODO is for something like a physical description or a scene description, although it might also be something where I'd need to pull up my spreadsheet and look up a worldbuilding fact or time range.

The reason I do this is that is that I try to remain in the focused state without getting interrupted. I'm trying to hold the characters in my head and generate their conversation, and running off to check some fact or figure out the right words to describe a setting or something always takes me out of that headspace. It's a lot easier to go write those descriptions later while I'm in a headspace more suitable for description.

anybody else do things like this?

(I think this is an instance of something that makes writing kind of tricky, which is that you need a bunch of different mindsets for it: you have to think about how your scene operates in the context of the overall plot, you have to get in the mind of (multiple!) characters and how they think and how they talk, you have to describe physical things, you have to write good words and have balanced sentence structure... it seems to help to try to separate them out a bit, I think.)
