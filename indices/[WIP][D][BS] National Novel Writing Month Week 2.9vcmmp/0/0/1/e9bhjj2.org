This is a good point, I'll watch out for it. Now that I think about it, there are two characters that were meant to be important, but I've almost TODOed them out of existence because I haven't described or named them yet and as a result I don't think about them very much. This is probably something I should fix sooner rather than later.

(Usually, though, it's little things, like, "find the words to describe the way she swings her sword that conveys her uncanny superhuman precision". Doesn't really affect the rest of the scene and even if it did, I know what the intent was supposed to be.
