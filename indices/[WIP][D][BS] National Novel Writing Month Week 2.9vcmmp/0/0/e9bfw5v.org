I do that somewhat frequently, especially for /Worth the Candle/, which is approaching 800K words, and has absolutely horrific amounts of continuity to keep track of. It's added a ton of work, especially with regard to names; I spent half an hour the other day trying to figure out whether a character's two sons had ever been given names. If I stop in the middle of what I'm doing to look up stuff like that, it represents an enormous break in flow.

That said, I think the biggest downside is scene continuity and the temptation to write around the TODO. If a person's appearance is TODOed, then you either end up with a lot of TODOs, or you just never mention their appearance after the first TODO, neither of which is great, especially since appearance can be a good part of speech tagging/tone (e.g. someone loosening their tie, adjusting their cuffs, fiddling with a button, running a finger along their bushy eyebrow, etc.).
