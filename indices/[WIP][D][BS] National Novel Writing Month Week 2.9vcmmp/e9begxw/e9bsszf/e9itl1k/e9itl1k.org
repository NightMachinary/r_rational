Well, today managed to surprise the shit out of me, because first off I got 3800 words down and second both the narrator and one of his housemates had a rebellion against my intentions and whoops that is not how I envisioned her character. Or his. What are you doing, my characters? What madness have you wrought?

I know that's how authoring is "supposed" to go, your characters surprising you and all. It's just the first time it's actually happened to me. Feels weird.
