I'm really enjoying doing nanwrimo this year. Before November I was doing ~500 words a day, and was struggling with staying motivated and enjoying writing. Now that I've had to pump up the pace at which I write, I'm writing about twice the words in the same amount of time, and I'm feeling really excited about my story again.

I'm not sure if this was because I was being too complacent with my writing schedule or what, but it's had a positive effect on my attitude and with the quantity and (hopefully) the quality of my work. I'm thinking of changing my daily word goal to 1500 after November, especially since after this December I'll be essentially done with school (asides from two classes). Has anyone else felt similarly with a change in their writing schedule?
