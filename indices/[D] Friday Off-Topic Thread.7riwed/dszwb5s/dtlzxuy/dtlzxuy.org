When I first read this, I thought of SAO (which I kinda hate) but also how often it seemed that when a large group of human beings are now in a "real" MMO they are made to look like their "real" forms.

I was then curious about a story where this change doesn't occur. So not only do you have people presenting as different genders but you have lots of the population looking almost exactly identical to lots of the population.

I wonder what kind of weird social, physical, and mental things people might go through to create distinct presentations from other people. If group work might, on average, be more amicable because your physical identity isn't as unique. Or if you might see a rise in psychosis due to a lack of individuality. Maybe a greater emphasis on tribes and using group identity to create distance between yourself and others?

Seems really interesting. And I have realized I did nothing to answer your question. Sorry. But very interesting!
