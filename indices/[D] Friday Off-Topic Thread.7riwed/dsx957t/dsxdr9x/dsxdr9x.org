I'd check local bookstores-- I bought my 3.5 books back in high school used there. Obviously local bookstores aren't anywhere near as common, and 5E is newer than 3.5 was then, so you may not find anything.

That said, if you don't find it I'd probably recommend you do the bad thing and torrent a PDF of the player's handbook. It's not functionally much different from you borrowing it from another member of the table, and it's inconvenient enough to have to use the PDF (especially if you're a casting class, while at the table), that if D&D ends up being something you play semi-regularly you'll still be pretty incentivized to purchase a copy when your financial situation improves.
