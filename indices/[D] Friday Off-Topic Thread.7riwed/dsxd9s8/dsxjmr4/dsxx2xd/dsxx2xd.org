Great summary! I'll expand on two points:

Python is my favourite language, and I'd strongly recommend it as a first language to learn - the syntax is straightforward and there are many good tutorials. /Think Python 2e/ (Green Tea press) is a very good introduction and entirely free, so no loss if it doesn't suit you.

The only downsides of Python are that it's not suited to low-level tasks (eg hardware control, operating systems), and that distributing your code to non-programmers can be more complicated than in compiled languages (but it's possible!)

Re JavaScript: if you want to write Web stuff, use Typescript instead - it's a language from Microsoft which is basically "JS, without the stuff that makes that awful" and compiles back to JS very easily. There are actually many languages that compile to JavaScript (or Web assembly now!), but few are widely use for Web development.
