  Re JavaScript: if you want to write Web stuff, use Typescript instead - it's a language from Microsoft which is basically "JS, without the stuff that makes that awful" and compiles back to JS very easily. There are actually many languages that compile to JavaScript (or Web assembly now!), but few are widely use for Web development.

I was personally thinking of recommending CoffeeScript, but then I figured having trying to teach a coding beginner a scripting language that /also/ has to be compiles is a bit overkill.
