I would heartily disagree about Javascript and PHP.

Sinatra ([[http://sinatrarb.com/]]) is pretty much the simplest/easiest you can get for a web server. I think at this point everyone has microframeworks, but Sinatra remains my gold standard.

Javascript is a different style of thinking (callbacks/promises) that takes a minute to get your head around, but is really cool when you get into it. It's a blessing and curse that you can pull the shenanigans that are possible in the language, since it allows for really inventive exploration, but results in a fair amount of fragmentation and crazy sauce (look up "transpiling").

I'm working almost entirely with Python right now, and I'd say it's major downside is that it's very opinionated about the "correct" way to do things. The language itself fights you if you're not doing it the "right" way, but doesn't do a great job of explaining that "right way".
