A shoutout to [[/u/DaystarEld]], who posts here regularly. I was reading posts about the Aziz Ansari situation in Change My View yesterday and had been feeling really uncomfortable. I was feeling like Ansari had behaved inappropriately, but I wasn't able to articulate properly what exactly was the problem; and it was getting me really down, as many comments seemed to express he did nothing out of line. Then i stumbled across [[https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/7re6fh/cmv_the_aziz_situation_is_showing_a_double/][a post]] from our own resident Pokemon Professor which perfectly explained the issue and detailed step-by-step what Ansari did wrong. And the way he responded to the comments were really well done as well.

Sadly the post was removed for (what feels to me like) a pretty lousy application of the sub's rules, but the comments and responses can still be found there. They did actually help me clarify my thoughts, and I really appreciated the effort he put into them.

(Sorry if this is a bit controversial!)
