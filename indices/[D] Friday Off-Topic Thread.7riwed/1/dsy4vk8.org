People might recall a few weeks ago I was talking about the application/interview process for what amounted for, well, my own job. I'm pleased to be able to announce that I've been identified as the "preferred candidate" which means that the people who weren't picked have a week to file a complaint and if they don't I get my own job!! Yay!!!

Someone who congratulated me said "it must be a relief" and I think that's the best way to put it: if I hadn't got the job I'd made plans to leave the building and take a long walk to get my head together, have a long lunch, and leave early so I could mope the rest of the day. Getting the job just... feels like nothing though, the relief at the bad thing not happening.

But ah well, at least I got to demonstrate to my Evil Boss in no uncertain terms that I am fucking amazing, have qualifications he probably had no idea about, and so on.
