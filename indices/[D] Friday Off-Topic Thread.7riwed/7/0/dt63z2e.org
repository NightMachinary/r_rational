This is probably super simplified advice but a simple, easy way to at least start trying to break bad habits is the rubber band method (test? Experiment? Idk). Basically, wear a rubber band on your wrist. Every time you notice that you're venturing down a self defeating line of thought, immediately grab the rubber band, pull it far and release.

Try your best to make it reactionary (as the more time you have to think about it, the more likely you'll be too afraid of the pain to do it)

Eventually your body will (or I guess I should say may) start associating those patterns of thought with the pain of the rubber band snap and it'll be easier to avoid because you'll naturally shy away from those thoughts.

Dsclaimer : this method is very simple.and basic, more for breaking a habit of eating chips after bedtime. It's no substitute for legitimate therapeutic assistance though it can serve as a supplement.
