I see what you're getting at. I've had a few discussions about this myself in the past few weeks. I'm mostly on Aziz' side, in that I think it was up to Grace to show her own agency by simply leaving, but I can also agree that (as you pointed out, if we accept her story as pretty much true) Aziz was being quite ignorant of what were very clear signals to pretty much anyone. I settled on a 70-30 weighting in favor of Aziz if we were going to attempt to quantify the responsibility/blame proportions, though that wasn't worked out with math. It's more of an estimation of my opinions.

My main issue with the account is that, based on what Grace said, she gave off very clear signs of disinterest and Aziz Ansari simply steamrolled right past each and every one (I believe she gave at least four signals that, while not explicitly verbal, were very clear signs of disinterest/disgust) Based on the account given, it makes it seem as if she was uncomfortable from the start and only got more uncomfortable as things went, and made no effort to hide this discomfort, though she didn't exactly yell "NO!" in his face.

What bothers me is, if her account is completely true, is that I can't see most guys who aren't explicit rapists going to that extent if a woman is being as disinterested as she claimed she was being. I feel that there was more willingness shown on her part that didn't really make it into the article considering the slant it was written with or that she simply refuses to acknowledge or even may not remember, since memories change over time, especially if there's associated trauma, i.e feeling like you were sexually assaulted. She says Aziz basically dogged her steps through his apartment for half an hour and repeatedly gave her unwanted kisses and "shoved his fingers down her throat". I can't really see any human being, no matter their fetish or sexual bent (outside of just, ya know, being a rapist) doing that if you're being as cold as she claimed she was being.

Guys push for sex. It's not uncommon at all. It wouldn't surprise me at all if Aziz was the type to try to get into a one night stand with a girl. Plenty of guys are. But the way she depicted the encounter just felt off to me; it felt surreal. I couldn't see most men acting in the way she claimed he had (disclaimer: I don't know Aziz, other than his standups and personality online/TV so he could just be a giant douchebag. Very /very/ possible.) And, as many people harp on, the (from what we can tell) completely consensual blowjob. I feel like we can all agree that that was, at the very least, a very mixed signal to send.

In a sexual encounter between two people that don't know each other very well, things can be weird and awkward. Neither side is completely sure what the other's into, what they want and how to best communicate their interests. Did she pull away because she's not into progressing past first base or did she pull away because she just wants you to slow down because she has nerves but is fine with things progressing? Was the way he asked where you wanted to fuck him being threatening or was it sexy? Were his repeated advances because he didn't care about you or because he figured you seemed receptive to changing your mind? Is she sucking on your fingers because it's an awkward sexual technique she's not experienced with and so she's going along with it, or because she's actually into it?

These are all questions that both people probably ask themselves and don't voice. The reasons they don't voice it can vary wildly. For men, maybe they don't want to seem timid and meek(which, despite people's claims, is a valid position. They are scores of women that will tell you that they like their men to be aggressive, to "know what he wants", etc. And how that translates is probably different for each specific woman) For women, maybe they're intimidated by his power (be it social, physical, etc.) or maybe they want a second date and are afraid that not acquiescing pulls the plug on future connections of any sort, and so they go along with it thinking "This won't be so bad". And for some women, that's the case. It's not so bad. For others, it leads to them feeling violated and regretful.

As I stated earlier, despite my being (mostly) on Aziz' side, I can easily agree that there is blame on both parties' ends. Sex is a complicated thing; it always has been and will continue to be (most likely) though the /way/ in which it is complicated will change. People are complicated too, and figuring another person out can be a lifetime of work, let alone trying to do it in a single night. The easiest solution is for people to be open and honest with their communication; that seems obvious. But there are barriers to that; barriers that have real effects in the real world. There were multiple reasons that both Aziz and Grace did what they did; some justifiable and some not.

Ultimately, Grace remained in the bad part of that encounter by her own will for (from what I could tell by the writing) seemed to be at least an hour, if not longer. She had the agency to leave at any moment but chose not to for reasons that we can really only speculate at. But it's important to note that she did stay there of her own will; she kissed Aziz several times despite his relentless, unwanted advances and she did perform oral sex on him towards the end of the encounter.

This does /not/ mean she should've fucked Aziz. This does not mean she didn't have the right to tell him "No." and this does not mean she didn't have the right to feel disgusted by his aggressive actions or regretful of the night in general.

What this does mean is that she doesn't have the right to call it sexual assault, at least in my opinion. And she also shouldn't have gone to a magazine and attempted (I say attempted because opinions are mixed on whether or not Aziz actually assaulted her) to label him as a sexual assailant. Whether Aziz was a celebrity or not; that's something that has the potential to cause a lot of damage.
