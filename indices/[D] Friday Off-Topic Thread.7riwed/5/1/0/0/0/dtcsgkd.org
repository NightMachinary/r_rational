Yeah the mods still haven't adequately explained why it was removed, but I can still see it, so might as well just copy/paste here:

(Quick note that this is not a post about rape. Aziz is not a rapist, by Grace's account. No rape occurred on the date. But it is still a post about sexual boundaries being ignored)

(This is also not a post about the response from society and whether it's proportional. I don't think Aziz deserves to be lumped in with Weinstein and Spacey. I just want to focus on the ways it highlights poor understandings of consent and unfair expectations)

Among the many arguments I've had and seen around this topic lately, one refrain I keep seeing is that Grace should have been more vocal and clear about her desires. There was even a front page video making fun of her being unclear, invoking things like "chakras" to communicate for her.

I can't help but feel that these people didn't read the original article, because in it she very clearly states her preferences a number of times, whereas Aziz is the one who is ambiguous, or who says one thing and then does another.

#+begin_quote
  She said she remembers him asking again and again, “Where do you want me to fuck you?” while she was still seated on the countertop. She says she found the question tough to answer because she says she didn't want to fuck him at all... But he kept asking, so I said, ‘Next time.' And he goes, ‘Oh, you mean second date?' and I go, ‘Oh, yeah, sure,'"
#+end_quote

This is a clear "no" to anyone who understands basic English. "Next time" is not "now." "Next time" is not "tonight."

Not to Aziz, apparently:

#+begin_quote
  and he goes, ‘Well, if I poured you another glass of wine now, would it count as our second date?'” He then poured her a glass and handed it to her."
#+end_quote

So here Aziz is using a "joke" to try to ignore her stated preference and get her to change her mind about being ready for sex that night. But it's an intentional move: if he had instead been clear about his desires, if he'd said "Well I'm just here for a hookup, I want full sex, that's what I'm going after tonight," then Grace might have just left. Most people would, so of course that kind of thing is rarely said on dates.

Instead you get more poor communication... not from her, who is pretty clear that she doesn't want to be forced into anything:

#+begin_quote
  She excused herself to the bathroom soon after. Grace says she spent around five minutes in the bathroom, collecting herself in the mirror and splashing herself with water. Then she went back to Ansari. He asked her if she was okay. “I said I don't want to feel forced because then I'll hate you, and I'd rather not hate you,” she said.
#+end_quote

But from him, who says one thing:

#+begin_quote
  “He said, ‘Oh, of course, it's only fun if we're both having fun.' The response was technically very sweet and acknowledging the fact that I was very uncomfortable. Verbally, in that moment, he acknowledged that I needed to take it slow. Then he said, ‘Let's just chill over here on the couch.'”
#+end_quote

And then does another

#+begin_quote
  Ansari instructed her to turn around. “He sat back and pointed to his penis and motioned for me to go down on him. And I did.”
#+end_quote

Here's something important that again people don't seem to understand about consent:

*If you give someone a blowjob, that doesn't mean you're okay with intercourse.*

Yes, things can evolve organically, and often do, and that's totally fine. But when the other person *explicitly said no to intercourse for the night*, and explicitly said not to do things that make her feel forced, you should not do this:

#+begin_quote
  Halfway into the encounter, he led her from the couch to a different part of his apartment. He said he had to show her something. Then he brought her to a large mirror, bent her over and asked her again, “Where do you want me to fuck you? Do you want me to fuck you right here?” He rammed his penis against her ass while he said it, pantomiming intercourse."
#+end_quote

And again, she clearly says the N word:

#+begin_quote
  “After he bent me over is when I stood up and said *no*, I don't think I'm ready to do this, I really don't think I'm going to do this. And he said, ‘How about we just chill, but this time with our clothes on?'”
#+end_quote

This is the point people keep bringing up as him doing things right, as him stopping when being told to stop... completely ignoring, of course, that it's followed by:

#+begin_quote
  They got dressed, sat side by side on the couch they'd already “chilled” on, and he turned on an episode of Seinfeld... While the TV played in the background, he kissed her again, stuck his fingers down her throat again, and moved to undo her pants. She turned away."
#+end_quote

So again: he is using his words to /mislead/ her about his intentions, and /not/ honestly just telling her what he wants. Which is sex.

So she says this:

#+begin_quote
  I remember saying, ‘You guys are all the same, you guys are all the fucking same.'”
#+end_quote

Which he /again/ ignored:

#+begin_quote
  Ansari asked her what she meant. When she turned to answer, she says he met her with “gross, forceful kisses.”
#+end_quote

Another clear sign that she wasn't happy that he deliberately ignored, trying to force her to be quiet with a kiss. And that's when she finally gets up and tries to leave, having to endure another two kisses from someone who should have recognized that she wasn't feeling it.

So assuming you take the original article as mostly true (which is a whole separate discussion than arguing what happened based on it), the above seems pretty clear that she made her desires known, verbally.

Now, we can all talk about when she should have left if that's important to reinforce too. I think she should have left when she got out of the bathroom and he asked her for another blowjob instead.

But no matter how poorly you think she communicated her discomfort or how much you think she should have just left, accusing her of not being clear about what she wants (no sex and no feeling forced) does not get disqualified just because she was okay with oral sex. That's what consent /means./

If he, on the other hand, is verbally saying one thing and physically doing another, and yet people who don't agree that he did wrong keep saying that /she/ is the one who didn't communicate clearly, there's clearly something wrong with the expectations we have of people on dates in society.

This seems a clear double standard to me, but a lot of people are insisting that her communication was mixed (largely because she gave oral sex) while he, at worst, was just insensitive or awkward or worse, "not a mind reader."

But that's ridiculous: she clearly stated her desires. And instead of responding honestly to them, he said one thing and did another. He acted like he cared what she wanted, when really he should have just been clear from the beginning that his goal is to pursue intercourse.

Saying that you don't want intercourse but still giving oral sex is not unclear communication, to me.

Saying that you understand your date's desires for taking things slow, desire not to have sex on the first date, desire not to feel forced, and then acting purely to still get sex, is unclear communication.

But everyone on Aziz's side never seems to bring that up, and it seems ridiculous that she's the one being accused of not communicating clearly.

CMV if you can, and thanks for your time.

[Edit: A lot of people here do not seem to understand how consent works. Quick dating tip:

/Ramming your cock against someone's ass and asking where they want you to fuck them is a proposition for sex the way jamming a cup of coffee against someone's lips and asking how much sugar they want is a proposition for coffee. Particularly if they already said no to coffee. Even if they are drinking tea instead./

It is fine if you are in a relationship with them. It is not fine if you are on a first date and your date has already verbally said no to intercourse.

People who do not understand this and keep conflating what Aziz did with "asking for sex" are missing the point and not actually aiming at anything that will change my view.]
