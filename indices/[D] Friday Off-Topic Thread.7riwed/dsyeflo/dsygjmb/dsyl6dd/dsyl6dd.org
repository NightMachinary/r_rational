  However, such idealized scenarios rarely if ever occur in real life. I think it is highly likely that any irrational tendencies which would score higher in a specific situation like this would score lower in similar situations with only a few details changed. Are we sure that rebellion will always lead to the device going off rather than succesfully disarming it and leading to a higher utility?

Let's say your plan for dealing with a doomsday device threat is to rebel if it looks like you have a "high enough" chance of doing so successfully. That doesn't tell the villains "hey building doomsday devices is pointless!" It tells them "build doomsday devices in secret locations that will automatically trigger on your death or if they don't receive a certain signal only you know or any number of other security measures to ensure rebellions can't disarm the doomsday device." Which is even worse, because doomsday devices that automatically trigger on certain conditions are even more likely to accidentally trigger and end the world.

Also, both you and [[/u/sicutumbo]] mentioned nukes as doomsday devices that didn't kill us all, but I'm not sure that that generalizes to other doomsday devices. There are various reasons why this may only apply to nukes. For one, nukes tend to only be owned by leaders of countries that are rich and powerful enough to have nukes, so the people that can launch nukes have a lot of lose by doing so. In contrast, there probably are doomsday devices that can be built by random civilians with the right skill sets but not a whole lot of wealth. For another, world leaders are screened in many ways before becoming world leaders. If you are a psycho villain willing to threaten the destruction of the world and actually follow through with it, odds are high that you get (assassinated/disowned by previous more sane king/not voted in) before becoming the leader of a country that has nukes. So it may just be that the world leaders so far have all been sufficiently good people (not wholly good, since there are dictators and war mongers and all other kinds of horrible people, but at least not villainous enough to actually destroy the world if they don't get what they want).
