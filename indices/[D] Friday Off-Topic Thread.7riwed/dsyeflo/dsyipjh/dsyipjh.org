I think it would be short sighted of the population of utilitarians to obey the person holding the Doomsday device. It's similar to the logic of not negotiating with terrorists, which this basically is just on a different scale. If the terrorist is smart, they will make it so the cost to you of the thing you are to give up is less than the cost of losing whatever it is the terrorist is holding hostage. The child's safety is traded for a large but achievable amount of money, for example. From the parent's or a government's point of view, this should be an easy trade. Money for a parent is replaceable while the child isn't, and for a government letting a child die to a terrorist is such a huge negative that it's worth it. Under your analysis, this is the right solution, right?

Well, IRL, this doesn't happen in a vacuum. Unless the parent has a strong incentive to keep the entire thing hidden, they will tell the police, and if the government gets involved then a lot of people will know about it. Capitulating to the demands in a hostage situation signals to every potential terrorist that this is a strategy that works, and pays off well since the government doesn't want to risk someone's life in such a public manner. So then everyone does it, and everything's terrible. IRL, you preempt this cycle by never giving in in the first place. Not only do you not agree to the demands, you meet every hostage situation with disproportionate, overwhelming force. You make it public knowledge that any attempted hostage situation has such a small chance of payout, such a huge chance of you ending up dead or in prison for life, that it never becomes a sensible option. The government even goes so far as to not even bother with communicating with the hostage taker in the first place, because a threat that you never hear can't be used against you. You make this reality by sharing it publically, and we call the phrase "We do not negotiate with terrorists."

Where this doesn't apply fully is in your scenario, where the terrorist takes a city or state hostage with the threat of destruction. A single individual, or even a large crowd of individuals, is worth the sacrifice so that taking hostages does not become something that people expect to work. But losing a city or state is another thing entirely. And you're right, there isn't a good solution to this problem. Obeying the commands is the sensible option for the government and populace, even going so far as to force compliance from those who might rebel.

However, what governments can do is try to never allow the situation to arrive in the first place. Nuclear weapons, just about the only practical way of taking a city hostage, are extremely heavily restricted. I haven't looked into this issue specifically, but I imagine that if a government credibly thought that you had a nuclear weapon, you wouldn't be greeted by a SWAT team, you'd be met with a missile. I do not feel like putting myself on a list just to confirm this.

Luckily, nuclear weapons are so resource intensive to design and make that individuals and even most organizations can't afford to make them. Some countries did, however. To get an idea of what your scenario looks like played out in real life, research the Cold War and MAD.
