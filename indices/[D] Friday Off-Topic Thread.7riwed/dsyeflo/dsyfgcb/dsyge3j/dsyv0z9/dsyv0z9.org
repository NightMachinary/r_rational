For exactly the reasons you describe in your original post: If you rebel once, there's a increased chance of doomsday but a decreased chance of a future person doing the same thing.

Here's a basic mathematical model. To simplify things, I'll say that everyone dead or enslaved is 0 and the current state of the world is 1. Let's say rebelling is a 10% chance of everyone dead and not rebelling means that 1% of the world is enslaved.

Your point is that rebelling means an expected utility of 0.9 while not rebelling means an expected utility of 0.99. However, since not rebelling means that this will happen again (and again and again), either people will rebel at some point, or everyone will eventually be enslaved. If people are going to rebel at some point, it's better if it happens before half the population is enslaved. If everyone is enslaved, it's just about as bad as doomsday, or at least definitely worse than a utility of 0.9. So, since we don't want people to be enslaved, the optimal thing to do is to fight against the villain immediately.

Now, obviously thats simplified, but I suspect that the point would stand under a more complicated model.
