This is only based off my own personal experiences, but I've found that creating new habits, especially at the beginning of the day help me a lot. Something as simple as stretching first thing in the morning helped to wake me up, made me feel like I had already accomplished something, and had a tangible benefit.

I also tend to respond well to broaching physical boundaries. What I mean by that is I have a hard time doing work in the same place I sleep or spend watching tv/playing games. I have an easier time working if I move go to a coffee shop or cross a significant boundary (door to the room, going outside, etc).
