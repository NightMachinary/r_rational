I'm not sure the comparison to hostage taking is the same for utilitarians though. When villains takes hostages, the comparison is between the well-being of the small group of hostages versus all the other people the villains could hurt if they go free, and the latter if often far larger. So from a utilitarian standpoint, it makes sense to rebel.

But once it gets up to a city or global scale, the comparison is now between the world and a small bunch of targeted individuals. The utilitarian directive now points the other way to obey, because the villain is already threatening a maximal group of people and could hardly cause more harm by you obeying.

However, based on the thought experiment in my first post, it seems that this is actually a suicidal course of action, as it gives all villains perverse incentives to create doomsday devices and inevitably one of them will trigger and kill us all. So it seems that the "we do not negotiate with terrorists" pre-commitment must be extended to these large-scale cases, even if it sounds irrational and un-utilitarian.
