But how do we know whether something just sounds un-utilitarian as opposed to actually being un-utilitarian? It wasn't immediately obvious to me that rebelling was the utilitarian choice, and I highly doubt this is obvious to most (self-proclaimed) utilitarians either.

If this is true, then this leads to a very dangerous situation where a large majority of the population could become misguided utilitarians who make utilitarian-sounding but not actually utilitarian choices, and once again villains gain perverse incentives to make doomsday devices.

So is there something like a public list of official guidelines and pre-commitments for utilitarians to follow. A utilitarian bible of sorts, with commandments like "Thou shalt not negotiate with terrorists"?
