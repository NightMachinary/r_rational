I don't think deterrance via rebellion is a feasible strategy to begin with. I'm not convinced that it's possible, and I'm also not convinced that it's worth the cost. Maybe it is possible and worth it, but these certainly aren't self-evident.

First, we need to convince enough people to irrationally rebel even against threats even under threat of world destruction.

Second, the doomsday devices must be worthless except via extortion (missiles which destroy cities but not the world have military value even if the opponent doesn't submit).

Third, this rebellion committment must be common knowledge, so that every potential villain knows that their demands won't be obeyed. This one is probably the most difficult. How do you convince everyone in the world that you would rather let doomsday devices go off than give into a few demands unless this actually occurs several times to establish a pattern? Your precommitment has no value unless the opponent truly believes it.

Fourth, the villain has to be irrational enough to be willing to set off a doomsday device (or have one that allows them to avoid its effects), but rational enough to acquire one, and to understand your precomittment. A truly irrational villain will make a doomsday device and threaten you with it anyway even if you've made it not be worth it, and then you're forced to rebel and then they set it off. A truly rational villain wouldn't be willing to blow themselves up, and will just go into politics and gain power that way.

So while your policy may decrease the number of doomsday devices being made, it won't decrease to zero. Since it increases the conditional probability of a doomsday device being set off given that it was created to 100%, this is only worth it if the deterrance effect is incredibly strong. Given that all four of the above conditions have to occur for it to work, there will be a sufficiently high percent of cases where it doesn't work to tip the balance against this policy.
