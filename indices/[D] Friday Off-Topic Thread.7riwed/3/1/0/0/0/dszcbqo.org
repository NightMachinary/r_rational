  I don't think deterrance via rebellion is a feasible strategy to begin with. I'm not convinced that it's possible, and I'm also not convinced that it's worth the cost. Maybe it is possible and worth it, but these certainly aren't self-evident.

To be honest, I'm not completely sure either, hence my request for a second opinion. The thought experiment does seem to suggest that the alternative is suicide though.

  A truly rational villain wouldn't be willing to blow themselves up, and will just go into politics and gain power that way.

The problem is one of skillsets. If you are good at politics, then sure you can gain power via politics. But if you are good at building doomsday devices and bad at politics...

Also, there is a problem with hoping that the villain is rational enough to not activate the doomsday device: randomization.

Suppose a large chunk of the population's strategy is "rebel unless the villain displays that he is willing to activate the doomsday device". All the villain has to do is make the activation random: Every time he presses the button, there is a 10% chance that the device activates and kills everyone. Then it becomes rational for the villain to press the button whenever there's a rebellion: If he doesn't press it, the rebellion succeeds and he loses everything. If he presses it, 10% chance the device activates and he dies, losing everything. 90% chance the device doesn't activate, but the rebels see that he is willing to activate the device and so switch to obey.
