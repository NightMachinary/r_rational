This is a pretty standard Game Theory sequential game dilemma. In certain sequential games, there are cases where committing to an irrational decision would lead to an increased payoff as a deterrant. In such cases, there is a Nash Equilibrium where the player promises such an irrational decision but never has to follow through with it, but it is not a Subgame Perfect Equilibrium because such a promise cannot be followed through on. In such circumstances, we can say that an irrational player who can precommit would score higher than a purely rational player, assuming that their status as irrational is common knowledge.

However, such idealized scenarios rarely if ever occur in real life. I think it is highly likely that any irrational tendencies which would score higher in a specific situation like this would score lower in similar situations with only a few details changed. Are we sure that rebellion will always lead to the device going off rather than succesfully disarming it and leading to a higher utility?

Does the villain have some method of avoiding dying from his own doomsday device? Or does this necessitate him being irrational enough to follow through with his threat? Perhaps your policy of keeping around a population of irrational people willing to sacrifice themselves for credible threats would causes such villains to be possible. Maybe some or most villains make empty threats and we can rebel without risk of being annihilated because they are too rational to follow through. Even if these isn't always this case, if it's common knowledge that it's possible to safely rebel with high enough probability then it might be rational to rebel and we can have a detterant effect even without irrational policy.

Maybe we do our best to study possible doomsday devices that can be made, control the supply and knowledge needed to make them, and rely on our own doomsday devices to point back at anyone who manages to get one anyway. That's what we're doing now and so far the world hasn't been nuked to death, and I don't think it will be in the near future.

I don't think blindly rebelling increases global utility, otherwise we'd have invaded North Korea by now. Diplomacy and physical prevention seem much more productive given the much smaller chance of nuclear annihilation than some vague "motivation deterrance". I think everyone would still want nukes even if there were a 100% rebellion policy because rebellions have a smaller than 100% success rate and the nukes would still be useful in fighting them.
