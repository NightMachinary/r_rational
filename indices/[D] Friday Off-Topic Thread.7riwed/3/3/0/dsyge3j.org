Hm? Why is rebelling the utilitarian choice? Once the doomsday device is built, if you rebel there's nothing stopping the villain from just activating the device in spite. Even if you try to rebel secretly, there's a non-negligible chance of being detected in the planning stages or failing in the execution phase, at which point the villain activates the device in spite and again everyone dies.

So if you rebel, there's a fair chance of everyone dying. Which seems like 0 happiness or negative infinity happiness depending on how you specifically calculate it.

Whereas if you obey, most people carry on their lives as normal, just a small fraction of them become enslaved by the villain. So whether you are an average happiness type of utilitarian or a maximal happiness type of utilitarian, isn't obeying the rational choice once the device is built?
