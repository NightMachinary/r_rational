I think something that may be relevant here is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_utilitarianism][Rule Utilitarianism]]. Basically it's the idea that the goal should not be to take each action based on maximizing utility but rather to come up with rules of life that if followed universally would maximize utility. It attempts to solve many of the problems with utilitarianism and at least accord to Wikipedia represents the dominate ethical theory among utilitarians.
