Ruby is possibly the best language out there if you want to do stuff with strings, and it's consistently the only non-frustrating language I work with.

For example, Python is explicitly designed to be correct; Ruby is explicitly designed to be enjoyable. You might think this is not all that important, but these attitudes underly the tooling, communities, and documentation styles. It's just easiest to /play/ in Ruby compared to every other language (IMO)... simply because that's such a core value to the language, and thus the community that grew from it.

In terms of learning - Almost all programming tutorials are written for people who already think like a programmer, even if they don't yet know how to program. Ruby has the only two I've come across that aren't like that - _why's poignant guide, and the SonicPi tutorials.

That all said, the second biggest factor in choosing a language is library support for what you want to be doing; for example, Python has Numpy, which makes machine learning programming really easy.
