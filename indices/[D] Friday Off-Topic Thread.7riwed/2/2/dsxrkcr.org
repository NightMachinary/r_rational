There's like a billion different factors that go in deciding which programming language to use.

It depends on what you want to do, how much experience you have, etc. I'm not sure what project you have in mind exactly. Do you want to do something in a window? On a Linux-style terminal? What are its inputs and its outputs? Do you want to generate the pseudo-randomness from a seed yourself, or just hook into some pre-defined "getRandomNumber()" function?

Anyway, I'd probably recommend Python if you're starting out. It's one of the most beginner-friendly languages out there.
