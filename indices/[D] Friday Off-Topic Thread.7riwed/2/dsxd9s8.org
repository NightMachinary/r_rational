I'm looking to get back into learning code, and the first major project that I'd like to keep in mind (since "working toward a particular goal" is probably going to be more fruitful, and less scattered, than "just open a book") is building a random generator, preferably one that can work independently (rather than something that's embedded into a webpage).

Does anyone have a programming language to suggest for building a random generator? Googling mostly turns up random /number/ generators, but I'm looking for something that can, at a bare minimum, pick something from a list of plots that I've already written out, when I want to write something but can't pick one.
