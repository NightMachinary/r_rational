Most of the DnD rules were released under an Open Game License, which (in short) means that the rules (but /not/ the published settings) can be freely reproduced by others.

In other words, you can find the rules [[http://www.d20srd.org/index.htm][on a wiki at no cost]], if that's what you're interested in looking for.
