I liked this video. The reminder that slight distractions easily break us out of "deliberate" courses of action, reverting us to the techniques we've trained the most, rings particularly true. (Is this because a deliberate substitute for our fast technique requires an overide signal by the prefrontal cortex, which is dropped when startled or otherwise stressed? Dunno.)

On the other hand... /8 months/ to learn how to ride the backwards bike, "20 minutes" to switch to the other control scheme?

I have quite a bit of experience swapping control schemes around: I'm on my third keyboard layout, and in analog-in for games I've tried X axis inversion, Y axis inversion, 90 degree rotations, handedness changes, combinations of the above,... and those numbers just don't jive. (My experience is that a switch in one direction takes nearly as long as switching back, and about (20) 30-minute sessions to get high-score beating good with any given scheme)

Having not tried it, I don't think this can be much more than a suspicion, but the timescales suggest that the backwards bike probably mostly requires learning new skills, with the suppression of existing ingrained fast responses playing a fairly minor role.

Thinking about the physics of it, the backwards bike is dynamically unstable due to the influence of physical inertia and bits of fundamental physiology like the stretch reflex. IMO, this dynamic instability explains why it takes so long to learn to do it - and, perhaps, explains why riding the backwards bike is such a separate skill from riding a normal bike that you can "unlearn" it in 20 minutes. (The major competing hypothesis is probably "the guy just never got good at riding the backwards bike - I mean, just look at him; he's barely staying upright.")
