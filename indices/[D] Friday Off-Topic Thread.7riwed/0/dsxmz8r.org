Is there any good evidence for a relationship between mattress price and quality (of sleep, back health, longevity-of-mattress-construction, etc.)? In response to questions of what it's best not to skimp on*, people often respond that mattress quality doesn't diminish too much marginally with cost until you get to the ~$1k range. Is this actually the case? Personally, I've slept on two 12" queen memory foam mattresses the last ~5y (the first one we had to toss after a badbug infestation), each [[https://slickdeals.net/newsearch.php?src=SearchBarV2&q=mattress&mode=frontpage][costing around ~$150 new and shipped]], and they've been the comfiest mattresses I've ever slept on. Admittedly I've never consistently slept on $1k+ mattresses, but I have stayed in lots of hotels of varying price and quality, as well as at rich friends'/relatives' places (with fancy, multimillion $ homes and designer this and thats, etc. so I imagine they sprung for a fancy mattress), and also briefly tried the expensive mattresses at dept/furniture stores -- and I still find that I prefer my cheap mattress. Supposedly "[[http://freakonomics.com/podcast/mattress-store-bubble/][a bed with a retail price point of $1,000 probably costs about $250 to make]]", so are the cheaper online stores just operating under much narrow margins (with fewer e.g. advertising, real estate, storage, labor, etc. expenses)?

This seems like a really straightforward (if expensive) experiment to carry out, so has anyone done it yet?

*incidentally, people also say this about shoes, where I've also found it to not really be the case -- e.g. my dressier chippewa boots are comfier than my much more expensive, equivalently styled red wings, my AE strands are decidedly not comfy to wear for long periods of time, I've had ~$50 hiking shoes completely outperform $200 hiking shoes, etc. But shoes are much more personalized, so I think they're harder to compare.
