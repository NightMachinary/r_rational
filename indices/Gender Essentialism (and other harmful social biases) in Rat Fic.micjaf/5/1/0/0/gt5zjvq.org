I'm don't think it's political, or that it has to be political. "The personal is political" is a left-wing saying, after all. We can have fiction for straights, and fiction for gays, and all the other variations; there's no need for it to be combative. I guess it might become 'political' as soon as any side starts to treat it that way, if people see it as a zero-sum game. Again, this is why we need the fill-in-the-blanks bot, so people aren't in competition with each other for the identifying characteristics of their characters. I'm not joking about this.
