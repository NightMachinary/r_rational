As others have said, it's a matter of focus, as well as representation. Why do gay people want to read stories with gay people in them? Why do people of x race say they want to read more stories with people in them that look like them? Humans like to read stories featuring characters they can identify with, characters similar to themselves. Trying to identify with a character significantly different from yourself has a particular 'taste', which is acquired; it's interesting and nice, but you wouldn't have it for every meal unless you're some kind of fancy connoisseur, and readers of sci-fi/fantasy trash are generally not connoisseurs.

Basically- all people are the same, they want to read stories with main characters that look/are like them unless they're specifically looking for a change or a mind-bender.

For personal anecdata, I remember that when I first looked at /Ra/, I was mildly turned off by all the focal characters being women, but Laura Ferno's mindset was familiar enough in an endearing sort of way I kept with it. You could say that's a stupid reaction to have, that it's sexist to be less inclined to continue reading a story because the main character has a different sex to myself, and maybe it is! Just like it is when gay people or people of x race judge stories based on the identities of the main characters ;)
