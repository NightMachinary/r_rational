That's quite the amusingly alternative-facts thing to say! It nicely combines a complete lack of historical context, an exclusively federal lens, and a redirection of agency in recent corporate actions to be a really well-packaged right-wing talking point in a polite suit.

It's very much in keeping with everything else you've said here, so I guess points for consistency.
