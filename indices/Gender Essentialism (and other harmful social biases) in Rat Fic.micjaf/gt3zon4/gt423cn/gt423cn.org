I think you might be pointing to the divide this community has kind of had since the start: some people see rat fic as well constructed or thoughtful worlds, some see it as power fantasy or Munchkinning, some people are looking for evidence of a larger philosophy that emphasizes reasoning and thoughtfulness (and even real world action upon that).

EDIT: To your point about people seeing their or the harmful social biases of others as political rather than real measurable problems, I think that provably comes from the luxury of being in a privileged social group that can afford to be detached from the issues. For people who experience them daily, they are real issues that need to be confronted and addressed as a matter of survival.
