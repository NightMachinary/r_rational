There's a lot of people in the ratfic community who really don't want any GLBT themes in their power fantasy fiction, is my take. Why? Somehow to them GLBT themes are /political/, whereas erasing any queerness from fiction isn't? I don't get it, but it's a thing!

Like, if you can reshape your body, you can bet that a whole lotta people are gonna be in bodies that aren't gendered with the gender they were assigned at birth. And that's just one of the most obvious things.
