  There's a lot of people in the ratfic community who really don't want any GLBT themes in their power fantasy fiction, is my take. Why?

Personally, it often calls on experiences that are foreign to me without providing a framework to understand it. I can get /something/ from reading works written from different baseline experiences and for a different audience, but not as much as other people do.

  Somehow to them GLBT themes are political, whereas erasing any queerness from fiction isn't?
#+end_quote

For me, the difference isn't political vs. nonpolitical, or even political-I-agree-with vs. political-I-disagree-with, it's focus vs. background. Any work with LGBT themes /by definition/ has some focus on the topics of romance, sex, gender identity, etc. (specifically, it has a focus on the subset of those topics where the experiences of LGBT people differ from others'), and...I'm just not that interested or engaged by it. Including a gay romance in a story isn't any worse than a straight one, but that's not a very high bar.

Combine the added difficulty relating to the characters with the necessary focus on topics I don't care about, and you've pretty got my stance.
