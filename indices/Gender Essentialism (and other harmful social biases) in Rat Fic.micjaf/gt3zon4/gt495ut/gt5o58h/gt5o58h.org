Okay, but the specific criticism that I most often see levied in this specific community isn't "I don't like romance subplots", it's "why did you make this so political". Including when it's just background; people complain about PGTE's General Basilia, and she's literally the most low-key trans-but-it's-not-relevant character possible.
