I guess I'm not representative and don't have a good understanding of the "mainstream" criticisms.

(I'm at Book 5 of PGTE)

I'm surprised that the LGBT/feminist-esque criticisms aren't levied against Cat's bisexuality, or Hakram's promiscuity, or the love triangle in Rat army, or standards of interspecies attraction/flirting, or Cordelia being the First /Prince/, or an entire society/species that is non-gendered. I'd also expect critics to point out the differences in strength between (Earth, human) men and women to complain about female officers/soldiers as well.

Maybe it comes up later, but I don't even remember General Basilia.
