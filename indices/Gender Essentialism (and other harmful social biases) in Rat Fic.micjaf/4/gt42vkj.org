What you're seeing is probably the collision of:

1. an author who did not grow up in a society with body swapping magic psychics,
2. keeping clear in their own mind exactly which characters they're describing in any given scene,
3. trying to describe those events in a way their audience will find comprehensible,
4. trying to write in a literarily satisfying way, ie, not repeating the characters' names too many times in a paragraph or (God forbit) twice in the same sentence,
5. and all while using words to simulate a specific timeframe in a specific culture on a specific planet.

Each author has to deal with these issues in their own way. Some are skillful and top-notch, and hit all five points during the entire story. Some are kind-hearted but clumsy at hitting each of the five points at different parts of the story because they haven't had the practice you've come to expect from the top-notch fiction-writers. Some are deliberate trolls, transphobes, or haters. Some disagree with gender identity ideas without any animus, and refuse to change how they write. Some find the easiest way (or the "funniest") to solve that Gordian knot is to just cut it and say "Character F /is really/ a man, even if he's turned by magic into a physical female [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5gvnfkOF9U][every day but Wednesday]]." (That example is species-essentialist too.)

Also consider how /fast/ society has had to shift to accommodate gender identity as a civil right instead of a pathology. Even just six years ago, in real-world 2015, it was considered a whimsical and farfetched idea that [[https://np.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/3wegtd/back_to_the_future_part_ii_marlene_mcfly_is_marty/][Marty and Jennifer's daughter in Back to the Future II's 2015, Marlene McFly, might have been Marty Jr.'s transgender identical twin]]. For youngsters in high school, that was /two schools ago,/ but for workaday people in their 30's and 40's, they might still be at the same job with the same co-workers and doing the same hobbies on the weekend as six years prior. Heck, there are TV shows on my DVR recorded that long ago!
