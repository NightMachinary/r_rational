This makes sense to me, and I appreciate the insight.

It still bothers me a little that projectors from families of projectors which explicitly were apart (until recently) from general society would have the same attitudes towards gender as someone who was part of the Humdrum society (despite having had untold amounts of time to develop their own insular culture and approach to gender fluidity).

But this recommendation is enough for me to keep with it and give the author the benefit that they're exploring the topic and not attempting to voice their views through the character (like the WTR author explicitly was).
