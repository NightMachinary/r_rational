I read Piths use of pronouns as 100% intentional

Can you give an example of a time the pronouns swapped which is throwing you off?

I think Anna pretty consistently doesn't swap, unless it is people referring to her undercover/ don't know. Hira has two bodies, and seems to consistently have right Hira be called he and left be she. Wes has pronouns that swaps throughout depending on people talking about them, but Wes's gender identity is also in flux through the story, which is resolved/ reflected on in his final chapter in volume 1, where he wants to identify as Wes, and doesn't like the fem body he is in.

Given that homophobia was a major plot/ worldbuilding point in one of the interludes (admiral Ebbridge and Florence) I think the gender and sexual norms in pith's recent past are supposed to mirror those in our own recent past.
