  the gay jokes in Mother of Learning
#+end_quote

I don't recall any homophobia in MoL, but it's been awhile since I read it.

That said, you really should provide context here if you're going to make that claim. Discussing something is not the same a being a proponent of it. It really depends on the context. An author can put bigoted jokes/slurs in their work without promoting bigotry or being a bigot themselves, but the highlight that bigotry exists even in subtle forms and why it is harmful/wrong.

  If anyone has any LGBT/queer rat fics to recommend to me, please do so!
