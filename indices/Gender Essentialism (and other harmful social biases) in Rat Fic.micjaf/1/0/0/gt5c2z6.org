Oh yeah, I remember that scene.

I read it as Weston being rude and misgendering Tasia, while Samuel uses her correct pronouns. I don't think we are supposed to like Weston in this scene. I think the societal expectation is that the person who ousts is supposed to take their name and pronouns /Tasia wants to be gendered with she/her and Samuel respects that.

I'll repeat what some other commentators said that Epistocrats are regressive, and artificial bodies are relatively new. [[/u/NoYouTryAnother]] expresses this, and a general perspective on the world and author better than I could, and I'm glad you'll continue to give the story a shot!
