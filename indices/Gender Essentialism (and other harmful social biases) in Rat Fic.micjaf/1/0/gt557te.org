The pronoun usage in the beginning made perfect sense given the situation, it was this sequence that confused me:

Spoilers for 2-C:

I smiled at the thought of my team missing me. Even if they were practicing without me, it was nice to know I hadn't just disappeared without a trace. “And your newest member?”

Samuel closed his eyes. “There is so much to think about. So much to talk about. Are you sure it's the best idea to -- “

“No. But I don't much care. What is he like? Is he shy, loud, cruel? Does he prance around in my dresses like a ballerina? Did he tell you his strategy for filleting me last week?”

And

Stop hedging. What is he like?”

Samuel took in a deep breath. “She's...enthusiastic. Excited about getting a free ride to Paragon and all your family's resources, but awkward. Me and the rest of the squad refused to speak to her at all, but she took it all in stride. Very demure, very apologetic. It's still too fresh and too personal for us to acknowledge her, and...she kind of gets that.”

Both refer to the same person in the same body, but maybe there's a social difference as a result of the usurping process where taking someone's position includes taking their pronouns when talking about group dynamics?

Like I said above not sure if this was a result of the society's approach to gender, this particular situation, or these characters in the moment.
