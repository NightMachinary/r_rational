Without providing examples, it's kinda hard to know what specifically you're referring to. You seem to be saying all characters should act a certain way, without considering that there are a ton of divisions going on with the characters in terms of age, gender, politics, class, ethnicity, parenting, and education that differentiate how they think/act.

  you'd think that what really matters in a society with body swapping magic psychics is what stays consistent between bodies.

The character in Queen Sulphur, for instance, come from all across the world, from societies that teach body-swapping is a sin to ones that view it as putting on a new pair of shoes. The story doesn't have a single, monolithic society/culture, but multiple ones crammed together, pushing up against another.

As someone mentioned in another comment that the body-swapping is still relatively new in society, so it could just be that society has not caught up with technology and people don't know how to react to it.

It could also be because some characters can afford to choose which sex they body-swap into and some can't, and this affects how they, and others, treat gender.
