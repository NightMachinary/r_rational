That's your deal. Briefly on Pith- do you consider Pith to be a case of showing bigotry towards underrepresented populations? Because I don't- we don't have body-swappers in real life, so from my point of view, mistreatment shown in Pith is the same as mistreatment shown in, I don't know, X-men. It's allegorical, not 'fictional black people getting whipped'. Again, this is just where our personal intuitions differ, I suppose.
