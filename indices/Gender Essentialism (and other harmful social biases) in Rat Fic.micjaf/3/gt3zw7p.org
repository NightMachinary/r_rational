Far as I can tell, the author of Pith is very much aware of issues of trans rights, as well as gender non-conforming, body dysmorphia, and others that are natural to consider in the setting and explores these through the characters. But the /society/, one which has only openly had knowledge of Projection for a decade, is not.

Some of the characters have clear self-identification as one gender or another. Some of the characters are struggling to figure out who they are after having taken it for granted. One of the characters is simultaneously a guy and a girl in two bodies at once. The most recent chapters have outright addressed one of the character's discomfort with the gender and body they'd originally never questioned, but they haven't figured things out yet (potentially non-binary? we don't know). I am not sure what you're looking for in Pith, but I think you should give the author the benefit of the doubt here.
