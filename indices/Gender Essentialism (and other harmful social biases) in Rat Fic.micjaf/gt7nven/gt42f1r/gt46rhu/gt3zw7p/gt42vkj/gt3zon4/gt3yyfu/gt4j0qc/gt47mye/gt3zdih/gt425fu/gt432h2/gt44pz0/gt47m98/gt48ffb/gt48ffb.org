I can see what you mean to some extent, I don't remember that part with Silverlake but it comes across as her being a sore loser and childish more than anything else.

  Zorian is asked multiple times if Zach is his boyfriend, for example by his brother Damien.

Is it possible that maybe Zorian is in the closet himself, and the author is hinting at that? I don't think he has any other serious relationships besides Zach, there was this buildup with a girl who was clearly interested in him but he never acted on that. In fact, I don't remember him having pursuing anything more than a casual relationship with another female character, despite have several opportunities to do so. He is always just been with Zach
