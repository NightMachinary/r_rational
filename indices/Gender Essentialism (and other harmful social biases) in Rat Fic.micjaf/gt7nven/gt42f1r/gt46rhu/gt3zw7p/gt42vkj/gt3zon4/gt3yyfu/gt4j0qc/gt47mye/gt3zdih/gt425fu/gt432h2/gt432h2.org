Not exactly a rat fic, but I first saw always human being recommended here , and it still gets recommended pretty regularly [[https://m.webtoons.com/en/romance/always-human/list?title_no=557&page=1&webtoon-platform-redirect=true]]

The murder bot diaries is also recommended pretty frequently. It has genders and sex norms very different from ones that currently exist, although that isn't the focus. (Having read the first 2 books)
