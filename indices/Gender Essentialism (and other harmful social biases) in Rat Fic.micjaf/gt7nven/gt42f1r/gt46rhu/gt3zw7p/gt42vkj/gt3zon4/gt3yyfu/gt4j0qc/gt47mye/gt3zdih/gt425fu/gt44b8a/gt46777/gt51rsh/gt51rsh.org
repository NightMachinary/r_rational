Personally, I found Mother of Learning to be very chaste. Anything romantic is described from a mile away, in a workmanlike fashion, compared to other stories.

And of course Silverhand would say something like that. She's trying to rile Zorian up; she's caustic, that was part of her character from the start. Is it really so far-fetched that a fantasy world might have attitudes towards homosexuality that the west had... in the 90s?

Maybe I'm being uncharitable, but it seems like you're more disappointed that the author didn't make a show of allegiance to your social tranche.

EDIT: Actually, I saw another one of your comments, and you were just hoping the main characters would end up banging. Hey, I can respect the hope for lewd.

As always, the answer is algorithmically-generated alternate versions of the same story, one for straights, one for gays, one for lezzos, one for gender-nonconforming body-snatchers, plus alternate versions for each race/skin tone. You put your personal details in the website, it fills in blanks in the text/swaps character genders in appropriate ways.
