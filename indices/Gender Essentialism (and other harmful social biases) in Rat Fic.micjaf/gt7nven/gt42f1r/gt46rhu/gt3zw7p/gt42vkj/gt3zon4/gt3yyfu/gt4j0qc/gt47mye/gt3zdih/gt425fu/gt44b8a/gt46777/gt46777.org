HUGE SPOILERS Zorian is asked multiple times if Zach is his boyfriend, for example by his brother Damien. In the final battle versus Silverlake, she asks him, if he is gay in a condescending way and whether that is the reason that Zorian is so hard pressed on saving Zach from almost certain doom.

I gotta say I'm a little disappointed that there is zero lgbt representation in the story, considering it's one of my all time favourite stories. (A story where people turn into spiders and eagles doesn't at least mention that people use said magic to swap their gender? Come on, it's so easy to add a throwaway line. Like making Lukav and Alanic ex-boyfriends. Considering that Zorian is a literal mind reader, I find it suspect, that he never stumbled over any closeted gay people.)

Like I could live with the story skipping romantic themes all together as well. But Zorian, and Zach especially, are written as straight playboys. Zach literally dates two people at the same time, early in the time loop. Benisek and Zach constantly want to talk about girls, Benisek gives especially detailed descriptions about Taiven's hourglass figure.

I'm also not the huuuuugest fan of ZZ showing romantic interest in their teenage class mates, considering they are much much older than them mentally and the power balance is insanely in their favour. Like, I just wished the story would have discussed or at least addressed the pseudo-pedophilia or whatever you would call it. The author did address reproductive themes several times, specifically when talking about grey hunter shifter genetics.

So it's not like they are completely ignoring sexual themes, just lgbt themes. The only "representation" are the gay jokes directed at ZZ. I've been reading some of the author's world building posts (not all of them) and they haven't even breathed in the direction of lgbt themes, while talking about literally everything else under the sun. I'm just a little disappointed in that regard. If I missed anything, please correct me.
