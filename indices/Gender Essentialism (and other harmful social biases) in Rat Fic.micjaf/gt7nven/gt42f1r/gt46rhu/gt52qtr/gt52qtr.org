I got the feeling that it's a matter of respect, as well. Right at the start, when the female MC is working in the bar/tavern, all the guests refer to her as him because the discount body she's in is male. If I'm a wealthy guy of higher social class, what do I care what gender the mind in that body over there thinks it is/originally was? I'm not going to spend mental effort to remember such things or take them into account; it would denigrate my social standing among my equally cruel and vindictive peers, same as taking the effort to remember this random servant's name would. You're here to serve me, maggot, not vice-versa. What do I pay you for? You want me to call you 'she', get a body with some feminine wiles. Remember your place, and don't bother your betters with this whining again. Get back to work.
