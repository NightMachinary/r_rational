I agree with your point. I'm not saying that you shouldn't write about bigotry ever. I'm merely stating how the story and further world build posts (that I read), are written.

I really love MoL, but there's no lgbt representation besides gay jokes. Can I rationally deduce from that, that the author is a hardcore witch hunting homophobe? Probably not. I didn't claim the author to be one in my original post either.

But if I'm being honest, they really could have done better as well. That's what I meant with rat fic having blind spots.

(I posted some context in reply to my original comment.)
