The story really blueballed me honestly, so I've been reading ZxZ fanfiction on ao3. So yeah, some people also heacanon Zorian as closet gay, but it's niche as heck.

Zorian did go on a date with Taiven, who was his original crush and love confession. I personally liked that nothing came of it. The author did well describing the power imbalance between them through Taiven's insecurities.

What do I know? Maybe the author will address Zorian's sexuality in the sequel, whenever they write that one. Whether he is straight, bi or ace, I'm open for surprises.
