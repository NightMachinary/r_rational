I can't recall concrete examples off the top of my head but of course rat fic has a bigotry problem. Just like any other genre really. People absorb their culture through osmosis and said culture has bigoted roots.

I'd argue that rat fic is more "woke" in some issues (depending on the author), but I've also noticed a definitive blind spot in some "softer" fields like sociology or psychology.

If I had to pick some concrete examples I disliked, it would be Hermione's treatment in HPMOR and (minor spoiler) the gay jokes in Mother of Learning. I've yet to find a rat fic written by a queer author. It feels like hunting a rainbow coloured unicorn on the 29th February.

If anyone has any LGBT/queer rat fics to recommend to me, please do so!
