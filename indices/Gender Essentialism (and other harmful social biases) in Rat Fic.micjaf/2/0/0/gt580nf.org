I think this is probably where I run up against my own lines and veils when engaging with fiction/fantasy: I'm comfortable engaging with fiction where there is bigotry and injustice directed towards fantasy minority groups, which allows authors to explore the concept (and response by injured parties and allies), but fiction which depicts bigotry or socially motivated disrespect that's focused on underrepresented group aspects (treating women badly if they're of a lower social class, sexual violence against disadvantaged populations or the vulnerable, ect.) of real underrepresented populations gets uncomfortable for me, in part because I worry about what the author is saying/normalizing (again, like With This Ring, or Joss Whedon depicting sexual violence on DollHouse while crossing lines behind the scenes with coworkers).

I'm explicitly not making on judgment on Pith regarding this, this is my own comfort.
