The world building flaws are not due to writers, but the original manga by Yoshihiro Togashi, and in fact this is a flaw shared by his earlier hit Yu Yu Hakusho (also a good watch). I think he just likes to plow forward and retcon things as he goes along. Also worth noting that if you enjoyed the anime, HxH is still continuing as a manga, albeit extremely slowly.

If you're looking for fiction similar to HxH, I'd heavily recommend The Zombie Knight Saga. It even has the bizarre early world building and lengthy hiatuses of the original!
