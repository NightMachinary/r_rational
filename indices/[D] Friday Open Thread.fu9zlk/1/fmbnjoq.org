I see posts asking about rational anime from time to time, and I'd like to propose one that I haven't seen mentioned here before: */Hunter x Hunter/* (2011)

There are a lot of things to like about it: the challenges tend to be resolved rationally, whether by fighting or avoiding a fight. The learning curve is especially well portrayed, and the MC shows intelligent goal-setting. The magic system is (mostly) consisent and characters have believable and consistent motivations. Some of the scenes are so brilliant they will bring a tear to your eye! I always cry during the 3rd ep when Gon understands the true meaning of the impossible question the team is asked. So rationally beautiful!

There are a few problems with it though, especially WRT the worldbuilding. I don't want to go into detail and influence what you don't like, but some of the macro-scale stuff doesn't hold up to scrutiny. The show was written serially so as the writers came up with more fleshed-out ideas in later seasons, it was too late to go back and change details about what happened earlier. /Most/ of the flaws can be wallpapered over with some slignt headcanon changes IMO, and imagining those changes doesn't bother me, considering hoe great the good parts are.

If you don't mind overlooking a little bit of bad for a whole lot of good, I recommend watching! (I'll note that the series gets good on episode 2, I feel the first episode is childish and dumb. So don't worry if you don't like the first one, the series gets good fast from that point).
