While its totally true that carrying a weapon will make you far more likely to win in a fight, note that having a gun (and presumably other weapons) on you will also make you more likely to die or be severely injured in said fight due to it escalating the conflict and changing how you react to the situation.

Presumably your win scenario is not dying (as opposed to not getting robbed or beaten up or whatever), so carrying a weapon in most circumstances in the modern world is actually a bad idea.
