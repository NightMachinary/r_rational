I'm very confused as to how some media is reporting so incredibly positive results on hyrdochloroquine, and some is reporting nothing. I read over the slatestarcodex reviews of published studies, which seemed somewhat inconclusive.

Does anyone know what the rational-sphere is thinking about the drug right now? Are people just not talking about it because we're waiting to see the official studies?

(I'd prefer comments to stay away from culture war arguments of what mainstream media is reporting what)
