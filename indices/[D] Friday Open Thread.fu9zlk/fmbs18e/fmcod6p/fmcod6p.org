I don't have a lot of info but avoid tranquilizers and being knocked out.

Applying tranquilizers is an entire job irl (anesthetist) and even when all of modern tech sometimes people die. Real life tranquilizers also tend to be pretty slow acting, so sleep darts aren't going to work.

Knockouts are similar. Being knocked out is a big deal -- your brain is being shocked so hard it shuts down. Clobbering someone over the head will probably just kill them, or leave them with long term injuries.
