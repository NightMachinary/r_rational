It really does depend on willpower, kind of. There are instances of people through adrenaline simply soldiering life threatening injuries. However most people don't handle pain all that well.

If you want realistic combat, than start off by making it short. The fight ends when the hero gets punched in the jaw sending him reeling. His broken leg leaves him paralyzed with pain. A limb doesn't even have to be broken to be unusable if it's damaged or hurt in a way in that makes it too painful to use. A punch to gut leaves him heaving.

Broken limbs, depending on how they're injured might never heal the same way either. It really does depend on a whole host of circumstances. Some people have had arms torn off by machinery only to get it reattached with relative ease. Others have had had broken bones or torn muscles that leave their limbs permanently weaker. Career ending injuries are a thing for a reason.

Getting knocked unconscious is generally speaking a pretty serious deal, mainly because it requires that you be hit so hard that your brain gets rattled and short circuits. Knocking someone unconscious is never a good idea mainly because there's a decent chance they'll never wake up again. Even if they do, they might have some form of permanent damage. I would suggest looking up the symptoms of cumulative brain damage experienced by boxers as a good example. The same logic applies to anesthetic and other drugs. Add too little and they might not feel anything, add just a little more and you've killed them.

For sources, there are plenty of real life stories involving people who have been through grievous injuries and lived. This includes any health problems they might have.
