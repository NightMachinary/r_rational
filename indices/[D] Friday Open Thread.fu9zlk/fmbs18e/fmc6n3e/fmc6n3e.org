Here are some things I've learnt: - If one party has a weapon and the other doesn't, the first party will more likely win. - If one person weighs more, that person will most likely win, even if they are grossly out of shape. - There is nothing stopping you from carrying a Jo ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C5%8D]]) around in your daily life, except social acceptability, and you can just spend the weirdness points. - Training in martial arts is often bullshit, but actual masters do know something. - If one person doesn't do exercise, they will run out of breath pretty quickly. - You can increase your resistance to pain. - Pinnings are a thing. - Learning to fall is often one of the first things you learn.

Lastly: - If you want to kill someone, you stab them while they're sleeping, or in a sneak attack, rather than beating them in a duel with your superior skill. - Corollary: If someone challenges to a duel, you run, and stab them in their sleep another day. Or, in general, running is often a good idea.

And another thing... If such fights are expected to happen relatively often, how does the shape of your society look like, and why? - Are there deterrents? Maybe strong kin networks that discourage this kind of thing? Clans? Police? - Why doesn't your protagonist just submit/admit defeat? - The cost of killing someone, or making an enemy, is often relatively high. Why is that the best thing your competent antagonist can do with their time? - Why aren't people killed in their sleep? / Why don't main characters live in bunkers / why don't they surround themselves with praetorian guards? - Is there poison, or gases which can knock people out?
