The way that *Worm* (Wildbow) deals with this, is that while villains are greedy and amoral, most of them don't actually want to kill people. The Travellers, for example, are villains because they allied with the only person who agreed to help them achieve the nearly-impossible. They frequently get in tussles with heroes, and many of them have highly deadly powers. They typically find creative ways to use the powers to block off their opponents' options, rather than directly attacking.
