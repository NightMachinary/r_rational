If you want to get a feel yourself I recommend watching MMA and reading memoirs of combat medics/doctor's. You can also find live combat footage online, but they are very intense. You could also take a emergency responder course to cover the medical side.

TLDR: The human body can temporarily tolerate incredibly bad changes, but freak accidents happen all the time. Combat generally lasts much longer than people think but the break points/action happens very quickly. People also value their lives much more than the public would expect.

1.  People appear to suffer brain damage from any moderate impact to the head (pro football players show signs of damage from headers for example). Most knock outs come from dramatic impacts that move the whole head, either from sheer impact or the angle of force. People "lightly" knocked out, from boxer vs boxer punches for example, will have a altered mental state after waking up but they recover* over days/weeks. Headaches, fatigue, and mood swings throughout. More severe knock outs could be anything from just worse symptoms or symptoms that never go away to stroke-like effects. All non-technical knock outs are due to a concussion being bad enough to effectively require your brain to reboot, if it can. Blood chokes <2min generally don't cause permanent brain damage, past that effects get very bad fast. People either wake up from knock outs relatively quickly or not at all (without treatment). Avoid using long term unconsciousness outside of magic, a knockout then coming to in cuffs is the edge of realism.

2.  Some people can tolerate crazy things on broken bones, adrenaline+shock is a hell of a drug. That being said structural damage is structural damage, you just can't run with a fully broken femur since the bone won't hold. Broken bones are extremely painful outside of the short term though, soldiers won't fight with broken ribs after things calm down for example.

3.  Limbs are unusable if they can't handle forces transfered through them, such as a broken arm bone unable to support picking up a weight, if their muscles or attachments can't create or transfer enough force, or if usage causes intolerable pain.

4.  Google it but I don't think people really splatter. The impact concusses them hard enough to kill or breaks their neck in a lethal way. Or they break a bunch of bones, typically become paralyzed, and have a lot of internal bleeding. A lot of bridge jumpers die from internal bleeding/drowning. From suicide attempt accounts there's always panic on the way down.

5.  A heavy impact out of the blue, you suddenly realize you are hit/crushed and try to deal with it. Hope the weight isn't on your chest or blocking blood flow anywhere. Crush injuries are very bad.

6.  Medically: when blood pressure starts dropping, when hypoxia is apparent. As you lose blood your body tries to pump what it has faster and at a higher pressure to compensate, when that fails you're dying fast. 10 pints of blood in a person, 1 pint loss is a blood donation, 2 is light headed but you can be ok, 3-4 you're mentally out of it can't catch your breath clammy, 5+ and you're dying. 2+ is a concern and your abilities tank.

7.  Unless it's the lungs just immediately worry about the bleeding. Other organ damage you can't do much without a surgeon and damage will either kill you slower or on the spot(brain/heart). Evisceration is incredibly nasty but still the #1 is bleeding then get a surgeon.

8.  Very dependent on the injury but it takes a long time and never gets back to 100%. Treatment, close care, released care and rehab.

9.  During focus on the situation, fixate on details, or get swept up in it. After varies a lot.

10. Varies a lot, the effects are less obviously connected to combat than people think. It's easier to think of it as several mental disorders combined. A lot more sleep disorders than people think.

11. The body can tolerate a lot until it just can't then you start dying fast. Think of it like hypothermia, your body is pretty good at resisting the cold, you're shivering and curled up, but your temperature creeps down until you hit a point. After that your thermoregulation fails, your temperature starts plummeting and you decide you need to take all your clothes off. A lot of systems are like that.

12. Short term=blood loss. Also dismemberment/maiming is very mentally scarring.

13. The coma is caused by something very bad, that needs to be fixed and you likely need a doctor to recover.

14. A lot of panic, half remembered things you were taught and "know". Thinking about what you can and can't do anything about.

15. See 14, emphasis on the limited things you can treat. Everything falling apart from the blood and need to be fast.

I personally get stuck on how fast people die in media sometimes, especially from melee weapons. People don't fight until they drop dead, and people injured enough to be disabled can hold on for a long time. After every medieval battle there has to have been a huge amount of post battle execution of enemy wounded on the field. Also general portrayals of people not valuing their life in combat.

I think if you know the real versions of these things you can work around them in fiction with magic or tweaking scenarios. Just beating someone until they surrender is a huge difference vs knocking them out for example.

Edit: I've also heard the recommendation to go play small team paintball shirtless after pulling an all nighter to get a taste of the fear, exhaustion, and skills breakdown. YMMV but it sounds both miserable and hilarious!
