Actual fights are over very quickly. Even a minor injury means you can't fight effectively, and if you got injured in the first place then you were already losing. And hand to hand combat is incredibly tiring: if somehow neither party gets injured, combatants will be too fatigued to adequately defend themselves within a couple minutes. This is why combat sports have rounds; I can tell you from first-hand experience that a minute of Tae Kwon Do sparring is about three eternities long.

Large scale combat and war is much slower, not because the actual fighting is any longer, but because you spend loads of time positioning and waiting around for the fighting to start. By all accounts this is an awful combination of incredibly boring and incredibly stressful.

If you want an in-depth understanding of the mechanics of injury and first aid, I'd recommend taking first aid courses, even working your way up to EMT training. It's something people can do in their free time, and learning it is a net benefit to society.
