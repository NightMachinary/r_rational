There's no strong evidence in support of hydroxychloroquinine for now. It may or may not have some minor benefits that could become evident with further testing in ongoing trials, but side effects and impact in overall mortality rates among COVID-19 patients receiving it will also need to be evaluated. Per Yao et al. (Mar 9 2020), "Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infection". Per McCreary & Pogue (Mar 23 2020), "...there are currently no efficacy data available for hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19...". It's worth continuing to investigate it for potential benefits, but it has been tested enough to show that it's not a miracle cure, and it would be dishonest to hype it up that way.

I would recommend at least skimming through the article by McCreary & Pogue, since it does a good job of covering all the various candidate drugs and what kind of testing has been completed or is underway. They also go into a lot more detail regarding hydroxychloroquinine if you're more interested in that drug specifically.
