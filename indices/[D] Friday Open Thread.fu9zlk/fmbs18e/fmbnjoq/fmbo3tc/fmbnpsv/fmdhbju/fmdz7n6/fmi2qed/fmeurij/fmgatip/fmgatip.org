This is the latest (and best) study that's probably being discussed:

- [[https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20040758v2][Efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in patients with COVID-19: results of a randomized clinical trial]] (March 31)

Randomized trial with 63 patients. The critique was that it's not documented at what stage each of the patients was (and controlled for...) and that 63 patients is still too small. But it shows significant effect.
