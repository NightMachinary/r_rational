So I'm looking for advice on how to write realistic combat.

You know how in regular fiction, heroes defeat the bad guys by knocking them out? Or how no matter how much the protagonist bleeds and breaks his legs, he just keeps running forward through sheer willpower? Or how the good guys can recover from any amount of damage so long as they don't die?

Yeah, I don't like that sorta stuff; I'd like to try and learn how to write realistic, messy combat in a world with super powers.

At what point does a person suffer brain damage from head trauma or getting knocked out?

How much can limbs function on broken bones?

When is a limb rendered unusable?

How do you write someone falling from high up and getting splattered on a surface?

Or getting crushed by falling debris?

At what point does blood loss become a serious concern?

What about damage to internal organs?

What's the process of recovering from mild or extreme injuries like?

How do you write someone during and after shock from being placed in a life or death situation?

What about PTSD?

How much punishment can the body take before it starts shutting down?

What about maiming and dismemberment?

Or falling into a coma, and recovering from one?

How do you write about person A trying to help person B who is injured or in critical condition and there's no one else around to help?

How do you write first aid in general?

What about physiotherapy and dealing with losing limbs?

​

What I'm saying is: how do you realistically write all the messy, gory and traumatic details of deadly combat and natural disasters that media like anime and such completely gloss over in favor of punching baddies in the face?

​

Yeah I know it's a bit morbid and all, but still.

I'd uhh... appreciate it if you guys could point me in the right direction. I'm willing to do research to improve my writing.

Just thought I'd ask here since rationality an realism seem to go hand in hand.
