Hi, developer here. It does not interface with git, but we're currently working on change logs (for a log of what changed on content, when) and data export features (in JSON and human-readable formats) as well as looking into two-way Dropbox/Drive sync for storing a copy on your own storage services. Just to clarify though, what functionality were you looking forward to getting from a git interface?

Edit: Just wanted to follow up and say data export (to a text-based outline, JSON, and CSV formats) is live and available from the dropdown in the top right of any page. :)
