Not a big fan of the layout for many of the pages, but i'll try it out.

The character page for example, should have a vertical mode or something where I can edit multiple characters or groups of people at once.

Edit:

One more critique. I understand that for many, there's a whole >2 genders in the world, but if I was to use the app, I would want to use it for fast prototyping, and so rather than a "type anything" field, consider a drop down list where I can select the standard "Male/Female" for gender, and then those that want to do things like 'genderfluid' or whatever it is, do an "add another" option, which lets people type into it and it gets added to their selected list.

Do you think that's doable?
