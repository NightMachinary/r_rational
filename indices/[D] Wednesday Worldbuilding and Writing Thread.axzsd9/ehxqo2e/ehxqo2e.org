Could someone sugest some powers for an story idea I have. I was thinking a magic sytem mainly made up of the type of powers you would find in [[/r/shittysuperpowers][r/shittysuperpowers]] would lead to an intresting world. Any power sugestions idealy need to have two attributes:

1) The power is pasive, it is something that happens to the holder of the power and not something they can decide not to use. There should be no power were it's downside can be escaped by simpley never activateing it.

2) The power needs to be situational. idealy to the detriment of every day life.

Some powers examples.

[Tiny intagablity]: This powers holder is intagable to any solid objects that can fit in a 4cm diameter sphere. This was made to avoid being shot with low calaber bullets.

[No Girls Allowed]: If this powers holder say the words "No Girls Allowed" any girls in ear shot of of that are teliported out of ear shot. The area in ear shot of the user when they said the words will atomaticly teliport any girls who try to enter to the apposite side of the area. This effect persists until the powers is activated again.

[Flint skin]: If this powers holder's skin touches human skin (incudeing there own) it produses a large amount of red hot sparks. The holder is immune to the sparks but not to the fires prodused by the sparks. This was made to start a fire.

[The sunny road]: If the holder of this power comes to the conculsion that they have made an irrevocable mistake an ilusion verson of them, that only they can see, will appear. This ilusion will be and do exatly what the user would have done if they had not made the mistake.

[Creepy carpet]: Any fabric the powers holder touches will become intelligent and can fly. The amount they can lift increasses with size but they are slower the larger they are. The intelligent fabric will love the powers holder dearly. They will also be posesive and become murderously jealous to anyone they consider a 'love rivel'. This mostly means other sentient fabrics but can also aply to other humans.

[Alarm stop]: When sleeping or trying to sleep a milimenter deep field that blocks all sound will be created around the holder of this power at skin level.
