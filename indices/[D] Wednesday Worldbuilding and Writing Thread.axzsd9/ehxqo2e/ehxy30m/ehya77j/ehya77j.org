[Skinbreather]: The holder of this power, instead of breathing through their mouth or nose, does so through their skin. However, if any part of their skin is covered, they will feel discomfort in that spot, as if someone had put a wet cloth over their face - but only in that area. Only a small part needs to be uncovered to breathe properly, however.

[Homeostasis]: The holder of this power has an endocrine and circulatory system that is always at human norm if possible. This means that chemical changes will only occur if that is what the average human at their age and gender has at that moment. No adrenaline, perfectly normal puberty, can't feel the chemical facets of emotions. They are resistant against attacks by poisons or hormones, but can only feel intellectual stimulation - and even then, it's not necessarily enjoyable.

[Fifth step]: The holder of this power can only take steps in groups of five. These can be as large or as small as they want, but their must be five in a row. When locked into stepping, they cannot be bodily hijacked or prevented from stepping in any manner - they will blast through solid concrete if it is the only way they can take additional steps. If their is a concrete wall on only one side, however, they will just turn around to take the next step.

[Scorpion's tail]: The holder of this power can vomit scorpions under their control at will, and will also do so if they would vomit normally. They can only have one scorpion living at a time; any additional ones will arrive dead on being vomited up.

[Target Practice]: Everyone will feel minor annoyance towards the holder of this power, but they can't feel anything worse either. Generally gets along without making enemies and hopes he isn't spit on by some random guy on the street. He tries to be nice.
