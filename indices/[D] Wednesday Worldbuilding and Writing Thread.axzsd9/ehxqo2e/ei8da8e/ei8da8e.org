[Personal force field]: At all times, the holder is surrounded by a force field that blocks solid objects from coming closer than 1 cm from their skin, including the ground and clothing. Forces exerted upon any point on the force field are evenly distributed upon the holder's body, and angular momentum is evenly applied to the holders' body when those forces are offset from the holders' center of mass. Good luck with the body paint in lieu of clothing, the liquid diet, and the complete loss of any usefulness for fine-motor skills.

[Future sight]: At all times, the holder sees the future as it will be 10 seconds from now. The holder cannot see the present. Other senses (touch, hearing, smell, taste, proprioception, etc.) are unaffected. Basically blindness with a perk.

[Obvious telepathy]: The inner monologue of anyone within 1,000 ft. is reproduced as an audible sound coming from 5 cm behind your head. Other people can hear the sounds, and your own thoughts are broadcast as well.
