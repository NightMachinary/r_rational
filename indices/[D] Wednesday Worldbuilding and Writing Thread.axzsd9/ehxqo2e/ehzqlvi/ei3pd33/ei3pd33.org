Do the two consuls repeat? It doesn't sound like it, and if so, you could say the posting is actually a punishment. "Do well as consul and your prison sentence will be reduced by twenty years." or "Consuls get their exile from the Core Worlds lifted."

In Boatmurdered, the conceit they used was that no-one actually wanted to be in charge of the place, because it was a terrifying nightmare, so they were always conspiring to find a replacement. However, the place was remote and they couldn't just conscript a local, and that made for enough time between rulers to build up a story.
