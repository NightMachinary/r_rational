Writing skills question:

it's easy to say "... six months later ...", but it's difficult to make the reader /feel/ that time has passed in a story. Does anyone have thoughts of how to get the reader to feel a great deal of time passing, without having to write, say, six months' worth of content?

My current thought is to do a "time passing montage", kind of similar to how an old Disney movie might show the pages of a calendar falling off while the trees outside turn orange, lose their leaves, get covered with snow, grow new leaves, and bloom, and then fruit grows. But with text it would take a lot longer to communicate something like that which can be put across in like 30 seconds on a screen.
