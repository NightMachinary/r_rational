I'm working on a new story based on the idea of transplanting the idea of Succession Games with games like Civilization or more specifically in a Masters of Orion-type of game, but I'm cutting away the explicit game-ness, although the space mechanics and combat will be much more game inspired but a bit hidden.

A Succession Game is where 2 or more people take turns, playing the save game for some defined amount of time, and then passing control on to the next player. The whole fun of it is seeing what the other people have done with the save, how their style is different and so on.

In Roman history, 2 Consuls were elected to serve for a year, alternating month by month, who was in control. So I decided to do a Roman space power, with the two Consuls serving for 5 years each cycle before going into Hibernation / flash-frozen.

The main character will be the second consul who wakes up after the first consul has established their first space yards, colonies and ships, etc.

I've decided to put a lot of focus on the idea of the hibernation, presuming that at some point in history a large amount of the population were placed in suspended animation, and the scientists who freeze and unfreeze people are part of a power block that can counter-act the consuls to some extend, and limit their ability to serve beyond their 5 year turn.

I'm still playing around with the ideas, and where the conflict will come from. My characterization ideas are based on a succession game I played in Space Empires 4 with one other person. I always loved the idea of building out these durable defenses on each planet, and really focusing on small unit buildouts with infantry and mechanized troops, weapon platforms, mines, satellites and fighters defending local colonies.

The optimal way to play Space Empires 4 was always to mostly ignore that stuff (except perhaps mines) and build large ships, so I'd like to build a setting that allows for both, or somewhere in the middle. The character I played in this semi-roleplayed succession game was very militaristic and focused on Esprit de corps and elite units, so I want to contrast those characteristics in the MC with the other Consul being mainly a ships and colonies focused person who goes to the other extreme.

I've established a lot of ideas around the Roman themeing in the process of planning and plotting out the first few chapters.

I've already been reading about the three lines of the Roman legions which I want to incorporate, and I'm working on writing thematically appropriate ship names and people's names for the setting but there's a lot more work to do, and I need to justify why the "Succession" rule (of alternating 5 year terms) wouldn't just fall apart.
