[Spellcheck]: the user can cast magic spells, but the spells xan only be composed of words that are commonly confused due to homonym, homoglyph, or AutoCorrect. Changes to those forms of perception in turn change the availability of spell words. For example, =they're there= could be an effective teleport spell, but only for enbies or groups of people. =i speed= would make something's speed imaginary; =I speed= would accelerate the user, =eye speed= would enhance visual perception, but if a more-intelligient autocorrect rule were enacted, the use of =i= and =I= would go away because the confusion diminished, and that moght take out =eye= as well.
