Just life-ending events. It makes all damage less likely insofar as all damage makes death likelier, but he still /can/ be damaged as long as it doesn't kill him.

And yeah, an increasingly improbable series of events would save him if he tried to kill himself - unfortunately for him, I think one of the simplest ways to resolve this would be for the attempt to fail but disable him badly enough that he can't try again.
