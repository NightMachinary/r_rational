I don't understand the lucky strike one. Does the power prevent ALL damage, or just life ending events? Could a guy tie off his leg with a tourniquet and saw it off? If he got in the car wreck would he come away unscathed or would he accrue any injuries that aren't actually going to kill him?

What would happen if he tried to kill himself? An increasingly improbable series of events that would save him, and eventually put him in too much pain to continue trying?
