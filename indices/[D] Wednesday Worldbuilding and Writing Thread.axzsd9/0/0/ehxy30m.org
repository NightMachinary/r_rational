[Forced hijack]: At all times, the holder of this power pilots both their own body and the next-closest human body. This power does not come with any sort of multi-tasking ability, so it's easy to use in a clumsy fashion, or to fail to keep track of what's happening to both bodies. Whoever the power applies to is effectively locked in while being controlled - the power holder is not getting any input from them on what to do.

[Self taunt]: The holder of this power has a mind-reading ability, allowing them to hear the inner monologues of people around them! However, they only get to hear negative thoughts about themselves, and if someone /isn't/ mentally criticizing/insulting them, the power will just /make up/ plausible negative thoughts as filler. Basically, mind-reading, but warped and embellished to make the power holder think everyone hates them.

[Lucky strike]: The holder of this power warps probability, making it impossible for them to die - circumstances will always contrive to prevent it. However, the power-holder feels constant pain proportional to the probability of death the power is acting to avoid - so, for example, they'd survive getting into a bad car accident, but it'd be excruciatingly painful even if they weren't actually injured at all, because they /almost/ died so much and the power did a lot of work to avert that. As the power-holder gets older, they will inevitably wind up in increasingly poor health, immobile and in unimaginable pain because they should be dropping over dead every moment.

[Laser show]: "Freckles" drift aimlessly around the power-holder's skin, each moving at a speed of about an inch every few minutes. These "freckles" constantly produce lasers pointed outwards at the surrounding environment. These aren't sci-fi laser weapons - they're simple laser pointers, with invisible beams (outside of fog, anyway) that produce visible colored dots on the surfaces of walls, objects, etc. Just like these simple lasers, though, they are capable of blinding people if pointed in their eyes, so they do have /some/ use as a weapon. The power holder is thankfully immune to this.

[Psychic scream]: Any sound the holder of this power produces will be heard at an uncomfortably loud volume by everyone in a radius of several miles. This includes speech, but also things like snoring, sneezing, coughing, footsteps, /eating/...
