They repeat. Obviously not forever.

One of the Consuls is connected with the Senate and powerful families, and one (the MC) is connected with the Temple of Juno. I've got a lot of backstory involving Temple warrior traditions. I've had a character idea in my head for years that I'm fleshing out for this story.

I originally was going to just write it, but I decided to play it out with different styles for the two Consuls with Space Empires IV Proportions mods which makes colonial development realistic, as it takes a long time to develop a colony, and you can either make it a less effective colony with basic mining facilities, or go the slow way and build cities and such.

Proportions AI isn't any good, so I'm playing the other spacefarers as well. I'm still in Consul Seleucus' first rule, focusing on building bigger ships and getting the first colonies established.

I'm making all my alien spacefarers more complex than just Alien omnicidal maniacs. I've got a hyper-religious society, a very anti-social loner / isolated society and a more peaceful society.
