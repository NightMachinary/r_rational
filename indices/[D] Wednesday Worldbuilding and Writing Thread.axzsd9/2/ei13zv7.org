So for a creative writing class, I recently wrote a short story where in a semi-postapocalyptic United States where technology is failing and getting replaced by magic, the preferred mode of transportation, at least, for postal workers delivering packages, are enchanted mech suits/combat exoskeletons that jump from place to place by processes I explained only tangentially (something something springs, something something flywheels, something something magic-momentum converter.) The magic in these suits also handles the other inconveniences caused by bouncing through the air at speeds faster than a locomotive, such as getting killed by the acceleration or the windchill.

Now, obviously, this idea is totally ridiculous, and I'm not going to bother trying to explain why the government doesn't use this tech to make superior forms of land transportation. However, I do at least want it to be plausible that this is the "least bad" form of non-riverine transportation. I've included the following setting details:

-- Staying on a road too long gets you eaten by "land sharks". -- Flying is impossible. (I don't bother explaining this, except with something about shape-shifting clouds).

Are there any other details I should include in revisions to make it seem plausible that literally every other mode of overland transport is somehow worse?
