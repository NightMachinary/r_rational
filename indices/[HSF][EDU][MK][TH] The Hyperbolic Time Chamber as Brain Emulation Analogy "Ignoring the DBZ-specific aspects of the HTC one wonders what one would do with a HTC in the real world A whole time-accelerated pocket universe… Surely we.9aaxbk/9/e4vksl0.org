Why is software development considered zero sum here? If the Android developers spent a day there writing bug fixes, then Android users will have a smoother experience for one year, compared to the normal schedule.

And not only bug fixes, but I can think of a lot of software development tasks that can be done more or less in isolation, specially design ones. Imagine a new programming language, database engine, or file system developed in six real-time months by baton-passing developers using the HTC.

I would happily eat dehydrated food and live in isolation for a year to make this happen.
