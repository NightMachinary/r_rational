They do set up a senzu bean farm in the Dragonball Multiverse U16 fanfiction. However they don't do that in the HTC because they need many more; they just grab a whole uninhabited planet and cultivate it. It's a necessity because in that universe Vegitto is permanently fused and senzu beans are the only thing energetic enough to keep him fed.
