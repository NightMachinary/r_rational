  There's no such thing as a HTC-within-a-HTC, so uses are limited to just that one 365x speedup - no 3652 speedups.

The article disallows it. I'm not sure specifically what a 133k times speedup would do, but I think it would mostly be of scientific interest rather than industrial, since almost nothing would continue working for that long without repair.

Actually, neutralizing nuclear waste would be really useful. Stick anything in, wait a couple months, and it's no longer radioactive.
