Well, we could speed up computation. Dump in there all the world's supercomputing clusters, we get a 365 times speed-up factor on everything we do, we can finally crack really hard problems that are currently unfeasible. Putting humans in it is a double edged sword (who wants to take one year off their lives like that? Also, the 10x G doesn't help).

Lots of other processes that have a natural speed could benefit from the acceleration, like organ and tissue growing, in theory. Though again, the 10x G must be factored in there. If you can grow food in it, you've just solved every food problem for a very long time. And you /should/ be able to grow food in it - at worst, you can run cloned meat labs and mycoprotein reactors. Not sure whether that white, pale light is good enough for crops...

It seems very vast, it's not inhabited, and time flows quickly - perfect place to just dump your nuclear waste! What would have taken 300 years to decay now takes one. And anyway it's stocked in a separate dimension. Problem solved forever.

I keep trying to think of energy applications, like a perpetual motion machine, but I'm afraid that can't be hacked out of it. It could perhaps if you could keep the door open and operate something within the time speed differential, but you can't, or you'd die just stepping in, while your body's half in half out - the time differential activates when you close the door. So that's just not a good avenue to pursue.
