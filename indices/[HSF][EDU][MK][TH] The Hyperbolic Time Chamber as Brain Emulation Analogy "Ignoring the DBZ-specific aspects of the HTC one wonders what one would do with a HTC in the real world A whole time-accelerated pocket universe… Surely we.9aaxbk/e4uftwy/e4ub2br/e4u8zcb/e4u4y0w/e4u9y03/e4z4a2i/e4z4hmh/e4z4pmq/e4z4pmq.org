Depends, you still have to buy the servers, install them inside the HTC, set up the connections, and that's not even considering the detail that really kills the idea, namely, the need for an internet connection (can't keep the door open and also get the speed up). There's gotta be better money-making schemes to carry out with a dilated time pocket dimension.
