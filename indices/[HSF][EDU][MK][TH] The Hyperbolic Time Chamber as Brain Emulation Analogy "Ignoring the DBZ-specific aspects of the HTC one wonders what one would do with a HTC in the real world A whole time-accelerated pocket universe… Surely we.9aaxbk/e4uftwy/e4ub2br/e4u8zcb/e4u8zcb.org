The Haber process for nitrogen fixation is very slow when not done at high pressures and temperatures. If a device could be made to perform a high efficiency, low speed Haber process without human intervention, fertilizer and other nitrogen dependent products could be cheaper. I don't know how it would be powered, but I'm sure something could be arranged. It doesn't really matter if the machine can't run for the full year; it just needs to make enough to justify the cost of the machine regardless of wasted time.

You could probably grow some really cool crystals that would take impractically long times IRL, but I doubt this would be particularly valuable.

Maybe you could bioengineer microorganisms to eat plastics if you put a bunch of plastic in there as a potential source of food. Kind of doubt it though.

Maybe test how corrosion resistant certain alloys or paints make a material? Seems a bit niche.
