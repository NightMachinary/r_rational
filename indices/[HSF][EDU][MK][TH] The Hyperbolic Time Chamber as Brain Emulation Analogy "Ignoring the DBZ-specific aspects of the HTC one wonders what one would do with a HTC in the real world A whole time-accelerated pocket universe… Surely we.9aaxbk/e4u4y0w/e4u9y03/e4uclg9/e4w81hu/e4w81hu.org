As far as I know, this is not necessarily true for Bitcoin. In current practice, yes, miners need an active internet connection, because the guy next to them might solve for a block and it would normally be in their best interest to solve on top of that new block instead of 'continuing' on their own. (And they only know about that solved block from their internet connection.)

The solving part doesn't require an internet connection, just an up to date blockchain and some pending transactions. The propagating part is the internet part. Since we can safely assume that the time chamber solves first, there's no issue as long as they can pop open the door every couple of minutes to communicate with the rest of the world.

Blocks take an average of 10 minutes (real world time?) independent of total computational power in the mining pool. So for starters that 'real-world time?' bit is going to have to be addressed. Also whether or not there are multiple time chambers... Honestly, at this point in a rational world, someone smarter than me would probably come along with an Altcoin to account for these problems. But Bitcoin's system, as is, could function inside a time chamber; it could functionally be the same as a massive increase in hash rate... that involves opening a door every couple of minutes.

EDIT: Was it a DBZ rule that the chamber only opens once a day real world time? If the door can't be opened as frequently as the avaerage block publication rate, then it's useless for Bitcoin. And thank god for that, a hash rate arms race is not a good use of the world's resources.
