  Was it a DBZ rule that the chamber only opens once a day real world time?

I don't remember anything like that. When Goten and Trunks go in to train before fighting Majin Bu, the door is re-opened one hour later. The rule was that a single human can't spend more than 48 real time hours inside. It was violated later anyway, so we can probably just ignore it.
