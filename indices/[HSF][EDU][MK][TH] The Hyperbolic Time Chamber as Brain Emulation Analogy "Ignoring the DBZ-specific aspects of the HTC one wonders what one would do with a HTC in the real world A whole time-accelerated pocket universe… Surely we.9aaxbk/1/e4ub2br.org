Startups are going to love this. Also hate this. It allows them to trade effort that large companies won't be able to spare (because most employees won't sit in a box for a year) for time-to-market, and helps devoted newcomers displace incumbents.

I expect automated manufacturing will be all over this. Some expensive processes should become a lot more effective, since it makes small-scale production much faster. It requires a lot of space, though.

The major targets might be mostly related to ramp-up time. It's much easier to make one machine, or train one person, and then speed them up 365x, than to make 365 machines or train 365 people.

Still thinking, though. I suspect this would change a lot, but it's not clear where the lowest hanging fruit is.
