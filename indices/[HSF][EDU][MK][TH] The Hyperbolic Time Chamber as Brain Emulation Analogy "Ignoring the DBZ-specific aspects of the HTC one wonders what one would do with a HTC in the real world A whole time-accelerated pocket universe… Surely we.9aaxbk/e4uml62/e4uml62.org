I dunno what I'd use the article's hyperbolic time chamber for besides aging food, but the canon one can be exited at will (Goten and Trunks pre buu fight, Kid Goku taking a month and then leaving, iirc vegeta blew something critical up and had to leave early once). As such, it'd be a lot more useful for time critical tasks; need to get a response to an event? Have your pr people spend a week inside perfecting a speech, then have it ready to go within 10 minutes. Want to finish touching up a project or prototype before a deadline? Need to get your patch working before customers start seriously complaining?

I think the article crippled itself by adding that kinda arbitrary restriction on.
