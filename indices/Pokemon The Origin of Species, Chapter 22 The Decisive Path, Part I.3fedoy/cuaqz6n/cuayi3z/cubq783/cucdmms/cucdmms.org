So there actually aren't "ghost minds" per se: people with an affinity for ghosts are psychic, but they often have a different philosophy or practice concerning their powers.

As for the interactions between psychic and dark minds and other types, that's treating all type interactions as substantive. The truth is more complex: many type interactions are just the result of different emergent properties when pokemon of different types interact. This will be exlained more in upcoming chapters :)
