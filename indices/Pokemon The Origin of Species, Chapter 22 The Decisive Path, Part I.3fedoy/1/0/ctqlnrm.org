Agreed: the idea of just making it a game of survival against an unstoppable force was brilliant, and I have no intention of trying to one-up that, partly because I'm not sure I can :)

But additionally, it just doesnt fit the world I've built, where pokemon killing and eating eachother during an official match would be considered wasteful and bad form, not to mention poor control, on the Leader's part. In GoC Gym battles are far more about the spectacle and glory of the blood sport, while in mine they're about testing, training, and identifying competence, so that more people are prepared against the threat of wild pokemon.

All that said, I hope to make it as exciting and tense and all that good stuff as possible!
