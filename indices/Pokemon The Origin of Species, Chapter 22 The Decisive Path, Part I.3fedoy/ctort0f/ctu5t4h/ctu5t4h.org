Makes sense of the experience in the games, where a kid who's barely started can "beat" a gym full of experienced trainers, up to and including the local Leader.

If they're really just testing for competence before awarding a badge then having them holding back from full strength, and using lower levelled pokemon than their 'personal' team, allows for a victory that doesn't break any suspension of disbelief.
