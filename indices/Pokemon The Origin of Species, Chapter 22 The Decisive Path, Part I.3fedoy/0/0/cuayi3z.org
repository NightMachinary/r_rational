Hey, thanks for posting! I often wonder how many people go through the story wanting to write reviews for each chapter and deciding against it because it's "old" already, but for me at least the feedback is as valuable as ever :)

  I'd be happy with you slowing this down (not the frequency of updates but the speed of time passing in-universe) and dragging it out and elaborating on tiny details and offshoots of stories and keeping this work going indefinitely. I really, really enjoy it and want to keep reading it for as long as possible.
#+end_quote

The ideal is to try to be as concise as possible while still including everything I think is interesting or entertaining, but striking the right balance can be hard and I definitely tend toward "more is more" rather than "less is more." If I do err on the wrong side of the tracks though, glad to hear that at least some people don't mind the length!

  My current big question is whether Dark trainers are weak to Fighting Pokemon in any respect or if the similarity to Pokemon strength/weaknesses is relegated to the interaction between these three specific types.
#+end_quote

The problem with testing this hypothesis is that fighting pokemon tend to be /really/ strong relative to a human, so judging the effect of getting hit by one is kind of hard when all the results will tend toward extreme damage. If you want Word of God on the topic though, I'm tending toward "yes" right now.

  I don't know how long this is going to be feasible for, but I enjoy being able to keep track of everyone's Pokemon inventory.
#+end_quote

It's struggle, to be sure. I don't know if it's fair to expect readers to have a list of character inventory, both pokemon and items, kept out of the story so they're constantly aware of what tools they have at their disposal, but for now I intend to try to keep detailing it out.

  Leaf lying about the hootowl didn't fit my internal model of her at all. Even after later finding out about how she made this right (which did fit my internal model of her and was very nice) it struck me as odd how she handled it. I feel like she should have known that Red could handle the news, given that there were vastly more important things happening at the time.
#+end_quote

It's one of those things that took me by surprise too. I was writing the chapter out as if she would tell him, and when the time came felt her balk in my mind at it. I was like "Really? You don't want to tell him?" and her response was a very clear no, out of a mix of sadness and shame. I don't pretend to completely understand my characters all the time, but since writers tend to err toward too-perfect characters, when mine reveal a flaw I tend to let them show it.

  Are large Pokemon really rare enough that not splurging for at least one Great Ball per person makes sense?
#+end_quote

Relatively speaking, yes: most pokemon found in the wild have less mass than a full grown adult, which is roughly where the greatball becomes necessary. And of those that are bigger than a pokeball can handle, a great many of them are too big for even a greatball to handle (an onix, for example). Unusual events aside, most people don't consider greatballs an integral part of a starting trainer's kit.

  I like how Blue is so blinded by confidence that he believes himself to be exhibiting patience while also consciously deciding against going to a Poke center to give his Pokemon a rest. I was supposed to notice this cognitive dissonance, correct?
#+end_quote

Absolutely, and you're one of the few commenting that did :) It's hard not to be too obvious about how unreliable a narrator Blue is when he's so overconfident and cocky.

Thanks for reading, I'm glad you're enjoying it so far!
