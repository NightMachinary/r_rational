Yay, another update! Looking forward to part two!

Here are some typos I noticed:

- its doors slid open automatically -> slide
- He wants to preserve Squirtle's water as long as possible, and generally helps them avoid getting tired out. -> help
- (shut up Red, no one cares if it's "not an 'actual' allergy) -> missing closing quotation marks
- it releases a toxic sheen spores to kill them off -> maybe "a toxic sheen of spores"
- and the plat pokemon stares back -> plat?
- vines still stretched below the much overturned and pilfered through soil.. -> add or remove a period
- Her pokemon tries , -> remove the space before the comma, or maybe you were going to add a few more words?
