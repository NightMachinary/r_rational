Hey all, welcome back! Sorry for the late update! Started a new job this month and been super busy. On top of that, the chapter just kept growing as I wrote it, until I had to split it into two parts. It's kind of rough, so expect some major edits soon.

Another question that I've gotten a number of times and won't be able to address in the narrative: Biologically, people in general in the pokemon world are smarter and more mature, due to much more severe selective pressures in the form of deadly wild pokemon. Even beyond that, the circumstances that force kids to "grow up" faster in some aspects, such as early trauma or loss being so much more common, coupled with the early agency of being able to commit themselves to a professional path and goals, makes it so that kids in the Pokemon world are on average more mature than that of our modern day.

That isn't to say there are no kids in our world that would act this way. I believe there could be, and keep in mind that throughout history, some countries trained their kids for war from a young age: those young children would be almost impossible to compare to those in our society of the same age in regards to temperament and maturity. On top of all that, this is a story where the main characters are exceptional in a number of ways. So even in a society where kids are on average smarter and more mature, Red, Blue and Leaf are particularly gifted as well, through a mix of nature and nurture.

Keep the feedback coming, and enjoy!
