I could post pictures of myself on the internet--or a livestream of some sort. Maybe if I was widely-viewed enough, I could steal personal information from some of my viewers.

I've got it: self-help videos for debugging things on the internet, the first piece of advice is always 'try logging out and back in', and I change my youtube profile picture to a new image of myself very often to keep resetting the time limit.
