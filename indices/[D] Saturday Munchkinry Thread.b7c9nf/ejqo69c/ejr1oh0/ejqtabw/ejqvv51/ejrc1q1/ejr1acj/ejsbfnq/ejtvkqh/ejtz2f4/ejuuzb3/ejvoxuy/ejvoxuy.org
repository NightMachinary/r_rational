That's why I keep changing my profile picture. It appears beside the video, and is less than eleven minutes old.

If the power requires a still from a video instead of a simple picture, that has some implications. If that didn't work, I'd try a GIF. If that still didn't work, I'd test the limits of deliberately induced pauses and slowdown in a live feed.
