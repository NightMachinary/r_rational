El Goonish Shive just finished a non-canon side story about a magical artifact (a set of scales) that can "rebalance" two people's physical attributes - e.g., making one taller and the other shorter, or making people bigger or smaller in... certain places. The bit with the artifact starts [[http://egscomics.com/egsnp/nanasecraft-36][here]].

The immortal who created this artifact created it mainly to have wild shapeshifting parties, but she's very worried that someone could use it for "evil stuff." How well-founded is this fear? What sort of shenanigans, evil or otherwise, can you get up to with the ability to reshape one body part at the expense of another?

Note: In El Goonish Shive, transformation magic is /extremely/ safe and can't directly hurt people - you can't crush someone by making them too tall for the room they're in, for example.
