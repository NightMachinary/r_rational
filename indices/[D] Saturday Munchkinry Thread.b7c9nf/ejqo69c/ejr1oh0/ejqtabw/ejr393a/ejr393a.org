Send out detachments in a star pattern around the army during the night and have them hide. Next time they harass the main body of your force, you have forces behind them. This should let you force a fight, rather than just being shot at from range. I mean, most of them will probably still get away, but now they cant harrass you without first checking the land over with a fine comb, so a lot less time spent shooting at you.

Next night, archers hiding in covered trenches a couple hundred yards out from the camp - idea being to be in range to shoot back. Infantry ranged is more accurate than mounted range, and they will run out of men and wargs far sooner than you will run out of archers.

Both of these rely on doing night marches, since otherwise you are just letting them pin you in place, which would be extremely bad for an army that large, but if they start harrassing you at night, that is still a win, because, well, cavalry running around in the dark is going to have casualties even if you do /nothing/ to them, and in any case, just having detachments of troops with night vision roam around will again let you force fights at ranges closer than they want. (You are the army of darkness. You do have troops with nightvision, right?)
