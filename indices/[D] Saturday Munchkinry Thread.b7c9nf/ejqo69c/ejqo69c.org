If you were reincarnated/inserted into the Naruto universe (or some closely related fanon substitute) sans plot armor or narrativium (or, indeed, the overarching canon conflict), but were motivated to become a standard ninja who'd go on standard missions, what sorts of skills and abilities would you focus on developing? What strategies would you follow to maximize your odds of survival? Let's assume civilian life is barred to you -- you're going on a diverse sample of missions in 3-person groups, damnit! Assume also that you lack any special bloodline talents and are otherwise middle of the road on all ninja-related performance metrics. This tops your potential at /maybe/ high-Chunin level, after a decade or two of diligent practice and study. You're welcome to munchkin to your heart's content, but grant fellow ninja some basic level of real-world competence, along with the implied ruthlessness of a military organization that employs child soldiers. If your plan is to steal rare techniques from dangerous people, expect to very quickly die.

My own thoughts:

I think a strategy I haven't seen used much in Naruto is a combination of short, small-scale, high-fidelity genjutsu and techniques that focus on speed. Even basic ninja can be seen to move hundreds of miles per hour over short [[https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Body_Flicker_Technique][distances]], we well as throw projectiles at comparable speeds with pinpoint accuracy. I'd try to couple these -- if I can deceive my foe for the second it takes them to realize and dispel the illusion, as well as throw a kunai some distance in that second, I could defeat most foes at my skill level without ever having to create a minutes long virtual world or giant fire dragon or whatever. If I had the attention to spare, I'd also try to work on techniques to hide my chakra signature, the better to lay in wait for such an ambush. I'd also work on my "running away" skills -- I think most ninja are by default paranoid, and so informing them of enemy interest is hardly revealing. Fleeing after a failed encounter (leaving behind only nondescript kunai) should let me live to make future attempts instead of engaging directly on a more even playing field. Obviously this wouldn't work on exceptional sensory ninja, or the ones with knife-proof skin, or whatever, but most of my enemies would also be common fodder, and sniping them from a distance seems by far the least risky and most reliable way to resolve encounters. On the off-chance that we have to engage directly, tiny illusions cast trivially could also mean the difference between a successfully blocked strike and one that hits true.
