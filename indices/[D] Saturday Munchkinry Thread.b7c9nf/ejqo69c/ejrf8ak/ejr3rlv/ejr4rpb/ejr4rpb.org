The most important thing would be learning some kind of clone technique, that lets you send your clones on missions while you never ever leave your home, whether that's a safe place in your hidden village or a hideout in the middle of nowhere that no one knows about.

Failing that, I would go for sensory and stealth skills. Sense your enemies and hide from them, while telling your heavy hitting allies where the enemies are so they can deal with them. The best way to survive is to avoid combat entirely, and your ability to sense enemies is plenty valuable enough that you will be sent on recon missions.

P.S. Am I not allowed to use my modern world knowledge that I reincarnated with? There are lots of technologies you could easily do with simple ninja techniques, even if we don't count guns and cannons. For example, if you have a fire skill, you can create hot air balloons and heat the air in the balloon with your fire skills. This will allow you to fly high above your enemies in relative safety. Not total safety since there are other flying ninja like Deidara, but those will be rare elites that you won't be likely to run into.

And if you have a lightning skill, well then, its time to have fun with electrolysis. Create large amounts of hydrogen from electrolyzing water, and you can use the hydrogen to create a massive explosion. Create large amounts of chlorine gas from electrolyzing water, and you now have a large amount of poison gas you can send at your enemies using wind skills.
