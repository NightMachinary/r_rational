This right here is what makes munchkining difficult. If we assume that they are competent, it also means that there are no flaws in the system obvious enough for a chunnin level ninja to exploit otherwise it would be in common usage.

Most notably it means that although genjutsu seems like a system comically ripe for exploit it wouldn't actually be given that we don't see normal ninjas popping up 1/10th of a second genjutsu and just instakilling their enemies in that timeframe before they can do anything about it.
