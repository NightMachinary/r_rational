To start, put a lot of effort into illusions and medical techniques, and try to learn the 8 gates since it synergises really well with medical (you can punch above your weight, and heal the damage inflicted by the technique afterwards).

You'd generally want to focus on stealth and remaining undetected, so you could ambush your enemies to steal their eyeballs (mileage may vary).

Basically I think there's a lot of knowledge a fan of the series could exploit that doesn't require them to be insanely skilled and lucky - just moderately so.
