  This tops your potential at maybe high-Chunin level, after a decade or two of diligent practice and study.

IMHO it's not that /hard/ to reach Jounin. The hard part is /living/ to reach Jounin. Count the number of ninja in the setting who are over 30. If you can survive long enough, you will inevitably learn enough to be Jounin-level dangerous (and will inevitably mature enough, compared to the average teenaged grunt, to be tossed into officer finishing school and lead a team.)

See also: actual armies in war-time. If the war goes on long enough, every enlisted /will/ eventually gain enough experience to have a good chance of getting a field commission, just on the basis of the war effort always needing more officers (because the existing ones keep dying) and the influx of academy-fresh ensigns just not being enough to satisfy that demand. You just need to not get shot.

A hypothesis that I've never seen about /Naruto/: ninjutsu are like math skills. You don't actually have to practice them when young to be good at them when you're older. In fact, it's counterproductive; you're trying to use a muscle that hasn't grown in yet (for math skills, that's "the formal operational stage of cognitive development.")

What if the key to being a great ninja, is just biding your time as a civilian who happens to have chakra, and only starting to learn Ninjutsu as an adult once your body (and so reflexes, chakra channels, etc.) and mind (and so cleverness) are higher?

In other words, what if "child soldiers" aren't any kind of /optimum/ for learning ninjutsu (only an optimum for war-time return on training investment, given clans producing R-selective amounts of children)? What if ninjutsu were much better taught at a university level?
