I.. wouldnt? The ninja system is insane. Chackra magic is super interesting, and potentially very useful, but actual ninja training comes with a major side of indoctrination which is /going to get you killed/.

So... Become a medic nin. Work your ass off, very, very carefully check everything you are taught for deliberate misinformation, plan how to fake your death and go missing nin without ending up in a splat book, now run /far, far away/.
