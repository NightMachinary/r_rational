Naruto is fundamentally a shonen setting written on a weekly basis under intense deadline pressure, where everything happens to drive the plot forward as the author desires - but with little overarching plot that was established before the story started, and instead relying on making up backstories and figuring it all out on a 'fuck it we'll do it live!" plan. The causality for almost all setting elements goes "plot requirement for this week -> required setting elements" rather than "setting elements established -> plot element that would logically arise". The setting and background make very little sense; the background numbers/demographics/math were thought out with less than, say, JK Rowling's attention to detail.

Consider the great snake escape. What the fuck is that, you might ask? Well, this comic [[https://imgur.com/vM4Uw1i][puts it into words better than I can]]. The great snake escape is basically a microcosm of the whole Naruto universe, and if you choose to keep the events of the Great Snake Escape canon you're basically going to have to make up like 10 different pieces of fanon /just to justify that one event/.
