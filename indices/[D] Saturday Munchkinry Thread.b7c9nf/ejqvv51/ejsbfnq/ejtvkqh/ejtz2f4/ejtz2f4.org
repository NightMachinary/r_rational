  How would anyone keep the video of you open while logging out and in again?
#+end_quote

I imagined them pulling it up with the window, side-by-side, or using their phone (which admittedly might leave their range of vision). Or something similar. I have multiple monitors, so I leave videos running on one.

True. It would require many opportunities. I imagine the intersection between 'multiple monitors' and 'hunt-and-peck typists' is quite small, for example.
