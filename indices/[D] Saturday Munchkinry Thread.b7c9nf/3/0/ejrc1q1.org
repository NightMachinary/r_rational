I always know who is looking at me and from how far away, and which approximate direction. This will be exceedingly useful if I ever need to sneak into someplace. (But I only know after I've already been noticed, limiting the effectiveness somewhat - unless I have a disguise or similar).

In a crowd, this also allows me to have excellent awareness of things going on around me.

In any situation that involves a security guard in a surveillance room, I can also see dozens of other screens, giving me an idea of what's going on elsewhere in the facility.

Hmmm.

...ah, I think I've found a way to use this power. I can make a habit of playing poker; the opponent will very probably look at his cards while he can see me (as long as we're playing in person), allowing me a distinct advantage.
