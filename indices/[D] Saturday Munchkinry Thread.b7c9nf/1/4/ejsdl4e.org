What happens when the target you placed a spy in dies? Do you lose your ability to place spies forever? Or can you create another?

Can you place a spy on someone, then keep trying to create new spies until it works, letting you know when your target has died? Because that's an interesting ability in itself: the ability to tell whether a certain person has died, regardless of distance or secrecy, without any need for communications that could be intercepted or jammed.

Place a spy on an enemy, and you know for certain whether he is dead and no amount of faking his own death will save him from you.

Place a spy on an actual spy of your agency, and he can kill himself on a mission to instantly and completely secretly send a message to you, based on time of death.
