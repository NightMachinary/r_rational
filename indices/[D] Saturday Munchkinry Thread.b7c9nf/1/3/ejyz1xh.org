It's a duplicate of your consciousness and you gain all its memories, and presumably doesn't sleep. At the very least, you can more than double your ability to think about problems - become a programmer or mathematician, precommit that if you're ever a spy you'll think about $problem, look into someone's eyes then go to sleep. When you look into their eyes again you have 8 hour of uninterrupted thought on the subject.
