When you make eye contact with another person, you can create a "spy", a duplicate of your consciousness which lives in their head. The spy experiences all the target's sensory data (sees what they see, hears what they hear, etc) but has no control over their body, and cannot access their thoughts or memories. Whenever you make eye contact with that person again, the spy can choose to return to you, at which point you gain all it's memories. You can only have one spy at a time. How does one best use and/or counter this power?

Bonus round: The spy can freely hop between targets, as long as they make eye contact.
