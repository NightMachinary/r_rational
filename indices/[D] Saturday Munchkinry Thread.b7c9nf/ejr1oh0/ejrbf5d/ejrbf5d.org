Become a reporter. Develop a habit of interviewing a specific type of target (e.g. politicians, CEOs, whatever). A day or two before the interview, meet in person with the interviewee to ensure that he has some idea of what will be spoken about (in the bonus round, a secretary will do as well, on the assumption that the secretary will speak with the target before the interview).

Absorb the Spy during the (in-person) interview. Use the information from the Spy to inform my choice of follow-up questions and improve my fact-finding.

Avoid people who habitually wear mirrored sunglasses.
