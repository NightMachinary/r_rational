Goal: Power.

Go into politics, using your spy to get a grasp on your biggest threats and opportunities. Become the person who already knows the party leader's biggest problem and has a solution or who is always capitalizing on opposition weakness they didn't think had leaked. Blackmail is incredibly useful for you since you can hint at what you know and they will never find the source, and you can know if they are looking for one too. The power actually gets more useful the higher you climb as you get regular access to more important people, and less people can threaten you. Also as you get higher up the chain people are getting more and more information and reminders for your spy to observe.

Eventually once you get high enough you can start using it on other countries leader's during summits and other meetings. High level leader's are being fed intel all the time and have post-public strategy meetings, so you will get huge amounts of information even over short time spans. You can use that information to subtly guide your intelligence agencies towards areas other countries are focusing on for example.

Money: Get any job at a high end hotel, a doorman ideally (daily, face to face, video alibi), spy people in town for buisness meetings. Use your insider info for stock trading or flat out steal an account and transfer the money to a "financial privacy" country like Panama. Your power makes it impossible for them to pin it to you, since most investigation depends on how they got the info, with a little prep.

Bonus round: This allows the spy to "5 degrees of separation" hop back to report to you, and allows the spy to hop deeper and deeper into organizations without your involvement. President>FBI Director>specific Investigator for example
