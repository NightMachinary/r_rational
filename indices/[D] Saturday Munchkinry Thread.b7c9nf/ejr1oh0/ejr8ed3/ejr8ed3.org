I feel that using this power is going to be very difficult. Since you can only have one spy at a time and you don't know where your host are, it is very likely that you're going to lose your spy when said target say moves or whatnot.

So with that said I would prioritize short term targets or targets that you are relatively certain that you have access to later.

Poker players or other partial competitions that have a well defined time interval with multiple cases of eye contact would be good targets. Learning someone's password by looking them into their eyes before a meeting could work. Most people at work are probably safe targets.

It also becomes easy to break in given that you can learn the internal layout of a based etc.
