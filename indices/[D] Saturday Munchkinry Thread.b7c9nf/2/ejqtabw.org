You are commander of an army of twenty thousand orcs and goblins, roughly organized, accompanied by some dozens of siege and assault trolls. Your equipment is medieval by our standards, a mixture of stone and iron weapons and primarily hide-based armor. In your train are a number of siege weapons, and many of your command are proficient with shortbows.

You command the armies of The Necromancer and are driven by his will to assault Lake-town, Dale, and Erebor. It is assumed that you will be able to complete this march in under a month, from Dol Guldur to the Long Lake. You have been marching up the River Running, pillaging, looting, and burning as you go, in an effort to provide supplies and arms for your armies.

In this march, you have been harassed by a hundred-rider company from Isengard. The riders ride wargs (somewhere between an overgrown hyena and a pursuit predator) and have functional muzzle-loading cartridge rifles. The technology for such weapons is not known outside of Isengard, and this campaign is the first time such weapons have been deployed in the field.

Your harassers are green soldiers straight from school (though you do not know that fact); your armies are seasoned warriors.

How do you defend against your harassers?
