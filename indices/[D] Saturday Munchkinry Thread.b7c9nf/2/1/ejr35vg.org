Is this based on the fanfic "Saruman of Many Devices"?

My first thought is, even if I don't know what a gun is, after being shot a few times it will be obvious that it is some kind of bow, and it won't be hard to see that there are deformed metal lumps in the injuries of wounded soldiers.

So adopt standard anti-bow tactics. First is stealth. Enemies won't shoot what they don't see, so look for tunnels, caves, forests, etc that you can hide in. Travel through them towards your destination, while sending out your stealthiest elites to act as ambush teams, skulking around in the shadows, waiting for the enemy riders to go past and then hit them in the back while their guard is down.

Second is shields. Shields stop arrows, they may stop guns too. After trying wooden shields it may become obvious that they don't work. But luckily for you, you are the commander of 20000 meat shields. Stick the useless ones on the outer perimeter, carry around their dead bodies as literal meat shields if they get killed. Orcs live in filth and gore all the time without getting sick anyway, so the possible health issues from carrying around dead bodies doesn't seem to be a major concern. Also orcs are much stronger than humans so carrying around a bunch of dead bodies all day won't be too much of a drain on their strength either.
