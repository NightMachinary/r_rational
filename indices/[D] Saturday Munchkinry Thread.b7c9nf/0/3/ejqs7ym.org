Well it's hard to know how difficult it is to learn techniques because we don't really see any avarage people learn anything. Excepting Lee but I don't think I would ever be able to put in as much effort as he did.

If my life is on the line I think I could put in enough to git gud though. So focus on training my body is a way that should make me strong enough to life my life takeing safe d and c rank mission.

Doing all the chakra control stuff as early as possible is a must.

I think abuseing the [[https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Body_Replacement_Technique][Body_Replacement_Technique]] to teleport by haveing friendlys attack me to trigger it is a neet hack.

I know the theory behind the rasengan but it wouldn't be super useful for me since I wouldn't have the chakra for it. Maybe I could trade it for something but that would be risky.

Some how useing a sumoning scroll to summon my self so if I take to much damage in a fight I will be unsommoned and telipoted back to where I first cast it.

Abuseing the crap out of storage seals is the best bet. Putting them on my shoes and taking out platforms to jump on on mid air. Storeing jars of air born posion that I have made myself imune to/ have the antidote, to pull out in combat. Putting seals on my fist and taking out massive weights as I punch. Or if the objects original momentum is conserved store pre fired projectiles in there.
