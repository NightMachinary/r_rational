I'm not sure it's far enough along yet to get a clear idea of whether I think it is rationalist fiction, but I think it's great that it is intending to be.

I'm curious: one of the key elements in time travel stories (that are rational) is what the [[https://qntm.org/models][metaphysics]] of time travel is. Works range from "everything is immutable, and fate conspires to make this work out despite the apparent existence of free will" ([[https://gist.github.com/defunkt/759182/ad44c6135d168ae54503a281bb7e1a24c6c2ea0c][eg]]) to things like "time can be changed, which is simply the actor moving to a different possible path in the multiverse" ([[http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2011/12/rudy-6-time-as-a-divergent-ser.html][eg]]). But to be honest, MOST time travel stories have a metaphysics where time travel works different ways as the plot demands it.

What is this story planning to do?
