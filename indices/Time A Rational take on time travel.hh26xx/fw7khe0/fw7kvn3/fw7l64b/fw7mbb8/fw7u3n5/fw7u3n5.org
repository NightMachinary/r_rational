Cool! If it's ok, just rewrite your post if you would. As it is, the verb tenses are passive instead of active, which leaves you out of the picture, and the whole thing reads differently if it's you who wrote vs not you. I.e., the "I /think/..." part sounds like "This author did a pretty good job doing the rational genre right!" when you're not the author, but when you are, it reads more as "I hope I'm doing the rational genre right." And "Give it a read" sounds like a recommendation of quality from an independent source when it's not the author, but when it's the author it's more like a request for indulgence.

That is to say, whether you're the author in this promotion makes a big difference in how people view your work going in, and is important to include.

Additionally, it's not a serial yet - it's just one chapter.

If it were me, I'd edit it to "Time is /the first chapter in/ a web serial /I'm writing/..." and "/I'd appreciate it if you would/ give it a read /and let me know what you think in the comments./" More upfront and more constructive and aware of your role of the author that way. But, do what you think is best - I'm just an internet rando with rando advice.
