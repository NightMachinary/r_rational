Hard to say much with only one chapter so far. There's no time stuff yet, just teenager stuff. The dating stuff is rather plain, but the asshole-dad stuff makes me sympathize with Emily.

A few comments:

- Everything is center-aligned, which isn't pleasant.
- It was weird that Emily couldn't remember which class she was in with George given she's apparently really into him.
- There were a few punctuation errors at the ending quotes. Easily the worst offender was this one with the double-period,
