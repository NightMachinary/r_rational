Yes, precisely, in the case of language usage determines what is legitimate.

That means that, unlike in the case of something that is empirically true like climate change, the consensus view of the language's rules actually determines correctness.

This means that some individual believing that the rules are something else is just plain incorrect. The majority view dictates correctness and has legitimacy because it is a consensus. The individual's rules are not equally as valid as the consensus view.

I hope this makes the idea clear to you, because I'm running out of different ways to say the same thing and it is clear you've been misunderstanding descriptivism to mean that there are no rules and everyone's ideas about grammar are equally valid when it does not remotely stand for that idea.
