In this context "better" refers to moral (i.e. normative) superiority not increased utility. It's sociolinguistic and the scienctific stance is identical to the one given for race, nationality, gender etc. In as much as those things exist (looking at you "biological race") no one is "better" based on wherever they fall among these types of characteristics.

Regarding linguistics (and ignoring the things said about language utility) what you said is mostly accurate if simplistic and not necessarily the phrasing I would use to explain it.
