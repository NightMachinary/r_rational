Yeah, it's a more logical way to do it. You treat quotes as parentheticals rather than some weird ad hoc combination of a normal sentence and a parenthetical.

Here's an example.

He said, "I wanna go to the store.".

The quote is treated as it's own thing like an interjection so you also need another period to end the sentence it's interjected into.
