You've misunderstood what that means. Do you think that because there is no English pope handing down rules of grammar from on high that every imagined way of doing things is going to be regarded as equally correct?

People don't think that way. There are dominant views of how grammar is done, and authorities catalogue those views. Diverging from them will make people conclude that you can't be bothered to learn how to communicate clearly.

This is a useful assumption, because it keeps people adhering to one set of rules and that makes clear communication possible.

So, while you can use two periods in a sentence if you want, the price is that people will assume you're making a mistake and unaware of it. If that makes you happy, then by all means, nobody will arrest you for it. But some people simply won't read your work because the author not knowing the correct rules of grammar and punctuation suggests that the quality of the rest of the work will be similarly poor.
