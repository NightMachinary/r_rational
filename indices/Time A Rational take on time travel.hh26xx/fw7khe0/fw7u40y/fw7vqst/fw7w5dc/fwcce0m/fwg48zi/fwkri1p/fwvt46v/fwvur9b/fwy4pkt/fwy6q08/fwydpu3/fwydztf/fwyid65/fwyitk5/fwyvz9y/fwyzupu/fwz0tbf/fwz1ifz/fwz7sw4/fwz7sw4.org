I'm having trouble wrapping my head around your position, here. You appear to be saying that you think the idea of there being accepted grammar rules is ignorant, implying that you believe that anybody should be able to make up whatever rules they want and they are all equally valid.

I don't think you've thought this position through. First, as a factual matter, a consensus view on what is and isn't correct exists. The fact that you don't seem to like the idea of a consensus view doesn't make everyone who participates in the consensus 'ignorant' somehow. That is snide and dismissive of most of society at best, and that isn't what ignorance means anyway. Ignorance means not knowing. Ignorance does not mean in disagreement with your personal ideas.

Second, we all benefit from there being a consensus view and from adhering to it. The purpose of language is to clearly communicate ideas. Having one set of rules is a key part of what makes that possible. When language balkanizes it gets in the way of communication. Criticize homogeneity if you like, but it has real benefits.
