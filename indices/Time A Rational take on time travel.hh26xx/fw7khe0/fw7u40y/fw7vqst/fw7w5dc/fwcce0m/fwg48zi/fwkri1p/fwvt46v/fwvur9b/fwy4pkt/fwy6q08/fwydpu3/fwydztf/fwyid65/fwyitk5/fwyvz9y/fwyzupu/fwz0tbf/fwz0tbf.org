You've got that reversed. By insisting on your own private grammar as perfectly correct and accepted when it isn't, you're the one being willfully ignorant in this situation. You are entitled to your opinion that English should have multiple full stops per sentence, but you are not entitled to your own fact that this is commonly accepted practice when it simply is not. That is self-delusion.
