I am a descriptivist if you don't know what that is or means you can look it up. Having one set of rules could be useful and is especially within technical communities wherein they usually choose their own. Consensus when it does exist merely determines what people /think/ is correct. Language is always changing and is dependent on context. There are many language communities all with different styles. I think we disagree on a philosophical level. To make an analogy you seem like you would be a person that would dismiss climate change if they did a popular vote on its existence and 95% of people thought it was made up. So much so that you wouldn't even think of asking for scientific evidence. People are ignorant of the /science/ of linguistics which says that no variety/dialect is better than any other and that usage determines what is legitimate.
