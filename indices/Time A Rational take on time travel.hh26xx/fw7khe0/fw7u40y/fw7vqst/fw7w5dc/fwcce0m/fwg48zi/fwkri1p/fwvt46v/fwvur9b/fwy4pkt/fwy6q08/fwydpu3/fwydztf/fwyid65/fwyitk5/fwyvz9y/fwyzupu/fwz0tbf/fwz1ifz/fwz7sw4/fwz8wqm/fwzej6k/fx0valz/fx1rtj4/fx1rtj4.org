Yes, however, there is no singular use case. There are many. Dialect, register, politeness level, formality, setting, background and so on. You have to understand the idea of correctness is something that only exists in prescriptive thinking. There are rules but no way to break them. If I and everyone around me call the word "carmel" there is no authority that can tell us we're wrong. There is a dictionary editor however that will happily add our version to the dictionary though.

EDIT: I'll add some resources on linguistic prescription vs description.
