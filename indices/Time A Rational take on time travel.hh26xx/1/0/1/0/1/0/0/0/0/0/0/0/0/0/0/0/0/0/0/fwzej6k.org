  People are ignorant of the science of linguistics which says that no variety/dialect is better than any other and that usage determines what is legitimate.

Isn't the "usages determines what is legitimate" a reference to (local) consensus though? If the group that is communicating has a consensus to communicate in a certain way, then that is the language/dialect that is "legitimate" at that point in time and space?

If a single member of the group picks a different way to communicate, it will be "incorrect" unless it gets enough traction to cause the consensus drift to include it.

A variety/dialect can be better than another, within the scope "to clearly communicate with a certain group at a certain point in time". Like any task, the right tool for the job is better than the wrong tool.
