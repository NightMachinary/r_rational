First off, I don't use that grammar. It makes more sense but I use the version I studied years ago. I never said it was common practice merely that I thought it was common in some dialects/language communities. And I certainly never said it was accepted. There are entire dialects which aren't accepted (e.g. African-American Vernacular English). And, indeed, most non-prestige dialects are /not/ accepted. I, normatively, and in accordance with science reject such non-acceptance as the ignorance it is. On this topic I am not delusional though I may be mistaken on the object-level that negates none of the general things I have stated.
