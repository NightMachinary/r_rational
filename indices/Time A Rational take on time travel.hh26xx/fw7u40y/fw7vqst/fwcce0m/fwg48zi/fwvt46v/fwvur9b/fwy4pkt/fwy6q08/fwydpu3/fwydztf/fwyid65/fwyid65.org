If that is what you think then you really didn't exercise sufficient care in reading.

"...there is no English pope handing down rules of grammar from on high..."\\
"There are dominant views of how grammar is done, and authorities catalogue those views."

Do those statements sound more like prescriptivism to you, or a rejection of it?

The absence of prescriptivism does not mean that there is no such thing as correct or incorrect usage. There absolutely is a consensus view on most subjects of grammar, and diverging from it is perceived as incorrect, which is for all functional purposes the same thing as being incorrect under a prescriptivist standard.

I have gone looking and been unable to find any authoritative source that recommends putting a full stop within quotation marks and then again after them, except in the special circumstance that another poster explained above. I've gone through a number of style guides that all agreed.

If you can find something to the contrary, please, I invite you to present it, but I think you may have misinterpreted an error you've seen more than once for a common practice.
