I am unable to find any evidence of a 'linguistic community' that uses the double full stop grammar you describe. I believe you are factually incorrect in thinking it is an accepted thing anywhere. I have invited you to provide evidence to the contrary and you've given me nothing.

You may be conflating descriptivism with the old linguistics rule regarding 'what is a word', for the purposes of linguistic study which welcomes anything anyone uses that anyone else understands, even if it is a single case. (It should be noted that this definition is for the purposes of study and classification only, not something incumbent on the actual users of a language to accept, and most do not.)

Descriptivism absolutely considers something that one person makes up and nobody else uses to be incorrect. Something must be in common use at least somewhere to be accepted as regular practice. That is fundamental to descriptivism. If it is not actually in common use then it is aberrant use not recognized by others, an error.

I am not sure how many more ways I can explain this point to you. You seem extremely focused on not listening.
