But in this case (I thought) we were discussing language choice for a written story, not prejudice at interpersonal interactions nor general philosophical questions like the value of languages themselves, uniqueness, understanding, etc.

The goal (when writing in English) is commonly to communicate the story clearly to the English speaking world in general, because your target audience is presumably global. The context then becomes a question of which language is the best tool to achieve that.

If you want to get your book accepted by a publisher, there is also a set of standards involved that will influence what is the best tool for the job.
