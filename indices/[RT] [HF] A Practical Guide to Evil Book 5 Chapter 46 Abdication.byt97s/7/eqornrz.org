  “The last story is mine,” I said. “It is made of crowns and debts, the desperate trick of a fox chewing through its own foot for fear of the night.”

Looking back, I actually can't interpret this applying to anything else than Larat, who having brought up the story of the fox is probably meant as the fox himself. He just gave up right to rule to escape the trap that would have pitted him against the Night, literally.

I'm hesitant to vote on "Catherine planned this" solely because the chapter isn't an Interlude, really. I don't understand her reference otherwise.
