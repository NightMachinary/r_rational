Catherine didn't give up her right to rule (as evidenced by the fact that she's currently still Queen of Callow; she was even one of the possible "final" crowns that could be used with the seven), so it's still on the table for her. But I'd be surprised if it went that direction. She seemed much too pleased to have rid herself of the last court/mantle to really want to pick up another.
