  “Hear me, Sve Noc,” I said. “Whatever claim I yet hold to Winter, I pass to you. My crown of Moonless Night, I lay at your feet. I stand before you without power or right to my name, mortal at your mercy.”

"Right" probably includes "right to rule" here. As for being the Queen of Callow /at the moment/, here's how the Grey Pilgrim puts it:

  “Though the earthly crown will not be taken from your brow, save if you yourself do so, you will have lost the authority of a ruler in the eyes of the Heavens,” the Grey Pilgrim said. “Lingering in that role after discarding it before Gods and men can only bring calamity.”

  “I figure it'd be subtle at first,” I said. “Small nudges. Crops get a little worse, people listen a little less. If you keep holding, though, then it's a different story.”

  “Disease and strife,” the Peregrine said, “and they will only grow, so long as authority is kept.”

There's a window of opportunity to abdicate before the Gods' displeasure grows out of hand - and the way her advisors started taking questionable decisions that ended in the narrow points of the plan breaking down, seemingly right after the confrontation in Tvarigu, may be the earliest of those nudges. I personally hope Cat uses her abdication to bargain for the kingdom joining the Grand Alliance, now that it's no longer ruled by the Arch-Heretic of the East.
