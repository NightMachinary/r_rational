There's a huge amount of Chekhov's guns before this! We've had tons of buildup about /giving up crowns/ for the last 20 chapters! We've had Cat's unexpected surrender to the Pilgrim to win! We were giving up crowns to give someone a crown, why couldn't they give it up too, just like Cat did? We didn't see it coming but the foreshadowing was there.

edit: Cat also gave up her crown of Moonless Night to Sve Noc. Has this been a theme for a whole book and we haven't noticed?
