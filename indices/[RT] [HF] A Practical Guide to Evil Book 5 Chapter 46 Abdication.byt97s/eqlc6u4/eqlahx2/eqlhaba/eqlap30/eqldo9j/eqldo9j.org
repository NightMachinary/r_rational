Because we've been thought that the complete absence of a [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun][Chekhov's gun]] means there is no way something can happen. There was no way Larat giving up the crown would work because the story we were told looked good enough and we hadn't been given /any/ hint what might have happen if it didn't. Writers don't just subvert their own stories without set up but apparently /this one does/ because subverting stories doesn't need set up in this one.
