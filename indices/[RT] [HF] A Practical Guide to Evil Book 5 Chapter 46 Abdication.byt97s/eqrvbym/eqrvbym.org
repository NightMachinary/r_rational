Here's my take on Twilight King 2019:

Peregrine: Would restore his right to rule (not that he's using it). Probably one of the better developments. Would get the Pilgrim out of Cat's hair without killing him.

Saint: Taking the crown would make her less of a sword. Not going to happen.

Masego: Too easy a solution to the "no more magic" issue. Creates too many narrative vulnerabilities for Cat's liking.

Cat: I think sure could get it without getting ganked by the Saint, Pilgrim, or Tyrant, but it's not how her story works. She pays the costs of her power up front.

Tyrant: No clue. He'll probably make a play for it, but he's got a very solid streak going of /nearly/ getting what he wants.

Dark horse candidate 1: Roland. About all we know is that he steals power and makes it his own. Might be the best option for Cat for having someone reasonable get the power while remaining recognizably human. I bet on him being the first proposed candidate before Tyrant's inevitable betrayal.

Dark Horse candidate 2: The Crows. Maybe they've developed a taste for fae power.

Dark Horse candidate 3: Akua Sahelian, after Tyrant's betrayal has been drawn.
