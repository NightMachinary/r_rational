We know who we can rule out. Tariq and Catherine both gave up their rirght to rule, to empower this very crown and the Sisters respectively. Masego is out of it, and Sve Noc or any drow claiming it would just bring us back to the problem of a Court sworn to Below.

So might Amadeus, but between losing the Name of the Black Knight and generally unorthodox methology he might haggle a deal (with anyone but the Saint of Swords). Laurence already has a domain, so she may be able to extend her *Decree* over it, and worst comes to worst, Cat will just go with the old plan of killing the newborn goddess. Ronald is probably not interested, and Kairos may care too much about being the successor to Theodosius the Unconquered to give up the Name he inherited, but who knows? Hierarch will likely explode if the crown gets put on his head, but that's far from the only thing he can do with it.

The drow may have also brought someone from the battlefield below, but no candidate there is exactly fit to be a god. I'll laugh very hard if they take the crown and use all the spares lying around (Spellblade, Thief of Stars, the Stolen Crown, Tyrant, Hanno's coin, Keter) to make an even bigger god.
