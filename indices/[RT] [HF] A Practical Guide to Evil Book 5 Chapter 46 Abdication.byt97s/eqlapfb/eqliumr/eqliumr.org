The worthy take, the worthy rise. Larat knew what he was doing when he abdicated in the middle of the drow army that followed Losara Queen's bid to power.

And Bard probably did more than that. I doubt the King of Winter decided to deep-six his Court just in time for Diabolist's plans being looked into by Thief and Squire. The invasion escalated their threat level from "didn't they siege that city a year ago" to "oh Gods why are there so many zombies". The Summer's advance helped to level up the Diabolist and Squire while giving Akua enough time and fodder to make her plans actually work instead of Thief sneaking a crate of goblinfire into the room where the captured Deoraithe were held.
