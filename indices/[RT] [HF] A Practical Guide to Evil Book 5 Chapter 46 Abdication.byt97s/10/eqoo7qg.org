So, I know this is not currently a popular opinion, but I believe the Rogue Sorcerer will ( in the end) accept the crown.

Think about it: he has sympathy from both villains and heroes, and the last chapter explicitly states that "people who don't want to rule are especially well suited to ruling".\\
He obviously doesn't want it, but he has no other obligations or stakes in the story ( in the sense that the Audience doesn't know/care about his own character arc that he's doubtlessly going through).\\
All the other people in the band of five are very unsuited to taking it. Cat will in no case accept it, she just regained her mortality. Swords is not about ruling at all, and is important to defeat the Dead King. Pilgrim just gave up his right to rule (although the crown, being made from it, might restore it), and more importantly has too central a role in supporting the fight against the Dead King and uniting the Alliance (and it just would sound off tune, if you know what i mean).\\
Archer... I don't know how to explain it other that it's just not her role.\\
Tyrant might make a play for it, but no one will allow him to take it.

Masego regaining his power this way would feel cheap, and binding himself through very strict creation rules just goes against what he's about.

The Rogue Sorcerer is also thematically compatible with the Twilight Court, i think.
