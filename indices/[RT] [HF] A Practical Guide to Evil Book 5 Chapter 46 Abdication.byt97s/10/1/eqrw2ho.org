I think you need to go another layer or two. The Rogue Sorcerer is likely the best conscious choice. Then the Tyrant will do the betrayal thing again. At that point, the third candidate either (a) needs to pay a price the Tyrant didn't expect they'd pay or (b) be a player the Tyrant didn't account for.

At that stage, (of characters currently present) I'd guess any of (a) Akua, (b) Crows, (c) Archer, (d) Saint.
