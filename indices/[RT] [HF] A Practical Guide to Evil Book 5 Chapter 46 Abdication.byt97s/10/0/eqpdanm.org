There's two layers of narrative here: first is the in-universe narrative which Cat and co. can read, and the second is the meta-narrative that EE is setting up.

Even if Rogue Sorcerer would be a halfway decent match narratively, the meta-narrative is really lacking. We don't know him or anything about him and thus we don't care at all what sort of arc he goes through at this point. Introducing him so late to the scene just to take the fall for the highway wouldn't feel very satisfactory.

For that to work out, there would have to be an unforeseen twist like having him be Malicia with a hat on or something.
