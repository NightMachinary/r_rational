I'm always super hyped for the next chapter, but doubly so this time because I had absolutely /no/ clue what was going to happen. A timeskip? How long? Whose perspective? Would it be an interlude? And sure enough, I was taken completely by surprise.

​

/Huh./ So Red has DID now. Which honestly makes a scary amount of sense. I mean, what else will happen when you literally segment a part of yourself away? It's gonna grow on its own while the "new" you grows on its own, so when you go back, it feels like you're a different person (or in a different reality, as uh...Past Red called him? Wonder if we're gonna come up with nicknames for the two Reds).

​

At first I felt a slight amount of trepidation seeing the main character suddenly get a new personality, but I think it was executed really well. Neither Red, despite literally being "out of character", feels OOC. They both feel like /him,/ and you could make arguments for either Red being the "real" one. The part where he switches between the two? So well written, you can /feel/ the shift just like I'm sure Dr. Seward did. May edit as more thoughts come to me, idk, great chapter and looking forward to the next.
