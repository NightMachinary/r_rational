Ha, I was actually about to type "Blue" when referring to Past Red because it seemed to fit, but unfortunately it doesn't work for...obvious reasons.

Just to clarify, there are only two personalities here, right? There's "Past" Red (the sad one), and is the other Red present, future, or both? I don't want to call him "default" or "normal" Red.
