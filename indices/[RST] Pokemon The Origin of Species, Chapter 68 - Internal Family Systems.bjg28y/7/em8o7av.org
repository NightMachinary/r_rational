I've been feeling a bit impatient to see Red, Blue, and Leaf try and resolve their issues after the last chapter, but luckily that didn't happen because this "intermediate" chapter was incredible. Red's emotions, and his thoughts and explanations of them, were perfectly done and his transitions between mental states fit so well for something that out of the blue. (That pun wasn't intended but it's staying.)

I almost cried with Past Red. Personally I've never been in the kind of situations Red has gone through but it's so hard not to empathise after he says: "They're dead, it's the least I can do to acknowledge that, instead of ignoring it like a... a coward...". Really makes you think about your view of death after reading that.

+On another note, Past Red says "ignore how much I miss my dad and how guilty I feel about A..." but Red clearly states that guilt isn't the true emotion that he's feeling. Is this more of an off-hand statement or is it an admission of sorts?+ Never mind, he says that guilt isn't the main thing he's thinking about, but he doesn't say there's no guilt at all.

EDIT: Made a correction and rewrote a sentence.
