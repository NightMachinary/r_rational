Thinking about it, it does make a terrible amount of sense that Partition!Red and Non-Partition!Red, while both still Red, would have different views about the world. After all, supressing a part of his brain the way Red did for as long as he did, is bound to have consequences. For now, keeping the partition up seems to be way to go. But, in the long run, his endgoal should be reconciling both his sides and learning to live without his partition.

Very interesting chapter. Not at all what I expected, but entertaining nonetheless. I'm also happy that Red is concerned about becoming aloof and distant as most psychics are because I was worried about that too when he left with Sabrina.

So things seem to be at pretty low point right now with everybody broken up and still hurting after Aiko's death, but hopefully it will get better from here on. Wishful thinking I know, but you can't stop me from rooting for these kids.
