Oh, completely unrelated thought, but do you have any plans for the move Miracle Eye? Among other things, it removes a dark type's immunity to psychic moves, which has a few plot relevant consequences. Kadabra/Alakazam and Natu/Xatu are both capable of learning both Miracle Eye and Teleport, which would make them ideal teleporters for dark humans. Also, Mewtwo learns it, which sounds like fun times.

Given that this move clearly doesn't exist in the current story (as even Giovanni laments his inability to teleport), it might be a good fit for something discovered by Red when training his (eventual) Kadabra. It's really easy to imagine him immediately showing Sabrina, who then manages to unwittingly pass it on to Mewtwo.
