So I made some comments on a thread a month or so again about this, and I finally caught up on the story (a few weeks ago actually, but I was waiting for a chapter post to make this). My feedback (I believe I made it up to the forest fire before quitting, initially) was primarily that 1. the scientific explanations felt forced, 2. The characters felt weird, and 3. Game of Champions ruined other pokemon fanfic for me.

Now that I'm caught up, I can stay I still largely agree with all of these initial impressions, but with caveats.

1. The most egregious scientific explanation was Red's experiment from when he first got his charmander. That set a /horrible/ tone for me because it felt extremely naive for a (near?) genius who lives in a pokemon world. This experiment felt like an actual 12 year old, and happens before you clarify that they're different in an AN. HPMOR had a similar issue early on as well.

2. General character weirdness. This one is less quantifiable, but I found myself not really liking most of the characters early on. It wasn't until Pewter that I realized I really enjoyed Blue, and a bit later when Leaf grew on me. Red is still half and half to me, but that's more for me not liking his personality too much, rather than me not believing it. He still feels too naive and hopeful for me to like him, but I can't complain now that this chapter has justified this, and also clearly defined a dark counterpart to it.

3. Game of Champions vs. OoS. Obviously Game of Champions has a far edgier and less hopeful outlook on the world, but it also uses a ton of evocative language and darker worldbuilding that OoS doesn't do. This is more a stylistic preference on my part rather than legitimate criticism, in retrospect. I tend to give the story a lot of credit because it flips enough switches in my brain that I don't see the flaws.

The caveat to these is that the writing quality improves */DRAMATICALLY/* over the course of the series. Early chapters just didn't have the characters as well defined, and the scientific explanations felt forced rather than natural. The last one I even /remember noticing/ was the value charting on Red and Blue's birthday. There have been more, but they felt seamless and important rather than a boring blog post interlude. All three of my complaints from before were valid /for the chapters I read/, but I currently wouldn't apply any of them to the recent chapters. This isn't my favorite story, but I greatly enjoy reading it and was disappointed when I was finally caught up.

On the interlude you suggested me, chapter 28: I actually wasn't a huge fan of it, and it felt fairly different from the rest of the story. I ended up reading the story because the quality wasn't bad, and some of the comments seemed to indicate that the story/characters got better. Most popular things on this sub tend to be good, barring a few exceptions. I'd be interested in seeing interludes from some non-characters, more to flesh out the world rather than flesh out the plot.

On topic for the chapter: I was actually hoping the time skip would go a few extra months, if only to see further power progression when the characters need to respond to disasters. I'm cautiously optimistic that the gang will get back together, but a Red/Blue rivalry *is* canon, and this would be a better way to start it than most.
