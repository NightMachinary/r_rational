That's a really good idea. Giovanni might not (actually) want such a move to exist, but there is probably at least /some/ interest in-universe for a move allowing psychic types to affect dark types. I can imagine there already being deliberate research in that area. It seems natural for psychic trainers to be interested in reading the minds of dark type humans/pokemon. Alternatively, a trainer of psychic types might make note of the move while shoring up weaknesses.
