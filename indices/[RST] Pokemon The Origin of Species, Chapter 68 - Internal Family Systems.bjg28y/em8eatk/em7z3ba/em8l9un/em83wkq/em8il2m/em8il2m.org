Red's DID is scary. Both Non-Partition Red and Partition Red claim they are the real and the other is fake, either delusionally-naive or delusionally-depressed. I must admit I like PR better than NPR, but eventually I hope he deals with his grief in a normal way, without a partition, but retaining his personality and character.

Really good chapter. I'll definitely have to read it again to fully get the implications.

Also, during the day, does Red normally make an effort to keep his partition down? He says it goes back up if he doesn't concentrate or after sleep, but does he take it down first thing in the morning?
