Wowee that's a mental health. That's a big boy bad right there and you know it. Also, maybe a scary path to Red ending up standing on the top of a mountain not speaking to anyone? Still very well done chapter, and very unusual exploration of grief, which, oddly enough, I don't see much media about?

I suppose this raises the question then: anyone got any good recs for works that deal in grief? Especially in unusual (but valid and realistic) ways. Definitely do not need to be rational/adjacent, but seeing how different types is kinda the point, if you do have any, feel free to chuck em my way.
