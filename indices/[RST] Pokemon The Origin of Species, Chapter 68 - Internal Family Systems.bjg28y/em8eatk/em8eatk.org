This is the chapter where you remember that the author's day job is being a therapist - we will skip over a month of psychic training, but we ain't gonna skip over the therapy sessions!

​

The part that jumps out to me the most is all the Red's sense that they need to "resolve" the Aiko question, figure out if he "did the right thing or not" before feeling guilty, etc. It evokes what the Gym third said to him as she found him outside the hospital - "sometimes we dont get to know"; sadly I dont think Red is ever going to be able to answer that question, which is the real struggle he has to deal with. Thats my, uh, guess I suppose for why he can't resolve this and what he has to internalize, though also just generally an important thing for anyone to know, how unresolvable most uncertainty is.

(also +1 point for Red point-of-view, oh thank you, I was suffering withdrawal I swear)
