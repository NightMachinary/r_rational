Multiple Personality Disorder is often characterized by the idea of distinct "people" all inhabiting the same brain/body.

If you read Dissasociative Identity Disorder's DSM criteria, the symptoms can include something like that, but also include people who undergo periods where they just feel, as the name implies, disassociated from their thoughts/actions. This doesn't necessarily mean they think they're a different person: people who go through manic/depressive episodes, for example, can qualify, as can people who have kleptomania, or people who feel like they undergo particularly strong personality shifts under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
