As great as the therapy sessions are... this is a little annoying, even if it is understandable why its written this way.

So far, each Gym we've seen has gone into detail as to the philosophy, training methods, and nature of people who both challenge and work at said gyms. It's really been quite amazing, and I've been eagerly looking forward to how Sabrina does her training.

I know that it is written this way because we, the audience, are still focused on the aftermath of the Endbringer battle, and therefore that thread needs to be resolved and not just immediately abandoned at the start of a new chapter. Right proper storytelling. I'm just hoping that the author will give us a chance to see and to detail some of Sabrina's methods at some near point in the future, because so far the worldbuilding has been amazing.
