Personally I wouldn't say self-aware. He's had a partition up for long enough and prodded it enough that he now has a separate personality built around grief. In HPMOR the main character has a "mysterious dark side" that thinks differently, here the two reds have a completely different take on what reality looks like and they can't really make an argument for which one of them is "real".

I guess it just feels a bit wrong to call him self-aware when he's mostly aware of the fact that his self can't recognise or understand itself.
