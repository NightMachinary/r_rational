Internal Family Systems were very interesting to learn about, because as a writing/introspection exercise, in my circle of friends it is very common to concept our internal parts as, uh, goetic demons. The person who started this trend even expanded it out to a full Key-of-Solomon-modeled 72-demon grimoire.

Speaking purely hypothetically, what would your reaction be if you explained Internal Family Systems to a patient and they came back with a fifty thousand word occult text?
