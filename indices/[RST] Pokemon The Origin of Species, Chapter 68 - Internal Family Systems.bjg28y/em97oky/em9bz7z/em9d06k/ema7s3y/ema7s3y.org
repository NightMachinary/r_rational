Split brain patients are covered in intro psych and neuroscience texts, but you would be surprised by how little of that sort of thing is retained by people who have been working in clinical psychology for years, let alone decades. I checked with my coworkers, and not one in 14 other therapists knew about it. To be fair, 9 knew that the CC being cut was a treatment for epilepsy, but not about the side effects of that.

Meanwhile, as [[/u/Memes_of_Production]] noted, fMRI are a fairly well known diagnostic tool, and certainly brought up in clinical practice, let alone day to day life, much more often.
