I think split brain patients and fMRI are /both/ covered in my intro psych and neuroscience textbooks, and common knowledge to most people who specialize in those things at least in my circles. Like, I typically would never start a conversation with "have you heard about split brain patients" in a psych/neuro academic circle..., I'd just assume they know. Certainly something you'd be shocked to find any vaguely brain or behavior or psychology interested person not knowing... although non-neuroscience biologists, non-psychology social scientists, or non-scientists might not know. But the /reader/ doesn't necessarily know in this work, so we have to work with that. And also, this is a different world, so.
