Good chapter but also I found it a little immersion breaking for a moment that the therapist knew about fMRIs but didn't know anything about split brain patients (although of course this world presumably has a different history, maybe they didn't split brains for epilepsy here so it was never that reliable of a finding, I mean why would they when they have psychics who could tell you to stop if anything weird seemed to be happening)
