No, Red with the partition up likes keeping it up. He described it as painful and uncomfortable to take it down and only did it because his therapist asked him too. By the same token once the partition is down, he would never put it back up, but it requires focus to keep down. As a result it always eventually returns.

The only reason the partition ever comes down is that using his psychic abilities weakens it.
