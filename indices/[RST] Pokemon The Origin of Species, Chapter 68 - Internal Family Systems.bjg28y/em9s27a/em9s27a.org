Awesome chapter!

I hope this eventually builds to Red learning to accept both, or all sides of himself. I wonder if he keeps gaining control over his partition, if he'll eventually be able to break it and have those thoughts memories and feelings merge with those in the rest of his mind. That's if he chooses to, of course.
