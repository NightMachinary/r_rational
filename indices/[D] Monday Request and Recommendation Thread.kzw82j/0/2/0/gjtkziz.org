I heard the author lived in turkey and when the coop happened he/she went dark. They came back and got shit on by every royalroadl reader in the comments for the latest chapter complaining of the MC's “poor” choices. In my eyes everyone was mad that the novel was not turning out as a harem power fantasy and it pissed me off over their outrage that made the author disappear. Was one of my favorite English takes on xianxia behind cradle.
