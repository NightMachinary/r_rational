Oh absolutely. The author has done a very good job of showing where the power boost is coming from, and why. My issue is that it seems to be a relatively easy way of getting lots of power that, surely, at some point, other cultivators must have figured out. I get the whole idea that a cultivator choosing to go be a farmer is unlikely, but in the entire history of cultivation, no one else has done it? Ever? It's never been figured out before? That's the main issue I have. Why is this technique not the focus of a school somewhere?

Now, we might find out that it's limited in some other way (power fades if he gets too far from the land he's been supporting maybe?) or that maybe there /is/ a school focusing on it somewhere distant, and it's just not very popular because it's antithetical to the aggressive attitude that most cultivators have, or something.

But if it turns out to be a relatively large power boost, even in the context of the wider world, that doesn't have obvious down sides or limits, and it appears that /no one/ else has ever discovered or taken advantage of it, that will be a pretty big oversight, in my opinion. Not enough to make me stop reading, since, so far, the quality of writing has been more than high enough to make up for things like that, but still. I'd be disappointed if it turns out the MC is the only person in history to take advantage of such an easily discoverable hack.
