I think the power boost is fine.

In an early chapter, the author tells an in-universe story of two cultivators who find something beautiful in nature; one studies and appreciates it while the other the other snorts it for cultivation power. The cultivators think the latter is correct, while the MC is unique in thinking that the reason everyone only hears about the second kind is because the first one actually ascends.

IMO it had big neon lights saying "this is an allegory for the theme of the story."
