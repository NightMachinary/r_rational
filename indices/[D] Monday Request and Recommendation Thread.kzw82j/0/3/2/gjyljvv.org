  To find yourself in a world where the path to eternal youth is known and achievable and to just say "No, I'm gonna live on my farm and die in 50 years, bye!" is just not something I can respect.

I would agree with that, except:

- It's not necessarily achievable. They're not lying about the "one in a million genius young master" in Xianxia stories. Taking a one in a million gamble on eternal youth - particularly in a case where death is actually /the least bad/ failure outcome - is just letting yourself fall victim to Pascal's Mugger.
- It's not necessarily known. Any particularly good or effective cultivation method is going to be the private property of some sect (or some sect elder), and they will at best kill you for having that manual without permission. Getting permission to have those manuals is, again, something that'll require risking your life. And even then there's a decent chance that the cultivation manual you just risked your life to get access to just makes you a living pill for some grandmaster to pluck once you're ripe.
