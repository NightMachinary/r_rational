To be very honest I don't think you're really seeing the extent of how completely different a xianxia world would be like and how futile any type of significant plans are.

I think individual contributions to making the world a better place are doable and needed, but having a grand vision of how you can make an significant impact is imo very naive.

You might know a lot about crop science, but I don't and I doubt most people do. Other than knowing about the basics of crop rotation I know nothing about improving general farming. Even if you know better agricultural processes, I'm strongly confused why you think you'll be able to make a significant difference. In a xianxia world displaying your talents will only result in you either being kidnapped/forced to join a sect, your crops will be stolen by cultivators, someone you teach might kill you and take your methods and be smarter and practice them quietly.

A sect might even just get annoyed and kill you. Even if you're not doing any harm by increasing the, "low level" cultivation materials, you're creating more competition for "medium level" cultivation materials. Xianxia worlds emphasize that cultivation materials are limited and even if you increase low level ones, it might turn out that medium level ones are hardcapped and increasing the number of people that want a small pool of resources is not a situation sects and cultivators want. Or another cultivator will notice your intelligence and smartly consider you a future rival and try to nip you in the bud.

I'd argue that Street Cultivator is an extreme aberration for a xianxia world. The only reason it seems logical to us is because we're putting together our sensibilities of our modern world and you add cultivation. I don't see how a world so similar to ours in sensibilities could form where immortality is exists and personal power can be be so vast. The simple structure, to worldviews, to politics are much to similar to our own. A cultivation world with our modern technology would be extremely alien to us and I guarantee street cultivation would be a utopia compared to that.

40 Milleniums is a wuxia world. That's why anything is doable. It's listed as xianxia because theoretically people might be able to live, "forever," but 1000 is considered the limit for literally all people in history. (except maybe the Supreme Emperor and Li Yao.) Wuxia worlds have hope because people will die and there is a limit to personal power. Those limitations can that give starting level cultivators a change to yes, like you said change the world. Anyone can be caught up to. You can afford to take delays in cultivation because the finish line is the same for everyone. The only reason that Li Yao can be so optimistic, moral and win against his opponents is because he's in a wuxia, if he was really in a xianxia, the immortal cultivators are 100% always going to win.

Sure you could hope for the best and try to gain power and build something, but you're always at the whims at the insanely strong and the completely amoral. In a xianxia this world, age won't kill the sadistically strong people and because they're willing to have no morals they will advance faster than you. Again unless you have mc like luck, if you're not willing to compromise your morals others will and they will advance. They'll accomplish the demonic ritual that requires the sacrifice of a thousand peasants to improve .5% of their power. They'll be willing to literally work people to the death toiling their fields for the cultivation resources. And if you ever have anything, land, resources, peasants and they want them for themselves or maybe their students at that point, they will take it.

Like I'm can't overemphasize just how different a xianxia world's culture is. Anything is possible in a world where age has a limit and personal power is capped. In limited worlds you can wait for someone's inevitable death or simply overpower a person with sheer numbers. Even bar actively making a change, limited worlds make people act in a much different way.

In limited worlds cultivation is not and end all and be all like in xianxia. Cultivation in wuxia is a means to accomplish other goals. It is a tool.

The achievable immortality found in xianxia warps everything and cultivation is the end all be all. The implications of that are extraordinary and change everything.
