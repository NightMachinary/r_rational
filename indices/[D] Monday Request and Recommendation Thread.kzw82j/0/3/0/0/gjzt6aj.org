You apparently feel very strongly about this. And yet, assuming you find yourself in such a situation, you would prefer to stick your proverbial head in the sand, hiding in the proverbial darkest hole you can find, leading an ascetic life as a farmer, hoping to grow enough food every year to survive the winter?

Instead of facing reality as it is and then attempting to *change* something?

In Xianxia immortality is often achieved at a certain level of power. Let's say the goal is to maximize the amount of people that reach this level, or at least as close to it as possible. Then how about trying to kick off some analogue of an industrial revolution? Obviously not in the sense of building machines, but, for example, in the sense of expanding the production of low-level cultivation resources? To the point where they become so ubiquitous that basically everybody has access to them, thus raising awareness of cultivation, thus improving the average health, lifespan and everything else that automatically flows from this? Basically attempt to transform a typical medieval Xianxia world into something like what is described in [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23220/street-cultivation-a-modern-wuxialitrpg-hybrid][Street Cultivation]] and [[https://wuxiaworld.site/novel/forty-millenniums-of-cultivation-webnovel/][40 Milleniums of Cultivation]]?

This is just the very first plan that came to my mind. Obviously, depending on the world you find yourself in, something else will probably make more sense.

You say you would have to sacrifice your morals? Well, probably. At some point, to some extent. Probably the most while in the very initial stages of cultivation, while very low on power. After that it really becomes your choice, with an extended lifespan and at least some average power it becomes possible to find like-minded people, who would support you. And/or founding your own sect, where you can teach your morals from an early age, thus raising people you would approve of.

Saying "I don't like your culture, so I'm gonna hide and pretend it doesn't exist!" only works in a comedy, while backed by plot armor.
