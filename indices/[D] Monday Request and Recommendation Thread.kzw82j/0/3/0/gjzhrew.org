Really?

To be the one person out a gazillion who reaches the final peak of cultivation and immortality you have to have insane luck, but realistically that's nowhere near enough.

You must be extremely ruthless. You need to take advantage of every opportunity and moment for personal gain. Because resources are limited and cultivation gives insane power, xianxia fantasies exist in an extremely rational dog eats dog world. Any benefit someone else gets is basically a loss to yourself and something that might hinder you in the future.

Every caricature, story or history you've heard about extremely ruthless businessmen, manipulative politician, monstrous warlord, multiply that by ten thousand and you might come close to how most people and organizations must act in a xianxia world to barely get by. People who live hundreds, thousands and more years cultivating solo will be stripped of any humanity in them. To them regular humans who live and die are basically a separate lower species. To compete with an endless number of organizations and people who live by a completely ruthless philosophy unless a person has god level cheats, they kinda have to drop down to their level of existence.

Beliefs in things like kindness, equality for all people (not just your ingroup of sect peers), loyalty, integrity, love are things that will only hinder a cultivator. (Faking them is useful, but actually believing them and acting on them will only end with slowdown in your cultivation and/or pushing forward your death.) To survive and thrive in a xianxia, you must be smart and adopt that extremely ruthless, selfish, asshole mentality.

If anything in my view, not choosing to pursue immortality in xianxia world is the most respectable thing that can be done. To have a shot at success I personally would have to sacrifice many of the values I believe in.

Assume I try my luck and attempt to be a cultivator without compromising principles, as I go up in power the more and more of my peers that will be people with values I absolutely despise. Cultivation attracts corruptible people. It is the ultimate power and those who will do well are those that care about power more than anything else (power hungry psychopaths, ect.)

Because my peers are terrible, I don't want to spend time with them and so I might spend time with lower level cultivators that are better people. Spending time with people who are lower than me in power is an exercise in pain since my extended life at that level will mean that an these friends will die much sooner than I do. I can only see being reborn into a xianxia world and choosing to be a cultivator to be a lonely existence with few benefits.

Instead of dealing with all of that, I'd much rather spend as much time doing things I enjoy with people I love and making the world a better place in some small level.

Honestly reading xianxia has only really taught me one thing, it's that immortality (to me at least) is only really worth having if it's democratized and everyone can have it. I love the idea of spending lifetimes doing interesting challenges with my friends, spending time with my family, learning from my grandparents, interacting with interesting people. I like living because of the people in the world and I'd like everyone have immortality so everyone could live doing cool stuff and having good experiences. But spending my existence chasing something I most likely will never reach and pretty much requires I compromise nearly everything I believe in and robs me of what happiness I could have seems like a terrible trade.

Sorry I wrote the same thing for like ten paragraphs, but I guess I feel like I cannot stress that point enough.
