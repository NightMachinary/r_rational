While I realise that the story is comedy, it needs to be said that the premise is not at all rational. Or maybe it's the wrong word and it would be more correct to say not personally relatable.

To find yourself in a world where the path to eternal youth is known and achievable and to just say "No, I'm gonna live on my farm and die in 50 years, bye!" is just not something I can respect.
