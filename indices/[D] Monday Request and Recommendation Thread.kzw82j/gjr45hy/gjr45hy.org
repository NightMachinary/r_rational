I finished Midnight Diner a couple days ago. Very offbeat show, takes place in a diner that's open from midnight to seven in the morning, and each episode is a mostly one-off story about the regulars or new customers in the diner. It's very simplistic, but the execution is very good. There's some very well-done emotion here. I highly recommend it; this may go on my top 15.
