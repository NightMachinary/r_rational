Totally get where you're coming from with the Cinnamon Bun thing. I can't articulate exactly why it bothered me so much, but it did, and it's a major factor that contributed towards me dropping the story. Also, it opened up a really weird can of worms concerning cultural appropriation and specieism--like iirc when she turns into a bunny she suddenly feels obliged to connect to bunny culture, have bunny friends, and suffer from the same racist/specieist stigmas/problems that born bunny people deal with, even though in a world where you can literally evolve into a different race, it doesn't make that much sense.
