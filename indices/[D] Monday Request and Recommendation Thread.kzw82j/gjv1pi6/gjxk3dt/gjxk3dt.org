Not sure if its what you're looking for (I haven't read it) but I remembered Scott Alexander's review of [[https://www.slatestarcodexabridged.com/Book-Review-House-Of-God][House of God]].

  I found myself having more emotions reading House of God than I've had about anything in a long time. I don't really know why. But I think it has something to do with this resignation to the general incommunicable weirdness all around anyone who works in medicine. Somehow Shem manages to avoid the normalization of insanity that happens to every young doctor, capture the exact subjective experience and write it down in a way that makes sense. And then, having put his finger right on the unbearable thing, he makes it funny and beautiful and poignant.
