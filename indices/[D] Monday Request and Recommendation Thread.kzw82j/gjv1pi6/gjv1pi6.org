Looking for stories that delve deeply into one field of study. This could be anything, from hard physics to cognitive psychology to early modern weaponry. Examples include R. Scott Bakker's work for philosophy, Masters and Mages trilogy by Miles Cameron for early modern combat styles and garb, I became a [Biologist] in another world for biology, etc. Just something that delves deeper into a topic than would be comfortable for a layman, and is clear on the author's expertise of the topic.
