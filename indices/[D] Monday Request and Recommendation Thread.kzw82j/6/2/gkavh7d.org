I have not read Pith, but that is similar to the premise of Drew Hayes' Villians Code series, starting with Forging Hephaestus. The MC gets caught breaking into the lair of a middle-aged tech villain-cum-billionaire, and offered the choice of membership in the Guild of Villainous Reformation or an exotic beam attack to the head.
