Kind of a specific request, but does anyone know any stories that start with a premise similar to the very beginning of Pith? I.e. the MC breaks into a secure establishment to steal/uncover something, discovers that they've gone in way over their head and gets their shit kicked in, and in the aftermath they get invited/forced to join a shady organization in order to avoid death or jail time.
