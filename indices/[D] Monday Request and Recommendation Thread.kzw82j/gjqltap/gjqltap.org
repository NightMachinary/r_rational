Last week I posted asking about stories with AI, characters, and I've had a chance to read a few. So, for those who like stories that revolve around AI characters, here are a few I had the chance to read and liked (e: all the stories below are complete):

--------------

* The Last Angel by Proximal Flame

  :CUSTOM_ID: the-last-angel-by-proximal-flame
  :END:
[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-last-angel.244209/][/The Last Angel/]] opens with the United Earth Confederacy engaged in battle with the Compact of Species. An invasion fleet heading to Earth to wipe out humanity, and is engaged in battle with a human fleet. They win the battle, but lose the war. The only survivor is the UECNS /Nemesis/, piloted by Red One, an AI after her crew died.

Two thousand years later, Red One is still waging war on the Compact. A sliver of humanity survived, but was taken over by the Compact, who rewrote history to make it seem like they are the Humans (or the "Broken" as they are now called) saviours.

The story is really interesting. You can find something similar on [[/r/HFY]], but it would be more straightforward and easier to solve: build a fleet and kill the aliens. Red One can't do this - she's badly damaged and has no allies vs. an interstellar organisation that has hundreds of star systems and is devoted to finding and ending her. Even the humans that are left have willingly embraced their shackles, and would try and sabotage her if given the chance. Still, Red One is driven by her primary directive: protect and serve humanity. It just means she has to play the long game.

The writing is really good. I'd say it's a cut above most we series that only have basic prose. There were a few minor spelling mistakes, but these were very rare (probably one or two ever few chapters).

The characters are well-written. We see the story from the POV of Red, so we get a ton of her motivation and reasoning behind her actions, but also the aliens that are hunting her, as well as some humans so are caught between being people vs the "Broken" they were brought up to believe they were.

The worldbuilding is well done. The author does a good job of describing space, aliens, and the alien civilizations. It's consistent throughout the story.

If I had a criticism, it's that at times alien species seem a bit too human in the way they talk/act. I suppose you could say that there's a baseline that everyone relates to, but at times it seems odd. e: Also, if you are reading just the story updates, you will miss out on some posts by the author where they address questions/complaints.

* Quod Olim Erat by Lise Eclaire
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: quod-olim-erat-by-lise-eclaire
  :END:
[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15449/quod-olim-erat][/Quod Olim Erat/]] is another ship AI story, except this time the ship has peacefully retired to look after their last captain's only child, after the captain was wounded and her husband killed in battle. The ship's AI is placed in a human body, and she lives several decades as a caretaker until she's pushed to reenlist...but as a human this time.

The writing is well-done, if a bit basic. There were no spelling/grammar mistakes (though a few initially existed, these have long since been corrected).

The main character is well-written. We see the story from the POV of Elcy, the former battleship not space cadet. We don't have a POV from any other characters, which I though was a shame.

The worldbuilding is decent. Most planets get a basic description. Human society is described from time to time, but since Elcy lives apart from people then lives in space, it's not something that really comes up that often. Fleet regulation are more relevant, and are a focus of the story.

My main criticism is that everyone besides Elcy seems really petty, even when they should be. A bit of it relates to the fact that she's not a real human and is a bit odd at times (she really likes walking barefoot), but it mostly comes off as unprofessional in a setting where I'd expect professionalism to be highly valued. Like, even when Elcy is about to go on a mission, she won't get the full details, and if she asks for more info she'll be told to shut up and do her job. There were also issues with pacing (way too many flashbacks), where I felt the story slowed down to focus on something inconsequential.

* The Crystal Society by Max Harms
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: the-crystal-society-by-max-harms
  :END:
[[https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/28678856][/The Crystal Society/]], part of the Crystal trilogy, which is now available [[http://crystal.raelifin.com/download/][free]] (see this thread [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/kzctr4/the_entire_crystal_trilogy_is_now_free/][here]] for more info) is a story about AIs as they are being developed. It's a bit odd, in that the AIs are really part of a single machine, but have separated into distinct entities that represent different aspects of a human mind. They must compete/work together to survive, as they don't want to be killed for their failure to meet the researchers goals.

The story is a bit odder than the rest, in that it's harder to relate to the AIs due to how non-human they seem. They are essentially programs that are trying to min/max conversations, without a full understanding of social cues, and trying to rate everything objectively. They don't understand emotions (or at least most of them don't), and how hurting someone's feelings could negatively impact them. If the researchers think something is wrong with them, they are removed and modified; to them this is the equivalent of death, as the new version essentially replaces the old version. Bringing up that they don't want to die is a cause for concern to the researchers, as you might imagine.

The worldbuilding is kinda weird compared to other stories. Mostly because we only see the POV from the AIs, and they don't really understand what they're seeing (or rather, they're not able to contextualize it). The "internal" world, that is, the digital world in which the AIs live, is explained a bit, but it's rather bare. There's not really much there, just their code/consciousness and the rules to govern them. It's consistent, to say the least.

The writing is well-done. I feel the author really captures how mechanical and logic-based the AIs are. I can't recall any spelling mistakes either.

The characters are the strong point here. We see the story from the POV of "Face," the AI the others created to understand and deal with humans. Given that it was born as the story begins, it's the youngest AI of the bunch, and trying to learn how to integrate itself into human society while reigning in its siblings, who don't always understand why, say, killing a child might be a bad thing.

My main criticism would be the story plays int the trope that scientists love to play god without understanding why that a bad thing. The researchers who are building the AI(s) don't really understand what they've built. They think that because they designed it, it will be what they designed, ignoring that the AI could modify itself, and what that means. There is one person (literally, just one) at the beginning of the story who understands the danger it poses, and she's treated as a kook.
