I second this recommendation, it's a very good show.

As an aside for anyone wondering, despite the popular description of Japan as a lonely place, the atmosphere of places like the diner in that show, or izakayas, wine bars etc.. is pretty much accurate. People will sit at the counter and often start talking, the owner of the restaurant will often facilitate the conversation between people. It's a very convivial thing I think and if you can speak Japanese, going to such a place is a good way to meet a lot of people and be part of the community. In one of the izakayas I often went to, I ended up going to a onsen with the owner and the regulars to celebrate the anniversary of the restaurant. I've also been invited a few times by owners of restaurants I went to often to eat with them and other friends at another restaurant :)

It's a facet of Japan that's not very well known and that foreigners can't really experience until they speak decent Japanese but it's something that I really like about Japan.

I've lived in a lot of other countries in Asia and I've never found this conviviality anywhere else.

Actually, they tried to replicate the concept of the show in China and it didn't really work because it felt fake. It's just not the way restaurants work there (in Hong Kong, before covid, you'd often be seated at a table with other guests due to lack of space, but people would do their very best to ignore you).
