I don't remember how I found it, but I found a complete quest called "Pokemon bet."\\

It's pretty good if the first person does not take you out of it, and it's pokemon fanfic that contemplates a world with pokemon somewhat realistically. It's a worm cross buts it just some of the main characters, nothing really wormy about it.

I would say if you wanted to read a story mostly about pokemon in the real world its one for the few that is around so it might be worth reading for you.
