Presumably humans do that, but because they don't have plot armor, it means they tend to die when they do.

If you assume 8h/d for 100 years the numbers start getting stupid so lets do it. It equals 292000h trained. Spider bro training 24/7 for one year = 8760. Her training would have to be 33x more effective to be at a similar level. A 100yo entity would need to train at 3% her efficiency for 8h/d to achieve her level of strength.

If you want to assume her training is even more effective say 50x. An 150yo would have her level. You see how time is OP? At 100x efficiency a 300yo would have her beat at 8h/d training, which btw already is 1/3 her assumed efficiency.

Powerful entities should be old, unless you use a question ender like 'because God made it this way' to explain it.
