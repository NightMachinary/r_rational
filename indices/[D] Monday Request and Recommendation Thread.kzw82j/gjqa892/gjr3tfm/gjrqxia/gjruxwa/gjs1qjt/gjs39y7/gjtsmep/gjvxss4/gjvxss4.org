Old entities are powerful though?

And again, I am pretty sure this is an XP world right, so her being 33x more effective because she is 1. a monster so can hit monsters of a higher level than humans can presumably. 2. Constantly trying to fight suicidal fights and survives cos of plot armour (like literally every Isekai story). 3. is actually naturally stronger and has more potential cos spoiler.

Also most people are pretty sheltered; you can see the difference in their living conditions in the human chapters, and they don't have strong monsters available to them, nor do they have as many tools as she does, nor do they live to 100 years, so yeah seems perfectly reasonable to me.
