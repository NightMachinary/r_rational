It annoys me that she doesn't use tools and gets powerful too quickly. She basically ignores the biggest human advantage, tools, she could have made armor, weapons, tools and any number of things to make her life easier, but she doesn't. She walks around naked even though she has access to materials that would tremendously improve her survivability if she took a couple hours to turn it into armor.

​

In her position I'd be walking around in a full suit of the toughest monster skin available, combined with a layer of spider silk. Use tools and weapons to improve my offensive capabilities. Missile weapons, actual traps, I'd try to find a way to fight remotely like with clones, puppets, mind controlled units or minions..

​

She gets OP too quickly. There's people in her world that have been grinding and training for what centuries? Longer even, but she shows up and just overtakes them in less than 5 years? Kind of lame. If you're going to have power levels that are this imbalanced you need to justify the MC progressing at an insane pace with something better than 'hard work'.
