Oh, one of my favorite series fits this to a T.

I'd recommend the Japanese light novel series “So I'm a Spider, So What?”

Silly name aside, this series is really hiding a looooot more under the guise of a litrpg spider isekai. It's somewhat divisive due to a major shift around volume 5, but if you're looking for a genre shift that's pulled off satisfyingly Spider should fit.

All the major twists are foreshadowed very early on, there's even some Volume 9/10 twists foreshadowed as early as Volume 1 chapter 1. It's a really interesting take on isekai and litrpg that I haven't seen any other series pull off.

And despite being a JP LN, I find it far more well-written than its peers. The MC has personality and sass, a complete opposite from the typical and generic flat cardboard MCs you usually see. She's also competent and has an incredible drive to survive, and you can understand all of her decisions and feelings based on what happens and what she learns.

The way the System plays into the overarching story is just brilliant, too. I won't reveal too many details on how it changes or what it changes too, but it's all pulled off with a lot of foreshadowing and nothing ever comes out of nowhere.

Well, that's just my personal opinion as someone that's kept up with the source material to the very end. A lot of the people who dislike the series hate how the series moves away from litrpg and grinding at a certain point, but fans will say that this shift is where the story goes from ordinary to amazing. Don't come into the series thinking it'll blow you away from the start, as it starts off acting like a normal isekai, with an unusual hint or tease here and there, and slowly builds up to grand story.

Of course, don't expect something written to the level of Worm, as it is written by an amateur light novel author, but I still greatly enjoy it. I'd even say it's my favorite litrpg.

There's also an anime of it airing this season.
