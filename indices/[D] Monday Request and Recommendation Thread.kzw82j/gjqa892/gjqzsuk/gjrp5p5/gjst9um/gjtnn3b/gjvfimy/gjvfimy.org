What's going on there is terrible, and I'm in favor of doing things that will help. But blaming a Chinese author for not knowing something that's kept secret in their country seems very wrong.

Sure, it's bizarre that China is the place where it's hardest to learn what the Chinese government is actually doing. But that's how censorship works.

It's like the "Spanish flu", the last big pandemic before Covid. Why was it called "Spanish"? Because every other country where the disease had spread was censoring the newspapers. So even though the disease was much worse in France or Italy, it was Spain where you could first find out about it. Should we have blamed ordinary Frenchmen or Italians for not knowing their government was lying to them?

100% agree that doing more about the human horror over there would be good. But punishing Chinese authors for not having discovered Chinese state secrets feels wrong.
