Actually, I think this is a case of it being done intentionally, just that it won't fit with much of the rational community. I mean the kid is just such a petulant brat doing completely retarded things, I can't stand it, but its totally in character with a not-very-smart, spoilt brat. I would personally much rather the last human to be a soldier who knows exactly what they are doing and just blow the other races away, but I know many people would not enjoy such a story, and I would love the kid to find another human who knows what they are doing, but narratively it can't happen cos it would just sideline the kid, which is a shame cos probably I'll end up dropping it soon cos I can't stand the kid.
