Yeah, it... isn't as a good once that character is introduced. I'm still looking forward to where it's going, and TBH I think that character is written reasonably (you're a child, and you traumatically wake up to find that everyone and everything you knew is long gone - gonna fuck you up).

I suspect it'll turn back around as we keep going. Reminds me of how season 2 of many shows just isn't as good as season 1 - gotta figure, how long with the authors spend thinking about season 1, and how long did they get to think about season 2?
