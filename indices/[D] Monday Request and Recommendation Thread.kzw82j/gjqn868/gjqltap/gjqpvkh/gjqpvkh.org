I'll second the rec for The Last Angel. It felt really slow to me since I read it while it was being written and there were often stretches of chapters without the plot being advanced at all. But it's much better reading it all the way through.

Really good worldbuilding for a massive, galaxy spanning civilization, which is rare even in actual published works. You really feel like you understand the perspectives and motivations of the numerous different species and factions rather than everyone just being automatically pigeonholed into a role.
