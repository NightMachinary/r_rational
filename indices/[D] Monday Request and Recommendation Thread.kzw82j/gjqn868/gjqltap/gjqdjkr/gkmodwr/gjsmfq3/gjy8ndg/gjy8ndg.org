I've read a bit of Tower of Somnus, and quite liked it so far. Thanks!

I like the setting and setup. Instead of a typical LitRPG, the RPG is an actual game that people can enter in their sleep.

My one criticism so far is that the aliens don't seem too alien, but perhaps that is due to the in-game auto-translation software being really good. It is also super-convenient that the aliens have the same 24-hour day / night (sleep) cycle that the protag does, but I'm willing to let that slide for story purposes.

*Edit:* Grammar.

*Double Edit:* The sleep cycle thing is explained later.
