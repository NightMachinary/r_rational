These aren't recommendations per-se, but here's what I'm reading currently with some commentary.

/Looking forward to every update:/

[[https://iagtd.com][Whispering Crystals or whatever it is called now]] - Emma was seriously holding the idiot ball towards the end of the last book though. The earlier book is now /not/ available for free online because of the author signing an agreement with Amazon, but it is cheap.

[[https://royalroad.com/fiction/26675/a-journey-of-black-and-red][A Journey of Black and Red]] - Ariane and her cohort continue to kick ass.

[[https://royalroad.com/fiction/26294][He Who Fights With Monsters]] - the recent time-skip was a little jarring. It had looked like the world was looking at a slow ramp-up, but the antagonists have really turned up the tension. Still waiting for the Asya subplot to get going.

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-lion-in-winter-asoiaf-got-si.9138/][The Lion in Winter]] - *NSFW* - a little misogynistic even for smut, but it has been interesting how the original timeline got altered. The story is just about finished.

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/power-corrupts-gamer-si-skyrim.10700/][Power Corrupts - Gamer SI]] - *NSFW* - in ES:Skyrim for the foreseeable future, and again, interesting on how the original story line is getting messed up. The SI is waaaay overpowered though, his problems are more political than physical. At one point, he kills an entire invading army that was trying to take a city. By himself with a sword.

[[https://royalroad.com/fiction/31388][Every Hero Needs a Vacation Now and Then]] - satire of a typical harem fic and funny.

[[https://fanfiction.net/s/11115934][The Shadow of Angmar]] - Harry Potter dies and ends up in Middle Earth, well before The Hobbit. He has a good relationship with Saruman, so it'll be interesting to see what happens there.

[[https://royalroad.com/fiction/37951][RE: Monarch]] - interesting time loop mechanism, where the protag doesn't just go back to a fixed starting point in time, but only far enough back to avoid his own death and fix other issues. The antagonist also may be a looper, but that isn't clear.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21322/re-trailer-trash][RE: Trailer Trash]]

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26149/skybound][Skybound]] - major upgrade for Morgan. It seems most of the major conflict resolution will take place in the next book, don't know.

/Stalled out on:/

Azarinth Healer - will probably pick this up again at some point, it may be fun to see what happens at level 500 for her classes.

Wake of the Ravager - Just haven't been in the mood for it recently, but will pick this up again someday.

[[https://royalroad.com/fiction%2028111/ultra-ai][Ultra A.I.]] - as mention previously, this is a wacky ride, which reminds me of Cory Doctorow.

[[https://royalroad.com/fiction/21216][Grand Design]]

[[https://royalroad.com/fiction/32123][Just a Bystander]]

/Dropped:/

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31429][Cinnamon Bun]] - this and the author's other work like Stray Cat Strut bothered me a little with the non-consensual species mutation. If you want to be a catgirl or whatever, that's fine, but to end up as one without explicit consent bothered me for some reason. That or I just didn't like that as a result of a seemingly innocuous class evolution. Though the nearly same issue with The Many Lives of Cadence Lee /didn't/ bother me where the protag is incarnated as a non-human. Though after being dumped in the current 'verse as a non-human, she has /chosen/ what evolutions to pursue.

Dirk Gently's Hollistic Detective Agency TV series (2016) - I started watching it on Hulu last year, but didn't much care for it, though I adore Douglas Adams (and yes I know exactly how much involvement he had in developing the series). The series starts out by introducing a whole bunch of subplots and spending relatively little screen time developing the primary relationship between Dirk and Todd. I'd have rather seen further development of the A plotline and their relationship, and then gradual introduction of the others. Or maybe not have Todd? I don't know.
