  the power in code geass is just a set of rules to be munchkined

I disagree. For one, the script explicitly condemns it as a dark power, with Lelouch himself describing it as something that overwhelms "their ethics, their thoughts, and their feelings," that he has chosen to use anyways, knowing this fully.

I think you would do the show a disservice if you took the events at face value only. There's a subtext to the Geass that isn't only for entertainment or plot convenience but is actually the point of the story. At its heart Code Geass is a show about men who could be "kings." To quote one of CC's monologues:

#+begin_quote
  Every man has his day of judgment, does he not? Geass: he who uses this inhuman power will find his heart isolated, whether he wants it that way or not. Thus he plummets into the abyss that lies between good and evil. But if a man can climb out of that abyss into the light, then that man has the soul of a king.

To "climb out of that abyss into the light." Lelouch is a man who wields absolute power, both literally and symbolically. For Lelouch, the entire civil war itself is only an appendage of himself. The battle is utterly indistinguishable from Nunnally's happiness; Lelouch sees almost no value in a victory that does not include his family's good, whether a peaceful world for Nunnally or the solving of their mother's death. Suzaku was correct in his evaluation: "Zero is a lot like my father. He firmly believes that the entire world revolves around him." Hence, when, earlier, Suzaku was revealed as the White Knight- Suzaku, who Lelouch hoped would marry Nunnally and become the knight of her life- we get a glimpse into the darkest side of Lelouch's soul. He can only laugh maniacally, much like he laughs at Euphemia's death, one of the "crosses he has to bear." He laughs because it is funny. As he says in his monologue after Suzaku's phone call, "I mean, of course, you and I are friends..." He continues:

"Perhaps this is what I've longed for ever since that day: the destruction and loss of everything. That's right --- destruction always comes before creation, and for that goal, even my own conscience must be cast aside."

It turns out that absolute power is not absolute, and the more he follows the path of remaking the entire world in his own image, the more he must confront the contradictions of being both powerful and powerless. CC saw this clearly: Lelouch was great not because he was bold or powerful, but because he saw value in the powerless of the world. But Lelouch nevertheless will not renounce the power of Geass, of absolute command, and the darker side of his thoughts is always lurking, a kind of nihilistic desire to use men as pawns for an ultimately selfish "greater good," and to recover his own wounded dignity, at any cost.
