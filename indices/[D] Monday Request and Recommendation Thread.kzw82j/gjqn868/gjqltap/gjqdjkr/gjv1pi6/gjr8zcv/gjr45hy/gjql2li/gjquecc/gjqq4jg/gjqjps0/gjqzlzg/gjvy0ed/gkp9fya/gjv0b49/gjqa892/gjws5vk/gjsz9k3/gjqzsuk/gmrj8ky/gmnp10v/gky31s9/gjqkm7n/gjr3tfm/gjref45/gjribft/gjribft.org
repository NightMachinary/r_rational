The academy part is really early into the series, like early Volume 2, and while the human perspective is initially boring its actually quite important to the overall story, even if it does admittedly start out boring and generic.

The human side is really important to the overarching story, and even without delving into that aspect it provides a lot of great context on powering up and certain skills and lifestyles and how they affect the user, like in the descriptions for Parallel Wills and Appraisal.

The human characters seem generic at first, and well one of them is purposefully made to be “the generic isekai MC” as a complete opposite to Kumoko, from acceptance of reincarnation to motivation to lifestyle. A lot of people were dissatisfied with the early human chapters, but it eventually crescendoes into a climax even more interesting than the MC's.

Like I said, most people who are dissatisfied with the series all seem to drop it very early on before enough clues are laid out and the story really hits its stride. I admit it's a major negative that the story is purposefully generic for several volumes, but what it eventually turns into more than makes up for it. It definitely makes rereading the early volumes and catching all the little hints a lot more enjoyable once everything is clear.

I don't really understand the issue with the MC's strength. Isn't that an inherent weakness of all litrpgs? In Spider there's some legitimate reasons for the weakness of humans in comparison to the monsters and dragons, and even the the MC is never overwhelmingly more powerful than everybody else with the likes of the Ancient Dragons, Queen and Puppet Taratects, and the Demon Lord. She only seems ridiculously powerful compared to humans who live a sheltered life and don't try to seriously become more powerful. Her rise to power given her actions always seemed really reasonable to me, at least compared to other litrpgs and isekais like Azarinth Healer, Delve, Chrysalis, and so on.

It may not be for the more hardcore rational crowd, but for those more rational adjacent and accepting of web/light novels and isekais, I think they'd find it enjoyable. The level of writing certainly isn't as high as professional writers and there are definite issues with how boring the early human POVs are, even if purposefully generic, but despite these slight bumps I found it highly enjoyable. It's far better written than most other light novels, which I guess really just goes to show how poorly written most light novels are, I'll admit.

Perhaps that's because I'm more used to the overwhelming amounts of trashy webnovels, but Spider does legitimately do some cool things in the medium. The way it handles the story relevance of the System and reincarnations adapting or rejecting their new identity is fantastic.

TLDR: It does have its fair share of quality and writing issues innate to the medium, but for those who can handle and enjoy webnovels like those on RoyalRoad, Spider can be quite the interesting read. It starts off seemingly normal and average, but it really does turn everything on its head later on. Every detail, no matter how tiny, has story relevance, no matter how irrelevant it seems at first.
