  The academy part is really early into the series, like early Volume 2

Ah, I guess it was earlier into the series than I realized. Though to be fair, I was reading the web novel and there wasn't much left unread when I dropped it, so it felt more like giving it a proper try than it may seem at this point.

  I don't really understand the issue with the MC's strength. Isn't that an inherent weakness of all litrpgs?

Early on it's fine. She levels and gets more powerful but there's always bigger fish and she's a specialist so she's forced to play it smart. Then she becomes literally indestructible and has nearly infinite offensive capabilities. Reading about someone with godmode on just isn't particularly interesting to me, you know? If your protagonist is Superman, his opponent /must/ have kryptonite.

Perhaps I'm misremembering some details due to how long it's been since I've read it. I read a fair amount of trashy LN/WNs and Kumo always seemed to be a solid, creative start that descended into mediocrity as the author ran out of ideas. Based on how you've said it evolves, evidently the author eventually found a good direction for it to go.
