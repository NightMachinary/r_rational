Second this request, and also do you have a link to the anti-memetic division?

I only have one half-remembered story tip; some time ago I started reading an interesting SCP story where (one of?) the main characters gets injured/killed and lives on in a symbiote of some kind? Very vague memories. It was interesting but I have lost the bookmark so I have no idea what it was called. Ring a bell?
