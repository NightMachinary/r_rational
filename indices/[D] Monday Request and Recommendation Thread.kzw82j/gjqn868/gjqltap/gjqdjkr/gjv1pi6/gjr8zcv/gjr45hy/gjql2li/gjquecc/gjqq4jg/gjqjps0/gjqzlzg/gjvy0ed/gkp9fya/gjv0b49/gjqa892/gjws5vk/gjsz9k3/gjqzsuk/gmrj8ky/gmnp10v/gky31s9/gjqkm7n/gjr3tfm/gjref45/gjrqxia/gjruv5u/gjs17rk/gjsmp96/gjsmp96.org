It's not really the time or efficiency of training, but the training itself that separates Kumoko from others. Your assumption is correct if they're both training against the same enemy and training in the same way. But if a normal human only fights against some weak lv. 10 boar while Kumoko trains against lv. 10 Wyrms, people sized wasps, and minivan sized snakes, she's going to be magnitudes more efficient than a human, especially with a higher density and much higher frequency of combat. Practicing Earth Magic against a lv. 1 rat on the overworld for a month straight might not be even half as efficient as practicing the same Earth magic against say Earth Dragon Alaba for 3 seconds, as skill growth also corresponds to the strength of an enemy.

Humans only train in normal ways too, like swinging a sword or running some laps. They'll completely avoid using or even knowing of Parallel Wills(which seriously fucks up the mind) or grinding resistances. While they might be relatively leisurely practicing sword forms or running, Kumoko would run, use a Parallel Will to cast water magic on herself, use another Parallel Will to cast Earth magic, and then use an Evil Eye to increase gravity on herself. She trains exponentially more than humans, and in exponentially more difficult ways, with exponentially more rewards from living in such a dangerous location.

I do think it's justified quite well too. War may be hellish, but how many normal soldiers would normally constantly stab themselves and set themselves on fire? And then do both simultaneously while running as fast as they can? Kumoko's location and life has led her to a place where this can be considered normal, and upon noticing a certain naked old wizard copying her training methods she calls him crazy. These benefits are even of a completely different category too, as normal humans would miss out on all the high level resistances and passive HP regen. I personally think all this along with Ruler of Pride is sufficient to explain Kumoko's overwhelming strength compared to humans.

Immortality isn't really that OP. It's more of a joke skill that nobody can ever get. It can only be obtained naturally through the Hana Zorowa evolution tree, and in two of the preceding evolutions each one gives a powerful skill but doesn't give the corresponding resistance skill, meaning the first use of the skill would kill them. And it's basically impossible to avoid using those skills. Even if someone managed to reach the final form, Immortality doesn't heal you back. If you lose all your HP, like say through decapitation, you'll just stay as a head with your consciousness still intact forever. You need a passive HP regeneration skill or you're trapped. Even then, if your body is completely obliterated or certain elements are used, you completely die. And at the power levels where you get the skill, enemies like Queen Taratects, Ancient Dragons, Ariel, and Potimas can easily counteract it. The skill is really just a sick prank by D, as isn't immortality a goal humans would give everything up for?

Immortality digression aside, I don't have any defense for her other OP skills like Pride, Perserverance, Sloth, and Wisdom.

Kumoko makes mistakes and can be a bit silly at times, but I don't think it's any more egregious than Lindon's progression in Cradle. Plot armor really is the unavoidable failing in progression fantasies, depending on how much you criticize each one, I suppose.

I don't disagree that Spider is a popcorn read. It is a light novel after all, and isn't meant to be anywhere near as rational, professional, and gritty as something like say Worm.

Among light novels, litrpgs, and isekais though, I do think it is much better than the rest. It's a fun and popcorn read, not a serious and deep read.

It's like the isekai In-N-Out compared to the norm of isekai McDonalds. Never said it was hardcore rational or not a popcorn novel, imo it's a fantastic light and rational adjacent novel. Nothing wrong with that, is there?

There's no point to really quibble over this minutiae when the MC buys 8 Evil Eye skills solely because it'd be cool and chuuni to have 8 separate deadly abilities coming from each of her eyes. As far as isekais and litrpgs go, its one of the most well thought out, but it's definitely nowhere near the likes of works like MoL and HPMOR. For the intents of what the OP asked for, I'd say this series fits the bill.
