In a world like this where there is XP, a person training in a yard 8 hours a day for years would be weaker than a person killing a single high level monster. If the humans here do not regularly go out and kill stronger and stronger monsters (which they don't) they wouldn't get stronger than her no matter how long they trained. XP means that only the strength of the monster you defeat matters for power.

It seems someone beet me to the spoiler, the reason for both of those as they said is: She is actually the soul of a spider, the god gave her a shard of herself to make her sentient. This explains her power and her "spider" tendencies.
