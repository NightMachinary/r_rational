On the point of other people's power in comparison to hers, there's only like six people who put in anywhere near the effort, and it's not really the effort that sets her apart, it's her insanity, in a way.

The only six comparable people in stats in the world are the Demon Lord Ariel, the strongest human Mage Ronandt, the reincarnator Sophia, her butler Merazophis, the reincarnator Wrath, and the Hero Julius.

Ariel is at essentially the peak of the System, and that's due to her never dying and gradually improving over 1,000 years, as well as holding the pretty broken Ruler of Gluttony skill.

Julius is the Hero. His soul is very weak so he doesn't have the capability to improve as much as the reincarnators and Kumoko does. He doesn't grind his abilities either, only fighting with necessary and doesn't hurt himself for resistances and doesn't farm in the Great Elroe Labyrinth full of powerful and high EXP enemies.

Sophia and Merazophis are both put through Kumoko's hellish training regimen, and by the end of it they become some of the most powerful beings in the System, and they start off as a baby and a mediocre and average civilian. Sophia is far stronger than Mera due to starting fresh and gaining more benefit from the stat-increasing skills and having a fresh soul.

Wrath doesn't go through the same training as Sophia and Mera initially, but all the killing he does is far more than virtually any other being, and he still gets Kumoko's training at the end. He also goes through one of the most painful lives on the planet as well, as additional fuel and motivation for his leveling.

Ronandt doesn't have any special abilities and also has a weak soul, but he gets powerful after studying Kumoko and practicing the way she does. Using attacks on yourself grinds both the relevant skill and the relevant resistance, as well as some others like Pain Resistance and HP Regeneration. But if you really think about it, isn't it insane to just hurt oneself like that? It's not so easy to do, especially with all the pain and damage. Ronandt, Sophia, and Kumoko all remark on how insane this training method is.

She minmaxes all her skills, and it really requires mental fortitude that only living in the hell that is the Great Elroe Labyrinth forces someone to do. Even humans and demons in war time can't possibly comprehend such a nightmarish training.

She starts out eating her sibling and spends most of her time at death's door. It makes sense why she's uninhibited by things like Parallel Wills, constantly hurting herself, eating the most nasty things possible, and so on that no human/demon would willingly subject themselves to. It's like constantly stabbing yourself with a sword to remove your sense of pain and strengthen your body. Would you constantly do that, and when it doesn't hurt as much or effect you anymore, keep on moving on to larger, sharper, and more painful and destructive implements? Or be forced to walk 2 miles on foot everyday as a baby?

When Kumoko trains the 10th Army, a bunch of Demon losers and rejects, she forces them through her hellish training and despite them being bottom of the barrel recruits and having weak souls they still average out at 1k stats.

And it's not just that either. Kumoko has the Ruler of Pride skill for a lot of her journey, which especially complements her.

More could be done optimizing her fighting style like with tools and armor, I'll admit on that front. There's a lot of potential and room for more optimization for sure. Still, I don't think it detracts from the overall experience that much. Spider isn't exactly rational and in a medium like light novels, surely this fault can be forgiven, haha.

But on the point of overtaking others, I don't think she overtakes anyone that she shouldn't have, since as a whole they're relatively sheltered and weak. There's a couple of points that aren't written that well, but as a whole it's far less egregious than in most every other litrpg I've read, like in Azarinth Healer or Chrysalis or all the crappy ones where everything is completely unbalanced and spoonfed to the MC.
