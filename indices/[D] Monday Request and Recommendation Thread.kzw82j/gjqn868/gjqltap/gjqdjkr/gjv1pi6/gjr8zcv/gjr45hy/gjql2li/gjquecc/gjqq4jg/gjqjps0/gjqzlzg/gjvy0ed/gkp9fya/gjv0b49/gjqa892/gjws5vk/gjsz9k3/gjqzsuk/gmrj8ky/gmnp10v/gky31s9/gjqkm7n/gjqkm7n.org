I'll recommend Daniel Abraham as an author. Basically all of his series change genre from book to book, to a greater or lesser extent. I did a bigger writeup [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/826k1r/d_monthly_recommendation_thread/dv8kz2s/][here]], but the gist of it is that he writes a good Book 1 in each series with world-changing consequences resulting from the events, then /the world changes/ as a result of those events, and we go on to Book 2 in a changed world.

The Long Price quartet fits that pattern (of time passing and things changing) /very/ well, while The Dagger and the Coin and the Expanse fit it in broad strokes.
