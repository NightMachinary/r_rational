This happens in a lot of Lawrence Watt-Evans novels - not quite with "foreshadowing", but with the events making clear sense by story logic; the point, as I'd see it, is that in real life plots don't obey neat dramatic sequences and things can happen because the world works like that, rather than them needing to be foreshadowed. I continue to think /The Misenchanted Sword/ is a nice place to start.
