She really only has godmode on compared to humans, and in the place she was born it's literally inhospitable to humans. Even the strongest humans can't beat some of the more average powerful monsters like the mid-level dragons like Alaba or S-class monsters like Arch Taratects by themselves. There's a very good reason why this cave in particular is full of such powerful monsters everywhere that don't want to escape and destroy humanity, but that's spoilers for the overarching plot.

Humans can barely handle the Upper Layer with the equivalent of mobs like Snakes, much less the armies of powerful Taratects and Dragons on the lower layers. There's no need for them to explore down there either, as there's nothing of value there. Well, nothing conventionally at least.

In that context there's some unsavoriness with Kumoko's rise to power if you don't agree on how she gets Ruler of Pride(boosted EXP and skill gain) and Ruler of Wisdom, which allows her virtually unparalleled information, for almost nothing, which explains why she's /the/ one that becomes so powerful but might be a bit unreasonable.

All this really isn't the part of the story that fans like anyways, although most will say that the litrpg segments are better than what most other series do, with typically ridiculous power scaling, asspulls, and an incomprehensible System.

The litrpg section disappears once she reaches a certain point and the story moves into a new direction and explores the underlying conflict that turns all the elements onto its head. So it stops right when the litrpg bits start to overstay their welcome, although there are a few that also dislike how the story moves away from being litrpg and how the MC breaks away from the System, but that's an argument for another time.

I suppose it all just comes down to how much you can stomach litrpg and trashy web novels and light novels. If you only read stuff from professional authors or from writers as skilled as wildbow, Spider will probably be disappointing. But if you enjoy such web novels and isekais and translated works, Spider is really good.

I'd say it's like the same for the Chinese Cultivation webnovel Forty Milleniums of Cultivation. If you're not used to translated webnovel quality and cultivation novels and tropes, you might find it unbearable. But if you're used to translated novels and read a lot of Cultivation trash, Forty Milleniums becomes amazing and one of the best in the genre.

That's how I personally feel about Spider and what it does for the trash-filled isekai genre. You earlier complained about the generic human characters, of which I assume you primarily refer to Shun, the human protagonist character that serves as a deconstruction of the generic isekai MC.

He serves an interesting purpose through being bland. He's how a normal average Japanese high school boy should act, as a normal boring average high school boy. Despite reincarnating as a prince, he still clings to his previous identity and modern Japanese beliefs, and can't fully accept the new world and it's cruelty. He lacks the conviction, motivation, and drive to change the overarching conflict, which literally concerns the entire planet and every living being, for which there is no easy solution, so he ends up unable to change anything or alter the situation.

There are other reincarnators that juxtapose with him, like the high school girl bully Fei that reincarnates into a baby dragon and reflects on her past and changes, his best friend who reincarnates into a female body and struggles between these two identities and eventually accepts his new identity, emotions, and situation, and aggressive classmate Hugo who is both the same as him yet completely different, stuck in a different fantasy and unable to fully accept his new reality.

There's a lot of similarly cool twists and subversions of isekai tropes like the 1000 year old loli Demon Lord(unironically the best and most well-written character of the story), Hero vs. Demon Lord conflict, Gods, reincarnation, medieval fantasy world, elves, and so on.
