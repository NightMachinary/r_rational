I say hate the C++ C P, not the CP (Chinese people). The author has very little power in that situation. It's easy to say you'd do differently, but to do other than he did would be to risk torture, death, and serious consequences for family and even friends. And yeah, I garbled that on purpose, I dodn't need bots following me around.
