Check out [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52693586-timberwolf][Timberwolf by Dominic Adler]], one of the best SPFBO entries I've ever read, certainly the most polished. I don't think I can do the book justice with a summary, but I'll try:

#+begin_quote
  A high-fantasy military story with dieselpunk undertones set in an alternate world weimar germany just as it gets taken over by the party(nazi-analogues with soviet undertones).

  The protagonist is Axel Geist, a concentration camp convict who only wants to survive the war, but gets caught up in the machinations of the Old Gods and is set to infiltrating the regime by joining the Timberwolf Legion (the equivalent of the SS) in order to cut the cancer out from the inside.

Even though I generally despise urban fantasy and alternate-history fantasy, I loved every second of this 500 page story. Give it a try.
