Assume somebody has had say 100 years to train. Say they train 1h per day. That's 36500h of training. If Spider bro trained 24/7/365 she'd have trained 8760h in a year.

Even if you assume her training is 3x as effective she'd still be behind others. Time makes a big difference.

She takes several stupid risks, and should have died many times over. She's alive because of plot armor, luck and OP skills that are dumb like immortality.

If the excuse for her power is that she put herself in stupid situations and survived because the author gave her plot armor it's a bad excuse..

I don't read the worst things available so I can't discuss the comparison. It's a popcorn read as far as I'm concerned.
