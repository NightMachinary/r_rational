- [[https://www.novelupdates.com/series/release-that-witch/][/Release that Witch/]] --- explores technological uplifting, industrialisation quite thoroughly. Does a very good job at describing and explaining the physics and chemistry behind the introduced technologies, as well as the social changes that happen due to the industrialisation. Also occasionally puts various characters in the limelight to explore their subjective / limited perspective on the system. Drawback: closer to the end the quality drops rather noticeably.
- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32807/dark-skies][/Dark Skies/]] --- similar to the above, but for good description and explanation of life and culture in medieval Europe.
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender][/Avatar: tLA/]] --- many have been praising this for its detailed and accurate portrayal of Asian culture.
