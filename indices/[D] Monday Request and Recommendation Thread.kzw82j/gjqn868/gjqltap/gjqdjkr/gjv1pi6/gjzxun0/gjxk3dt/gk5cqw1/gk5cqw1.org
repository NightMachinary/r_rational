Every Neil Stevenson book has one or sometimes two fields that he delves into as part of the plot. In Snow Crash it's Sumerian mythology and virtual reality, in Anathem it's linguistics(on a meta-narrative level) and maybe the scientific method, with forays into astronomy and math, in Cryptonomicon it's cryptology and a bit of cryptocurrency. The baroque cycle trilogy has a half dozen or so different topics, but the main ones I can recall right now are the scientific method, economics and currency.

Even though I've found his last 3 or 4 books increasingly terrible it's testament to how incredible his good books are that Neil Stevenson is still among my favorite authors.
