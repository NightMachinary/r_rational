Lots of people liked it, but IMO it was pretty bad. Simply the fact that there are two *major* characters that are pretty obviously stand-ins for real life people, Neil deGrasse Tyson and Hillary Clinton, and that a sizeable minority of readers caught that without prompting should tell you a lot about the quality of the plot. On top of that, Hillary is the major antagonist of the second third of the book while, you know, the moon is blowing up and all of humanity is dying! And her motivations are childishly portrayed, it basically boils down to pure selfishness and cowardice, which feels very, very unnecessary and hackneyed. Truly disappointing.

And the books after that don't really get better. Reamde had a lot of good parts, but overall felt Stephenson was trying to cross off movie adaptation from his bucket list, and D.O.D.O was co-authored and felt like it(boring plot and prose). Finally Fall; or, Dodge in Hell, which despite having one of the plausible premises of all his books was extremely fast and loose with the verisimilitude, and boring as fuck to boot. Trying to crib on Milton and Tolkien, simultaneously? After his recent record? That's pure hubris.
