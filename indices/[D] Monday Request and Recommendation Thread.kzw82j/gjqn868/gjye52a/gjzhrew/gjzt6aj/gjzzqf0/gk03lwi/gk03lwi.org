Maybe you're right. I do indeed read more Wuxia than Xianxia, so maybe my perception of a typical Xianxia world is warped.

However, I just don't see that "The only way to win is not to play." applies in this case. All the things you describe are still there, whether you are actively cultivating or not. The only thing /not/ cultivating does is to increase the amount of people who can randomly take everything that belongs to you in such a world.

Sure, the odds are overwhelmingly against me changing the world for the "better". But, I don't really see a choice. I wouldn't even have "ignorance is bliss" on my side, that lets the average mortal live his life in some illusion of safety.
