How would you know if anyone else figured it out? "Before enlightenment, chop wood and carry water. After enlightenment, chop wood and carry water."

The story is setup that cultivation isn't just spiritual workout. It requires a particular mindset, and deviating from that mindset can see your Qi /instantly/ become soured before you even start to take any actions.

Anyone who lives in accordance with this cultivation method will grow powerful and then ascend within their normal lifespan. They wouldn't found a school or build an empire, because doing that is antithetical to the cultivation method. They might teach it to their friends and family, but any of them who try to use it for evil will be corrupted and unable to actually progress with the method.

If anyone else is using this method you couldn't know, because it would look identically to them not using it. The only difference is that the occasional random village would have a powerful hidden master protecting it, or certain random areas after those masters ascend would be blessed to have more QI in the land with better plants and animals... and that's what Xianxia already looks like.
