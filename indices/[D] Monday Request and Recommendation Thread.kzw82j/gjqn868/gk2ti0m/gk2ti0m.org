Seems to update every day, or almost every day, and so far has been really enjoyable, although it's still early.

I'm a /little/ concerned because it looks like the MC may have gotten (or is in the process of getting) a pretty massive power boost for very little effort, and in a way that should have been available to any other cultivator and also shouldn't have been /that/ hard to discover. We will have to see how it turns out though.

So far, as long as you don't mind hopping on stories relatively early, I second this recommendation.
