  To find yourself in a world where the path to eternal youth is known and achievable and to just say "No, I'm gonna live on my farm and die in 50 years, bye!" is just not something I can respect.

Getting transmigrated into another world is strong evidence that some variant of the simulation hypothesis/multiverse theory/the afterlife exists, so you don't need to worry about becoming immortal as a goal unto itself anyways. It's still in your best interest to live rather than die because without more evidence it's hard to guess whether most lives are utility-positive, but doing utility-negative things to get immortality is senseless.
