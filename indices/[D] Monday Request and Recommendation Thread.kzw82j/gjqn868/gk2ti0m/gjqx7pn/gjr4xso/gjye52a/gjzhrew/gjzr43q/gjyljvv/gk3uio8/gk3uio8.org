This is assuming there's no in between. Either you become immortal or you die at 60.

​

Cultivation in general tends to increase lifespan so, any investment you can put into it that's not too costly should be considered reasonable..

​

Also most cultivation MCs tend to fight without safeguards, put a smart MC there and he'd be fighting via puppets, clones, servants or make the xianxia equivalent of a phylactery.

​

Risking death is kind of dumb, specially when there are other options. Defense is the most important thing, and it's not focused on enough. If you die that's it, if you then decide to put yourself in dangerous situations then you better have a safeguard. Most authors just rely on plot armor..
