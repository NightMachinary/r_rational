  He Who Fights With Monsters - the recent time-skip was a little jarring. It had looked like the world was looking at a slow ramp-up, but the antagonists have really turned up the tension. Still waiting for the Asya subplot to get going.

It was necessary for pacing IMO. Nothing particularly interesting or relevant to the plot would have happened during that time, it's just "Jason levels up."

I suppose I'll do a similar list. Other than HWFWM, stories I'm reading:

- Apocalypse: Generic System (by author of Wake of the Ravager). I'm a Patreon supporter of this author and this story is even better than WoTR IMO. I'm in the same boat with not being fussed about WoTR right now but A: GS is great. Not available for free as it's on Amazon, but you can read it for $1 on [[https://www.patreon.com/Macronomicon][Patreon]]. As per title, it's a system apocalypse litrpg

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/33020/blessed-time][Blessed Time]]. Fairly standard time loop/litrpg but it's decently written and hasn't yet dropped to that threshold of quality where I lose interest, so I'm still reading.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13574944/1/Brockton-s-Celestial-Forge][Brockton's Celestial Forge]]. Worm OC tinker who gets a version of Inspired Inventor from CYOA. Weekly chapters, but they're very long. Look forward to every one.

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36983/tower-of-somnus][Tower of Somnus]]. Haven't read this up to the latest chapter yet, but planning to. Decent story. (By author of Blessed Time - I think this one is better actually). Cyberpunk/litrpg+aliens, set on a future earth
