I'm going to recommend an HP fic:[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense][The Pureblood Pretense]], as well as it's sequels. It's a light crossover with the Alanna the Lioness series.

Basic plot is that Riddle became a politician instead of a terrorist and as a result purebloods have basically taken over wizarding Britain to the point that Hogwarts is pureblood only but there wasn't a first wizarding war so everyone's alive. Fem!Harry wants to go to Hogwarts so she switches places with pureblood childhood friend who is Sirius Black's son.

*PROS*

Harry is pretty close to rational in that she has a very concrete goal (studying potions with Snape) and systemically pursues it, with allowances to be made for her age. There's a lot of very fun worldbuilding around magic systems and the ways in which Harry explores them will likely be appealing to anyone who enjoyed the experimental early parts of HPMOR. The book also does a better job of exploring magical academia than just about anything else I've seen. It's also good about fair play. Most solutions to problems build on or come directly from previously established magical capabilities. Also, the first three books are complete, and the fourth has only an epilogue to go.

*Caveats*

Though the beginning was fun, the first book dragged admittedly bit in the middle. From 75% of the way through the first book on through the rest of the series it was binge worthy. Considering that that's about ~100K into a 1M+ series, I'd say it was worthwhile, but YMMV. Writing quality starts out okay and improves dramatically at about that 75% mark. The child characters never really talk like children, but they stop sounding like they're from Pride and Prejudice once the author hits her stride.

Overall it was a fun read with something for just about anyone, so if you're looking for a long close to rational exploration of an interesting AU of wizarding Britain then give it a look.
