Not entirely what you're looking for, Steven Brust's Vlad Taltos series is like this. Each book is a different genre. One book is a murder mystery, while another is a proletariat revolution, while another is the story of an assassination, and another could be a battle between gods and the systemic breakdown of magic. There's a deeper lore behind the history and state of the world too, and Vlad's role in it. It's pretty fun, and sometimes tongue in cheek.
