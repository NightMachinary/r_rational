Liu Cixin only has access to censored news, like other Chinese citizens. His interview remarks simply parroted what his government-controlled news is telling him.

It seems nasty to blame Chinese authors for their government lying to them, especially when the lies don't appear to actually be repeated by the author's books.

Or should we not recommend Harry Potter to kids, because JK Rowling turned out later to be a trans-hater? If it's still okay to think Harry Potter books are good books, how can we anti-rec Chinese authors for their government's deceiving them?

Rowling had access to uncensored news; she could easily learn the truth. Chinese authors don't even have that option.
