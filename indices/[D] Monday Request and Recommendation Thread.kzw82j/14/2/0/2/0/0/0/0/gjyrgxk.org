Eh, I don't think that's an unreasonable position. And I actually think the novels are a bit overrated. (Well, only read one.) But in that environment not affirming something can be taken as being against it. I think it might be actually kind of hard to conceptualize from a WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic) perspective, but survival in a society like that does typically require internalizing the ideas. It's a rare (and admirable, but still rare) person who can keep two realities fully in mind. And people are listening and paying attention, and a demure clip can go viral. See what happened to a (will remain nameless) CEO who said one wrong thing, one of the richest people in the world and taken out of it. And, honestly, the fact that the abuses you reference aren't front and center in our discourse is a disgrace. But I also (personally, reasonable people can disagree) can only blame individuals so much when they are trapped in that environment. Anyway, off topic, so I'll just upvote any response you make and end it there. :)
