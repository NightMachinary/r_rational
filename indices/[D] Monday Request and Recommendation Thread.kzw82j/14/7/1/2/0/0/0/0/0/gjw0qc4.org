You seem to dismiss my point because apparently training isn't enough of an approximation in your mind to XP/h ? Cool..

Justifying bad writing by comparing it to worst writing isn't really a good argument.

Humans aren't the only entities around. Even if they were, some potentially could get skills that extend their life expectancy.

Also let me go ahead and say that I find the story enjoyable. I don't hate it or anything, I just think there are problems and pointed them out. This is getting weirdly combative and that was not my intention.
