I personally found the early volumes interesting and exciting enough, although that does appear to be a point of contention among many. It's quite a popular series among the isekai/litrpg/lightnovel/anime communities as far as I've seen, and is arguably better than most others in the medium and genre, even if that honestly means as little as dirt.

I do suppose that it's not a series fit for those with a more rational bent on this sub. I guess you have to be a light novel/web novel reader to enjoy this sort of stuff.

In my defense, I wouldn't say the early volumes are boring, just more typical. But fair point, those early bits have turned off a few people.
