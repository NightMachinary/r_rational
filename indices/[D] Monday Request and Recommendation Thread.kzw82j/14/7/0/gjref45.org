Eh, I just didn't care about the story after a certain point. She's far, far too powerful and the story stops even really being about her. It has been years since I read it, but I dropped it when there was some kind of academy filled with seemingly randomly generated characters, doing a bunch of stuff that had no impact on the story at large.

It felt like I was reading some amateur's snippets thread on SpaceBattles rather than a proper published novel; random vignettes that the author found interesting but was unable/unwilling to make into a cohesive story.
