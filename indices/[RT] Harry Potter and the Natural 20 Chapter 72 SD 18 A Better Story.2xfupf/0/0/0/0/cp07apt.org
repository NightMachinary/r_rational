Usually you find the hospital that you were born at and get their records. But even then it's a process. I've had to get a new social security card (my first one was misspelled and made the government think I was an identity thief) and it mostly involved going to a lot of different offices and producing documentation that reduced the odds that I had just faked all that stuff.
