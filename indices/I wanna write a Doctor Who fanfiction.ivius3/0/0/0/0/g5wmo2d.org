Sounds like a plan.

In that case, might I suggest you do a new Time Lord who has some sort of connection to the Doctor but a slightly different worldview, personality, and goals? You can ease the character in 'behind the scenes' from a known event involving the Doctor, and branch out from there.

I'll give some examples.

Both I and a friend of mine once had ideas for writing our own Doctor Who stories involving a new Time Lord. The thing was, we weren't friends when we came up with them, but later told each other about it and found out we had done something similar but in completely different directions. We both wanted to do an "Anti-Doctor", focusing on some different aspect of his personality or nature, but came up with wildly different interpretations.

--------------

His version was called the "Healer". Rather than a Doctor who is professional about 'fixing' a problem for the best result, his Healer was more focused on the personal aspect of helping others out in need. He didn't care so much for preventing calamities or worrying about messing up the timeline so much as he cared about helping *people* who were directly affected by tragedies. Where the Doctor tends to be more aloof, the Healer was more caring. Where the Doctor was more introverted, the Healer was more extroverted. Where the Doctor tried not to interfere but, when pressed, would change events when his back was against the wall, the Healer would simply avoid that conflict altogether and save whatever lives he could.

The exterior of his TARDIS always looked like whatever a sufficiently large tree-equivalent was for that world. It's interior was less tech control room and more of a fantasy tavern combined with a Zen garden, and he would have no problem taking individual refugees of calamities on board to find them new homes in the space-timeline. Its personality is generally that of a helpful nursing home assistant with a bubbly personality, and it enjoys visiting places of wonder and beauty to bask in while sharing the view with the current occupants.

--------------

My Anti-Doctor equivalent went a completely different way. Mine was called the Janitor. If a Doctor is a white-collar type who solves people's health problems, then the Janitor was more of a blue-collar type who cleans up the messes of the Time War and other temporal snafu's. The Janitor was never a Time Lord, as he did not become a doctor of anything, but he had hard work ethic and would set his own goals, even if he grumbled constantly about having to do all the real work. The Janitor generally avoided interfering if he could help it (as he would then set himself the task of cleaning up the mess), but sometimes would anyway if doing so would cause less issues farther down the line.

The Janitor's TARDIS was actually a decomissioned military TARDIS equipped with a potent weapon called a "Paradox Corrector". It could not only eliminate targets from the timeline, but also 'correct' all the paradoxes inherent in their erasure. It only used this weapon in war a single time before it flipped out, went rampant, and became an uber-pacifist, vowing never to use its weapon on living targets again. The Janitor lacks the Rassilon Imprimatur (as he never became a Time Lord), but after the War TARDIS witnessed his dedication to his job, it chose to override its programming to allow him to pilot it--the Janitor has been doing so for so long now he just sort of does it by 'feel'. Now, it only ever fires its weapon to correct temporal anomalies once the Janitor has proven beyond doubt that no living being will be adversely affected. Its interior is similar to the ones seen in the show, but its exterior is almost always cloaked in such a way that it appears as the world's equivalent to a Port-A-John or outhouse.

Together, the Janitor and his TARDIS are the /reason/ many of the wibbly-wobbly stuff exists, or that the Doctor and other Time Lords can get away with paradoxical alterations to the timeline. This poor guy goes along behind them to clean up their mess, grumbling all the while, and none of the other Time Lords even know he exists and does the job because he's not on their roster.

--------------

Both my friend and I followed a similar idea (make an Anti-Doctor), but the end results were vastly different. The best part is we did this before we ever met each other, but after we shared our stories, we decided that they existed in the same universe and would sometimes contact each other when they ran into a problem that required the other's specialty.

Bit of a long rant, but hopefully it gives you ideas as to what you can try, if you don't have any already. Focus on your goals and your what you want your main character to be, then build outward from there.
