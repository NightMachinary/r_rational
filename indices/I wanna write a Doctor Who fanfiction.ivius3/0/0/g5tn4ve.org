Fanfic generally falls under *two* primary categories.

1) The author wants to use the characters. The main characters are all the same people but they make different choices, usually at some key event, and the author explores the changes that snowball out from that point and the new choices they make, and how it affects the world. That, or they are used to 'continue' events past whatever work they are found in.

2) The author wants to use the world. The main characters of the original work exist, but are off somewhere else and may not even interact with the new characters. The new characters often have to deal with the fallout of the others choices, and in some cases may actually cause the problems the ones in the original work encounter.

Usually, but not always, an IP's fanfic tends to favor one category over the other. It's my speculation that the reason for this depends on how much and for how long (how many multiple works) the original IP focuses on its main characters.

Things like Harry Potter, Supernatural, or Doctor Who focus on anywhere from one to a small handful of primary main characters, and the entire series tends to be focused on them from beginning to end.

Things like Star Wars or Star Trek, on the other hand, tend to focus on a different, larger groups of characters over time and often changes them out in 'generations' for another group. We often see different sides and viewpoints over time as the group and world changes.

But even if an IP tends to have fanfiction of one type, that doesn't mean you can't write it for the other. Any sufficiently long series will invariably expand its world and have many interesting characters.
