I mean, new regenerations are part of the established canon. Each one is still recognizably the same character, the Doctor, while each is also a distinctive, unique incarnation of that character as well. If you can pull that off, I see no reason why you shouldn't. There's enough commonality that readers could go in with an understanding of the character.

Your initial post sounded like it might have been suggesting a new Doctor who wasn't /the/ Doctor, and I agree with the other poster that I don't see what the point would be. With as varied a setting and as wibbly-wobbly a backstory as the Whoniverse has, the main character and premise are the big constants; if you're ditching those, you'd do just as well, or perhaps better, to start from scratch.
