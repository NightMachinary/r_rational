There's lots of ways to go with DrWho FF. Having a TARDIS is a convenient plot device for exploring various times and places. Maybe you have a new take on the Cybermen, Daleks, etc..

Years and years ago I had an idea for a 6th Doctor story with Peri. The intent (at the time) was to explain why we don't see much / any use of molecular nanotechnology (MNT) in the universe.

It started with the TARDIS cruising along and hitting a rough patch of spacetime. The Doctor stops and investigates (because he's curious as a cat), and eventually figures out that a portion of the universe has been "pinched off" and a new, small, pocket universe has been created.

The Doctor figures out how to cross over, and does. Inside the pocket universe is a single star system with a few planets. Two are inhabited by a seemingly weird yet technologically advanced "civilizations".

Originally, a small research team was working on MNT, when the Timelords discovered them, decided they were dangerous, and separated them from the rest of the universe because they were afraid of another self-replicating hedgemonizing swarm worse than the Daleks.

The research team split into two groups, one going heavily into AGI, uploading their minds, and making advanced robots. The other group went heavily into human cloning, biological modifications, and such (though they still have some robots and such too). There's a big morality conflict between them as well as a "limited to a single solar system with limited resources" problem.

Both sides see the TARDIS as a ticket out of the pocket dimension, which somewhat resembles [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Doctor%27s_Wife][The Doctor's Wife]] situation that I saw years later. Shenanigans ensue.
