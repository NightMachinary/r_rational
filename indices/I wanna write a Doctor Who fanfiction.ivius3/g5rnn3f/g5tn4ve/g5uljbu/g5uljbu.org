My intent, or perhaps desire, is to introduce a Time Lord, or maybe another 'doctor' of sorts. I don't know. I have an idea of creating a different personality for a doctor. Not too different from the fact that every doctor has a different personality themselves.

The main interest is to use the world, and have self-contained stories within each chapter. And maybe even at some point, introduce an overarching narrative.

I basically want to copy the basic formula of the show, and put my own spin on it, with a character that's familiar, but different.
