I do get where you're coming from with that. Explaining the serious inconsistencies with the most recent doctor is definitely something that could be wanted in a fanfiction.

However, I have a question.

What's stopping you from writing this yourself? It's an amazing idea, and You should write it!!

I would write it, if I didn't already have a structurized idea of what I want with what I might make.
