What about instead you rewrite the last tv season, with a serious twist: just, hear me out, ok ?

Missy is mysteriously back and stalking the « fam », always in lockstep with them but helping from behind the figurative curtains, yet clearly trying to get back at the doctor.

Meanwhile the inconsistencies of the female doctor's behaviour (plenty to pick from the tv season there, just repeat and amplify, like her dismissing cancer because awkward) ramp up over time to the point where the companions start being genuinely afraid of her.

In the end you reveal that « the doctor » was really a seriously confused Missy who took the doctor's place and unconsciously adopted their identity out of sheer will to « be good » (be the good one) at the end of the previous season. The « Missy » that was stalking them all is the actual Doctor (but holding some if not most of Missy's actual lost memories, as excessive cumulated regenerations and too woven timelines have mashed and then ‘split' the two timelords wrong, somewhat simultaneously), and has been torn all along between taking the role back, punishing the past Master in the present, and mentoring a worthy successor.
