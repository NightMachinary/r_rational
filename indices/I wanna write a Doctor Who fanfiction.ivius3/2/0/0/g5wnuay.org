Thanks, but the thing is that I'm not a Doctor Who fan, I've simply watched the newer seasons (9th doctor I think ?) and I am only interested in finding ways for fixing bad sequels or prequels of popular franchises (i.e. I have similar concepts for reworking Star Wars, though not a fan of that either).
