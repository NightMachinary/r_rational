You could have a system where people work the time they would normally spend asleep, and have their brains jacked into an AI or have an AI module that feeds info, stimulants, and other hormones to the brain. In this future, we can offload and reload memories, but we cannot yet create a structure as capable of learning and as cheap as a human brain. Perhaps the AI personalities are all long-dead human "uploads" who only live when their hosts are at work, and generally ignore what their original host was like. They might even switch bodies constantly as necessary.
