Dystopias are fucking boring and played out. Use this idea in a story with a functional, personal-freedom-filled /Utopia/ and you have the start of one *hell* of a story.

Hint: some scientific knowledge really shouldn't be /public/ knowledge.

--------------

What happens when everyday businesses require the use and knowledge of tech that could be as easily abused as weaponized NBC threats? For example, this off-hours mind wipe could be one way to defend against nanotech misuse. When not in a controlled and heavily monitored environment of an office or factory, you can't be allowed to know how to use and program nano assemblers. Not the pushing the buttons part, but the gritty scientific and engineering details.

Instead of merely having no user serviceable parts, unmonitored minds simply aren't allowed scientific knowledge of this technology. No one can be trusted with that knowledge, nor can any fancy and exploitable expert systems.

AIs working this tech are right out, as that level of freedom of action plus paranoid control systems to try to implement "friendliness" always leads to disasters. In fact, how to make human-level plus AIs is another controlled branch of science. Humans, with moral systems tied into complicated socialization pressures can /barely/ be trusted in secure and self-contained facilities.

Any neighborhood-class nanofab center could be tuned to make weapons of mass destruction by someone determined enough, and with the right knowledge. This is how they work. Safety systems can always be disabled. Physical access is required, and that means any nanofab could be "owned" and turned into a WMD factory. Thus, this technology firewall. And it works, managing to put the genie back in the bottle.

Until our protagonist finds out that someone at their office is cheating the system. The mentally unstable person has already written a manifesto explaining what they've done, and published it where it will be found after millions have died. That our protagonist even knows about this is a massive coincidence, and because they thought something was wrong with their coworker so they went snooping that day. Just barely in time to discover the plot. Turns out, they've been removing their obsessive and insane thoughts /before going to work/, then putting them back again when they get home. Where they currently are, with a brain full of WMD science.

This is going down /now/. Everyone trusts the system and it'll take way too long to make anyone in authority believe this threat exists. If they don't believe the protagonist, the authorities will be in position to slow them (and not the would-be mass murderer) down, so they can't even try warning anyone while not knowing if it will work. From outside, the manifesto looks like it could be a smoke screen, and they certainly won't allow our hero to try to fix this themselves. Only personal daily interactions with someone slowly sliding into insanity is proof that this is really happening. The automated monitoring systems didn't trigger, after all, and the mad-person passed their psych evals as well.

The only sure way to counter the insane actions of this lone maniac is for our protagonist to use the same exploit before it's too late. They reload all their dangerous scientific knowledge outside the office and set out to throw together their own nano-tech counter weapons to protect the innocent victims and take out the nascent gray goo engine. The advantage they have is, they're not crazy, and can think straight about how to go about being the hero of the hour. Shame no one will be able to recognize which of them is the insane terrorist until it's too late, so our hero might be stomped on with the same boot once the utility dust settles.

Of course...our hero is working on really thin data about this threat. And their significant other did just leave them. And their luddite-fundamentalist mom recently died after refusing advanced nano-therapy...which is something our hero is going to do without asking to protect people in the neighborhood, with the side-effect of removing that personal choice from hundreds of thousands of people. And...maybe this whole thing was a security test IT was running. The exploit didn't work /exactly/ the way the manifesto suggested, after all...

Part way through, illegal knowledge able to destroy cities filling their brain and a basement factory full of bushbots, our hero stops to consider that maybe they aren't all that well themselves.

--------------

The end could go a number of ways, few of them good for people within a few hundred miles. Yes, there would be a military/security system response. Yes, our hero thinks it will be too late by the time they show up. And yes, being late, the security force's response will kill tens of thousands of people to save millions.

That's my take on a rational story on the whys of removing knowledge from a brain after working hours, without the dystopia bullshit these sorts of stories always involve.

You could also do something with magic and demon summoning and blah blah blah, but I prefer this set up.
