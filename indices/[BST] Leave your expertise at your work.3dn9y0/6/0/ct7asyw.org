  because working at a company which adopts this technology massively stunts an employee's long-term earning potential, such companies have to pay substantially more than other similar companies

+I feel like there's another stable equilibrium where everyone does it, anyone that /didn't/ do it would be put at a disadvantage because all their employees would be poached away, and for the employee it means you /really/ don't want to change job, because it means starting to build your experience from scratch.+ You covered that... and I need to read more closely before commenting.

And now I'm picturing a story where someone gets hired at a basic entry-level position only to discover that they've actually been /re-hired/ (let's say they have an implant that stores memories that can only be unlocked with the right employer-provided crypto key, so they aren't deleted when you leave, just rendered inaccessible, and if you return they're re-enabled... and also the memory of having ever worked there is part of the protected set).

So maybe in a former phase of their life they were higher up in the company until they learned /inconvenient secrets/ or got ejected by cut-throat corporate politics, and now they're a janitor with those secrets, using them to take revenge.
