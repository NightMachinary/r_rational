This means that every time I'd hire someone, I'd be getting a completely fresh trainee. There'd be no way to staff a team with mid-career professionals.

I think I'd look for 2 things to happen:

1. I'd ask my company to sign a reciprocity agreement with some similar but non-competing companies. Stay in network? Keep your skills.
2. I'd put a lot more research into training to minimize ramp-up time.
