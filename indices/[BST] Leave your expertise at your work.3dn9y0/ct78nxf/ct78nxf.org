Well, if this is just a way that companies can be run, then because working at a company which adopts this technology massively stunts an employee's long-term earning potential, such companies have to pay substantially more than other similar companies.

I do not expect this would actually become a mainstream thing to do, given a society which starts out without any such companies; most companies produce a product which can easily be reverse-engineered or obtained through espionage, so the protection of IP wouldn't justify the employee cost.

If, however, this technology is standard:

The skill-data becomes something which is negotiated for in employment contracts. There's no reason to think that the only options are "work normally and keep all your skills" and "we keep everything and you never get it back".

People could steal their own skill-file and either use it at home (onloading it, working, then offloading it to avoid detection) or flee to a country which doesn't honor these laws.

Since a company could sell a skill-file, there's actually a reason for companies to hire complete noobs: after working with them for a couple years, they are now a valuable (and captive) product.

However, academia would have trouble paying for these skills, so I suspect that many of the best instructors and textbook authors don't exist. Industry complains even more than it already does that nobody learns anything from college.

Productivity of people working from home is massively reduced, so a much smaller open-source programming community.

Similarly, the engineers don't remember anything from their work, so there's fewer really awesome things on youtube.

Similarly, public policy debates are even worse than they are now.
