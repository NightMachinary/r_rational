Back in the '90s I started to write a story (before I realized that I wasn't actually good at writing stories) with this kind of theme. In this story, the skills belonged to a separate artificial "work persona" that was managed by an implant that basically took over the ego and tied new memories to that persona being present... there was no association chain for the original persona to access them. Lots of handwaving, and it's been 20 years so I forget the details now.

This persona started out being identical to you. It was technically an organically-assisted AI, and was legally part of the implant, and had access to resources in the implant... but it had no continuity of personality or consciousness apart from when it was activated in the brain it was implanted in. It was aware of your life outside, because your regular memories continued to lay down without whatever tags or whatever tied them to the implant.

With the implant off, you really didn't even think about your job, you went into work, you got switched off for 8 hours, and you went home. Theoretically, it's supposed to be like you turn on the implant, the new memories "come back", but you're still the same person. After all, the processing is going on in the same brain. You work for 8 hours, and then the extra memories and skills go away, but you're still you.

But eventually the implant stopped being able to find associations for memories laid down while offline, it's non-work life became dreamlike, and then lost. Now you have a version of you that sees losing the job as an existential crisis...
