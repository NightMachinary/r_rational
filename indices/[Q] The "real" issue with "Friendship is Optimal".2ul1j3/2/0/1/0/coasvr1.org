  The fictional AIs pictured simply don't have any constraints along the lines of "These bits of mass have to remain assembled into biological people and environments in which they live"
#+end_quote

it is implied that celestAI will have such constraints in regards to anything it considers human.

which i do think would supply any AI which doesn't have such shortcomings a pretty big military advantage.

  Also, since we are technically discussing the physically realistic possibilities for interstellar or intergalactic warfare among Properly Advanced Species, you should probably relabel the thread to address that specifically
#+end_quote

if i understand correctly you are saying i should relabel the thread to speak on the more generic question of intergalactic warfare between AIs? if so i think that topic would be much less constructive as in the real world there are just too many unknown variables that would make such a discussion kind of moot.

if you are saying i should add "[D]" to the title then sure(though how do i do that? i didn't see an option for me to edit topics), i just wasn't sure what would constitute general discussion vs specific discussion of the question..
