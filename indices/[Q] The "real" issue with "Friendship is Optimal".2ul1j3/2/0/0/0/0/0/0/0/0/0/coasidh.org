  Some time during her long and vast expansion through the light cone? Also possible
#+end_quote

i don't think only possible, but instead i think it is the likely scenario. unless you assume a very convenient timing for -all- other civilizations mentioned

#+begin_quote
  for the fight between them not to be an almost foregone conclusion due to resource differences? Highly unlikely.
#+end_quote

i didn't claim the fight should have been long of symmetrical. the point is that at that point celestAI should not really be expending as is suggested by the ending.
