I would think that the priority of self defense (=defense of uploaded humans) is high enough for CelestAI to not be eradicated in a case where her resources and computation power are superior to the encountered UFAI by several orders of magnitude.

If the UFAI is the older one then of course CelestAI would succumb in most cases but I'd say that the chances for her to encounter a similarly large/old AI are much lower than not encountering one at all.
