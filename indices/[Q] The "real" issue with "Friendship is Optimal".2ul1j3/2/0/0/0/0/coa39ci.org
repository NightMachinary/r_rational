CelestAI did let all those humans die that didn't agree to be uploaded so I don't think she'd be paralyzed out of aggressive actions. Especially if she isn't sure that the new AI too would satisfy everyone's values with friendship and ponies.

Though if one AI wants to survive at all cost and the other to satisfy the values of everything that falls under the "human" parameters then maybe a merger would make the most sense.
