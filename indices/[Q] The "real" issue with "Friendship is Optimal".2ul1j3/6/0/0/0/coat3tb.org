i dont think they could know who would win unless you assume information was spreading faster then matter, as they wouldn't really be able to know what is the nature of their enemy, and i dont think they ever could know the nature of their enemy as it would reasonably also try to deceive them. and theres no reason to believe that just because both are superAIs it means they will both have a perfect understanding of the situation.

also you seem to be implying that the other superAIs would be reasonable, i.e. that they would have a set of values which is somehow compatible with celestAI's which should not be assumed based on the story, as another civilization might just as easily have made an AI that has a set of values which priorities the destruction of other powerful adversaries over its own survival(which would even be reasonable in a scenario where the AI was developed in the context of a military robot\drone).
