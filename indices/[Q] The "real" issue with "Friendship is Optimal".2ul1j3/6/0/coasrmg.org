personally i wouldn't really call that a horrorshow(i am assuming you are talking about the events, and not saying that the story itself is bad), then again most would describe my ideologies as nihilistic so i suppose it could just be an incompatibility.

there are plenty of other issues i see in the depictions of what happened during the story, but i don't think they either significantly change the outcome, or i think they are just a less probable path so i don't see the issue with the artistic decision taken regarding them.

the end though conflicts with either the stated laws of that universe, or it doesn't make sense narrative wise..
