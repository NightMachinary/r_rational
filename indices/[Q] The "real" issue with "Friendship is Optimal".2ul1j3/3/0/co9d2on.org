A little of both i suppose? my issue with the narrative is general and not only with the end is that it doesn't really have a point. it is more of a simulation. but then logically with the world described the end just doesn't make sense(for me at least :)).

The thing is narrative wise you could say it just wasn't the point of the story thus it wasn't mentioned(i.e. humanity was the only civilization which invented a superAI because you need some specific set of materials for that to be possible and earth was the only planet that had them?), but then what was the point? specifically the point of the end scene with eating the universe and all that..
