Even if it is improbable that CelestAI is the first AI created, that doesn't mean that a story can't be written about it. A lot of stories are written based on implausible premises, including HPMOR. In terms of narrative, I think that final scene had a purpose in that it was meant to be horrifying. The whole story was horror in my opinion, and I think the final scenes were a good ending in showing the logical outcome of CelestAI's values.
