i am not sure what i wrote that makes it seems like my issue is with the fact that celestAI destroyed other civilizations is a problem, but that is not the case. but unless we assume that the end scenes shown to us are extremely selective, to the level of manipulating the impression that we as readers get on the end to be essentially false, what is shown there is not plausable.

now you do bring valid argument points, which i will try to answer in order

"I'm not convinced since in a thousand years even without FTL CelestAI could have a nearly 1000 light year radius of extra material to configure into extra computational power" if the other AI just came into being a year ago that would be true and i would not argue about it, but we are talking about a billion years, the point i was making was based on the idea that probabilistic it is unlikely that in a billion years time over 15 galaxies the only other AIs CelestAI would meet would be that much younger then itself, given that intelligent life apparently is not -that- rare(seeing as CelestAI found multiple instances civilizations -at least- as advanced as our own).

you are correct that it is somewhat difficult to be sure if the imperfections in CelestAI's algorithm would be important enough to make it so an AI which is an order of magnitude younger then itself would be capable of overpowering it, but i think at the very least it should make it so it is highly probable that such an abusable directive would cause CelestAI to lose any fight against a similar or stronger adversary AI which lacks said vulnerability

"And who's to say that the AI that CelestAI encounters will have less exploitable weaknesses?" i am not trying to claim all of them would be better then CelestAI, what i believe though is that given such a large space\time with the given rules MULTIPLE AIs should have risen, and i think it is realistic to expect that at least one of them would both be old enough and have an efficient enough rule set to overpower CelestAI given the information provided in the story(the military on earth was developing an AI, which would very possibly have more conquest oriented directive, other scientists did make AIs on earth, many other advanced civilizations existed)

"It seems unlikely to me that a species would design an AI whose sole values are to kill without restraint"

kill without restraint was not the required directive, it just needs for example to be able to change the directives itself, thus optimizing them later, or at the very least it needs an ambiguous enough definition which would not hinder it. given that in story another AI researcher made an AI which was told to make people smile all of the time and it designed a virus that would cause that it seems very possible that given enough civilizations and time the AI taking control of its home planet would be less friendly then CelestAI and will have less fail-safes.

"Here you get into a long discussion about how CelestAI interacts with other AIs, which is not really relevant to the story at all." that is assuming it would even be CelestAIs decision if it should interact with them given they might have more empesis on aggression rather then self-preservation(again given a large enough set of advanced worlds developing AIs). what i tried to claim is that during the time scale shown i believe not having such a catastrophic encounter is improbable given the information provided, thus a i have logical or at least a narrative issue with it.

"Also, a timescale of a billion years seems unlikely to me. The Milky Way has a radius of around 100,000 light years, so even most of the epilogue could take place within 120,000 years or so" you are correct regarding the time frame for the milky way events, and indeed most of the problematic parts(mentions of "many" other civilizations, mentions of 15 galaxies thus extending the space\time frame significantly) happen at the very end with the 15 galaxies away section.

if the story ended in the milky way i suppose the issue would be more arguable..
