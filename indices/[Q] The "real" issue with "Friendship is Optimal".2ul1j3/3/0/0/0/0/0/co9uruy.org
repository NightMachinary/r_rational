there are lots of maybes as was mentioned and i agreed with in the other posts, but the maybes are not handled in story, and most of them are too much for me to just assume implicitly for anything other then the narrative of "and the end is really scary because celestAI consumed the universe!!!", which what i am saying is not really rational. about the 1000 year advantage, i mentioned that i believe the penalty that CelestAI has in the form of its directives will dwarf most advantages it could have as they are just way too exploitable.

i also dont think changing radio signals to complex tools would have changed something in the timescale (billion years?) mentioned.

deciding that my points are nitpickings are ok, they bothered me and i opened this discussion to see if they bothered other people, and\or if other people found some other explanations which i missed..
