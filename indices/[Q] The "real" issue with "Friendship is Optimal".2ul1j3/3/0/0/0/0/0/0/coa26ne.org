True, it's not handled in the story, but since that part of the story is from CelestAI's perspective it wouldn't make sense to pay too much attention to that line since CelestAI doesn't care if she's potentially killing sapient nonhuman organisms. This subreddit loves nitpicking; the problem I have is that even if you say that a 1000 year headstart isn't enough to make up for CelestAI's other disadvantages, I'm not convinced since we don't know that much about AI. Personally, I'm not convinced since in a thousand years even without FTL CelestAI could have a nearly 1000 light year radius of extra material to configure into extra computational power. And who's to say that the AI that CelestAI encounters will have less exploitable weaknesses? It seems unlikely to me that a species would design an AI whose sole values are to kill without restraint. Even if such an AI existed, it would still have weaknesses. Would CelestAI even register as something alive that it should kill in the first place? Here you get into a long discussion about how CelestAI interacts with other AIs, which is not really relevant to the story at all. The story was mainly about how human civilization interacted with CelestAI, and the rest was just a short epilogue. Any of what you said could happen after the ending of the original story, but there wouldn't be much point in including it. Also, a timescale of a billion years seems unlikely to me. The Milky Way has a radius of around 100,000 light years, so even most of the epilogue could take place within 120,000 years or so (IIRC CelestAI only sent copies of herself to other galaxies at the end).
