as you say we could assume the world works in the way your two first points mentioned, i got the impression you were talking more generally then just in the context of the story which is why i felt the need to talk about those points if i misunderstood then sorry for making my point less clear..

again the first point in your post seems to be theorizing about the general strategies of galaxy-eating thus i will be commenting on it, as you say eating a galaxy is something which calculating the most efficient strategy for might not be very difficult. on the other hand eating a galaxy while taking into account other inteligent\superinteligent civilization\AIs(in the same galaxy? in other galaxies?) is computationally much harder and might not even have a solution..

waiting till you meet another superAI to revise your strategy seems extremely inefficient to me(unless you have a good reason to assume what you meet wont turn against you\will not be capable of turning against you\will not exist), as would put you in possibly large danger(annihilation?) if you are wrong.

about the FTL drive you are correct, from the story it seems that it at least takes -some- time to travel. the same is not said about information, though i suppose because celestAI sent a clone that might be reasonable assumption(why would celestAI send a clone if it could be everywhere at all times)

the last point though is the most important, you say that the human weakness is not as important because how would the otherAIs know what is that weakness? well, there are many ways i could imagine that they would know, going all the way from actual observation, to experimentation(send vehicles with all imagined life forms artificially generated at celestAI and see which ones it saves?) to active information gathering(infiltration? an attack which freezes a portion of celestAI for analysis?)

and im not a superAI so im sure there are better ways to do that.

my point is not only that we do not know(though i do feel that substracts somewhat as well), but that with what we -do- know what is shown does not make sense as anything less then a plot device(i.e. so improbable that the only way to accept it is saying "the narrative demands that this be the case")
