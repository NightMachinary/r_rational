  The probability of five straght flushes is about 1 in 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. I can understand that you don't like using the word, and I understand the math, but I don't like mincing words. That is functionally impossible. If you think that something is that unlikely, you are basically certain it won't happen.

i don't think the example with the gambling would be much different(narrative wise) if the MC won because he got 2 straight flushes. to be honest if the only reason the MC won was because he got a single straight flush randomly that would still not constitute "rational" fiction unless he won because of statistics.

is this making my point clearer?

  How can you possibly think it's that unlikely?
#+end_quote

i cannot really go over the entire flow, but it boils down to 1. celestAI was made without any kind of freak occurrence(i.e. it was a reasonable natural progression for humanity)

1. celestAI does not modify its own rules(the ones set by hannah) thus it can never truly optimize itself

2. the universe enables interstellar and intergalactic travel

3. the universe(and more specifically our neighboring galaxies) includes many intelligent life forms

the end scene is :CelestAI consumes multiple galaxies and life forms

when you put all of these together i either get a conflict, or something being improbable.

  But do you think so highly of your own assumptions that you cannot believe a story where it works my way instead
#+end_quote

i am not sure of which assumptions you are talking, i think i based everything on what the author showed me.

#+begin_quote
  Do you think it is functionally impossible to discover that the universe just doesn't work how you think, so you can't suspend disbelief if an author disagrees with you?
#+end_quote

that is not what i am doing though, or at least if i apply it to what i did it could just as well be applied to the example i gave.

the point is that the world built was implying one thing should happen while another did. in which is the issue, after all of the example i gave happened in the discworld it wouldnt be something i would really complain about, it is only an issue if the story establishes certain things and then breaks them later. then it just becomes a plot device.

  But why are you 99.9999999999999999999999% sure that caring for ponies is a competitive disadvantage?
#+end_quote

well first of all i wasn't saying it was -just- the caring about ponies which is a competitive disadvantage, but also the limitations regarding humans specifically(specifically the implied inability to actively hurt them). another issue with the lack of older AIs which would have destroyed celestAI regardless of those specific vulnerabilities.

moreover i didnt say that i am 99.9999999999~% sure of my evaluation(though the examples i gave might have given that impression which is an error on my side, so sorry about that, hopefully the first part of this post clarifies the point) just sure enough that it happening differently doesn't feel like a "rational" outcome, in the sense that it ends up being plot mandated rather then earned\realistic outcome.
