And here we have the crux of the problem. You say, "Either the story follows my assumptions, or it has irrational plot devices."

I hear, "Either the story is written how I would have written it, or it is irrational."

For example, I say, "Interacting with an AI is a problem that can be optimally solved /without/ needing to play out all possible scenarios. This is a good thing, because playing out all possible scenarios is physically impossible. There's no point in even trying to do it; You can never make any meaningful progress. Doing it that way will never give you even the slightest advantage."

That is not an unreasonable plot device. That is a supposition. That is an axiom of the worldbuilding. The fact is true about lots of real world problems, and we can suppose that it is true for this particular problem. You can write a rational story about what that implies.

If you don't like it, that's your problem, not the story's.
