all that is nice and all but we are told in story that other intelligent life forms existed, advanced enough to send radio transmissions at the very least.

the probability of another superAI emerging at the same time on the same galaxy might be low, on the other hand the probability that another superAI would be created long before celestAI should not be assumed to be that low(unless you assume quite a lot of things regarding human civilization)

moreover as i mentioned in story there are events mentioned 15 galaxies away, so the 100 light years really isnt the scale..
