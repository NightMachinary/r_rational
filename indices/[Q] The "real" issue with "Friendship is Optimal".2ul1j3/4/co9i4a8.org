Life evolves over the timescale of billions to millions of year. Intelligence life might require millions to hundred of thousands of years once complex life exists. Civilization might require thousands of years to develop fully. The Milky Way is only about 100,000 lights years in diameter. Thus CelestiAI can colonize the entire galaxy faster than any competing intelligent life can evolve and develop civilization. In other words, probability wise, its extremely unlikely for another AI to emerge in the same time frame as CelestiAI.
