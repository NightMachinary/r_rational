This is probably a bit rude of me, but at this point it kind of seems like you are trolling, especially with that last part.

You are saying, "It is absolutely certain that an AI will meet another AI within fifteen galaxies. It is absolutely certain that that other AI will be optimized for eating everything, rather than growing similarly to how this story depicts. It is absolutely certain that a distracted AI will be destroyed." Are you really so confident, that anything that says otherwise is /logically inconsistent/? You cannot even imagine a world that does not look like that?

I am saying, "It is possible that there is taking over a galaxy is simpler than you think. It is possible that information security is better than you think." Are you really so confident, that what I am saying is /completely ridiculous/? You cannot even imagine a world that looks like that?
