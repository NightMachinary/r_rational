The probability of five straght flushes is about 1 in 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. I can understand that you don't like using the word, and I understand the math, but I don't like mincing words. That is functionally impossible. If you think that something is /that/ unlikely, you are basically certain it won't happen.

How can you possibly think it's that unlikely? I have given you a framework in which it is highly probable that you are wrong! Maybe you think what I said isn't how the real world works. That's fine. But do you think so highly of your own assumptions that you cannot believe a story where it works my way instead? Do you think it is /functionally/ impossible to discover that the universe just doesn't work how you think, so you can't suspend disbelief if an author disagrees with you?

Put another way: If caring for ponies is a competitive disadvantage, then there is a 99.9999999999999999999999% chance that CelestAI will be destroyed. Sure, whatever. But why are you 99.9999999999999999999999% sure that caring for ponies is a competitive disadvantage?
