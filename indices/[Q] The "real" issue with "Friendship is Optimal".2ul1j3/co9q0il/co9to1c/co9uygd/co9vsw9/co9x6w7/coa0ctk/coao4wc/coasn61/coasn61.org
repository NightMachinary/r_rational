  This is probably a bit rude of me, but at this point it kind of seems like you are trolling, especially with that last part.

i suspected that last part might come off not so well, but i really didn't see how to illustrate that point better.. my "absurd" example was mostly there to try to show that this is actually not about absolutes. but instead probabilities.

what is "logical" and "rational" will always end up being just the more probable. which the example illustrates by showing that you don't need to explicitly break your own rules for something to not be logical\reasonable. its enough to skew the probabilities enough.

  You are saying, "It is absolutely certain that an AI will meet another AI within fifteen galaxies. It is absolutely certain that that other AI will be optimized for eating everything, rather than growing similarly to how this story depicts. It is absolutely certain that a distracted AI will be destroyed." Are you really so confident, that anything that says otherwise is logically inconsistent? You cannot even imagine a world that does not look like that?

thus i am not saying that i am absolutely certain in all of these, i just believe the probability of them is so high relative to the alternative that i find it to not be reasonable to implicitly ignore them. i suppose another way to illustrate that would be if you had a story about poker, and in the end the MC won because he got a straight flush 5 times in a row. that is not strictly impossible, its just extremely improbable.
