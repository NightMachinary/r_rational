  That's easy. Fiction is like reality unless noted. A rational person could believe that what I said is true in reality. So, a rational author could write a story in which they are true, without feeling the need to note it.

I wasn't aware that any of the things you mentioned being implicitly assumed by the story are any more established scientific facts then having a subjective universe or a god.

Could believe? sure, if the stars align just right.

  A rational person could believe that superAIs will interact based on nothing but abstract zero-knowledge game thoery

  A rational person could believe that superAIs are rare, or that they are largely self contained

Why not, when assumed over reality i wouldn't really object to that. i would even say its the most likely assumption. But then again in reality no one invented a superAI, if someone did i would seriously question that assumption...
