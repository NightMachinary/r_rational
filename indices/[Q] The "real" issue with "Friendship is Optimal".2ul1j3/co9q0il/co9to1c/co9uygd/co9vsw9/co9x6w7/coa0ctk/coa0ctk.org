obviously you cannot know(for sure) how other superAIs will react, but you can build strategies, and while the problem space is indeed large i find it improbable that advantage cannot still be secured by investing more time into it, unless you have some argument as to why that should be pointless which i am missing that is.

you wont find the optimal solution for every situation i suppose, but you should have a much better set of opening moves, and possibly much further insight into what will happen next.

when i said observation i meant less in the sense of observing celestAI after it ate the galaxy but instead observing celestAIs source, earth(that option become problematic with FTL drives though, i am not for the benefit of which side though).

the fact that the life form cannot exist in this universe doesn't mean that said adversary AI would just say "well what if it doesn't exist? why bother..". it means it will invest the appropriate amount of resources into that direction. it will of course put effort into many othre directions which will not bear fruit, but the fact the celestAI found a star with human like life forms seems to imply the probability of life forms taking human shape is not -that- low, or alternatively that said life forms from the end are supposed to imply what i am talking about here in the first place.

while there could be a large amount of options for the rules of her operation, and the rules\lack of rules celestAI would follow i don't think infinity is correct, its just a very large number of options, while we are talking about AIs with humongous amounts of processing available to them, and obviously extremely optimal algorithms.

you are talking about infiltration in a binary way which seems implausible to me seeing as we are still talking about objects that exists in the real world. in order for celestAI to be protected there would need to be a perfect defense, not just a higher defense to offence ration on information security.

moreover it wont cover all of the probes the celestAI sent, which while its main body might have some kind of home turf advantage would open it up into slipping into an enemy's home, where perfect information defense wont help as it would be outclasses by multiple orders of magnitude.

in the end there could be sets of assumptions about the world which would make any single point of failure in what i mentioned to not be that big, but once you need to assume -all- of them we are going again into the implausible region where its on the same scale as "it was like that because the author needed it to be".

if you had a story and suddenly when the MC was defenseless against an enemy a gun falls into his hands from the sky and the enemy gets distracted by a lightning and the MC shoots the bad guy and wins, in theory you could theorize that a tornado in another city made the gun fly and a set of winds on the way down slowed it enough etc. etc. till in the end its would not be -impossible- for it to happen even in the real world. it would just not be what i could call a rational story..
