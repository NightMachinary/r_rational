Every AI already knows the single optimal spreading strategy permitted by the laws of physics. Experience, strategies, and technologies do not matter to a galaxy-eater, they have already written the best possible playbook. But space is big. It takes a long time to get things done. So what if your sun crackers play with ponies in transit? A dedicated spreader AI would just be twiddling its thumbs anyway. That's /almost all/ of your available computational resources, at zero fitness cost.

If you do find a competitor, that information propagates through both your volumes at a fixed rate, limiting you to comparable resources to adapt to your new information. So there's not even any fitness advantage to having more resources, once both parties are sufficiently large and quick.
