:END:

If CelestAI never encounters another AI in her light cone, then the ending is as noted.

If she does, and if she fails to overcome the challenger, then the ending is as noted except at some point astronomically far in the future, at which point the simulation suddenly ceases for everyone.

I'm afraid I don't see the problem.
