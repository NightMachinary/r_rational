wether the issue i mentioned is irrelevant to the story would depend on what the story was trying to depict, and i already agreed that i could see things the story tried to tell which makes these points not so important(though they would cause me to have other issues with the story itself i suppose).

i cant seem to agree that the issue i mention is irrelevant to the story's rationality though, unless i made some mistake which i haven't seen pointed out thus far, the point is an issue with the way that world works which is not explained, and i cannot see explained without ending up as a plot device. which to my understanding would go against a story being rational..
