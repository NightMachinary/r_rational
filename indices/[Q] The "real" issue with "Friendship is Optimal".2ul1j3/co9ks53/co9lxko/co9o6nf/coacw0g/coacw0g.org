(This comment initially provoked in me the urge to write an extremely hostile reply involving very detailed accusations that would probably be false but would nevertheless be fun to make. [Personal attacks are not fun.] After calming down a bit, I decided to engage with close-to-normal conversational tone, particularly since you have engaged in well-written, civil conversations elsewhere on this subreddit, and I felt you deserved at least that much. Future comments using a similar tone will simply not be engaged with, and furthermore, I will state that if you make a habit of getting this riled up at online posts, I'd advise against getting into long, drawn-out arguments.)

What does this have to do with, like, /anything/?

Long, yes. Rambling, maybe. Hypocritical? Where are you getting this from?

  Try to do better next time, with your next account.
#+end_quote

This implies that you think I am a reddit user with multiple accounts, presumably for the purpose of trolling. I don't know of any easy way to verify this, but if someone does come up with a simple, non-invasive way to figure out if I've got multiple acccounts, I'd be happy to make a bet with you.

  200-400 */billion/* stars in just the Milky Way.
#+end_quote

Yes... and?

#+begin_quote
  It's about 13.6 */billion/* years old.
#+end_quote

I'm not sure if you were referring to the Milky Way with this, but if you were, this is quite false. The /universe/ is 13.6 billion years old to the best of our knowledge. We have no evidence that the Milky Way is the same age. In any event, as with the above cited statistic, I'm not sure how this is relevant to the discussion at hand.

  6 */million/* years of human evolution to get to almost seed AI, without someone else's stomping on us or (in this story, obviously) preventing us completing a competing seed AI.
#+end_quote

Okay, this seems /somewhat/ relevant, but you didn't complete the syllogism. It takes a long time to evolve and get Seed AI, therefore... what?

#+begin_quote
  Given what science knows, what's the chance one of "multiple" species in the galaxy is exactly there with us and able to allow AIs to compete realistically, given those time scales?
#+end_quote

/Exactly/? I would venture close to none. However, the chances that a parallel species is /exactly/ on par with us is not relevant here; all that is needed is for them to have completed AI at some point /before/ us. Yours is the difference between asking what fraction of the number line /exactly/ equals pi, versus what fraction of it is /less than or equal to/ pi. This difference is significant. Given that the story itself states that close-to-human-level aliens exist, other galaxies will probably contain similar population levels. The probability that /of the entire space of potential civilizations whose future light-cone overlaps with that of humanity/, not a /single/ one managed to complete AI before us is so close to zero as to be negligible.

#+begin_quote
  The story seems to have taken the most reasonable path for the dramatic conceit used.
#+end_quote

Not really.
