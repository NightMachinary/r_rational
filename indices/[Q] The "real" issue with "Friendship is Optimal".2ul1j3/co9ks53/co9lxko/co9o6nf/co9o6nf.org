Trolls with trash names, six month old accounts, 23 comment karma, and long, rambling, hypocritical posts don't get detailed rebuttals.

Shorter and sharper would have worked better, but it still almost got me. Try to do better next time, with your next account.

I leave other readers a short reminder about producing sloppy scenarios and mis-evaluating them with these three numbers -- ones the story's author clearly knew:

200-400 */billion/* stars in just the Milky Way.

It's about 13.6 */billion/* years old.

6 */million/* years of human evolution to get to /almost seed AI/, without someone else's stomping on us or (in this story, obviously) preventing us completing a competing seed AI.

Given what science knows, what's the chance one of "multiple" species in the galaxy is /exactly/ there with us and able to allow AIs to compete realistically, given those time scales? The story seems to have taken the most reasonable path for the dramatic conceit used.
