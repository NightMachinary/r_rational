you replied to me so in case it wasn't clear i don't think you were trolling, to me your post seemed very constructive and with a generally reasonable tone. with both the first part seeming lighthearted, and not hostile, as well as the suggestion to have a polite discussion honest.

so if you were responding to me because you thought i was agreeing that you are trolling that is not the case.

though the point about having a new account, with not too many posts would make it more reasonable not to invest as much resources responding to the user if you assume the risk of trolling is too high, as if you model a troll trying to avoid being spotted such a pattern would make sense for him. because it wont require too much effort, but give him some credibility as to not be dismissed outright(which i assume would happen if he posted with a completely new account, as a new account gives you the least to lose if you are identified as a troll).
