All of the observations regarding my account can be explained by the fact that I am a LWer first and foremost, and do not generally participate in other online communities. My original reason for creating this account was to write a comment response to[[/u/David_Gerard]] on a thread contesting RationalWiki's characterization of LessWrong, and I did not make any comments for a significant period of time following that. I think my later comments first began in [[/r/hpmor]], eventually spilling over into [[/r/rational]] as well. A quick skim of my profile will reveal that the overwhelming majority of my comments on reddit have indeed been confined to the aforementioned two subreddits, with the occasional post here or there in assorted places like [[/r/philosophy]]. This, of course, is at odds with the picture one would expect if I really were a troll.

At the time of my account's creation, I can't say I put much thought into selecting my username; my rationale for choosing to encode my name in hexadecimal amounted to pretty much "this seems like a cool, original idea". I did /not/, in point of fact, anticipate that my choice of username and my tendency to avoid posting often would be taken as "evidence" and subjected to a dubious analysis by someone looking to show that I am some sort of "troll", ostensibly because they performed a completely objective Bayesian accumulation of evidence and /not at all/ because they happened to dislike the way in which I responded to their comment. Such a thing was entirely uncalled-for and is in my eyes far more offensive than any remark I made. I would advise anyone reading this series of comments to thoroughly disregard any insinuations [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer]] has made about my account activity. The probability of motivated cognition being in play here is simply far too high.
