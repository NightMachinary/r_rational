Ah, no, I was pretty sure you didn't think I was trolling. My post was more of a "for-the-general-audience" post. I guess you could say I didn't want other people to read [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer]]'s comments and come to a premature conclusion about me as a result. Reputational assassination is a thing, after all, and while my reddit reputation isn't a /huge/ thing to me, I'd still rather not be considered a troll.
