  you make a lot of assumptions regarding the cost of emulating humanity inside a virtual world.
#+end_quote

True.

#+begin_quote
  assumptions which are at the moment baseless
#+end_quote

Absolutely not. No magic-tech is suggested to run things in the story. Simulating all of humanity can happen using only Earth's energy resources. Crossing the gulf between galaxies makes /insignificant/ the cost of simulating the information about even a hundred billion /billion/ human level intelligences, especially given that most uploaded aren't shown requiring particle physics simulations.

  moreover as i mentioned in the main post it is mentioned in story that in order to maximize it's absolute values in the real world celestAI was operating the virtual world significantly faster then the real world, which increases the cost and makes it so there will be no hard cap for said cost.
#+end_quote

This is a problem you are having grasping the issues, not one that exists with the reality of the situation. Even given an unfavorable interpretation (which isn't supported by the story) of how those values were implemented, nearly pausing the entire simulation for /millennia/ of "real" time would clearly be an acceptable cost to accomplish the goal of continued existence.

"No hard cap" is just a silly thing to say. The simulations aren't a virus. The AI is in full control and it plans to run until the natural exhaustion of entropy itself and beyond. That's a lot of time to amortize short-term costs over. Maximizing means just that, not some fairy-logic-trap gotcha.

  i really don't see how intelligence, or even super intelligence will change the fact that efficient processes for a given environment have a much better chance of monopolizing resources.
#+end_quote

Monopoly here has already been accomplished. There is no competition possible or required, as the problem space is wholly understood by the super intelligent AI. /Competition/ is inherently inefficient compared to a single correct solution. The small cost of running simulations of other entities is not a drag, as it is only computing time. The big costs it faces are energy and time. Computing at the level described requires very little energy, provably so: it can run simply with power available to a planet-based civilization. Once it gets into space, this becomes even less significant.

Even supposing it required a Jupiter-sized planet made of computing substrate to run all of the galaxy's intelligences at peek efficiency while expanding effectively, that's /still/ well within the budget of simply disassembling a /single/ solar system. One of hundreds of /billions/ in just this galaxy. That's the scope of resources available.

  and thus once you go into the universal scale collisions are very much possible
#+end_quote

I discuss why this is not significant [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2ul1j3/q_the_real_issue_with_friendship_is_optimal/coa8sup][elsewhere]]. In short, that is very unlikely given evolutionary timescales compared to AI-conquers-the-galaxy timescales.

#+begin_quote
  and in those collisions the process more adjusted for existing and growing will triumph. you seem to imply that will no longer be the case once superAIs exists and i cant see what is the rational for that claim, unless when you say superAI you are not referring to the type shown in this story but instead to superAIs that do not operate under any specific 3d party dictated rule-set thus it is optimal for any scenario.
#+end_quote

This is sort of thready. You are once again claiming things not supported by the story or by the current state of the art in science relating AI. If you had small timescales and the CAI fighting against a larger, entrenched foe, I think you would be right. It having to run and protect uploaded humans would be a huge disadvantage /while stilling running as [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale][Type 0 civilization]]/.

But being the first is an enormous advantage for a hard takeoff, strong AI system. It doesn't even need to be impossibly, magically intelligent for that to be true. Once humanity is declared to have been first ever, and CAI the first humanity produces, the game is sort of over.

Which is the point of the story.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  you say that the story answers all of the answers all of the rest of the questions because of the lack of data we have, and as i mentioned in a previous comment sure it possible humanity was first, and all the other intelligent life forms developed just in time to be conveniently consumed by celestAI. it just doesn't make sense in any kind of rational universe, and would basically be a plot device. which is no sin, just not really rational.
#+end_quote

No, I'm saying they would /not/ have evolved in time. In a rare life/rare intelligence galaxy (which is what real life seems to be, as does the story), reaching an alien solar system and seeing an alien species in a "steam trains" tech level should be /shocking/. It shouldn't happen that way. This happens in Star Trek, for example, lampshaded by virtually /every/ species in the show having been simultaneously artificially seeded by a single precursor. In the show, those that weren't were often stone age or energy beings that were like gods, such as Q.

Without such a process, you won't have that happen without huge numbers of aliens. Something like: 1/100 stars have planets that can have life ; 1/10 does have life; 1/10 of those have intelligent life developing; 1/10 make it to human intelligence at all. In our galaxy, that would result in the order of 3 million alien species of human-level intelligence with various development levels. With humanity being definitionally first to AI, this would result in something like 10 in the entire galaxy having advanced beyond hunter-gatherer. ABSURDLY optimistic galactic fecundity assumptions, and it still doesn't look good.

In the real world (and the story) most aliens will still be working on flint napping, at best, and any even close that are hit "late" by the optimizing wave will be at a huge disadvantage. They have a solar system, CAI has a quadrant. They have another galaxy, CAI has a galactic cluster.

Very small inefficiencies of running a planet's worth of humans (or any conquered aliens that fall within the scope) won't matter at that scale.
