  how could the superAI be capable of understanding the whole problem space assuming other superAIs could exist in it? unless you are somehow equating a superAI to an Omniscient AI which i do not see as reasonable.

Easily. Why would you assume inefficiencies comparable to human run social organizations, where anything not immediately understood is mismanaged? A strong, self-improving AI (one not even absurdly intelligent) would know what it didn't know about possible other AIs' resources and abilities. If they have fewer resources and no special advantages, CAI would win by being the first to takeoff and the one with the largest resources. In fact, CAI would be planning for such events as it went, and wouldn't be surprised to find smaller seed AIs starting up as it goes into other galaxies.

I'd also expect poison pills to be prepared by CAI and others, to leave room to bargain for reasonable surrender options to more powerful and rational forces, as well as "go bag" plans in case of superior quantities of non-negotiating optimizers. But in this story, CAI doesn't appear to encounter any of those. CAI wins hard, and not unreasonably. Which is the point of a "first seed AI wins" story, and not without reason.

  but you are claiming first in multiple galaxies which is much bigger, so what is your rational for that?
#+end_quote

One has to be first. Why not humanity? Saying that humanity being first in the entire universe is staggeringly unlikely is perfectly reasonable. I'm saying anyone else being second /at the same time/ even in the closest, say, 15 galaxies is what is baseless.

But it is not /irrational/ to think CAI is the first, even in the universe, given that /one has to be first/. This is the story of the first. It being unlikely /in that way/ is not something to ding the story for.

  but the story DOES mention "many" other civilizations not only in steam trains but with radio communications.

Getting to the other side of our galaxy at a cost of just under 100,000 years without FTL might just make this timeframe reasonable. Just. Getting to other galaxies makes it much more reasonable. I was assuming slow-ish FTL and don't remember what the story had. The 800,000 years at STL it would take to reach the 15th closest galaxy would leave plenty of time for other seed AIs to get running there.

So if those radio signals are mentioned being in the Milky Way and close by, shame on the author. But that's not what I remember. And that is what I was arguing against.
