  Why would you assume inefficiencies comparable to human run social organizations,
#+end_quote

because some of the AIs will have inherent inefficiencies in their programming, relative to pure survival\expansion, i assume they will be perfect, or as reasonably perfect given their available resources for the specific directive they have. just like celestAI has, only that some of them will have more effective(on the survival\expansion aspect) directive. and given that the simplest directive would be the more efficient in that it will limit the AI the least i find the probability of there being one more efficient then celestAIs stipulated rules quite high.

  I'm saying anyone else being second at the same time even in the closest, say, 15 galaxies is what is baseless.
#+end_quote

if i am understanding you correctly you say that once you assume humanity is first in our galaxy assuming a "second" meaning, close second, existed in our neighboring galaxies is unreasonable. but that is the scenario given, so given the information we do have assuming humanity is first would be the less reasonable explanation.

  But it is not irrational to think CAI is the first, even in the universe, given that one has to be first. This is the story of the first. It being unlikely in that way is not something to ding the story for.
#+end_quote

nerratively the story of the first civilization would definitly be fine, but it would bring a completely different context to it which would make all the events in it both a. unlikely to be relevant to humanity in reality and b. make the scenario stipulated not generelizable. i.e. it would not be reasonable to take any scenario the story would show as relevant for anything other then the first civilization.

moreover as in the story it is explicitly stated that other advanced civilizations at the very least existed by the time celestAI reached them(presumably in their galaxy) even the assumption that humanity was the first wont cover the scenario, the scenario would be that "humanity is first and all the other many civilizations in the close by 800k lightyears or so developed close enough in time just to be consumed but not to advance enough to halt celestAIs progress"

#+begin_quote
  The 800,000 years at STL it would take to reach the 15th closest galaxy would leave plenty of time for other seed AIs to get running there.
#+end_quote

which is the point, but the scenario depicted shows no other such AIs, or at the very least no other AI that effected celestAIs progress. which is the point i am contesting.
