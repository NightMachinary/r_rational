  We lack the simple sighting of spectral data of an extra-solar, liquid water bearing planet that has an atmosphere actively supporting plant-like life -- something that we should theoretically

You are implying that alien life should resemble ours, which we have no real reason to assume..

  And in the end, it all points towards at least humans early if not first
#+end_quote

Either that or we don't know what we are looking for, or there are one of a very large set of reasons we would not be observing anything All we have is a single data sample, we just don't know.

Essentially there is any number of alternative explanation for our observation and I haven't heard you really give any argument to why the conclusion that we are first is more likely than all the other explanations. At the moment they are all practically as reasonable.

  No, that's not how that sort of reasoning works. We can't assume invisible unicorns wearing shoes
#+end_quote

I am not saying we need to assume anything, I am saying we can't estimate the probabilities even because there is so much we do not know

If someone gave you a dice with an unknown number of sides, and you rolled it once and got some number, and he told you he is going to roll the dice an unknown number of times more, and he asked you what “place”(assuming ordering from highest to lowest) you are going to get, do you think it is reasonable to assume “first place” is the correct answer just because you haven't seen him roll the dice during the time you were observing him?

  That humans first is assumed in this story then isn't actually as "bad" as where it has any aliens ever appearing independently at all.
#+end_quote

If no aliens were encountered for a few millions\billions of years then maybe a “human first” would not be too odd, as it would be consistent, and could be considered one conclusion from our current observation, and thus rational. But the story never really give any such indication but explicitly through things that happen in the epilogue. Which seems like a hard sell for me...

  Choosing one thing that is unique in such as way as being first to develop AI of all sentient species ever is the opposite of random. It could be the story of the planet Blursg, in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and his people being first to seed AI and it would read out the same, given those assumptions the author made about AI. That's the point of the story.

Rethinking my stance about this I think it is correct that if an author establishes in a story about humanity that it is the first civilization, and he uses that consistently it can make literary sense, yes.
