we lack just way too much information regarding the spread of life in the universe. i cannot see what would make you think that no other life form exists in the universe(or for the sake of argument in the next 15 galaxies).

we can at most rule out there being any other civilization which we are capable of detecting. that in no way proves anything general.

and when you have no data on the spread of other inteligent life assuming the answer is 1 when 2 and 3 and 4.. and 10^{20} are an option seems highly improbable to me.

  Right. And that's the story: why first is all that matters. I fully agree that it wouldn't work as a rational story if CAI wasn't first.

so it would seem the last point left is if it makes sense for the story to be about the first civilization(by a 400k~ years or so over anything in our 800k lightyears radius) or not.

which i find to make little narrative sense as the story basically just tackles a random possible future with no generic applicability.

and moreover the story never really states that point explicitly which seem like a kind of important thing to say, seeing as it has such a hugh impact on the story.
