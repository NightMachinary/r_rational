  a. unlikely to be relevant to humanity in reality

Prove it. Provide data on this. It seems supported so far, and a swift reducing of unnecessary entities suggests that we are first if not completely alone until even weak evidence suggests otherwise. Pansporia theories extending from evidence of xenobiology might be a good hint towards widespread life in the galaxy, from which we /might/ be able to fill in a Drake Equation estimate on the back of a napkin, but we don't even have evidence of that yet.

  b. make the scenario stipulated not generelizable. i.e. it would not be reasonable to take any scenario the story would show as relevant for anything other then the first civilization.

Right. And that's the story: why first is all that matters. I fully agree that it wouldn't work as a rational story if CAI wasn't first.

You're right that ponies and friendship don't /help/ in some special way against a millennia old AI already ruling our galaxy, or even one just getting started, and would certainly be at least a minor drag getting started off the planet in the first place. But that doesn't point toward a weakness in the story as presented.
