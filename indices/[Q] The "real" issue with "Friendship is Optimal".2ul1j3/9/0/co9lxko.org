  That's missing the point of the story entirely. A rational entity with science and even normal levels of intellect is far greater in scope and power than a "natural" and directionless process, like the evolutionary one called here "survival of the fittest". Reconsider your assumptions about these pop-sociology, competition-supremacy ideas.

/<psychological-analysis-over-the-Internet>/Wow. That seems a bit aggressively phrased, what with the extremely direct declarative statements with no moderating adjectives (and in fact an absolute qualifier--"entirely") and a similarly unaccompanied imperative command, along with a fairly insulting accusation involving "pop-sociology, competition-supremacy ideas". Possibly a bit of latent hostility here?/</psychological-analysis-over-the-Internet>/

With that out of the way, I think you may be reading too much into that particular phrase. "Survival of the fittest" is a common term used in Darwinian evolution, true, but it can apply to contexts outside of that as well. In fact, one could say "survival of the fittest" applies whenever competition arises. In this case, as the OP suggests, "fitness" isn't determined by intelligence or capability as much as it is by /values/. /Ceteris paribus/, an AI valuing only survival and domination will win against an AI valuing some third aspect, like for instance "satisfying values through friendship and ponies", because the latter will be occupied at least to some extent fulfilling its third value, whereas the former will be suffering from no such handicap. This sentiment can in fact be found in the OP itself, so I'm not sure why you decided to interpreted it in such a baroque fashion:

  but if there are other species, and they will(and i don't see any reasonable reason why they wont) develop super-AIs as well it seems only inevitable that some other species(possibly as its last mistake?) made one with a directive such as 'be the most powerful entity', or 'enslave all but myself'. thus while CelestAI was working so hard to optimize humans and ponies inside her virtual world similar superAIs with less positive agendas will be using ALL of their resources developing weapons, strategies and technologies meant to control and take.

Your second paragraph seems to me somewhat suspect as well, particularly this portion:

  All of the rest of your concerns are answered by the story not being set up that way. Against that, no logical argument is possible given a lack of useful Drake-equation-fulfilling data. The story doesn't make any provably "unlikely" assumptions beyond the physics ones you point out, certainly not any involving the efficiency of the featured AI.
#+end_quote

In the story, we observe the following:

1. Humans exist, and were able to construct a Seed AI.
2. Human-like aliens exist within the same galaxy, presumably with similar-to-human levels of intelligence.

From these two premises, it seems reasonable to conclude--even with no direct numerical Drake-equation-fulfilling-data--that human-like intelligence cannot be /that/ rare, seeing as multiple instances of it exist /within the very same galaxy/. The fact that CelestAI is apparently the /first/ AI developed, amongst so many species, is statistically unlikely. (I believe the technical mathematical term for this sort of probability is "very small indeed".) Furthermore, even if she /were/ first, as long as her head start isn't too large, her value of "friendship and ponies" would most likely allow her to be overtaken by a similar AI that was launched marginally later but had the sole directive of "dominate". (I freely admit I'm speculating at this point, but it seems more likely than the alternative.)

So... no, I don't think the case is as clear-cut as you make it out to be. If you have any objections to my argument here feel free to articulate them, but really, I think the main reason for my (mostly negative) reaction to this comment was due to tone. If you found my response to your comment somewhat hostile in tone, that's probably the main reason behind it. (I will state outright that any such aberrations in tone are not intentional.) Please, can we keep it civil here? Thanks.
