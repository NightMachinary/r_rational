  not sure if you are only talking to 696e6372656469626c65 or me as well

Only the original comment was for you, and a general audience. The reply was for the troll and a general audience.

  why do you think these kind(random? ) of names are inherently inferior
#+end_quote

For psychological reasons. It isn't a human parsible name at all. A lot of problems arise from that. At least yours is phonetically workable, and it chunks into something the brain can work with.

  i wouldnt really call it trollish as to me it mostly seemed to be intended to justify why it was felt that you were being somewhat hostile.
#+end_quote

Starting a post with a personal attack, bringing up odd parallel issues, and ending with "but really bro, keep it polite" is a troll move. Nothing else. I won't engage at that level. It simply isn't worth my time. If other readers can't see why this is horrible, I won't be able to convince them otherwise without great effort, if ever.

Your response, in comparison, was on point and clearly stated your assumptions and goals in the conversation. There was no attempt at image management or personal attacks. That's a useful thing to respond to in detail, as there might be an actual exchange of information, not simply pointless chest thumping.

  regarding the numbers in the end, as i mentioned the story doesn't end in the milky way, and extends 15 galaxies away, and includes MULTIPLE intelligent species along the way. so any argument about the probability of other intelligent life forms in the space\time mentioned are not to relevant.
#+end_quote

"Multiple" isn't a big number. One species in the light cone has to be first, too, so the same applies across galaxies. The numbers for the time it took for humanity to get to AI also applies there, even if it takes significant time (1000s of years) to get to the next galaxy.

You'd need to make some argument that it would take hundreds of thousands of years to cross to the next galaxy -- giving that galaxy a timespan in which it is probable for them to have a species grow to make their own competing AIs -- and that those would be /able/ to compete against an AI controlling a galaxy already.

That is really, really wrong. That you think it is some sort of strong point in favor of there being a stretch of credulity in the story makes me wonder if you really understand the issues involved.

The only way that humanity being first /and/ having effective competition being likely is if there are GARGANTUAN numbers of intelligent species in the galaxy, making one statistically likely to have co-evolved to the point of AI close enough in time to be able to compete before the galaxy is conquered. That's the first big step, and is the only one we have good information on at all.

Beyond that, it is trying to work out how likely another galaxy is to gain an advantage that makes the gulf between galaxies significant enough to give them time to make a difference. Which is possible, but would still require intelligent life to be very, very common to make the numbers such that competition was likely in time to matter, if humanity was first. Which it is in this story.

I have more on this in my *[[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2ul1j3/q_the_real_issue_with_friendship_is_optimal/coa9nx8][other response]], where you made what I think is a slightly stronger point.
