  so if i understand correctly you agree that the section about the intergalactic conquest isn't logical. you just don't consider it to be important because its in the epilogue.

The only viable line of argument against the epilogue is that other galaxies could have AIs that are already working toward ours (we just don't know about it yet) or that they will by the time our CAI reached them and we'll lose the meeting engagement because they are more established, have better resources, or better set up from an efficiency standpoint. This could be a stalemate of sorts if every single galaxy gets AIs at about the same time, and galactic defense were easier than "landing" attempts that took hundreds of thousands of years.

There is no real-world support for any of those scenarios, though, and weak support for humans being first in the Milky Way because of a lack of /relatively/ local signs from other civilizations (meaning intelligent life is a certain rarity). There is also a lack of obviously broadcasting megastructures and intelligently made objects the size of solar clusters, many of which people are spitballing already.

With 15 other galaxies, and no other reason to believe them more likely to have later evolved life, that is necessarily only 15 times more likely to result in another AI being born /along with/ Earth's. Which I've already suggested is a tiny chance, both in reality and this story. Hardly something to stretch credulity if you already accept humanity first in the Milky Way. Which leaves something about older galaxies having a head start somehow, which I don't have any good numbers on and don't really care to look up. Seems pretty weak still.

Given a lack of data, the epilogue seems perfectly rational in that story. It is consistent given its assumptions and I believe it doesn't conflict directly with any known astroscience.
