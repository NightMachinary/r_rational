  There is no real-world support for any of those scenarios, though, and weak support for humans being first in the Milky Way because of a lack of relatively local signs from other civilizations (meaning intelligent life is a certain rarity).

in the real world that is a fine argument but in the epilogue it is specifically stated that many advanced intelligent civilizations existed within said 15 galaxies range.

  This could be a stalemate of sorts if every single galaxy gets AIs at about the same time
#+end_quote

well, my argument is any stalemate that CelestAI will reach will not last simply because it has an vulnerability in its programming, which will be abused by other more "ideal" AIs which would inevitably exist given the problem space.

in an essence it seems that for you regardless of any "large" scale issues the very mention of there being many advanced civilizations is not logical.
