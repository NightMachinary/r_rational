  Posting ignored comments once a week for that time would have resulted in more points, suggesting inactivity or a secondary account.

Or, y'know, evidence of someone who doesn't use reddit much. I post much more frequently on LessWrong, for example--I'd be willing to PM you my username over there if you want. Honestly, though, I'd prefer it if you didn't make random accusations like that. A troll is a very specific type of person, and referring to someone whose only "crime" was responding to a comment of yours in a fashion you didn't appreciate as such isn't going to earn you any friends.
