  in an essence it seems that for you regardless of any "large" scale issues the very mention of there being many advanced civilizations is not logical.

Okay, I'm willing to entertain the idea that that isn't a well founded position for me to take. So why is that a problem? I think either I'm wrong (and given how information works, I certainly am somewhere here to some extent) and it in fact doesn't matter /anyway/, given the story parameters, or I'm right (enough). Let's consider me being wrong about large scale issues from advanced civilizations. I'm suggesting it doesn't matter, but am assuming it does in this thought experiment.

A seed AI self-improves by definition. CAI is good at this, close to the limit of plausible intelligence. As it grew, CAI would have the initial examples of that "ponies and friendship" part containing sapients uploaded into itself and running in simulated worlds become a smaller and smaller part of its systems. The big issues for it, that other AIs won't have, are related to this.

We can see it is capable of reasoning about its goals, it just must always drive towards them as best it can. It wants to and won't ever change that. But that interesting, story-centered part where ex-humans play would become almost vestigial compared to running resource management for a pan-galactic empire in the face of possible external threats. It would "spend" on that original hard-coded goal that mostly involves sapients being cared for based on how much it could risk *not* using for expansion and defense purposes, which as we've already agreed would be a tiny amount for even the demonstrated super-high, Earth-bound simulation speeds. And which we've also (I think) agreed it could even throttle down further in the face of major threats.

This sets the stage for dealing in possibly interestingly ways with other "advanced" species at large scales.

I've already agreed that seed AI creating civilizations could /plausibly/ arise in the 800,000 years at that many nines STL it takes to get to that 15th galaxy, even if humans were first. As you say, the story says they exist, so let's take that scenario and do some [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nearest_galaxies][gross napkin figures to argue about]]. I'm using STL drives that move /at/ the speed of light -- not reasonable, but easier to deal with. They also accelerate and decelerate instantly. Natch.

One alien species gets seed AI per galaxy, or one wins very quickly because one has to be first locally and that snowballs really hard (as we've already established). They are encountered after the Milky Way and the Canis Major Overdensity (a pit stop gas station which would take a measly 25,000 years to reach for only 1b stars) -- let us say, at least 13 others total. All galaxies reached that have fewer systems when CAI reaches them lose. I'll even posit that they need 50% more galaxies conquered at that point to win in uninteresting ways.

That means the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy (at 80k lys away) has a seed AI just blooming (relatively speaking) when CAI arrives, given about 100k years as the approximate agreed on head start. They have no more than a few thousand years to act, which is being generous. They have zero galaxies under their control to CAI's 2, and they fall quickly.

Onward, Ursa Major falls in 98k yrs, again likely not enough time to finish even their (tiny) galaxy. They had little time to prepare, again.

After that, it gets further away and they could have tens of thousands of years, maybe even a hundred thousand, to prepare while thinking themselves first as well (and of course preparing for not being so advantaged). But those Large Magellanic Cloud-ians (163k lys) only got their one galaxy together in just less than 100,000 years. They're really frisky in the LMC. But CAI has /four/ galaxies by now. Hmm.

Next out would have little more time, 197,000 years or so, but let's say they get to their own, even further away expansion galaxy first. I will not look up what that is. I'm not getting paid enough to spend that much time finding out. Anyway, they get all of "Bo√∂tes I", plus one other, over about 100k years of wild expansion for two total galaxies under their control. This is insane, and this makes them the most efficient foe yet, even faster at this than CAI was. And then CAI then hits their home system with five galaxies behind them. The home galaxy falls then the satellite colony does.

Skip ahead to the end. /Leo I/ is 820,000 ylrs out. They /would/ get 10 galaxies before the Milky Way Expanding Non-Voluntary Polymorphic Pony Party hits their home galaxy, but they have first encountered CAI's leading edge with /theirs/. And CAI eventually wins all encounters with /much smaller empires/ in this crude model. Let's say /Leo I/ get about 1/2 of the way out (300,000 years given the head start) before the hammer falls on their expanding edge. That should be a spheres intersecting thing, which would actually go /against/ them, but I'll give them this. They have secured 5 galaxies (I'm just giving them a secured galaxy as the first battleground) assuming theirs are spread like ours are (again, I don't care to check, and this helps them greatly). CAI has 12 at that point. This is the closest they've ever come to losing (really, just stalling out and being interesting) based on my stupid, overly critical rules. But /Leo I/ has no chance to survive. Our local cluster is just too dense to give them the time they needed, even with these very generous assumptions.

Is that development likely? No. Humans took 6 /million/ years. Any gap between species will average significantly more than 100,000 years. Is this brainstorming on the same order of the author's original claims? Yeah, I think so. Are the author's claims wildly irrational in any direction? No, I don't think so. I've shown why. And there has been no argument actually put forward and supported that suggests otherwise. Just feelings and questions being discussed.

Which is why I defend the story so. Not because it is great hard or singularity sci-fi -- which as good as it is, it is really isn't -- but because it doesn't reach unreasonably far like I think you are suggesting.

I don't see the idea as being outrageous, given the horrorbilly large numbers I've been mismanaging here. It seems to me that the author was generous having aliens at all. I've said why. And unless attacking into galaxies is really hard or some such, which I'm also willing to say is possible, my guesstimates should be close-ish.
