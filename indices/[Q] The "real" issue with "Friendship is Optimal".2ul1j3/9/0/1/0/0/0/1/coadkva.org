  i can understand the rational for why a random name would effect a person, what i meant is why bring it up as an argument.

The name and stats on an account point directly toward what it has been used for. I quoted them in the open to point out this was a low contribution account with an odd name that had been around for only a moderate amount of time (as reddit's lifespan goes).

Posting ignored comments once a week for that time would have resulted in more points, suggesting inactivity or a secondary account. It was purely context for my response, put forward to demand justification for the tone and content of the message.

  so the real argument becomes about there being some kind of a divide not mentioned in the story which separated civilizations capable of radio communications, and civilizations capable of creating superAIs. which i find to be too big a leap to accept but maybe you seem to have interesting information on these topics so if you have some kind of an argument about that i am more then willing to listen.

It is about making this a wedge issue for plausibility. Suggesting this is a possible flaw or makes the story less "rational" hinges on this being simply author fiat for a specific highly unlikely outcome. Otherwise, it is simply a scenario that can be plausibly be excused by random chance.

It is much, much more likely that the humans-first scenario (which we only have /confirming/ data for from the real world) would find pre-civilization species rather than AI making or even radio broadcasting ones. This makes AI vs AI wars so much less of a concern in the story, especially early on when it actually matters a little. That was my argument for why that "weakness" in it's initial programming really wasn't, even given your worst-case interpretation -- which was also wrong in my view.

I think between the three posts, I've made my reasoning and views clear. Either it is a compelling answer for you or it isn't. With this little data, only the really improbable possibilities can really be ruled out. Everything else is opinion.
