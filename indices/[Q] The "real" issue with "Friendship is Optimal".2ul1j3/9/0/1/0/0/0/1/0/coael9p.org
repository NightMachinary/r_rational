"I quoted them in the open to point out this was a low contribution account " this is reasonable to assume as a reason to believe trolling

"with an odd name " how does that support the trolling assumption? it seems unrelated to me, unless your point about the name being less comfortable is some kind of an indication for you that it is meant to bother whoever talks to him?

"that had been around for only a moderate amount of time " reasonable for evaluating trolling

the point is 2 of the 3 pieces of information you mentioned i see how they would relate to trolling the 3rd doesn't really strike me as an indication..

as i mentioned even if i accept the galaxy take over argument, the intergalactic section of the story still ends up not being rational, which i don't see you disagreeing with seeing as you say the probability of meeting "many" radio broadcasting civilizations, which is a stated fact in the story, is low thus the story doesn't agree with your claims.

so if i understand correctly you agree that the section about the intergalactic conquest isn't logical. you just don't consider it to be important because its in the epilogue.

am i understanding you correctly?
