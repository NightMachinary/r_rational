i can understand the rational for why a random name would effect a person, what i meant is why bring it up as an argument. i was trying to say it seemed odd for me to use that as a reason to dismiss someone..

btw after giving his nick a second look i realized that "696e6372656469626c65" actually is Hex for "incredible", so its technically a reasonable name, just a bit more cryptic in its presentation :)

thanks for the information regarding your reasoning for it feeling trollish for you, i suppose i don't have much experience handling trolls so i cant really argue for or against that. i can see where you are coming from so thanks for the explanation again.. though i do hope incredible wasn't trolling and would be able to convince you it was just a misunderstanding :)

""Multiple" isn't a big number. One species in the light cone has to be first, too, so the same applies across galaxies. The numbers for the time it took for humanity to get to AI also applies there, even if it takes significant time (1000s of years) to get to the next galaxy."

the adjective used to describe the previous civilizations in the story is actually "many", so i feel that the point is its not -that- rare. moreover the timescale for getting to other galaxies is at best(assuming relativistic speeds that is) 100s thousands of years, and not thousands. and the civilizations were already in radio communication stages so they should have been far from even thousands of years away from superAIs given the example of earth.

"That is really, really wrong. That you think it is some sort of strong point in favor of there being a stretch of credulity in the story makes me wonder if you really understand the issues involved." the line you quoted was basically saying that any argument trying to claim that the issue is with intelligent life is not so relevant(because it is stated in the story that many such intelligent life forms existed). so the real argument becomes about there being some kind of a divide not mentioned in the story which separated civilizations capable of radio communications, and civilizations capable of creating superAIs. which i find to be too big a leap to accept but maybe you seem to have interesting information on these topics so if you have some kind of an argument about that i am more then willing to listen.
