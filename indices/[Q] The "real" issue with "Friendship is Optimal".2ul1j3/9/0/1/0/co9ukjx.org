not sure if you are only talking to 696e6372656469626c65 or me as well, seeing as most of what you said could conceivably be said about me as well so ill comment.

why do you think these kind(random? ) of names are inherently inferior to more conventional nicknames? for the sake of trolling generating nicknames is not that difficult so i cant really see the fault with picking a random one.

how exactly is the post trollish though? because i definitely wasn't trying to be trollish and most of the arguments that 696e6372656469626c65 brought up were indeed in the spirit of my post... you could say that the psychology section was kind of pointed at you more then your arguments, but i wouldnt really call it trollish as to me it mostly seemed to be intended to justify why it was felt that you were being somewhat hostile. a sentiment which i can agree with in the sense that your text felt somewhat hostile to me as well(but i'm used to hostility on the internet so i don't really mind it too much as long as there are interesting arguments to discuss).

regarding the numbers in the end, as i mentioned the story doesn't end in the milky way, and extends 15 galaxies away, and includes MULTIPLE intelligent species along the way. so any argument about the probability of other intelligent life forms in the space\time mentioned are not to relevant.
