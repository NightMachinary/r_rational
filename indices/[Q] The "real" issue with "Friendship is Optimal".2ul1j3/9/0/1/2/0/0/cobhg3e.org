(*NOTE:* This comment is /not/ intended as a direct reply to [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer]]. It is instead intended for any potential readers of this thread. Some background info: [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer]] has repeatedly made unfounded statements about me claiming that I am a "troll" on this subreddit. I have already written a [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2ul1j3/q_the_real_issue_with_friendship_is_optimal/coafxmk][similar]] rebuttal of his/her points elsewhere, but as he/she has not ceased to make these accusations, I felt it best to write one here as well.)

If you read my [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2ul1j3/q_the_real_issue_with_friendship_is_optimal/co9lxko][original comment]], you will see that my remark on [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer]]'s tone and my response to his/her actual argument were in fact written as separate from each other and were intended to be read as such. I even emphasized this fact by using HTML-esque /<psychological-analysis-over-the-Internet></psychological-analysis-over-the-Internet>/ tags intended to show that the statements therein were only semi-serious and unlikely to actually be true. I did not, in fact, believe that [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer]] actually had any psychological issues or whatever other conclusions he/she might have drawn from my post; my rebuke was intended simply as a reminder to keep it civil, as well as give an analytical list of reasons /why/ I found his/her tone in the thread originator hostile, seeing as I felt a flat accusation with no reasons behind it would be less useful. (On LessWrong, I believe this is referred to as [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/jis/tell_culture/][Tell Culture]].) I now see that this was a mistake.

Mistake or not, however, [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer]]'s [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2ul1j3/q_the_real_issue_with_friendship_is_optimal/co9o6nf][response]] to my comment was neither rational (in the sense that it derived its conclusion through a series of appropriate logical inferences) nor civil (this one should be obvious). The pieces of evidence he/she cited later on in comment responses to [[/u/IomKg]] to support said conclusion (low account activity, short account life, strange name--which I should point out is actually because it is [[http://www.asciitohex.com/][encoded in hexadecimal]]) are so weak as to be negligible, and there is a whole host of more charitable interpretations of the same evidence that could have been taken--one of which, I should add, was [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2ul1j3/q_the_real_issue_with_friendship_is_optimal/coafxmk][actually the case]]. I stated above that at the time of posting my original comment, I did not assign any significant probability to the hypothesis that [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer]] had any psychological issues. His/her reply to me, however, has caused me to significantly revise my estimate upward. If I may advance an alternate hypothesis as to why he/she accused me a trolling (with the usual caveats that come with trying to read someone's intent over the Internet):

I think that [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer]] has a generally stigmatic response to criticism, particularly criticism that he/she perceives as a personal attack. As a result, I believe that he/she may have interpreted my (mostly offhand) remark as a personal attack, i.e. an attempt to reduce his/her social status in this subreddit, and retaliated in kind by insinuating that I am not a legitimate redditor and am instead some kind of "troll". I feel that this action of his/hers may or may not have been [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/ju/rationalization/][intentional]], or even [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/l0/adaptationexecuters_not_fitnessmaximizers/][conscious]]. However, I estimate the probability of [[http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Motivated_cognition][motivated cognition]] playing a /significant/ role in his/her evaluation of my intent as close to 100%. The fact that he/she has continued making comments defending those same accusations which I have [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2ul1j3/q_the_real_issue_with_friendship_is_optimal/coafxmk][already refuted]] in spite of /multiple/ people ([[/u/IomKg]], [[/u/eaturbrainz]]) expressing skepticism that this is the case is, I feel, an attempt at reputational slander--deliberate or otherwise--and as such should be taken with generous helpings of salt.

(P.S. To [[/u/eaturbrainz]]: Is my English really that bad? :P)

(*EDIT:* After a closer reading of the parent of this comment made by [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer]], I note that he/she has in fact ceased to insist that I am a troll, and has instead begun to refer to me as a "dishonest debater" with whom it is "not worth [his/her] time to engage further". While this classification is also something I would like to contest, it is a significant improvement over his/her previous designation of me as a "troll". With this in mind, I hereby retract the claim I made above that [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer]] is attempting to slander my reputation on reddit. I hope that no further hostilities will be exchanged between myself and [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer]] beyond this point, be it direct or indirect.)
