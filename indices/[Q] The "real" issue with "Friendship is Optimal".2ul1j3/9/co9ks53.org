That's missing the point of the story entirely. A rational entity with science and even normal levels of intellect is far greater in scope and power than a "natural" and directionless process, like the evolutionary one called here "survival of the fittest". Reconsider your assumptions about these pop-sociology, competition-supremacy ideas. Ironing out inefficiencies in unsolved systems is the point of competition as an optimising process, something a super-intelligence capable of fully understanding truly huge quantities of variable doesn't have to deal with (or, at least not to as great an extent). It doesn't even have pressing biological distractions.

The rest is all assumptions and weak pleadings of disbelief with no backing, and thus not really requiring a strong response, but consider that all of existing humanity is absurdly low resource cost to run digitally compared to conquering a light cone. All of the rest of your concerns are answered by the story not being set up that way. Against that, no logical argument is possible given a lack of useful Drake-equation-fulfilling data. The story doesn't make any provably "unlikely" assumptions beyond the physics ones you point out, certainly not any involving the efficiency of the featured AI.
