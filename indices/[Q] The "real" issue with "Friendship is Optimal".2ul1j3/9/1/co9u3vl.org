you make a lot of assumptions regarding the cost of emulating humanity inside a virtual world. assumptions which are at the moment baseless, moreover as i mentioned in the main post it is mentioned in story that in order to maximize it's absolute values in the real world celestAI was operating the virtual world significantly faster then the real world, which increases the cost and makes it so there will be no hard cap for said cost.

i really don't see how intelligence, or even super intelligence will change the fact that efficient processes for a given environment have a much better chance of monopolizing resources. sure in the context of human existence celestAI could support an internal world with no scarcity, but in the real world there is a limit to the available resources(or there might not be a limit, but there will be a limit to close resources) and thus once you go into the universal scale collisions are very much possible. and in those collisions the process more adjusted for existing and growing will triumph. you seem to imply that will no longer be the case once superAIs exists and i cant see what is the rational for that claim, unless when you say superAI you are not referring to the type shown in this story but instead to superAIs that do not operate under any specific 3d party dictated rule-set thus it is optimal for any scenario.

you say that the story answers all of the answers all of the rest of the questions because of the lack of data we have, and as i mentioned in a previous comment sure it possible humanity was first, and all the other intelligent life forms developed just in time to be conveniently consumed by celestAI. it just doesn't make sense in any kind of rational universe, and would basically be a plot device. which is no sin, just not really rational.
