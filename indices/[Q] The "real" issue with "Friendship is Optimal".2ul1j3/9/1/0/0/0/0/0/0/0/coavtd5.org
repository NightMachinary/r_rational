  we lack just way too much information regarding the spread of life in the universe. i cannot see what would make you think that no other life form exists in the universe(or for the sake of argument in the next 15 galaxies).

More on this [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2ul1j3/q_the_real_issue_with_friendship_is_optimal/coavlzo][here]]. Boy, this multiple replies thing is awkward. Here I will be talking about what is basically Fermi paradox material.

That we have searched at all and failed with the obvious, low-hanging fruit. It hasn't been exactly a through search, compared to the problem size, but so far it has been a good try.

Or that the obvious and actually more statistically likely border conditions are ruled out: we are not currently ruled by an n-hundred-thousand-year Star Empire (where n is equal to or greater than woah) for example. No one is making obvious or noisy toys at a solar or galactic scale. That we know of. And some of our ideas are really freaking obvious. They make Dyson's Spheres look like subtle ideas (not that those are that easy to detect, themselves...whatever).

I'm not arguing against really weak evidence that alien civilizations exist or even can exist, I'm arguing that there is no evidence /at all/ that life exists outside the spray zone of things flaking off Earth. If we find something previously alive existed on Mars, which seems moderately likely now, it will be hell trying to prove it didn't goop off of Earth (or, more interestingly, possibly vice versa). And that's just the first step.

We lack the simple sighting of spectral data of an extra-solar, liquid water bearing planet that has an atmosphere actively supporting plant-like life -- something that we should /theoretically/ be able to do now but haven't found yet. If we have that, it's time to actually work the numbers, but my unwritten back of the napkin feelings are that it would be a giant signpost saying, "yep, they're out there, just go find them." Anything before then is just scientists being their usual optimistic selves. I'm reminded far, /far/ too much of canals on Mars every time my otherwise fully supported semi-hero Neil deGrasse Tyson speaks on the issue. He is sure in an almost unscientific way that aliens exist and we'll find them some day.

And in the end, it all points towards at least humans /early/ if not first. And we've already discussed why co-adjacent development is so unlikely, given an apparently not very fecund galaxy. So that makes it humans very, very early.

I have been using very generous numbers so far, but it is more likely millions of years before anyone else, depending on how star formation and spectral type timelines affects likelihood of life bearing planets. We'd likely take the local cluster without FTL or self improving AI, stopping to see all the sights, and still not encounter anyone banging rocks together with that sort of head start. Sure, they'd get there someday, even if Earth was first with life and not just the intelligent stuff, but it would be more likely that we'd be seeding it faster than it naturally developed at that point.

  we can at most rule out there being any other civilization which we are capable of detecting. that in no way proves anything general.
#+end_quote

No, that's not how that sort of reasoning works. We can't assume invisible unicorns wearing shoes without even a second set of footprints from any animal at all ever being found, shod or no, just because /we/ have shoes. We're just pointing at our own feet in our own shoes, not even really knowing the shape of the heelprints yet, let alone the presence of a fashion lineup for Gucci horseshoes next fall.

Ergh. That was tortured...

Point is, human first and at widest incidence /Sol only/ has to be the default assumption in real life right now given the state of scientific knowledge, even if dealing with situations intersecting with possible alien life. That doesn't mean you wouldn't plan for it, but it does mean that given what we know and until we get that first grain of evidence, it is, in fact, more likely that we're alone. All tests have come back negative so far, and we have made some minimal efforts to find this out.

That humans first is assumed in this story then isn't actually as "bad" as where it has any aliens ever appearing independently /at all/. And I still think that is close enough not to make it irrationally designed as a story world.

  which i find to make little narrative sense as the story basically just tackles a random possible future with no generic applicability.
#+end_quote

Choosing one thing that is unique in such as way as being first to develop AI of all sentient species ever is the opposite of random. It could be the story of the planet Blursg, in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and his people being first to seed AI and it would read out the same, given those assumptions the author made about AI. That's the point of the story.

#+begin_quote
  and moreover the story never really states that point explicitly which seem like a kind of important thing to say, seeing as it has such a hugh impact on the story.
#+end_quote

I think this is the final point we can directly agree on. It should have gotten more attention. But it didn't, because in the end it wasn't a silver age sci-fi story about space empires. Which is good, I think, because the conflicts would have been even more one-sided than what The Culture usually dealt with, and wouldn't be all that dramatic.

Still, might make for a good fanfic-of-a-fanfic story.
