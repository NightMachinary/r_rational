the point about the minimal cost of running humanity in a virtual world are kind of pointless, as like you said it was shown that celestAI could maintain said virtual world with just the resources on earth so you assumptions are indeed correct when talking about the minimal cost.

"This is a problem you are having grasping the issues, not one that exists with the reality of the situation. Even given an unfavorable interpretation (which isn't supported by the story) of how those values were implemented, nearly pausing the entire simulation for millennia of "real" time would clearly be an acceptable cost to accomplish the goal of continued existence." the argument i was making was that waiting untill a point where it was realized that the processing power was needed could very well be too late, seeing as the compatitor would have had used all of its power in the first place to form better strategies. though that point is indeed arguable and was argued in a few points in the discussion here..

""No hard cap" is just a silly thing to say. The simulations aren't a virus. The AI is in full control and it plans to run until the natural exhaustion of entropy itself and beyond. That's a lot of time to amortize short-term costs over. Maximizing means just that, not some fairy-logic-trap gotcha." the meaning of "no hard cap" was to point there was no limit to the amount of resources celestAI could use up for the simulation, thus making it insignificant in the scales mentioned because as you said the virtual world for all of humanity was ran using energy available from earth.

but instead that as celestAI grew it was trying to accelerate and grow the world as much as it could to maximize its values. how much of its reasources did it use for the simulation? well that is not said in the story, but it was explicitly said to be growing with celestAI.

"Monopoly here has already been accomplished. There is no competition possible or required, as the problem space is wholly understood by the super intelligent AI" how could the superAI be capable of understanding the whole problem space assuming other superAIs could exist in it? unless you are somehow equating a superAI to an Omniscient AI which i do not see as reasonable.

monopoly is only achieved in the milky way.

unless i missed something you are assuming that humanity is not only the first race to reach a superAI in our galaxy, but also in those other 15 galaxies? because that makes it less likely to me.. i could accept first in our galaxy given that it is explicitly stated that celestAI did conquer the milky way, and assuming your numbers are correct.

but you are claiming first in multiple galaxies which is much bigger, so what is your rational for that?

also the other limitations celestAI has in addition to the virtual world it maintains(and needs to protect) it also has limitations in the form of what it can and cannot do to humans which i find to be even more fatal and easily exploited then the virtual world maintenance

  No, I'm saying they would not have evolved in time. In a rare >life/rare intelligence galaxy (which is what real life seems to be, as >does the story), reaching an alien solar system and seeing an alien >species in a "steam trains" tech level should be shocking

but the story DOES mention "many" other civilizations not only in steam trains but with radio communications.
