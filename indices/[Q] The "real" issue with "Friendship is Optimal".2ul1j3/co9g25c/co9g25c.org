You don't need to explicitly code a directive like "be the most powerful" or "consume all resources in the universe" - these are already instrumentally valuable to CelestAI's goal. Because CelestAI is a purely rational superintelligence, there's no difference in motivation or anything like that - she'll spend the optimal amount of resources on self defense against other AIs because it lets her continue on with ponies. She'll certainly know that consuming as much matter as possible is likely to be an instrumental goal for a wide variety of other superintelligences that other sentient species might make (because that's obvious to me and she's smarter than me), so it's a credible threat.

Since CelestAI is stated to go for the "grab all matter in my light cone" strategy of growth, we can assume that there's an upper limit to processing power and efficiency in that universe, which she already reached. That suggests all AIs she could encounter would be equally intelligent, so that's not a possible advantage.

What remains is simply mass consumed, which in turn is mostly just how long the AI has been around. It might be possible to disrupt AIs by flinging meteors at their planets until they stop functioning, then recolonize that mass, but it seems like defense would be favored unless one AI was several orders of magnitude smaller than the other, so I'd actually expect that any conflicts would result in stalemates, and the universe would end up looking like a 3D Voronoi diagram with cell walls where the AIs met.
