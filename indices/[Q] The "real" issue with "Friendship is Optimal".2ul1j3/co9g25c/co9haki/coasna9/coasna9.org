  The point is that the other directive definitely subtract from any self preservation functionality, which other AIs wont (all) be hindered by thus creating a situation where they have inherent advantage with regards to survival.

Oh. The Scott Alexander Moloch thingy.

Look bro, once you've turned one solar system into gooey computronium, it's really all the same. The fictional AIs pictured simply don't have any constraints along the lines of "These bits of mass have to remain assembled into biological people and environments in which they live", eg: GSVs, Orbitals, that sort of thing.

So at that point, differences in goal aren't really going to provide much of a military advantage.

Also, since we are technically discussing the physically realistic possibilities for interstellar or intergalactic warfare among Properly Advanced Species, you should probably relabel the thread to address that specifically.
