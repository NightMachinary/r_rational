i can generally agree with that, in the sense that it is fairly un-provable in that kind of scenario if CelestAIs logic would be a big enough issue. and it would really depend on the universe. so i can accept that point, yeah.

  that the chances for her to encounter a similarly large/old AI are >much lower than not encountering one at all. why?

we are explicitly told many advanced civilizations existed in CelestAIs light cone. why would you think it doesn't make sense for any of them to have completed an AI before celestAI was made?
