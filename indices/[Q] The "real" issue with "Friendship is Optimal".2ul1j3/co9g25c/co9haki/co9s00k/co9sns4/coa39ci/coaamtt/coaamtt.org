let die is different from actively kill, i don't think i directive such as "never kill a human" is actually mentioned in the story, but i believe it is very much implied. not consuming earth before the last biological human dies, having restrictions such as not uploading the brains of unwilling humans, never actually killing someone in story

though it is shown the CelestAI was capable of letting laars be in possible physical danger, but the reality of the danger is never really proven and there are plenty of ways that it could avoid risking a violation of an asimovish first law so i don't really think it proves that such a rule doesn't exist for CelestAI..

anyhow i think even without complete paralysis in regards to human the difference in its ability to react would be significant enough to make it unfit for such a war.
