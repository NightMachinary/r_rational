Are you sure that the non-optimal parameters would be such a hindrance though? I would think that available resources are much more important. If CelestAI, after having assimilated 2/3ds of the Milky Way, encounters a perfectly optimized 'survive and grow by all means' UFAI that is still young enough to have only just started its conquest of a second solar system, then I don't see why the much larger entity should lose just because she uses a good amount of her much larger computation power for the prime Friendship and Ponies subroutine. This is very much a headstart advantage game.
