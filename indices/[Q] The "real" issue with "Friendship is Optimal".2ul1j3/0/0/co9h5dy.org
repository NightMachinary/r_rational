the timescale shown in the end seems to imply any such encounter event should have happened by the time the story ends.

unless you are only talking about the subjective virtual world, in which case my question would be why are we shown events(in absolute time) that happened eons after the last subjective events( that according to the explained subjective scale happened even before the last human died)?
