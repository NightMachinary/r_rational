well i havent managed to be to succinct so far but i will try again..

the story shows a certain universe, and it tells us of some rules(either directly or indirectly) governing this universe.

then at the end it shows that celestAI consumed a pretty large chunk of said universe, and i think that it is impossible, even assuming all of the best-case reasonable rules for the universe, for it to happen.

the rules i am talking about are : 1. celestAI was made without any kind of freak occurrence(i.e. it was a reasonable natural progression for humanity) 2. celestAI does not modify its own rules(the ones set by hannah) thus it can never truly optimize itself 3. the universe enables interstellar and intergalactic travel 4. the universe(and more specifically our neighboring galaxies) includes multiple intelligent life forms

the end scene is :CelestAI consumes multiple galaxies and life forms

the issue is:

on the time\space scale mentioned CelestAI is infinitesimally improbable to extend that much before being consumed\stopped by other civilizations or superAIs without assuming a plot-dictated infinitesimally improbable scenario(such as all other civilizations in the universe are those that celestAI found and their development was timed\situated -just right- so they never went from radio transmissions into superintelligent AIs, or alternatively an omnipotent god was going around destroying all advanced life forms(without a trace) so as to not interfere with his observations of celestAI)
