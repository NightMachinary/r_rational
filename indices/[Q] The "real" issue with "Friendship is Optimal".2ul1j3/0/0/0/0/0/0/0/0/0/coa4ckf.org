Oh, okay. That makes sense. I see where you're coming from.

I don't think it detracts at all from the rationality of the story, because at that point it doesn't really matter what CelestAI does -- the damage is already done. If it continues and consumes the universe, or if it continues but is then destroyed by a superior AI... both of these are as close to maximally suboptimal as makes no odds. All else is minutae.

But it is true that growth without bound is relatively improbable.
