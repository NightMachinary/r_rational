1. Yes, celestAI meeting another galaxy spanning AI would be a major event in its life.
2. Yes, there might or might not be more than one out there.
3. The timescale mentioned isn't anywhere near the end of the universe, it is just "a really long time from now". With an all encompassing AI this could be only a few thousand years from now.
4. The physics toward the end are questionable, but not irrational. It was very nonspecific because the author was saying "I don't know how it works, but the AI could figure it out." This is a slight bit of irrationality that we are I capable of overcoming because we do not have the tech so we can't accurately describe how it works.
