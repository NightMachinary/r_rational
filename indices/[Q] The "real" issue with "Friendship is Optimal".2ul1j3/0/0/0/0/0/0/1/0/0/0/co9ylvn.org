well, its less an issue of cutting the story a day before the invasion and more about it happening off-screen, as the story does go 15 galaxies away, and mentions multiple intelligent lifeforms being met before that..

but yeah one way is to assume that the story just doesn't show it happening, and the only point of the epilogue was to show that other civilizations were destroyed, but that begs the question of "why show that" for me, as in that universe the fact that celestAI destroyed a few civilizations is kind of insignificant relative to the other issues..

but then its less about a logical issue and more of a narrative issue :)
