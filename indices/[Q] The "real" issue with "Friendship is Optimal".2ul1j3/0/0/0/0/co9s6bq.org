the point about the significance and possible implications of superAIs is understood(even if not necessarily agreed), but my issue is with the logic\narrative of said world.

if you say that it was done because there was something the author wanted to tell issue i mentioned conflicted with that story so he just ignored it and told the story as he wanted that is fine(narrative wise). it doesn't change the fact that these are logical issues with the story, which makes it just less rational.
