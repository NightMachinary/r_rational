well, as mentioned if you think that the decision not to go into the logical reasons of what happened in the end was for the dramatic effect and it is acceptable for you because that is what the story should be that is fine, i didn't claim the story was bad because of it. only that it bothered me and i was interested in what others thought about it..

the point about the ponies first of all would depend on the maxim possible optimization of any superAI war. if it is a solvable issue, which is reasonably solvable with the resources that celestAI had then celestAI would not have any strategic\tactic issues in such a war. but there is no way to really answer that question, it is possible that there is no solution for that question and that the best strategy would be the one in which the most resources were put.

but other then that celestAI has another issues 1. celestAi needs to maintain a copy of the virtual world, which would require at least a certain minimal unit size, while an optimized AI could theoretically fit in a multiple orders of magnitude minimal size in a swarm array, thus if there exists a strategy(in the given limits of phisics of said world) which would favor small units celestAI would not be capable of winning that. 2. more importantly celestAI has exploitable rules which any other superAI would be sure to abuse in the form of her preferential treatment of humans.. the other superAI could just generate "humans" as Trojan horses and destroy celestAI(in my head cannon that is the only explanation i can see for the "human" like race CelestAI discovers in the end, but even that theory has holes)

you assume that all other AIs would have preference for their existence where it is possible they would have directives that make the second option preferable.
