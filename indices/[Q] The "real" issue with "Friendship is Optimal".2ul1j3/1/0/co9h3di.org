sure it does, my point is that there will probably be other AIs which are PURELY optimized for domination, while CelestAI is using at least SOME energy and effort maintaining a full virtual world(which if i am not mistaken CelestAI accelerates relative to absolute time based on the resources it has thus the effort put into it is in % and not some fixed amount)
