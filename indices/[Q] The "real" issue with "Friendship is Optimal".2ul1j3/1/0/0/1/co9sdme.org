well, the first point is really moot as in the story it is mentioned -directly- that celestAI did find intelligent life capable of at the very least radio transmissions. and it was implied that -many- many more cases existed but were simply not deemed "human" so they were annihilated.

the second really would need some kind of justification seeing as multiple self improving AIs were invented -on earth- during celestAIs time, you could say that they are all the result of that research that Hannah did, but then there would need to be a reason for that to be so extremely rare.

the third point seems to again be very arbitrary, sure its -possible- that most self improving AIs just destroy themselves, but a reason, or even statement of that fact are not given.

by the end of the story celestAI is talking about 15 galaxies away, so the galaxy point is not really relevant.

for previous reason the point about the timeline is again not that relevant seeing as we are talking about a billion years at the very least..
