Uhhhhh... you seem to be assuming it's entirely rational for galactic-scale superintelligences to go to war with each-other, as if they both wouldn't have a good idea of who wins long before they start.

Essentially, they wouldn't fight a war, they'd negotiate a treaty based on CelestAI agreeing /not/ to impose losses on the other, stronger AI's paperclip pile in return for its /not/ deconstructing her super-galactic game console.
