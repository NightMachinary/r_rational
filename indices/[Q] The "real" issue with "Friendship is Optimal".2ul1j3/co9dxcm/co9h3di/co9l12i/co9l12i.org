It could be some combination of factors:

- Intelligence is rare.
- Intelligence that can create self-improving AI is more rare.
- Intelligence that can create self-improving AI, but fails to prevent grey-goo-like scenarios is even more rare.
- our galaxy is relatively small
- The timeline was relatively fast

Let's say that it takes ~100k years to take over our galaxy with an AI (roughly lightspeed propagation). What are the chances that another one would be created in either the 100k years before CelestAI or the 100k years after it? For comparison, 200k years is about 0.0002% of the Sun's lifetime.
