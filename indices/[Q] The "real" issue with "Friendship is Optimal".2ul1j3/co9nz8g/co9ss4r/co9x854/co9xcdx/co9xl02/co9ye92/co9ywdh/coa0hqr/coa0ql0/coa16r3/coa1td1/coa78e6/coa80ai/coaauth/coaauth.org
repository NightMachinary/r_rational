1. i dont think i overvalued intellect beyond what is actually presented in the story. all of the weapons you are talking about are insignificant on the scales we are talking about. unless you are talking about a "baby" AI which was orders of magnitude younger then CelestAI, which plausibly would happen. only the opposite should happen just as well...

2. all you are saying about the real world are fine, but in story all the events you mention do happen, thus making them likely in that universe
