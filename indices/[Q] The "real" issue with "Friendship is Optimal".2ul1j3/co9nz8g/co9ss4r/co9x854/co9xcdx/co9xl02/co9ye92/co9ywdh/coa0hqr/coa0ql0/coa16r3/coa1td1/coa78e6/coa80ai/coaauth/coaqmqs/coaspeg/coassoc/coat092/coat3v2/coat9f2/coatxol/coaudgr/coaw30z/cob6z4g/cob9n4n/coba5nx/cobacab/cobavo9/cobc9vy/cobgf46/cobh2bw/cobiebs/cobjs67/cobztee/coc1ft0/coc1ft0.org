  one AI could travel at 10% of the speed of light, or even 1%, sure it would take it 10-100 times more time to get to its target

Is there actually enough available energy in one galaxy to move a galaxy's worth of mass? I doubt it. Plus there would be huge energy losses from surviving the trip. You'd also have the risk of enemy local number advantages. All of those things would pull it down sharply from a 1:1 ship trading match.

  in the room example that is true, but we are talking about a large body(galaxy) controlled by an AI, it doesn't need to "gather" all of the blocks you moved away, because in not a small probability they would simply reach another cluster of the AI(gravity?) simply in another spot in the galaxy.

Anyway, since you don't seem to be using much science in your answers I see little point in continuing- it's a fairly well known principle that space is mostly empty, if you're going to ignore that and entropy I can't do much to convince you, and you can't convince me with your lack of science.
