  if so, the same issue applies- celestAI can glass any non moving Computronium substance. She can easily kill any smaller AI. As such, intergalatic AIs aren't a threat to her.

sure, but what if the computronium is constantly moving?

  In story and reality hostile AIs or aliens haven't visibly colonized our galaxy or nearby ones, indicating their non existence or lack of ability to colonize things. The link I cited notes many possible reasons. "Intelligent civilizations exist, but we see no evidence, meaning f_c is small. Typical arguments include that civilizations are too far apart, it is too expensive to spread throughout the galaxy, civilizations broadcast signals for only a brief period of time, it is dangerous to communicate, it is the nature of intelligent life to destroy itself, it is the nature of intelligent life to destroy others, they tend to experience a technological singularity, and others." As such, celestAI should be able to colonize.

how do any of the reasons you quoted imply the celestAI should be able to colonize(without resistance, as no one implying colonization in its very essence is impossible for for celestAI)
