1. this is going for the extreme specifics, but "You several times implied that an older AI would be able to stop that somehow or avoid her weapons" not an older AI as much as a reasonably capable AI, lasers move at the speed of light sure, but they still need to hit, and that only works if the enemy is static, or has a predictable movement pattern. otherwise celestAI would need to be very close, in a way which seems to make that form of warfare moot. the point is that the warfare me and you imagine are just not likely to be relevant as we are not superAIs, so we can continue a back and forth of celestAI could do this, but the enemy could do this. but it just wont contribute to the discussion to much.

2. but then in the story many advanced civilizations, so all you can really say is that the fact that multiple such civilizations are found conflicts with you whole "14 billion years old" "if something hasn't happened it's unlikely to happen in the next million years" point.

  To use the weakness against her an enemy AI has to identify what humans are and that she can't hurt them. She's unlikely to tell an enemy AI this. They'd have to force it out of her.

true, but that scenario is not impossible, it actually likely over a long enough conflict.

  In our world it's canon that there are no obvious galaxy consuming AIs nearby, despite many suspecting intelligent life is probable.

in our world no superAI was developed so that's not really an argument.
