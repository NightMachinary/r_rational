  celestAI can presumably move ships pretty fast too in an unpredictable manner.
#+end_quote

true

#+begin_quote
  You were presupposing an AI with several stellar systems controlled fighting against celestAI. If the ships of the other AI dodge out of range then they can't stop celestAI from glassing their planets and the mainframes of the AIs that oppose celestAI. Planets are harder to move than spaceships.
#+end_quote

you are assuming the AIs have "planets" where the end of the story fairly explicitly describes a somewhat different state where the "computer" is some kind of a Computroniumish substance spread all over the galaxy.

  Also, if celestAi has more resources they can afford to zerg rush enemies and get ships close for the kill.
#+end_quote

true, though less relevant in intergalactic warfare where just getting the ships there would be pretty expensive energy wise

#+begin_quote
  Since many on our planet think aliens probably exist
#+end_quote

probably, but we do not know.

#+begin_quote
  This is a widely recognized issue with reality, the story shouldn't be expected to disagree.
#+end_quote

in the story many advanced civilization are discovered, an "issue" we do not have with reality, thus no conflict.
