I think there are two big errors in your theories.

1. You seem to overvalue intellect. No amount of intellect or AI intelligence is going to overcome the fact that celestAI, if she fears an enemy AI, is capable of hitting any planets with multiple dinosaur killers and vaporizing the surface with lasers. There are limits to material chemistry and so she can easily destroy any AI with superior materials and energy. Their intellect will not protect them from the fact that most chemical bonds break above a certain temperature.

2. You're not weighting real life highly enough. We know that an AI hasn't formed in our galaxy and done anything major like fully dyson a star. Whatever reasoning you have, evidently the AIs haven't done anything to make them deadly. We don't know why, but it hasn't happened.
