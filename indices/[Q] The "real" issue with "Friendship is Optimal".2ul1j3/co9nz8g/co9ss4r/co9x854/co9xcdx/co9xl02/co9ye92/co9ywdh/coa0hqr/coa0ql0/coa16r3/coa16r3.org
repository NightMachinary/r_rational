when you say AIs are presumably rare you mean hostile AIs i suppose, that doesn't really mean that -no- AIs exist.

how are the masses relevant for the discussion, what are you trying to say with that i feel like i am missing something.

why would an AI from another galaxy not know celestAIs weaknesses, specifically why would it not be capable of figuring them out? it seems much easier to figure them out then to keep them secret, with the fact that celestAI is sending probes into other galaxies with copies of herself(and much less resources).

while your argument about AIs being rare is fine in the real world we are not told any reason that would be the case in this story, seeing as humanity, which is not -that- advanced managed to develop one without any kind of irregular occurance. simply regular scientific advancement.

and we are told other civilizations(one explicitly others implicitly) reached radio communications levels of technology, which when talking about the astronomical timescales practically means that they should have reached AIs about immediately following what we are told about them.. i.e. extremely convenient timing..
