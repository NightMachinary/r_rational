  sure so lets say you brought a hundred planets

You said that it was hard for a ship to destroy a planet- I then replied to say you could send a hundred planets worth of mass of spaceships to attack said planet if you outnumbered them. I agree and have repeatedly said that a galaxy spanning AI can resist any incursions.

Still, do you think 1 planet worth of AI could resist 100 planets worth of ships? 10^{27} tons of planet vs 10^{17} 10^{13} ton ships?

  if you imagine a couple of blocks set together in the shape of a square and you kick them thus "destroying" the square, can you say that process would cost you less energy then it would take me to move them back into a square shape for sure?
#+end_quote

Imagine you have 900 blocks, each which have to be in a precise place. I kick them and some fly out of the window. I am very sure it will take longer for you to put them back together than for me to take them apart.

#+begin_quote
  the blocks are atoms. and actually atoms can have bonds between them, and destroying those bonds isn't always easier then reconnecting them.

yes it is, most synthesis things take huge amounts of time and precision, you can break down pretty much anything but putting it in a hot enough kiln. I am a chemist, I know these things. Purifying things is super expensive and takes ages.

#+begin_quote
  you are applying conventional knowledge which is relevant to our time and technology and applying it to a very different situation..
#+end_quote

Science doesn't stop working. New science is developed but past science remains true. Unless sci fi magic is true. Entropy isn't going to stop existing because you get smarter.

#+begin_quote
  but because in story it is said many radio using civilizations existed its a reasonable stipulation that regardless of what is causing advanced civilizations to pop up so much(some other alien race planting the seeds at a similar time in many places?)
#+end_quote

Your theory requires a godlike civilization mass colonizing the universe, my theory requires well known conventional assumptions like civilization die off. Yours has a major complexity penalty and thus is inferior.

#+begin_quote
  conventionally yes, depending on the specific physics of course but in our current assumption it would be, unless the AI has some kind of a significant vulnerability built into its code it would be extremely difficult..
#+end_quote

So, do you think one planet worth of AI invading a galaxy can defeat 100, or 1,000,000 planets worth of entrenched AI?
