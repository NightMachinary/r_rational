1. another AI might(as it depends mostly of the physics of the world) not be able to stop celestAI from galssing their world, but unless the power difference (age, as we assume both will spread in similar rates) but the same will be the case for celestAI, as the other AI will be able to to glass celestAI's planets as well.
2. even assuming that the fact no other AI dyson'd our galaxy before us is reasonable i dont think the same holds for no other AI dysoning the other galaxies. technically you could say that it is "canon" as well , but i dont think that would be logical nor reasonable. given the other canon facts.
