1. If you have to assume sci fi physics to make an AI win then it's not really canon. Real life physics should be assumed unless something else is stated.

2. We've looked at nearby galaxies, they don't appear to be heavily dyson'd, though we can't prove no stars are dyson'd unlike what we've done in our galaxy. Some level of AI presence is possible but without complete dominance as CelestAI has there's a chance for her to win any conflict. Without mass dyson'd stars and dominance of the galaxy other AIs will likely lose to the more dominating CelestAI who has far more ships to glass planets with. Regardless of your technology it's very hard to beat a 100-1 advantage. We know most galaxies aren't small clusters of super dense matter making giant computer cores.
