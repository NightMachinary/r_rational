i don't see how any of that supports your point, if anything it implies that an AI focused on defense would have an issue seeing as its so easy to attack with huge force..

btw you assume that celestAI has much more mass and computing power then competing AIs which can only be explained by earth somehow being the first world to make a superAI. which by itself is already improbable

also you ignored celestAI's second weakness
