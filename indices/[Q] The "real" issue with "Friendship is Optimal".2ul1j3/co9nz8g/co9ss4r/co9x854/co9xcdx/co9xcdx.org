by "event" and "meet" i meant to say that celestAI should have stopped existing as it was unfit for survival in that scenario.

you could claim that the probe mentioned 15 galaxies away from the milky way is actually the last remaining instance and that it is simply not aware of the destruction of its previous\other instances. but that doesn't seem like the impression the story was thing to give..
