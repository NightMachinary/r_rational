the fact we cannot predict it exactly doesnt mean we cant have any idea regarding what would happen.

what you say could just as well be said about any element in any story as we cannot realistically predict the infinite chain reaction that every action mentioned would generate thus why should we even try to be rational?

in other word its not really constructive.
