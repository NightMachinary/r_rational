AI versus AI combat is not what this story is about. (Although CelestAI does encounter other potential AIs on Earth, she makes quick work of them.) It might be a good story, and I think if you look through the Optimalverse fanfanfics it'll be in there somewhere, but it is not this story. /Friendship Is Optimal/ is already over and well into its epilogue by the time aliens enter the picture.

As to who would win - well, starting first might or might not be an overwhelming advantage. If the two Singularities happened independently, neither being in the future light-cone of the other, then both of them might consider themselves the "first".

I don't think it's all that relevant that CelestAI would need to protect the little ponies. Nobody's values (save the alien's) would be satisfied if CelestAI were destroyed, so deleting a few shards to free up resources is a perfectly legitimate move. Paperclip maximisers have a lot in common with one another - the first step of their plan is always "take over the world", regardless of whether they're maximising paperclips or ponies or self-preservation. I don't think their utility function has much to do with how good they are in a fight.

But who says it would come to a fight? War would certainly use up a lot of resources. Surely it would be better for everyone to recognise that fact and adopt an alliance? Given the choice between a 100% chance of getting 50% of the universe, and a 50% chance of getting 100% /minus all the resources spent on the war/, the choice is pretty obvious.
