i mentioned that even being the first superAI doesnt seem to explain the epilogue for me because we are still talking about a huge timescale. so unless you are saying i should assume that in that universe celestAI was both the first superAI, and that all intelligent species that evolved following celestAIs genesis happened exactly on the right point in time so that they would become capable of complex radio transmissions but not early enough as to actually develop their own superAIs.

the end of the earth is something i could understand as a (somewhat)logical outcome for celestAIs values. probably even the end of our star system. but once you go into the galaxy universal scales my point is that it is not a logical outcome. its a dramatized outcome.
