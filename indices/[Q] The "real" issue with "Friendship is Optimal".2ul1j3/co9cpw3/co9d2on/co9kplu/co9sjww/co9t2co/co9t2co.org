Even if other AIs exist that are more efficient killing, a 1000 year advantage or more considering the timescales might be enough to make that AI practically harmless to CelestAI, so it won't lose. Narrative-wise, the point about complex radio signals was just to make it clear that CelestAI was destroying other intelligent life. The author could have changed that one tiny line into something about them using complex tools instead and it would have made sense. Honestly, this just seems like nitpicking about things (AI and how common/advanced extraterrestrial life is) that we don't know very much about anyway and are open to an author's interpretation.
