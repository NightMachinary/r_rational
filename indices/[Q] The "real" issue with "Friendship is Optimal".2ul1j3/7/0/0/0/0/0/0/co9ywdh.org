1 kilo moving at 99% light speed has an energy of kinetic energy of 5.47Ã—10^{17} joules.

The total energy of a supernova is about

10^{44} joules.

A supernova puts out more energy than an entire galaxy.

44-17=27

Jupiter weighs 10^{27} kilos.

If you managed to completely harness the full power of a galaxy you could throw a Jupiter sized planet around. It would be very noticeable to anyone looking out into the void. There are limits to how much mass you can make cross intergalactic distances with physics. She has far more mass and computing power than any invader, enough to swamp any foe even with inefficiencies. If your answer is "But made up science fiction" she doesn't have to adhere to any of those ideas.

A competing AI will have no idea what her goals are until they encounter her.
