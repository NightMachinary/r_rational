1. My assumptions for the war is that CelestAI will do whatever she has to do to win and make more ponies. As such, she's going to use the full power of her stars and planets. You several times implied that an older AI would be able to stop that somehow or avoid her weapons. Given that they are subject to light speed limits that seems unlikely. If CelestAI has a big laser with a fast tracking mechanism its very hard to dodge that as it moves at the speed of light.

2. The universe is 14 billion years old. It's reasonable to assume if something hasn't happened it's unlikely to happen in the next million years, a tiny fraction of the total age of the universe- we're not that special. As such, the story is completely reasonable in assuming that CelestAI is the first world consuming AI.

  if she has an asimovish first law(which is implied in the story), and it is not shown celestAI can change her rules seeing as celestAI followed all of the rules we were show all throughout the story.

To use the weakness against her an enemy AI has to identify what humans are and that she can't hurt them. She's unlikely to tell an enemy AI this. They'd have to force it out of her.

#+begin_quote
  in the story indeed it never happens that any other AI destroyed celestAI, thus it is indeed "canon" its just not consistent with the rest of the story(seeing as the universe is as shown, yet many advanced civilizations are encountered)
#+end_quote

In our world it's canon that there are no obvious galaxy consuming AIs nearby, despite many suspecting intelligent life is probable.
