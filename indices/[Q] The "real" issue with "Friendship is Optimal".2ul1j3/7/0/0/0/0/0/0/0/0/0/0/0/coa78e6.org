i tend to agree non (inherently) hostile AIs will be less effective, but if they existed before humanity and are in the same galaxy a scenario in which celestAI is capable of overpowering them seems even less likely the celestAI overpowering purely malicious AIs it encounters in the future..

throwing a star will only work if you hit them

assuming other -all- other civilizations nucked themselves back to the stone age would again imply that earth is somehow implausibly special, something which either requires a lot of effort on the authors side or ends up being a plot device.

i didnt make assumptions so much as observations and extrapolations from said observations.

1. we are told that other civilizations reached RF communications progress, on the timescales in discussion that effectively means at the very least sthe same technological level
2. assuming other civilizations wont develop AIs capable of colonizing a reasonable mass would require an explanation for why humanity did
3. the reasons i believe that is the case were mentioned multiple times
4. i similar to 2 i think assuming that all other AIs wont desire such conquest while celestAI did would require some very good reason to assume that is the case
5. the is basically 3 again which i already mentioned in the previous posts
