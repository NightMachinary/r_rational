  it also takes more effort to "destroy" a planet vs destroying a ship(how could laser destroy it at all?
#+end_quote

You can have a hundred planets worth of ships, if you're an AI with a mass advantage, each containing optimally built fusion or antimatter warheads or nuclear pumped lasers. Destroying tends to be easier than construction too due to entropy- if you want to fix a destroyed computer core you need to sort out all the atoms. If you want to destroy it you just need to hit it hard.

  what we see right now is only correct for these other galaxies for 10k-20k years ago for the closest galaxy, for the further ones the status that we currently see is for 800k years ago.

Yes, and while the existence of other intelligent species is weak evidence for there being galaxy consuming AIs, it's more likely that those civilizations rarely produce galaxy consuming AIs- you're unlikely to hit those galaxies exactly as they produce an AI.

  if the fleet will be moving at less then the speed of light it would first of all be telegraphing its arrival thus the opposing army will be able to concentrate its forces for you, or alternatively bombard you with lasers long before you reach it

Yes, so that makes it tricky to defeat an AI once they are entrenched in a galaxy. Though most galaxies likely lack an AI. Unless you control many galaxies it would be nigh impossible.
