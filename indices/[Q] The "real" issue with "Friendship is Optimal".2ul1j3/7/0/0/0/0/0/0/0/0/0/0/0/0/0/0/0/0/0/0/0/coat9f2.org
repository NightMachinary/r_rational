1. its true no such abilities were presented and i didnt suggest that they were needed. on the other hand you made assumptions regarding the specific ways in which such a war(or at least the weapons in said war) would happen. which i was trying to say we cant really do as there are too many "maybe"s when talking about such weapons to get into such specific discussion.
2. the story is based on the real world, plus AI, plus many advanced civilization in the 800k~ lightyears radios of us. we do not know that something is blocking other civilizations from releasing all-consuming AIs, we only know that 100-800k~ years ago no such AI was observed on their galaxies. it doesn't mean that there isn't currently some AI on its way towards us, in reality or in the story.

  Or well bound by their civilizations.

true

  If she's worried about her weakness being exploited she can take steps to avoid it. She could have scuttling charges placed on AI brains for example. Unless her enemy is substantially superior or captures her early she can fight back against any attacks. She is really smart- she's not going to make any of this easy.

what steps could celestAI take to avoid having her human related weaknesses abused? if she has an asimovish first law(which is implied in the story), and it is not shown celestAI can change her rules seeing as celestAI followed all of the rules we were show all throughout the story.

  Per canon universe facts, that's apparently false. You are repeatedly assuming that this story is set in a universe where things have happened which haven't happened in our universe, like galaxies going dark and infrared.

in the story indeed it never happens that any other AI destroyed celestAI, thus it is indeed "canon" its just not consistent with the rest of the story(seeing as the universe is as shown, yet many advanced civilizations are encountered)
