The galaxy has a mass of about 10^{42,} vs a Jupiter mass of about 10^{27.} That's 10 trillion times the mass, a huge advantage. Jupiter is a tiny force.

Some intelligent life in the galaxy has to be the first to make an AI that conquers a galaxy. Due to human bias, it'd be understandable if it's earth. Competing AIs would either be in other galaxies or have conquered and destroyed the earth.

Since life hasn't been destroyed in the last 13.2 billion years since the milky way formed AIs are presumably pretty rare. You're probably not going to get a new one in the near future.

A competing AI would have no way of knowing about her weakness from another galaxy.
