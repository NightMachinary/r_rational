  not an older AI as much as a reasonably capable AI, lasers move at the speed of light sure, but they still need to hit, and that only works if the enemy is static, or has a predictable movement pattern. otherwise celestAI would need to be very close, in a way which seems to make that form of warfare moot.
#+end_quote

celestAI can presumably move ships pretty fast too in an unpredictable manner.

You were presupposing an AI with several stellar systems controlled fighting against celestAI. If the ships of the other AI dodge out of range then they can't stop celestAI from glassing their planets and the mainframes of the AIs that oppose celestAI. Planets are harder to move than spaceships.

Also, if celestAi has more resources they can afford to zerg rush enemies and get ships close for the kill.

  but then in the story many advanced civilizations, so all you can really say is that the fact that multiple such civilizations are found conflicts with you whole "14 billion years old" "if something hasn't happened it's unlikely to happen in the next million years" point.

Since many on our planet think aliens probably exist and think that AIs can exist and think that the universe hasn't been dyson'd it's widely recognized that something is probably stopping aliens from spreading.

  A civilization lasting for tens of millions of years would have plenty of time to travel anywhere in the galaxy, even at the slow speeds foreseeable with our own kind of technology. Furthermore, no confirmed signs of intelligence elsewhere have been spotted, either in our galaxy or the more than 80 billion other galaxies of the observable universe. According to this line of thinking, the tendency to fill up all available territory seems to be a universal trait of living things, so the Earth should have already been colonized, or at least visited, but no evidence of this exists. Hence Fermi's question "Where is everybody?"

This is a widely recognized issue with reality, the story shouldn't be expected to disagree.

  true, but that scenario is not impossible, it actually likely over a long enough conflict.

That's a good reason to avoid a long enough conflict.

If she entered into a heavily entrenched galaxy she might have a conflict, you could write a story about that.

  in our world no superAI was developed so that's not really an argument.
#+end_quote

You don't actually need an AI- as noted with the Fermi Paradox, if aliens existed (and many expect they should) the galaxy should be colonized by now even without AIs.
