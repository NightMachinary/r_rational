first of all that "claim" is a few orders of magnitude less "specific" then "CelestAI would just rock her 100 shits with huge lasors and melt the face of the enemy AI". second i did not say that a single planet of AI could defeat a galaxy of AI, i said that assuming a single planet of AI could somehow find CelestAIs weakness it could very well defeat an entire galaxy of CelestAI.

it is of course not something i consider to be likely, nor is it in any way relevant(an AI which is in the space between galaxies? why would it not take over its galaxy, seeing as CelestAI would need to get to it first, which is enough time for it to take over the galaxy, unless CelestAI had a huge time advantage)

  Anyway, I thought we could use science to see if it was relevant. If you don't feel it's relevant because they're AIs and smart this conversation is entirely pointless

using science is fine, but only in the sense that we can talk about the theoretical best cases, if we start talking about the AIs waging wars with space ships powered by chemical rockets, and nuclear warheads what are we doing exactly?

science is relevant for seeing its impossible to travel faster then the speed of light, and that at the very least traveling at a given speed would cost X jouls of energy, once you start going into the specifics the we will have a multi-dimensional matrix of possible efficiencies and technologies interacting to result in just too many possible outcomes.

  your initial question was about why the AI didn't face competition- if we can't predict the nature of that competition then we can't predict what would happen.

we don't need to figure out what color the space ships would have to conclude some things. also we are not talking in a void, this is all in the context of the story where we are trying to evaluate if the ending is reasonable or not.

if we conclude that intergalactic conquest is impossible -period- then the ending would not make sense as it is explicitly stated that CelestAI was galaxy hopping eating up civilizations.

and if we assume an opponent AI would figure out CelestAIs weakness, and create a billion "human beings" with technology equal to CelestAI's(seeing as both are superAIs) then regardless of if the warfare would be waged with nuclear weapons, lasers, RKVs or antimatter missiles CelestAI would have an issue.
