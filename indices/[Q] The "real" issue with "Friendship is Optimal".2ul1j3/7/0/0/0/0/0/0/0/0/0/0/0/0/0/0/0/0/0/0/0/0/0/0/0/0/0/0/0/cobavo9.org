Larger objects, by nature of being larger and so having more inertia, are worse at dodging. Moving computronium could be outrun by a smaller ship just like a planet and destroyed.

it also takes more effort to "destroy" a planet vs destroying a ship(how could laser destroy it at all? it would melt it sure, but it would just reassamble, so you need to hope your laser is at least as efficient as the process that reassmbles the computronium, as otherwise you are just wasting your energy).

  If AIs have not dyson'd stars and dominated their galaxies (and thus got enough mass and energy to fight back) they will be unable to defend them just by nature of being an AI. She can fly ships at their computronium and destroy it. We know as a canon fact of the universe that an AI hasn't colonized earth, or visibly colonized nearby galaxies.

what we see right now is only correct for these other galaxies for 10k-20k years ago for the closest galaxy, for the further ones the status that we currently see is for 800k years ago.

reaching there would also take time, and if you were to send a large fleet at lightspeed it would take immense amounts of energy as well(even assuming the most efficient engines possible).

if the fleet will be moving at less then the speed of light it would first of all be telegraphing its arrival thus the opposing army will be able to concentrate its forces for you, or alternatively bombard you with lasers long before you reach it
