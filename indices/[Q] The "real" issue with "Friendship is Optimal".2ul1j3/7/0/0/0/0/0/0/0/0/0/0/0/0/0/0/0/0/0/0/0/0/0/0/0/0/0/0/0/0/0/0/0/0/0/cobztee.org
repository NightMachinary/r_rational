  That's what I would expect to happen if an AI tried to invade another AI galaxy. They would outnumber any invaders a lot. As such, AI conflicts would only be significant if one hadn't colonized the galaxy.
#+end_quote

well the specific example is only asssuming either no attack or speed of light attack, one AI could travel at 10% of the speed of light, or even 1%, sure it would take it 10-100 times more time to get to its target, but assuming after taking that energy into account it still had enemysize+1 it should win when you assume simple swarming.

and in any case that would just make the situation shown in the epilogue less likely barring the assumption that humanity was the first civilization by a few 10k-100k of years at the very least.

  Algorithms can't ignore entropy either. You have to walk outside to pick up blocks (in this case, the matter would be smeared out over several light years and moving away at a good fraction of the speed of light) you need to spend energy to verify the identity of each atom, you need to move it to a precise place.
#+end_quote

in the room example that is true, but we are talking about a large body(galaxy) controlled by an AI, it doesn't need to "gather" all of the blocks you moved away, because in not a small probability they would simply reach another cluster of the AI(gravity?) simply in another spot in the galaxy.

and if we are talking about inefficiencies they exist in the generation of your laser as well, so it becomes a kind of open question.

  [[http://heshydrogen.com/hydrogen-fuel-cost-vs-gasoline/]] Cost of hydrogen per gallon- 1 dollar. [[http://southwestwater.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/172/%7E/how-much-water-is-a-cubic-metre-and-how-much-does-it-cost%3F][http://southwestwater.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/172/~/how-much-water-is-a-cubic-metre-and-how-much-does-it-cost%3F]] Cost per gallon of water- 3 pence. So yes, it is cheaper. Most hydrogen is already reacted, it's expensive to generate it in the environment. You might say "But nanobots" and I say "But thermodynamics."
#+end_quote

the point of the water breaking vs joining was to illustrate that on the atomic scale breaking something is not always easier then making. what if water molecules were an present as-is in the "computer" it uses, your laser might break them sure. but it would be much harder to do so, vs the work the enemy AI will need to do to reassemble the water to use it for its computer again.

btw all of this assumes you could even generate a strong enough laser that the enemy AI will not be able to simply redistribute the energy from it all over its galaxy, maybe even using your laser to power its systems, seeing as you are basically shooting the one thing all of you are trying to acquire(energy\matter) in the first place.

#+begin_quote
  I doubt it. Space travel is expensive, the cost of collecting all the materials which you've blasted away is going to be extreme, nanobots can't stop that.
#+end_quote

no need to too actively collect them seeing as the galaxy is under its control and thus at worst you would have had simply forcibly moved some mass from one point in its control to another.

  AIs probably can't be humans, also CelestAI can invade planets to liberate them from AIs if they mass cloned humans.
#+end_quote

they don't need to be "humans" they need to be human enough to so the utility function, hardcoded by a human, in CelestAI will accept them as human.

and you assume CelestAI will be able to invade a planet if it knew that doing so would kill a few humans(as opposed to the humans in earth who were a few orders of magnitude less advanced and thus couldn't even hurt themselves to hurt CelestAI(it is stated that suicide bombers tried to destroy a few of CelestAIs centers, and nobody was injured, implying even they were not injured..) in our case we are talking about "humans" which either are or completely controlled by an AI with at least as advanced technology and abilities as CelestAI
