  sure, but what if the computronium is constantly moving?
#+end_quote

Larger objects, by nature of being larger and so having more inertia, are worse at dodging. Moving computronium could be outrun by a smaller ship just like a planet and destroyed.

  how do any of the reasons you quoted imply the celestAI should be able to colonize(without resistance, as no one implying colonization in its very essence is impossible for for celestAI)
#+end_quote

If AIs have not dyson'd stars and dominated their galaxies (and thus got enough mass and energy to fight back) they will be unable to defend them just by nature of being an AI. She can fly ships at their computronium and destroy it. We know as a canon fact of the universe that an AI hasn't colonized earth, or visibly colonized nearby galaxies.
