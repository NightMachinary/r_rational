1. Yes, and no ftl travel or ability for a superior AI to violate the rules of the universe is shown. As such, AIs are limited to physics material durabilities, limited to a fraction of the speed of light for mass travel.

2. The story is based on the real world, plus an AI. Something is presumably stopping other civilizations from releasing all consuming AIs, we know this as a canon fact of our universe. We have no particular reason to assume that we are privileged as to being the first form of life- just because the galaxies shown them a 100k years ago if they were likely to produce all consuming AIs they probably already would. It's rather weird to assume that all the AIs produced are going to be produced suddenly in the next million years after the first AI.

  if the other AIs still haven't dysoned stars that means they are extremely(on the timescale discussed) young

Or well bound by their civilizations.

  and there the fight would very probably be long enough for celestAIs weaknesses to be exploited

If she's worried about her weakness being exploited she can take steps to avoid it. She could have scuttling charges placed on AI brains for example. Unless her enemy is substantially superior or captures her early she can fight back against any attacks. She is really smart- she's not going to make any of this easy.

#+begin_quote
  moreover there would reasonably be other AIs which have -more- stars under their control unless we assume we have about 400k years advantage over any other civilization other then us in those 15 galaxies
#+end_quote

Per canon universe facts, that's apparently false. You are repeatedly assuming that this story is set in a universe where things have happened which haven't happened in our universe, like galaxies going dark and infrared.
