  if the question is about the actual conflict then based on simple swarming we could assume the 100 planets would win unless there's some kind of huge issue in their logic.

Thanks. That was the thing I was trying to see if you accepted.

That's what I would expect to happen if an AI tried to invade another AI galaxy. They would outnumber any invaders a lot. As such, AI conflicts would only be significant if one hadn't colonized the galaxy.

  longer maybe, but we are talking about energy. and the energy cost would depend on my algorithm's efficiency and the enviorment.

Algorithms can't ignore entropy either. You have to walk outside to pick up blocks (in this case, the matter would be smeared out over several light years and moving away at a good fraction of the speed of light) you need to spend energy to verify the identity of each atom, you need to move it to a precise place.

  does it take more energy to break water apart then to combine oxygen with hydrogen?

Cost of hydrogen per gallon- 1 dollar.

Cost per gallon of water- 3 pence.

So yes, it is cheaper. Most hydrogen is already reacted, it's expensive to generate it in the environment. You might say "But nanobots" and I say "But thermodynamics."

  we are talking about a future with nanobots, you need to assume the energy for putting the atoms of the nanobots you melted by lasoring them is significantly more then putting them back together, which on the nano scale, in space, could very much be like the example with the blocks.
#+end_quote

I doubt it. Space travel is expensive, the cost of collecting all the materials which you've blasted away is going to be extreme, nanobots can't stop that.

  on the other hand if the single planet worth of AI would be in the that the other AI would have to accept as "human". and said other AI will have inside it a directive which prevents it from harming human beings without their verbal or written consent it stands to reason that the single planet will win eventually.

AIs probably can't be humans, also CelestAI can invade planets to liberate them from AIs if they mass cloned humans.
