  i said a few times over this correspondence that you picking specific attack methods and discussing them is pointless, because niether of us are super intelligent AIs, and none of us really knows what are the specifics. so obviously all attacks, and defenses we talk about will not really be relevant.

You were making the specific claim that a single planet of AI could defeat a galaxy of AI.

Anyway, I thought we could use science to see if it was relevant. If you don't feel it's relevant because they're AIs and smart this conversation is entirely pointless because your initial question was about why the AI didn't face competition- if we can't predict the nature of that competition then we can't predict what would happen.
