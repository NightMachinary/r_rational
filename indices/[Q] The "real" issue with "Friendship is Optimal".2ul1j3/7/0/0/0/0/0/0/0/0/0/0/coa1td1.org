Non hostile AIs are less effective, they have far less computing power and mass.

Most problems go away if you can throw a star at them.

#+begin_quote
  it seems much easier to figure them out then to keep them secret, with the fact that celestAI is sending probes into other galaxies with copies of herself(and much less resources).
#+end_quote

A hostile AI could do this if it had control over a galaxy.

#+begin_quote
  and we are told other civilizations(one explicitly others implicitly) reached radio communications levels of technology, which when talking about the astronomical timescales practically means that they should have reached AIs about immediately following what we are told about them.. i.e. extremely convenient timing.

Or they nuked each other to submission.

You have a daisy chain of assumptions leading to other AIs beating celestia.

1. Other civilizations reach the same technological level.

2. They develop AIs capable of colonizing a reasonable mass.

3. Those AIs can defeat celestAI.

4. Those AIs desire extra galactic conquest.

5. celestAI is unable to divert production to war for the greater good.

If any of those unreasonable assumptions aren't true your idea doesn't work.
