  Is there actually enough available energy in one galaxy to move a galaxy's worth of mass? I doubt it.
#+end_quote

depends on how efficiently you can extract the energy from the matter you have, and how efficiently you can transfer said energy into kinetic form, in theory it should be possible yup.

#+begin_quote
  Plus there would be huge energy losses from surviving the trip.
#+end_quote

you would lose energy proportional to the speed you traveled in obviously yeah, but you would gain quite a bit of mass so it could be worth it, really depends on many factors

#+begin_quote
  You'd also have the risk of enemy local number advantages. All of those things would pull it down sharply from a 1:1 ship trading match.
#+end_quote

if you went to a galaxy which is quite far from other galaxies it could be planned so sending forces from any other galaxy fast enough to arrive there before you take control of it would cost more then the possible gain from doing such.

  Anyway, since you don't seem to be using much science in your answers I see little point in continuing- it's a fairly well known principle that space is mostly empty, if you're going to ignore that and entropy I can't do much to convince you, and you can't convince me with your lack of science.
#+end_quote

the point is you are assuming -way- too many things regarding what will or will not be possible at that point, which we have no way to know. specifically your laser suggestion seems to me like the equivalent of medieval people seeing a car and instead of understanding the implications thinking that warfare in the future would be done by adding a battering ram to the edge and running people over.

lasers just don't cut it when you are talking about a future which assumes nanobots,computronium, intergalactic-conquests and the rest of the stuff shown\implied in the story.

you seem to have picked an extremely pointless topic(in regards to the main issue mentioned) for this context, and then decided you don't want to talk about it, which is of course up to you.

i said a few times over this correspondence that you picking specific attack methods and discussing them is pointless, because niether of us are super intelligent AIs, and none of us really knows what are the specifics. so obviously all attacks, and defenses we talk about will not really be relevant.

at most we can talk about the battle in extremely high-level manner which is what i was talking about in the beginning, but you decided to steer away from.

btw specifically,

#+begin_quote
  well known principle that space is mostly empty
#+end_quote

how space is now is completely irrelevant, CelestAI is even mentioned grouping the milky way so tight, that any tighter than it is would have resulted in a black hole.

#+begin_quote
  ignore that and entropy
#+end_quote

when did i ignore entropy? i merely suggested your assumption that one process would result in more of it then another is not really based on anything other your own assumptions.
