1. there are too many unknowns for us in the real physics to really base anything on it, we can at most reject some ideas. in the end we have to rely on the physics which are actually shown in the story

2. what we know of those galaxies is only true in the real world, seeing as in the story many advanced civilizations exist, and more importantly(thus making the previous statement less conflicting) what we know about these other galaxies is only represents their state 100k years or so ago at the latest(some of the 15 galaxies are actually more like 800k lightyears away, so even more time)

if the other AIs still haven't dysoned stars that means they are extremely(on the timescale discussed) young, so really arent the point. the discussion is more about thee expected few AIs that did reach the point of dysoning a few stars or clusters at the very least, if not their entire galaxy. and there the fight would very probably be long enough for celestAIs weaknesses to be exploited thus nullifying any pure mass advantage it has. moreover there would reasonably be other AIs which have -more- stars under their control unless we assume we have about 400k years advantage over any other civilization other then us in those 15 galaxies
