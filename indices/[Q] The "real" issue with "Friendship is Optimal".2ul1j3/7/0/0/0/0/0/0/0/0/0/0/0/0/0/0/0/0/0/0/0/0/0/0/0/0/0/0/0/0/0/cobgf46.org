  You can have a hundred planets worth of ships, if you're an AI with a mass advantage, each containing optimally built fusion or antimatter warheads or nuclear pumped lasers
#+end_quote

sure so lets say you brought a hundred planets, or even stars, worth of matter to an opposing galaxy, first of all under the assumption you made it there at the speed of light as you dont want to be wiped from the sky before you even get close. two things happened, first of all you wasted -huge- amounts of energy, even assuming you have a way to directly convert matter to energy, which is not too likely but whatever. second the other galaxy had 10-20k years to advance itself. which would be enough for it to take its own galaxy(the closest galaxy to ours is pretty small) even assuming you started at the same time.

so you come to its galaxy with you 100 planets\stars worth of matter, and you reach the other galaxy where the other AI has a billion or so stars. so you shoot and use your antimatter to cause your enemy 100% demage equal to your mass. so you've completely annihilated 100 stars worth of matter from its galaxy. good for you. only it still has 1 billion stars- 100 stars left, and because sending all of that matter was expensive you just lost -at least- 200 stars(100 stars that you sent+ 100 stars you needed to convert into energy to get them to the speed of light).

  Destroying tends to be easier than construction too due to entropy- if you want to fix a destroyed computer core you need to sort out all the atoms.
#+end_quote

entropy effects your destruction as well

if you imagine a couple of blocks set together in the shape of a square and you kick them thus "destroying" the square, can you say that process would cost you less energy then it would take me to move them back into a square shape for sure?

the blocks are atoms. and actually atoms can have bonds between them, and destroying those bonds isn't always easier then reconnecting them.

you are applying conventional knowledge which is relevant to our time and technology and applying it to a very different situation..

  it's more likely that those civilizations rarely produce galaxy consuming AIs
#+end_quote

why? they apparently were close enough to us that they were using radio communications. and it is never implied that the AI in the story was due to some kind of an extremely unlikely random event.

#+begin_quote
  you're unlikely to hit those galaxies exactly as they produce an AI.
#+end_quote

hitting them right next to the moment they develop an AI is unlikely, though hitting them a while after?

in reality you could assume the probability for that as well would be pretty low, but because in story it is said many radio using civilizations existed its a reasonable stipulation that regardless of what is causing advanced civilizations to pop up so much(some other alien race planting the seeds at a similar time in many places?) when you give a +-10k-800k years for the intergalactic travel it is reasonable some of them would reach superAIs as well.

#+begin_quote
  Yes, so that makes it tricky to defeat an AI once they are entrenched in a galaxy
#+end_quote

conventionally yes, depending on the specific physics of course but in our current assumption it would be, unless the AI has some kind of a significant vulnerability built into its code it would be extremely difficult..

#+begin_quote
  Though most galaxies likely lack an AI
#+end_quote

a point i do not agree with given information present in the story
