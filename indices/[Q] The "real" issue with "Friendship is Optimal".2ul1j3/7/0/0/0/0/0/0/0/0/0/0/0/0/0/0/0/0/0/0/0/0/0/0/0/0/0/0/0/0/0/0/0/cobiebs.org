  You said that it was hard for a ship to destroy a planet- I then replied to say you could send a hundred planets worth of mass of spaceships to attack said planet if you outnumbered them
#+end_quote

i didnt say it specifically because i didnt really find it important for the outcome, you can add to the end of the part you quoted, and any following reference "worth of spaceships".

  do you think 1 planet worth of AI could resist 100 planets worth of ships
#+end_quote

would depend on if said 100 planets worth of ships already got to it or you are talking about starting with 100 planets worth of ships on your galaxy. if its on your galaxy then i would answer no. if the question is about the actual conflict then based on simple swarming we could assume the 100 planets would win unless there's some kind of huge issue in their logic.

  Imagine you have 900 blocks, each which have to be in a precise place. I kick them and some fly out of the window. I am very sure it will take longer for you to put them back together than for me to take them apart.
#+end_quote

longer maybe, but we are talking about energy. and the energy cost would depend on my algorithm's efficiency and the enviorment.

#+begin_quote
  yes it is, most synthesis things take huge amounts of time and precision, you can break down pretty much anything but putting it in a hot enough kiln. I am a chemist, I know these things. Purifying things is super expensive and takes ages.

does it take more energy to break water apart then to combine oxygen with hydrogen? we are talking about a future with nanobots, you need to assume the energy for putting the atoms of the nanobots you melted by lasoring them is significantly more then putting them back together, which on the nano scale, in space, could very much be like the example with the blocks.

  Entropy isn't going to stop existing because you get smarter.
#+end_quote

entropy doesn't need to stop working, it just needs to exist more in the process of generating a laser that hits a a kilo of nanobots and breaks them apart, then in the process of returning them to place..

  Your theory requires a godlike civilization mass colonizing the universe, my theory requires well known conventional assumptions like civilization die off. Yours has a major complexity penalty and thus is inferior. i didn't claim a golike civilization, i just gave an example to a possible explanation to what is shown in the story. i didn't claim those civilizations popped up, the story did.

  So, do you think one planet worth of AI invading a galaxy can defeat 100, or 1,000,000 planets worth of entrenched AI?
#+end_quote

as a single unplanned assault the answer is an obvious no. but we are not talking about that.

on the other hand if the single planet worth of AI would be in the that the other AI would have to accept as "human". and said other AI will have inside it a directive which prevents it from harming human beings without their verbal or written consent it stands to reason that the single planet will win eventually.
