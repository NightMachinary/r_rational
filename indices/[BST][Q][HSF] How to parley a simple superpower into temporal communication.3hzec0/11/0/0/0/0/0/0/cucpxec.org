Honestly, just "strings" would be much cooler. What happens when she affects a single thread in a garment? Instant clothes-shredder!

Hell, you might be best restricting it to "threads below a certain width". No twined cords, no string - she has to do everything thread-by thread. As a consolation, you could expand her control to let her govern a handful of threads at once. Even at just one, she could pretty much destroy any plant-fibre cord at will.
