only if you happen to assume some sort of objective reference frame? like, every particle in the object is always in line, /from their own individual points of view/. there is no sense by which you can say, "oh, well, these things are simultaneous /even though they appear to happen at different times to literally every possible observer/". you're imposing concepts from classical mechanics on a relativistic universe and expecting the resulting model to be consistent.
