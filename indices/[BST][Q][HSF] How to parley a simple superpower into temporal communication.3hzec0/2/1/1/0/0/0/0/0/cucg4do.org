I think you could probably stretch the amount of materials that count as plant-based, simply because it's not a very strict separator if you deliberately blur the lines.

On and don't let the MC anywhere near a friendly biokinetic (or anyone with some power over genetics, really), because that could easily end up in confusing the MCs power to accept most if not all carbon based materials as plant-based, including collagen and human hair and molecules that grant the human body and cells structure in general.

This could easily escalate further unless you use a deus ex machina tool like the Manton limit and/or shard intelligence like in worm.
