Here's how a physicist who hasn't forgotten their basic thermodynamics might react to something perfectly rigid.

Something perfectly rigid is something that has degrees of freedom (ways it can have energy) limited to the modes of macroscopic motion. That is, its energy can only be from moving (three [quadratic] degrees of freedom) or from rotating (three more degrees of freedom). It's just like a water molecule at room temperature. It's not going to be at absolute zero: temperature is defined in equilibrium (that means, when everything has been left alone and let to settle down) by the amount of energy per degree of freedom. Since this thing has six perfectly good degrees of freedom, it's going to have a well-defined temperature. As soon as you pick it up and wave it around, it's not in equilibrium anymore and so different notions of temperature will give different answers (some of which will be "undefined") but the same thing would happen for a water molecule. What's special is that this object will have an incredibly low thermal mass (how much heat it takes to warm up when cold, or how much heat it radiates before cooling down when hot) - the same thermal mass as one water molecule!

What's interesting about this object is that it's still the same color. Color, as you know, comes from absorbing part of white light. And absorbing light is a way that something can have energy - it means there's still some degrees of freedom here! They're just locked out at high energy (or magic has happened). Assuming that this rigid object is kept rigid by some finite potential (in accordance with it not changing color), it should be possible to determine the strength of this potential b thermodynamic measurements, spectroscopy, or mechanical measurement. If that's not possible, then /that/'s magic.
