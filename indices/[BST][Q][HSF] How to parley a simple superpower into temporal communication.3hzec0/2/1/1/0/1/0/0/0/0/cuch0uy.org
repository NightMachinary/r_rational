(Many of these measurements require smaller sample sizes - a half-centimeter square of cloth would be good for most.)

The most important would be spectroscopy - the practice of shining electromagnetic waves at something, and seeing what gets absorbed (or scattered, or whatever). If there's a big gap between the "rigid" state and the first excitation, there should be "missing" absorption compared to normal clothesline at low energies (NMR, microwave, infrared). There might also be "extra" absorption at energies big enough to unfreeze those modes. If there's nothing fishy in the spectrum, this is either magic, or it means the stiffening-magic is letting the molecules move almost normally, and only operating at a macroscopic scale.

This could be tested with thermodynamic measurements - the practice of heating something up and seeing how much energy that took. A perfectly rigid body is extremely easy to heat up, as we've sort of gone over - but if the molecules are still moving around on a microscopic scale, it would behave more like ordinary string.

Either way, it's probably worth sending samples off to some microscopy labs to try and move microscopic pieces of it around, either by jamming a microscopic tip into it (AFM, nanoindenting, STM [may require special sample]) or by bombarding it with ions or high energy electrons (FIB, SEM, TEM [may require special sample]). If it has a normal heat capacity, I'd expect it to be be possible to move molecules around, if it has an anomalously low heat capacity, it will be impossible.

If spectroscopy shows a gap, this would imply that there's some corresponding stiffness - if it's measurable, you can try and bend this thread and measure its deflection. Okay, now we definitely need a 10' clothesline, at least.

Oh, and if she can do this with conducting thread (cloth of gold?), and it still stays shiny, shininess means mobile electrons! Definitely want to test the electronic properties. Or magnetic thread (cloth of... magnetite?) and magnetic properties.
