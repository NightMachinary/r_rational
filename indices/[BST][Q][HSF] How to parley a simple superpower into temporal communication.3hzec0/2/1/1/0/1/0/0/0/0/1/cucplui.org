It's interesting to imagine how a body can be 'absolutely invulnerable' on microscopic scale.

Can charged particles still exchange photons? Do chemical bonds that make up the lattice still make sense? If the material does not become intangible, then it must still interact electrodynamically, right? If so, then there must be a boatload of internal degrees of freedom and all the thermodynamics that comes with them. What happens if you add an 'extra' electron to an absolutely invulnerable semiconductor? Can you tear an electron away from an invulnerable material? Can you tear away all the electrons? If the object retains the colour upon transformation, then it must still absorb photons, so where does the energy go when it does? If it goes to the particles making up the material, then what happens when you heat it up enough for the fusion/fission to start?

The power described, as per usual with these things, is an omnipotent black box that does arbitrary things based on how a human brain interprets reality on macro scale, regardless of how reality actually works. It's a safe bet that you can achieve FTL (and probably time travel) with it.
