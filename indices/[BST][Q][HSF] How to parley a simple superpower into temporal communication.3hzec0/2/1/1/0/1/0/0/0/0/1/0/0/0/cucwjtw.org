That's a good example of something that's simply defined, but it leaves a lot of problems for use in fiction. Leaving aside all the definitional questions (what happens at the boundaries, is the change instantaneous, etc), you have these two fundamental issues:

- What, /exactly/, does it do when he uses it?
- More importantly: how do you explain it to the reader?

[[http://brandonsanderson.com/sandersons-first-law/][Sanderson's First Law]] is "your ability to solve problems with magic is directly proportional to how well the reader understands the magic." This cuts both ways -- if I say that my character can "make strings be straight", the reader knows what that means and I can get on with the story. If I say my character "can alter the fine structure constant" then I have to have a discussion like this:

Bob: So, what can you do?

Al: I can alter the fine structure constant!

Bob: Uh...cool? I guess?

Al: It's a constant in physics that defines the strength of electromagnetic interactions between elementary particles.

Bob: Oh. Uh...okay. So, what can it actually /do/? Can you energy blast the bad guys, cut through the wall, become intangible, turn invisible, what?

I actually have a character in my character bank whose power is "within a defined volume, one physics equation is inverted." So, for example, =F = 1/ma=. He then blows on someone very gently and it creates a large force. Actually using him is problematic, as mentioned above -- unless the reader has a good background in physics, they won't understand how he's doing what he's doing and his powers will look like a series of massive hat-pulls. It's a power that's incredible useful for munchkining but that, paradoxically, I /can't/ munchkin because the audience wouldn't get it. It's frustrating, but I keep him around anyway; he was a Champions character of mine in college, and I love the idea.
