I see your point. Still, the fact that most readers would not understand the implications of such a power can be used to make the story more engaging. The reader can find out about the power at the same pace as protagonist does. Imagine the protagonist running experiments trying to determine what the hell the power actually does, well that's some educational rationalist fiction just waiting to happen.

As for what the power will do, one can always crowdsource it on the internet, if one's physics-fu is weak. My example is actually pretty interesting as far as I can see:

- Significantly reducing fine-structure constant would pretty much make the matter disintegrate into plasma of electrons and bare atomic nuclei. The nuclei should then begin fusing.

- Significantly increasing it would make it impossible for nuclei to remain stable and they would split into lighter ones. This would probably result in everything exploding and eventually cooling down into a cloud of hydrogen.

- The most interesting one: slightly tweaking it. This would shift the energy levels in atoms and subtly affect chemistry without everything exploding immediately.

You should probably ask an actually qualified person like su3su2u1 if you ever decide to try doing this, since I'm just an engineer and not that good of a physicist. Anyway, I think there is a good rational story to be had with such superpowers. Sure, it's a bit more involved than controlling bugs, but that can be a good thing.
