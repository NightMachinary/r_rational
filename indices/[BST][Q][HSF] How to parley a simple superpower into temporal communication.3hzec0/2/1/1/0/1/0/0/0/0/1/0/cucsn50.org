Yep. Unless you're a top-drawer physicist, it's very difficult to write superpowers that work in any other way, and very few top-drawer physicists are good fiction authors. For that matter, I'm not certain that it's /possible/ to write mathematically-defined superpowers, since once you start breaking a single piece of physics everything else falls apart. I sure wish I could write -- or at least read -- that story though. It would be fascinating.
