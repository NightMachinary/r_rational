For an example of a mathematically defined superpower consider this:

A power that changes a fine-structure constant in a volume between two cross-sections (the coordinates of the cut determined by the user) of light-cone from the reference point somewhere around the user's head. It's still a tad underspecified, but can be improved until there is almost no ambiguity (except the actual interaction that changes the constant, naturally).

The important thing here is that the power does not mess with the laws, but tweaks the parameters, so one can examine the consequences within the existing framework, instead of inventing physics anew.
