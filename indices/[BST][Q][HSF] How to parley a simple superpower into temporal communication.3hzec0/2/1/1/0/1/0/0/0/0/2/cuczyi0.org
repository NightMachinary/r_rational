Okay, that's very cool and I'm going to need to spend time researching and thinking before I can meaningfully respond. Thank you very much for this; I appreciate you taking the time.

  Oh, and if she can do this with conducting thread (cloth of gold?), and it still stays shiny, shininess means mobile electrons! Definitely want to test the electronic properties. Or magnetic thread (cloth of... magnetite?) and magnetic properties.

She definitely can't do that -- I deliberately limited it to not include things with 'interesting properties' like that. Originally I said "anything organic", then I later narrowed it to "anything plant-based" in an effort to nerf it. I think I haven't nerfed it enough, though.
