That's actually a point that I address. Mostly by having one of the characters go "argh, this makes no sense! If it's perfectly rigid it should be at absolute zero!"

Basically, once you're talking about physics-breaking superpowers, you just have to resort to "it's magic!" after a certain point. My intent is that things break physics within their defined effect but need to obey physics outside of that.
