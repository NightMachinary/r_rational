If I were Elly, the first thing I'd do would be to either learn how to sew or hire a tailor and create versions of just about any object I might need that unfold into the object when straightened. She could even have something like an inflatable gun - the plush barrel, and a separate cord wound tightly around a core, with a bullet as well. Inflate the gun, aim, inflate the cord, and the only place the sudden line can go is out, propelling the bullet ahead of it. It's basically an obscenely overpowered spring gun, and anything that can fit in the barrel can be used.

Actually, she could probably impale just about anything by shooting a thread at it. Because rigid objects can't cut her, or indeed hurt her at all, she could perfectly easily climb up a micron-thick thread hand over hand.

Also, does the force reversal thing work reciprocally? Because if so, she can treat a rigid cloth table as a trampoline with perfect efficiency, bouncing upwards.
