  any straightened object that hits her with a force above a certain threshold will bounce off. Specifically, the direction component of its velocity will be instantly flipped 180 degrees

Would this not provide her with a sort invincibility? All she has to do is wear a full coverage, skintight outfit and extend her power over it. If she gets shot, or hit in any significant way her suit would immediately 'hit her" and bounce back. I don't know if it would sort of vibrate as it moves back and forth from the point of impact, "hitting" the user and bouncing back repeatedly.
