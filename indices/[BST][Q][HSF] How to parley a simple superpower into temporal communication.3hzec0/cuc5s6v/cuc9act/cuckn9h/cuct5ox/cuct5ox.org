Very true.

Although, I'm realizing something...she's only immune to forces imparted by a straightened object, not to secondary interactions. If one of her strings hits her in the face it's no big deal -- it just bounces off. On the other hand, if it hits her /sleeve/...well, it's the cloth of her sleeve that is imparting the force to her, not the string itself. She'd still end up injured in that case.

She could make shoes out of cloth, straighten them, and get bouncepads that way. The protection only activates when she takes enough force to cause injury, so she'd be able to walk normally, but if she jumped off a three story building she'd hit the ground and bounce safely as long as the soles of her shoes were what made contact.

That's assuming that I leave her the ability to affect cloth, though. The more I read this thread, the more I think that might be a bad idea. Still, this is a very cool idea -- if I do end up using it, what name would you like to appear on the acknowledgements page?
