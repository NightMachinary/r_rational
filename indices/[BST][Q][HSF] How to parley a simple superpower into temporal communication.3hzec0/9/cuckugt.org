I can see how you'd get FTL out of it, but I'm not sure about time travel. While the two tend to be casually linked in popular culture, being able to travel FTL doesn't necessarily mean you'd be able to send a message from A to B back to A and have it arrive before it was sent.

I'd also want to see how the 'perfectly straight' designation applied to deformed space, because straightness depends on what framework you're measuring it by.

For example, one current thought about the universe is that it's spherical (with a twist) in four spacial dimensions, meaning that there is a finite volume but no edge (similar to how the Earth has a finite surface area but you can't fall off the edge of the world). Would a straightened object of sufficient length start to disappear from the universe the way it would appear to lift away from the Earth's surface (which is curved)? Or would it conform to the spacetime curve of the universe, appearing absolutely straight at any non-interplanetary lengths but being able to be bent by supermassive objects in the same way as light (ie the thread would always remain parallel to a laser beam, even if the beam got bent around a star or black hole - both would remain /optically/ straight and straight according to local spacetime)?

I'd recommend using "straight according to spacetime", as it allows objects to appear perfectly straight at all normal day-to-day lengths while breaking far fewer physical laws.

(Note that this would probably mean it was only perfectly rigid within a lightspeed cone, too - so no FTL messaging, although lightspeed messaging is pretty good for daily superpower use.)
