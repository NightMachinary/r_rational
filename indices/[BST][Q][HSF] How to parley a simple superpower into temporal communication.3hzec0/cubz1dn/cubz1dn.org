So, if she has a giant coil of thread a few miles long and uses her power on it, does it all go straight or does only the section in her radius after it's done spronging outwards go straight? If it's a thin enough thread, and she can control the orientation, boom, instant space elevator. This is FTL communication, even significant if the thread is on a planetary scale. Conventional stuff might have a problem, but if there are the equivalent of Tinkers in the setting that can create coherent nanothreads, then she could send a message to Mars in a second subjectively.

On the other hand, why aren't the threads subject to time dilation and length contraction?
