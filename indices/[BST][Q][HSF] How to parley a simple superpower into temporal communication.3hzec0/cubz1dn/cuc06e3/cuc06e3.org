  So, if she has a giant coil of thread a few miles long and uses her power on it, does it all go straight or does only the section in her radius after it's done spronging outwards go straight?

Erm. Have to admit, I hadn't thought of that possibility -- I've been working with ordinary-sized objects that she was holding or standing next to. Let me get back to you on that. (If you have thoughts about the implications either way, I'd be grateful to hear them.)

That...is a good question. They would be. Which I think puts paid to the whole "signal back in time" thing.

Good. Honestly, I didn't want to have to deal with temporal messaging, I just felt that it needed to be addressed if it were possible; it's a rationalist story, and I would expect the people in it to munchkin the hell out of their powers. If they have a chance to mess with time, they will.
