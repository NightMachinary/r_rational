  This could easily escalate further unless you use a deus ex machina tool like the Manton limit and/or shard intelligence like in worm.

I actually do have something similar to the Manton effect, but it only applies to supers. A telekinetic can't do anything inside a super's body, but could rip a Normal's heart out. This isn't author fiat...there's an actual in-universe reason for it that could theoretically be munchkined.
