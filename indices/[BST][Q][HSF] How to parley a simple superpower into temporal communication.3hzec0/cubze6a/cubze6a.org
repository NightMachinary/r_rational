if you're looking for a method for causality-breaking that relies on superluminal communication, you're looking for the [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachyonic_antitelephone][tachyonic antitelephone]]. the difficulty is in the processing of messages within the small timeframe granted by the 100 foot (why are you measuring things in feet) diameter of the power, but modern processors have clock rates fast enough to perform many operations in that gap (and of course, so long as you're gaining some amount of time, you can iterate to go back to the initialization of the device). you would probably need to make many such devices run in parallel to avoid the extra time taken by serial processing.

that said... the premise doesn't imply the conclusion at all? """perfectly rigid""" doesn't make things somehow move faster than light.
