Thread is a simple fibrous material, but she has the ability to give it the properties of stiffness, straightness, thinness, cohesiveness... etc, through her will.

She's turned the simple material into something with unique properties, that's what I am trying to say.

Does a strand of thread turn from a collection of woven fibers into one contiguous long thread if she squeezes it for long enough? Do these effects persist after she's done concentrating?

Could she take a coiled rope with ash/coal in its core and make carbon buckytubes by squeezing it? This is similar to the knot idea you referred to before, but she's applying a great deal more pressure across the thread's entire length.
