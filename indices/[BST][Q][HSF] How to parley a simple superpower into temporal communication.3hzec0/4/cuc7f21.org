  I'm trying to picture a machine that could be built under these constraints that would send a signal back a useful amount of time. Any thoughts?

It depends on what reference frame "can't be deformed" is declared in. If it's in some privileged reference frame, e.g. Elly's, no information can travel backwards in Elly's time.

If it's the wire's own reference frame, I think I have one:

Take two sets of electrically charged, fortified pieces of fiber string. Send them in opposite directions through a synchrotron at relativistic velocities, keeping the distance between fibers less than the length of the fibers.

If you push one fiber at the front, it'll move instantaneously according to its own reference frame at the back, which is slightly in the laboratory frame's past. Use a ridiculously fast mechanism to push the front side of a fiber moving in the opposite direction iff the backside of an earlier fiber is pushed. This pushes the back of the fiber, further in the laboratory frame's past. Use the same mechanism on that end to push the previous fiber, and you can send back messages arbitrarily far with as much data as the resolution of the mechanism.

So setting it to Elly's frame is probably best. And not that atrocious, since the effect does have a distance limit.

Further thoughts:

A line can be declared straight if it follows the trajectory of a photon.

How are knots or braids resolved?

When is a bundle of fibers declared a single, larger rope?

how strong are the forces applied in straightening? Can it cut through water? Syrup? Custard? Fat? Muscle? Bone? Wood? Steel? ...
