Neutrinos are not massless, so their travel describes time-like worldlines, instead of light-like of the photons. This introduces a variable into our definition of straight line (the energy of the neutrino), which is not that elegant.

Properly done, we'd want to abstract away from particles and define a 'straight line' in terms of geometry. To describe the chosen definition we invent a massless non-interacting particle, whose hypothetical worldline represents our 'straight line'. It just so happens that there is a particle almost like that in standard model, so we use it as a shorthand. For our purposes, actual particles don't matter, having an easy way to visualise a 'straight line' does.
