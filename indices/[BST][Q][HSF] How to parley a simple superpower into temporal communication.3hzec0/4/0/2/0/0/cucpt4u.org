I meant those as examples, but my point is, on the Quite Nearly Conceptual Effect Scale, where does "this thread is now rigid" fall? Would the "I can destroy anything" guy trump it? The "I can mutate the genetics of any plant fibre I touch" lady? The "I can create localized singularities" person?

In Worm, we saw a variety of "absolute" effects - Contessa's "I win", Clockblocker, Foil, that relative position-fixer, etc. But when their semi-conceptual domains overlap, you have to have a hierarchy in place to figure out what happens.

Is Elly the top dog in that respect, or are there characters that have overlapping domains which could trump her?
