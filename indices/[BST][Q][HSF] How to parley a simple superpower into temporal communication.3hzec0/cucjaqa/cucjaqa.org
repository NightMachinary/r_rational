I would suggest you change the power's definition of perfectly rigid to eliminate FTL effects. When you push one end of a straightened rope rod, the other end moves a speed-of-light delay later. With relativistic effects, it's not your rope that bends, it's space. Your rope is still straight within that space. So there are ways around your character's power. Vista can play with your toys.
