I'm going to flex my bio background and inquire about the definitiona and composition of "threads" as polymerized chains of biomolecules.

Is she restricted to lignin and cellulose products? [[http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/pdf1997/han97a.pdf]]

Can she straighten DNA in plant chromosomes?

If not DNA, what about connective tissue, or proteins?

The reason I ask is because testing the boundaries and definitions of "threads" would be among the first experiments I would do, if I had her power (rather than test the physics to see if a "light-year long thread could defy relativity")

Implications for plant derived bio molecules means that more complex polymers like industrial plastics are out. However, if it's a chain of carbohydrates, then she should be able to "straighten" a potato, even though starches have a branching structure, she could "squeeze it" to break the chains and voila! The invulnerable small linear segments might shatter like a bomb from the release of energy.

The fact that the cellulose threads are longer than a few nanometers means that they are still woven together to some degree by the squeezing effect. I don't know how that's helpful, unless she actually bonds them all together into one long contiguous string. In that case, she's actually catalyzing the polymerizing reaction and she can use it to "unspool" a very long string (but not a light-year long) given enough raw material... basically converting a shirt into the equivalent length of thread as thin as her powers allow her to make it -- and when she concentrates, she makes it straight and invulnerable, perhaps getting dangerously close to nano-fiber cutting power. It's a good thing she's immune to her own power.
