#+begin_quote
  What happens to a knotted thread when the power is released?
#+end_quote

It goes limp, and the knot is still as tight as it was.

#+begin_quote
  Are the fibres crushed?
#+end_quote

No, the super-reinforcement happens fast enough that the thread isn't damaged before pulling tight.

#+begin_quote
  What happens when a thread is tied in a loop, such as a bowline or an alpine butterfly? Is the loop pulled tight or is the loop expanded until the rope unknots?
#+end_quote

Take a knot like that and yank the two ends in opposite directions -- that's what happens. I'd need to check it with real knots, but I think what you would get is that the knot moves such that the loop shrinks some, but then the knot clamps down before the loop is entirely gone.
