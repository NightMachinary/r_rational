Clockblocker could definitely freeze it, since (in my headcanon) he's affecting the time around an object instead of the object itself.

My current plan is that Alexandria couldn't bend it -- she's "just" superstrong, there's nothing special about her muscles being stronger.

The Siberian...I'm not sure I understand the Siberian's powers enough to be sure. S/he is invulnerable and can spread that invulnerability to others, but I'm not clear on the strength aspect. Anyone understand it better than I do?
