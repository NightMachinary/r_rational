I thought about this issue when reading Vinge's /Bobble/ series. If time stops in the bobble, the bobble is perfectly rigid. A bobble, or a chain of bobbles, could be used to send a message faster than light.

Or, if they're not perfectly rigid, then you can create an upper bound to how slow time passes inside the bobble.

In the process of trying to figure that out, I thought about time travel. The problem, I thought, is that to get time travel out of FTL signalling you need to be able to send the signals from an object traveling at a significant velocity with respect to the receiver. This practically rules out signalling through rigid bodies.
