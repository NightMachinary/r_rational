No, thank /you/. This is exactly the sort of edge case I need to be thinking about. I've been focusing on creating story such that my powers are underspecified.

I've finally decided that she can't affect anything but threads. It resolves a lot of these issues. Specifically, it pretty much resolves the inflated vs inflated question: the second thread would glance off of the first. If someone tried to set up some very special apparatus such that the two threads would still meet head-on, then the second thread would expand backwards, breaking through the apparatus. And, if some situation comes up where it really is impossible to avoid, then the second thread simply won't straighten at all and Elly will have a massive pain from her power backfiring.
