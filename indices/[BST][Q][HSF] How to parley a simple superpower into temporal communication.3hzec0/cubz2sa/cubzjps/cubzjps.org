Take a rod 50' long and mount it on a pivot. Alice stands at one end, Bob at the other. Alice pushes down on her end; Bob sees his end go up. Think of this as a 1-bit signal -- "rod end up" is 1, "rod end down" is 0.

In the real world, the rod is not perfectly rigid -- the force Alice applies causes the rod to flex slightly and then the elasticity of the rod brings it back into form. Because of this flexion, the far end of the rod moves up slightly after the near end moves down; the "signal" travels down the rod at sub-light speed.

Do the same with a 50' rod that is perfectly rigid: the far end moves up at exactly the same time that the near end moves down. That means that Bob sees his end move up at exactly the instant that Alice pushes down.\\
It takes light 50 ns to travel from one end of the rod to the other, which means that the signal has propagated down the rod at FTL speed.

  Err, are you?

Yes. I'm starting with "these things exist" and moving on to "how would society look as a result?" Wildbow started with "I want society to look like X" and then figured out how to justify it.
