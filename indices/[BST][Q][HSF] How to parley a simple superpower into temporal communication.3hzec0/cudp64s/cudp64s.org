What happens with these powers if you have a small sock and a big sock, and stuffed the big sock into the small sock, then inflated the outer small sock followed by the larger inner sock? Better yet, make them spheres without holes. What happens when the larger, unstoppable inner fabric inflates into the smaller, indestructible container?

What happens to any non-fabric material caught in between?

Let's reverse it. Inflate a small sphere of cloth, then stretch a very slightly smaller sphere of cloth over it, then "inflate" the outer cloth. The outer cloth has to crush the inner cloth to reach "inflated" state, but the inner cloth can't be crushed.

How does stretched fabric act in general when "inflated"?

Suppose someone constructs a shirt that happens to have a very large pocket, larger than the shirt itself, such that the material of the pocket completely stuffs the shirt. Now suppose that the inflate power is used. How does it react?

Essentially, when it comes down to inflat/ing/ fabric vs inflat/ed/ fabric, what happens?

Sorry this has nothing to do with what you asked.
