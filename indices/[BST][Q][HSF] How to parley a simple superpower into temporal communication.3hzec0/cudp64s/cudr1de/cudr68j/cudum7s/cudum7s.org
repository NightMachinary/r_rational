Yeah, that could work. It complicates things, though. This power started off as "she straightens thread, string, etc". Then I asked myself "what happens when you've got a piece of cloth made up of woven threads?" I decided "well, it straightens too"...which is an exception to the rule, since weaving implies that the threads are bent. Then I had to deal with the case of closed-form cloth, and I decided that it would inflate, which is yet /another/ exception. Worse, all those exceptions started yielding more and more abuses of the power, making her more and more god-tier straight out the gate, with no need for munchkining.

I think it's better if I just drop it back down to "straightens threads." And /just/ threads, not even rope -- basically, there's a maximum width she can affect. There's still a lot of abuses of this power, but they require some intelligence to apply.
