  Given a perfectly rigid object, you can send an FTL signal by moving the object -- when the person at point A moves the rod, the person at point B would see it move before the light arrived from point A.

I must be missing something - how do you go from immutability to person B seeing movement before the light arrives? Or are you saying that she can also move those objects (not really mentioned in the list of powers) instantaneously? Or by 'move' do you mean 'straighten', and she can do that ftl ('finite but small' is not too clear here)?

Err, are you?
