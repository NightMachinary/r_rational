When you push something, a wave of force moves along it at the speed of sound in that object, with respect to the reference frame of a point farthest from the push on the object, a speed necessarily less than the speed of light. If you could make an object perfectly rigid, the push would be felt immediately on the other side, effectively making the speed of sound infinite, and getting a message across the distance faster than the speed of light. Things can be said to be happening at the same time in a reference frame if they are seen to be happening at the same time--the light from one event hits you at the same time you are doing something. So, if someone can get a message across to you faster than light from the event could hit you, you're effectively getting the message before the message was sent!
