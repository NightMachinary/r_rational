Threads have an infinite speed of sound? Alright. I'll go with the standard ladder "paradox", which I prefer to conceptualize as a train going through a train-length tunnel with doors on both ends. When the train is in the tunnel, Elly, standing in the middle with threads going both ways, closes and reopens both doors at the same time. The train is going so fast that it is length contracted, so it fits in the tunnel and everything is fine.

From the train's perspective, the tunnel is contracted, and the train /doesn't/ fit. If the doors closed at the same time in this reference frame, the train will get damaged, and two reference frames can't disagree on whether that's happened! So, the train sees the front door close and reopen when it gets to it, then it passes through the tunnel, then the back door closes and reopens later. The conductor and Elly disagree on whether the doors were simultaneous, but they agree on all other observations.

Clever Elly ties a thread to the train. Using a hook or something, the train uses this thread to close the back door as soon as it sees the front door close in front of it. Since the train sees the tunnel as shorter than itself, this damages the caboose.

From Elly's perspective, the train (which does fit in the tunnel) is coming, then before it is completely inside, the back door damages it, pulling on her thread to the back door. She was going to wait for the train to be completely inside, so she receives this pull before she sends the pull to close the front door that the train is responding to.

How far back she can send a signal is limited only to how far she can munchkin her threads to go (maximum of 20 lightminutes if she doesn't affect a single thread beyond her range, arbitrarily far if she does) and how fast she can get them moving.
