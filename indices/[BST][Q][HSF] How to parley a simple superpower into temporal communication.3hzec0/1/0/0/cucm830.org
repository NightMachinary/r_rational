Even very slight causality violations can be daisy chained. Though quick back-of-the-envelope calculations say you're safe... A bullet going at 1200 m/s over 30 meters can send a signal back 4*10^{-13} seconds. Even if you made a big square of 8100 guns, that's still just a few nanoseconds. Elly would have to munchkin up another ten orders of magnitude to make it really useful. So she's at least not going to break Time in a weekend.

The 20 lightminute figure probably comes from misreading the rules. If she squeezes an object so she doesn't have to concentrate on it, and it leaves her range, does the effect still hold? If so, she can throw out the ends of a thread to get up to that far. But on rereading, I think that's not what you intended.
