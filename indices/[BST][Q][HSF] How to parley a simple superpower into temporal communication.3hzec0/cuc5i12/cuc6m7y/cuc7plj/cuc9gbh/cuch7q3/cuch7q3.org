Yeah... Just straight off the bat, it allows for creation of invulnerable shields, immediate immobilization of unprepared enemies, inviolable weapons....

With preparation, it becomes even more overpowered. Inflatable anythings, cut-anything microblades, indestructible fabric chains, inflatable super bouncy tables...

A one-piece glider she wears all the time that expands with a pulse of power...

Space elevators, part-fabric weaponry that only works when inflated, preventing recovery by enemies, literally indestructible bullet jacketing...
