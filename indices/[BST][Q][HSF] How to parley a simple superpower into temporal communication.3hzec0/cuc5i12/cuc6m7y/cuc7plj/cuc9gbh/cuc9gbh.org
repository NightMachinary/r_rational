The thing with knots is that there's only a few options -- she can't straighten something that has a knot, the thing melts through itself in order to remove the knot, the thing unties itself before straightening, or it pulls supertight.

After wrangling with it for a while I finally went with the last option. I'm not 100% thrilled with it -- it's an exception to the "it becomes straight" rule, but it's more straightforward than the other options and caused fewer narrative issues.

The original idea with this power was that it was supposed to be something minor that would need cleverness in order to be effective. The more I dig into it, however, the more ridiculously powerful it becomes.
