  You've even managed to explain why all top trainers aren't psychic: I'm guessing the advantage they gain from telepathy and mental cohabitation is tempered by the fact that they also have to experience the pain of their pokemon as well? Even if I'm wrong, now I really can't wait to meet Sabrina!

Yep: I like powers that are double edged swords, and knew that I would have to make psychic trainers have a drawback to show why they can't dominate others as easily as they otherwise should.

  Also a quick question; in your story, how does the strength of psychic powers work?

To put it basically, raw power comes from genetics, finesse and control comes from practice/individual talents/personal techniques. But the "raw power" difference between human psychics is a very narrow range compared to that of psychic pokemon (or even the strongest psychic humans and the weakest psychic pokemon).

Thanks for reading!
