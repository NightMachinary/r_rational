As always I am incredibly excited by the continued development of the psychic part of this story. Red not only developing his own powers (which, awesomely, seem to be unique without being overpowered) but also making a commitment to studying psychic phenomenon in general is literally a dream comes true for me when it comes to this fic.

You've even managed to explain why all top trainers aren't psychic: I'm guessing the advantage they gain from telepathy and mental cohabitation is tempered by the fact that they also have to experience the pain of their pokemon as well? Even if I'm wrong, now I really can't wait to meet Sabrina!

Also a quick question; in your story, how does the strength of psychic powers work? Is Sabrina very powerful (for a human) because her powers are just like that, or is it like how some people are born with bodies especially good at building muscle mass, but she still had to put in a lot of work to become the strongest in the world?

Or, more clearly, do psychic powers work like strength in real life, where some people have more potential but everybody can get pretty damn strong and the difference between the best and a very dedicated but limited person isn't too big; or is it like height, where if you're born a dwarf, that's that and there's nothing you can do to even come close to someone born to be normal or above average?

Thanks for the awesome chapter!
