It always bugged me that you could teleport out of anywhere you want but you could only go to one specific place with them in the games. I rather liked your solution to that; obviously Abras can go wherever the hell they want, it's getting them to go wherever /you/ want that's the hard part.

I also really liked the battle between Red and Blue; there was a lot of good character interactions in what should have just been a fixed battle, and I liked the nods to their fights in the game; Blue's got a fixed list of pokemon, and it's up to Red to work around that.
