The conversation Blue had reminded me of a running theme in the boxing shounen Hajime no Ippo: the concept of "heavy fists." In the context of HnI, it means that boxers who rise to the top carry with them the dreams of all the people they've broken along the way, people who retired for whatever reason after losing to them, whether that be from injury, demoralization, or because their record just wasn't good enough anymore. It is part of the /telos/ of the boxer (though obviously they don't use that word) to seek more and more greatness, because as they become great, the people who have fallen to them are vicariously fulfilled in their accomplishments.

"In order to move higher and shine brighter, you use other men's dreams as stepping stones. For the sake of those stepped on, we must not be a mere pebble, but the greatest mountain they've ever seen..."

This isn't quite the same thing, because Blue is merely demoralizing the people around him with his speed of achievement, as opposed to blocking people entirely from their dreams by crushing them himself, but it seems to be gesturing at the same sort of conceptual space.
