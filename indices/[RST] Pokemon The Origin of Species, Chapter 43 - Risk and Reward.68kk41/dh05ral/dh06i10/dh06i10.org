The way I understood it to work is that you can train an Abra two different commands:

"Register Teleport": An Abra who knows this command, when given the this command, will remember this specific location as a teleport destination. They can only have one such location remembered at any given time.

"Teleport": An Abra who has registered a location will teleport themselves (and if they're in physical contact, their trainer) to the registered location.

What Red was asking to be taught by Ayane was how to psychically connect with his Abra, so that when he gives it the Teleport command, Red can pick its destination, out of any location /Red/ can visualize well enough.
