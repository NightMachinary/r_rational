Pretty much, yeah. I thought about having the flying pokemon have to follow the Fly restrictions (basically you have to train your flying pokemon to take you to a specific spot rather than being able to free-roam) but that's silly and the Soaring mechanic from ORAS demonstrated what flying on pokemon should be like anyway.
