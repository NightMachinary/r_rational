Yeah, that solution is a nice middle ground: the main issue is that they don't want you to ever get stuck in a place you used an HM to get to (like if you surf to an island, catch a pokemon there, and replace only one in your party that can use Surf) but if they added some fancy coding or just were careful with level design it wouldn't be an issue.
