Well, based on Mister Daystar's definitions of humans with Typings, I'm guessing that there is a firm division for this.

One set would be the typings based on physical aptitude and or physiology, such as Fire, Electric, Water, and all the typings based upon the physiology of the Pokemon alone. These are typings can be deemed to be impossible typings for humanity limited genetics.

Second would be the typings reliant on the mental capacities and qualities of the of the subject, such as a Psychic's increased brainpower or a Dark's innate shielding. These are traits achievable by the genetic makeup of humanity itself. I'm quite excited to see how Sir Daystar can handle Fighting, Ghost and Fairy type Trainers in the future!

Those are my two-cents! Thanks!
