That's true, it can definitely be interpreted as a game conceit. I don't think a pokemon can /ever/ lose a move naturally through evolution, which seems odd considering how much some of them change. But yeah, the idea that metapod can move a bit seems more reasonable to me than the idea that they can't. They're not quite cocoons from our world: just modeled off them.

Others like kakuna are probably not as mobile, but they can still shoot out poison stingers and string and whatnot.
