Just spit balling and this would only work for the Caterpie line, but since Butterfree haveâ€‹ some psychic ability, perhaps Metapod have a very mild version of this? Just enough for a small self levitation to putter around? And particularly mobile Metapod tend to have strong psychic abilities as Butterfree, though perhaps they tend to be weaker physically since energy spent moving around is energy not spent strengthening their bodies? Maybe it's stupid, but it's another way to square the circle if nothing else
