Hey everyone, and welcome to, once again, the new Longest Chapter Yet! I was worried that this would finally be my first chapter to miss its deadline, but thankfully I was able to finish it in time. I'll be catching a flight tomorrow, so I won't be home until the afternoon. Once I am (and possibly after a nap), I'll update my site. Feel free to send all feedback and typos as usual, and I'll give it another pass for editing when I can. Hope you enjoy it, and thanks for reading!
