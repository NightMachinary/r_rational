You know, I haven't quite figured out what the maximum would be in meters or feet or anything. 3 blocks for a powerful psychic seems too far, but not by much. But the main problem is that when you go that far the reception/quality of the reading takes a heavy hit.

So even if one psychic can sense minds from 100 feet away while another psychic can sense minds at 300 feet, the effective distance for both would still be something like 80 and 150 in terms of getting a clear enough sense to be more than mostly-meaningless mental/emotional noise.
