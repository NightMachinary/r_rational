I was kind of figuring that it was more the limitations of the game; the designers didn't think it would work to have a mechanic where evolving stripped away learned moves. Especially in such an early stage of the game, where inexperienced trainers might not have any idea how to continue training their nerfed pokemon. And then everyone would be delaying the evolution of their bugs to minimise the time they spend in-cocoon...all in all, it would be a mess in-game.

But it would make more sense in-world.
