Mostly unrelated question; if humans can be Normal type or Dark type or Psychic type... does that mean that it's possible for humans to also be Fire type, or Electric type, or Poison type? If so, what would that look like?

Or is this just a case of this society co-opting pokemon typing terminology to describe a variable range of human psychic sensitivity?
