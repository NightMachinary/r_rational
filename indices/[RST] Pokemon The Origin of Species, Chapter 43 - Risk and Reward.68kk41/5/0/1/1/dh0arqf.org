I think it already mentioned in story about Agatha having a special affinity for ghosts and training other that have have that affinity, maybe there is a ghost-type variety of human that are similar to psychics but with different capabilities? I think the story also mentioned martial artists that learn to manipulate "chi" similar to fighting type pokemon?
