The pokemon game series is a long running tragedy of two-steps-forward, one-step-back. They keep introducing new features every game, only to have them removed soon after. Thankfully, on the whole, the pile of features is increasing, but we can never be sure which ones will stick and which ones won't. For example, I'm pretty sure now that Alola included character customization that it's going to stay for all the New games, but the Remakes probably won't have it. But will pokemon riding from SuMo persist, even in new games, or will they bring HMs back? Magic 8 ball says, "Ask again later."
