That goddamn banjo... I don't understand game development enough to know why whoever is in charge of music design doesn't play the alpha and say "Hey, maybe let's not spend half the game listening to the same song after we spent so long creating a bunch of different tracks for it?" Maybe they did and the project leader just loooves banjos.

But yeah I hear you. I'd be more okay with HMs being reintroduced if they just made the attacks all useful. Surf is the gold standard, and Strength is okay, but most of the rest just suck so bad it's insult to injury requiring them in your party.
