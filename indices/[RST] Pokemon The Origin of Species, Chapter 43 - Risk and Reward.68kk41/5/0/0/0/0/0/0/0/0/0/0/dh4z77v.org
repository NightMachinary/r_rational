Yeah, like, the bike themes were at least good and fitting, and you didn't have to hear them if you didn't want to anyways. The banjo would be okay music for a minigame, but for something as unavoidable and omnipresent as this...

Yeah, I definitely understand the issues with HMs. My pet idea for how to fix them without totally changing them is to just make it so that you can use them a long as you have the HM, the required badge, and a Pok√©mon that /can/ learn it, without needing to actually take up a move slot. But yeah, making the HM moves more usable would also be nice!
