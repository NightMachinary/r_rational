  And if you do, somehow, develop a special power or device that allows you to anticipate crimes or teleport to the scene... well, then you have the choice of either becoming a superhero with it, or patenting it, mass-producing it, becoming insanely rich, and putting it in the hands of the police who are already equipped and motivated to fight crime far better than you can anyway.

My desire to put that kind of surveillance network into the hands of the police is /pretty/ low, even if I could build one using off-the-shelf software-defined radios and a bit of hackery. There are better things to work on.
