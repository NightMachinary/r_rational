It's worth noting what the fairly common real life superheroes do- some do activism of some sort for a cause like environmentalism, some hand out food to the homeless or clean up litter, some patrol an area to keep it safe. It's very possible.

In the UK with me, there's this fairly well known superhero group which agitates for father's rights.
