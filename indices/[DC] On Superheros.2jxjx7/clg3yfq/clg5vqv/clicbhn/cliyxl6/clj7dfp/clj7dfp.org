There is very little reason for nearly everyone to fight/cause crime (though there's a bit of authorial figleaf for this one). Given that everyone is going to choose violence rather than profit or productivity, there is no reason for everyone to forgo guns (I've heard attempted justifications but it's a moronically unstable equilibrium /at best/). Secret identities are an inherently stupid, impractical idea; de-anonymizing someone is not that hard in our world, and with elevated stakes there would be a lot more effort/research put into it, making it almost trivial.

The entire setting is founded on some ridiculously implausible conceits, and it is possible to write interesting, high-quality superhero stories without those implausible conceits. This doesn't necessarily make Worm /bad/ fiction (though I do dislike it), but the degree to which the worldbuilding requires everyone to be holding the Idiot Ball all the time should heavily disqualify it from being considered rationalfic.
