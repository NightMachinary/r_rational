May I also recommend the same writer's webcomic, [[http://leftoversoup.com/][Leftover Soup]], which consists of 1)pretty good rapid-fire jokes 2)pretty good rapid-fire amateur philosophy 3)realistic, intelligent characters with very different viewpoints on the world 4)slow, detailed plot (time progresses fairly slowly in-comic) that progresses in a sensible, usually predictable way.

It's not necessarily /rational/ (the most-main character has hit several diabolus ex machinas), but it has many properties in common and is likely to appeal to this sub.
