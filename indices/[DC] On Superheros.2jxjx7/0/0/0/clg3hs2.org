From Tesla's Wikipedia article:

#+begin_quote
  Many inventions developed by Tesla were not put into patent protection.

Which is what I was talking about. There's also this quote from him about Marconi's use of his patents:

#+begin_quote
  Otis Pond, an engineer then working for Tesla, said, "Looks as if Marconi got the jump on you." Tesla replied, "Marconi is a good fellow. Let him continue. He is using seventeen of my patents."
#+end_quote

Though the Patent Office reversed their decision and inexplicably (though probably through bribes or use of political power) granted Marconi the patent for radio, which made Tesla furious since that meant that Marconi could sue him. (The Supreme Court later reversed that decision.)

There are a number of other instances as well.
