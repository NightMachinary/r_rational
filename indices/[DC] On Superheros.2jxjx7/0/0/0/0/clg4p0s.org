Again, this positive thing about Tesla on the internet sounds shaky. In fact, it sounds shaky at nearly every point. Wikipedia has no citation for Tesla forgoing patents (particularly relative to other inventors). The quote sounds too snappy to be verbatim. Impugning the motives of the patent office sounds like motivated reasoning. The fundamental principles of radio predate both Tesla and Marconi - calling anything "the patent for radio" sounds like it's obfuscating important technical details. I seem to recall something about the Supreme Court case being more complicated than you imply, and there being a third patent that predated either Tesla or Marconi.
