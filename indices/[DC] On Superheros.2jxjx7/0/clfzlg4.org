  (As a side note, those superheroes who develop or invent entirely unique powers, and then hoard them? Screw those guys. When Edison invented the incandescent lightbulb, did he keep its secret to himself, and then bust nocturnal crime as the Illuminator? Fighting the nefarious Doktor Lightning with the help of the Amazing Flight Brothers? No. Because, as a man of Science, he was familiar with Newton's statement about the shoulders of giants.)

Edison did, however, engage in extensive litigation around the patent rights to the incandescent bulb, and was fairly notoriously litigious about the use of "his" inventions. Edison /absolutely/ would have hoarded his inventions if he could have made money that way. Tesla was the one who eschewed patents and shared his discoveries and inventions.
