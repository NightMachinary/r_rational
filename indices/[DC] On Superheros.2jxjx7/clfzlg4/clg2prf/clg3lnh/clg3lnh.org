Tesla is horribly, horribly overrated on the internet (and Edison is even worsely treated). I personally blame [[http://theoatmeal.com/comics/tesla][this comic]], which was skillfully refuted by Alex Knapp in [[http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2012/05/18/nikola-tesla-wasnt-god-and-thomas-edison-wasnt-the-devil/][this Forbes article]]. I agree that Tesla is an interesting character, but [[http://pastebin.com/cyjZ4Me1][his actual biography]] isn't so dramatic.
