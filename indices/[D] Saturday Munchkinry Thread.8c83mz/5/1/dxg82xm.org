Would be a good power for a sniper. Especially if he could identify people at night.

At night mission the character would be usefull.

Also the character should be able to see through thin fabrics (At least with the right light source).

Not sure if you care, but there are some physical limits about how good a human sized eye could be. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2izv-c_ts]]

#+begin_quote
  visual sensitivity sharp enough to distinguish individual photons

Could the character see the structure of molecules? That could get him/her good money in protein structure analysis. (Chemist already use UV and other kind of light for identification of molecules. But only just absorbtion rates and stuff.)

#+begin_quote
  perception of wavelength directly

could be used to have 5 yellow tshirts and only your character could differentiate between them. Not very useful. But for secret messages maybe. or identification of people.
