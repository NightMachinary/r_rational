I've been thinking about mundane superpowers a lot, and one that's been in my mind for a while is the concept of a character with "perfect" vision. The character would probably be artificially created, either through robotics or genetic engineering, with the following abilities:

- visual sensitivity sharp enough to distinguish individual photons

- full acuity across the entire "retina" and not just the fovea (and no blind spot)

- perception of wavelength directly, rather than sensors for primary colors, such that "red light plus green light" is perceived differently from "yellow light".

- sensitivity to wavelengths outside the typical "visible light" spectrum

- robustness to optical illusions

The character would still be vaguely humanoid, so no saucer-sized eyes to pick up the more sparsely distributed wavelengths, and he'd still have to account for the slight blurring of light that passes through his pupil, unless there's some way to mitigate that.

Off the top of my head, he'd have excellent vision at night and over long distances, including basically being a walking thermal imaging camera, but I was wondering if there might be some more out-of-the-box uses of this power that make it more powerful than it seems.
