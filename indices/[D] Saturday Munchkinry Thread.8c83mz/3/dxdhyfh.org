I'm not sure whether this belongs in this thread or the worldbuilding thread, but today is Saturday, so it's going here.

A world I'm working with has special crystals that can be magically entangled in pairs, such that any light that enters one exits the other, and likewise for sound. Imagine one of the portals from /Portal/, but with a glass barrier preventing matter from passing through, and then make that baseball-sized and omnidirectional.

Aside from magitech telephones, I'm at a loss for what else they'd end up being used for. I know that wormholes which can transmit information faster than light can possibly violate causality, but setting up the necessary reference frames would be difficult with the setting's current level of tech, and there are already easier methods of time travel available.
