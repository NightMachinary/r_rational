Yeah I missed the last part of that sentence, but yeah if you have time travel you have /much/ larger issues. For one it's not clear there's any use to the crystals since advanced tech and other means of time travel could accomplish the same thing.

For one if you have time travel then this:

#+begin_quote
  would be difficult with the setting's current level of tech
#+end_quote

doesn't make sense since tech knowledge will propagate backwards until it's just always existed.

Plus you're going to have a rather difficult time trying to keep the setting from being a bizzare post-singularity world without normal types of conflict in the story.
