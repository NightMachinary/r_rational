Sonic grenades/Alarm buzzers? Put one end of a crystal in a place full of incredibly loud noises. Place the other in some kind of sound-proof container and carry it around with you. When you need to, open the container to create utterly deafening amounts of noise that doesn't stop until the crystal is destroyed. Effectively incapacitates everyone near the crystal while attracting the attention of everyone for miles around.
