You can reach mastery in pretty much everything given two weeks. I'd pick up an instrument, get really good, gain some notoirety (while picking up various charisma and crowd control skills) and then leverage that quickly into fame and fortune as an entertainer, and leverage that into whatever I wanted. 100x speed learning is real broke, as you can reach peak human skill in a profession given about a year.
