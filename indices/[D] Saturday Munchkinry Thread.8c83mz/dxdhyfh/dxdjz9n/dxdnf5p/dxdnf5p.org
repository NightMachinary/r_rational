To clarify, pretty much anything that can pass through, for example, a glass paperweight passes through the link between the crystals (with the exception of things like "a bullet" or "a hot enough metal rod"). The crystal itself does have properties of its own, though, so some wavelengths will likely be absorbed rather than transmitted, and images that are transmitted will have a fish-eye distortion.

The world is mostly preindustrial, so Wi-Fi is out of the question, but I like your idea of using them as "heat bombs", so long as you can find a crystal that doesn't melt or crack under the stress.
