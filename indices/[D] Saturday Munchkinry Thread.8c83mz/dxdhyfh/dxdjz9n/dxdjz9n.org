When you say light passes through, do you mean all electromagnetic radiation or just the visible spectrum? You might be able to do some interesting x-ray optics stuff not really possible in our world, or use them as amazing wifi/coms range extenders.

Building a massive array of mirrors out in a remote section of desert that all focus light on to one of these crystals might get you an interesting portable light/heat bomb.

(You build the array first, then when it is dark outside you slip a crystal into the focus point and put its pair wherever you want all that light to end up - e.g. an enemy's base)

If you built the array to only hit one side of the crystal, you could attach the matching one to a stick of some sort to make a rod that could be used as a fairly devastating weapon. You might be able to use it for something non-violent like clearing snow/heating a base you've built on land that was previously unusable due to cold weather)
