If all photons that go in must come out, as you shrink an active crystal it will appear brighter. If apparent brightness is conserved, as you enlarge a crystal it will become more of a light source. In the latter case, an apparatus of lenses and crystals in series (all but the endpoints of which can be offloaded to the homebase) might bestow night vision in all but absolute darkness, enhance the night sky, and yield a weapon whose exponential power is limited only by the outbound crystal's imperfections/cooling.
