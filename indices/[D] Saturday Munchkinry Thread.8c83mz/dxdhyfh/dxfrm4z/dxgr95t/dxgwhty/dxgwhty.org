No, it's just a better laser. Normal laser is excitation of gas in a chamber with two mirrors, one half-transparent to let the light out. For this you'd have both fully reflective and near perfect mirrors, which would increase the strength by quite a bit along with being able to release all the light at once instead of slowly leaking from the feedback loop.
