  Aside from magitech telephones, I'm at a loss for what else they'd end up being used for. I know that wormholes which can transmit information faster than light can possibly violate causality, but setting up the necessary reference frames would be difficult with the setting's current level of tech, and there are already easier methods of time travel available.

You're still going to need to limit things to lightspeed unless it's canon in your universe that no advanced civilizations will ever arise in the future (which obviously has bad implications for human civilization).

The main issue here being that there's almost certainly lots of crystal pairs that are going to stick around for a very long time. So if an advanced civilization ever finds one they could manipulate relativistic reference frames to affect one of the crystals in the pair up to when it was created. This an issue because not only could they communicate using it (perhaps convincing anyone on the other side to follow certain commands using superhuman charisma) but it's also very probably that it could use extremely precise lasers to construct the first generation of self replicating nanobots so it can directly instantiate itself in the past.
