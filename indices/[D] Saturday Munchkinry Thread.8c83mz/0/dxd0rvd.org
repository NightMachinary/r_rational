You have the ability to create regions of space ("voids") that destroy any matter within them.

- The regions are always 10cm radius spheres
- You can create them anywhere within the 3m sphere surrounding your body. Created voids must be anchored to a solid object also within the 3m sphere and maintain a constant position relative to that object.
- Voids stop existing when their anchor is sufficiently disrupted (e.g. broken into pieces or melted). There is no other way to destroy voids
- Destroying matter does not result in any energy release due to the lost mass
- Matter can freely enter voids, therefore creating one in an atmosphere would result in fairly rapid loss of said atmosphere.

What productive uses are there of this ability?
