  Matter can freely enter voids, therefore creating one in an atmosphere would result in fairly rapid loss of said atmosphere.

That gives me problems. How long would one void need to destroy the earth atmosphere and how many others can create voids? (Doomsday devices are cool. Put an object with a void anchored to it, inside an airtight box. Put a small bomb on the box, and explode it, when someone says you are an orange orangutan.)

Fu...Forget productive, I still would want a void sword (A sword hilt, with one or more voids anchored where the blade would be.) But void armor is not safe without oxygen tanks.

Do voids interact with each other? Can they overlap? Can they fuse? (Could void sword fights be a thing?) If voids can interact, how do the anchors behave (Is there a resistance to them)?

Sell yourself as tunnel making machine. How fast can voids destroy matter? That is a point you should limit a little. Maybe the void is viscose and stuff needs to be pressed into it. Would somewhat limit doomsday devices.

Can the void exist outside the 3m sphere when the object leaves it? If yes, you could use an object, that destroys itself in ~30 seconds, drop it (void down), and that void could "drill" a hole 4,5km deep in 30 seconds. (Oil here we come.)

Crazy plan: build huge generation ships and fill them up with fuel. Feed the earth to the void, so you can leave without wasting too much fuel.
