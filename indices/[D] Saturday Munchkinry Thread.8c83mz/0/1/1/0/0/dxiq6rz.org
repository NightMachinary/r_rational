  - Voids stop existing when their anchor is sufficiently disrupted (e.g. broken into pieces or melted). There is no other way to destroy voids

Okay, point taken, that works. Unfortunately, the destroying-and-replacing-the-voids version only works for /your/ personal ship, since /you/ have the power to create them.

But, on further reflection, some voids can be anchored to the door, such that they move /with/ the door as it opens, neatly resolving that particular issue.

And as long as they still permit electromagnetic radiation to pass through them, you can even see where you are going!
