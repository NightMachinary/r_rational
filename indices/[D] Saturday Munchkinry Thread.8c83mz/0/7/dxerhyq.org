Space shuttles. Have someone send you to the top, then create several near top anchor to the entire shuttle. Liftoff without wind resistance would be useful and it will automatically turn off when the boosters break off.

Deep earth drilling, as long as you can construct a reliable fail-safe shutoff. Say, you anchor an object that only stays together while it has an active current via electromagnet.
