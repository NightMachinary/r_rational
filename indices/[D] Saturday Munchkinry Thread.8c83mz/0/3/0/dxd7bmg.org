Sorry, I meant that you anchored the void to an object in the 3m sphere surrounding you but not contained within the void (therefore setting the void's frame of reference without arbitrarily setting it to the earth).

Also photons are not counted as matter (especially as it's unclear whether long wavelength EM waves like radio are within the void at all)
