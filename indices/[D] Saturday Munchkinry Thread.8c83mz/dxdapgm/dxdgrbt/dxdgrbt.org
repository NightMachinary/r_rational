Assuming you don't care about your country, you could just flee. Even if the war is worldwide, there's plenty of wilderness no one cares about, though you would have to adapt to a much lower standard of living since there won't be much civilization in these places. Middle class is enough wealth to stockpile tons of cheap food and water and transport them to your hideout in the middle of nowhere.

If you're unwilling or unable to move to the middle of nowhere, at least move to a rural area. Cities are basically holding up large "NUKE ME" signs in war, and there's nothing a middle class citizen can really do to prepare against a nuke. Even if you build a shelter and somehow survive in it, you're still stuck that that shelter for years before the nuclear radiation levels drop back to a safe level. You would need something like a fallout vault, and that's way beyond the price range of a middle class citizen.
