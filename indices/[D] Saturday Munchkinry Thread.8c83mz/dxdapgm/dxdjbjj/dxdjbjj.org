  You think there is a non-insignificant chance of a military conflict -- or some other similar crisis -- breaking out near where you live (or worldwide), somewhere in the next several years. Your character is a middle class citizen. What preparations do you make for such possible scenario?

I think there's a "non-insignificant chance of a military conflict -- or some other similar crisis" happening, considering america is /already/ involved in an overseas conflict, and will likely continue to be. And I'm not really doing anything unusual because of that-- it's just business as usual. So I'm going to raise the chance of not just a military conflict, but outright war to "more likely than not" to keep things interesting.

Because considering that many of us live in the US, a local war begins at "civil war" and ends with "nuclear holocaust."

That's going to destabilize the entire planet something fierce. So aside from whatever prepper stuff you can afford, you need to go somewhere remote and in the southern hemisphere. I personally would get a job in brazil for reasons I won't get into here, but other south american countries and africa would also be "good" locations.

Financially, the ideal would be to sell most stocks and bonds, and invest in gold as it tends to outpace other investments in times of crisis. Investments in the US defense industry would also bear fruit-- in the leadup to war, more contracts would get handed out.
