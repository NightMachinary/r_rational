You think there is a non-insignificant chance of a military conflict -- or some other similar crisis -- breaking out near where you live (or worldwide), somewhere in the next several years. Your character is a middle class citizen. What preparations do you make for such possible scenario?

For an easier mode you can assume that your character doesn't have good enough access to internet to be able to conduct proper online research, and has never frequented any online forums that are centered on the subject of apocalyptic preparations.
