Some things to note:

1. Use inside atmosphere will create powerful air currents, which means this is an engine and can self-propell.

2. If it is anchored relative to the orientation of the object, it can travel (near-arbitrarily) faster than the speed of light.

3. This is remarkably dangerous and wasteful.

4. Some things are nearly impossible to destroy, like single atoms.

5. You can assassinate basically anyone with a matchstick.
