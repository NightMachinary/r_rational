I thought of another use for this ability: nigh-invincible shields. Cover the surface of a shield with voids and it becomes immune to physical attacks.

Not recommended for use within the atmosphere, but would be incredibly useful in space. You would coat the exterior of a spaceship with voids, and then you can fly through asteroid fields without fear since all asteroids would be destroyed by the voids before they can hit your ship. Just remember to remove the voids when you want to land your ship somewhere.

You could also cheaply terraform Venus: get solid objects that can withstand the heat and acid of the atmosphere of Venus, attach voids to them, and drop them down to Venus. Most will probably be destroyed, but some would survive. Over time, their voids would eat up the entire atmosphere of Venus, removing all the toxic gases and greenhouse gases that cause the planet to be ridiculously hot and uninhabitable. Once that's done, you now have a nearby Earth-sized planet that you can colonize. There would still be problems like no atmosphere and reduced distance to the sun, but overcoming these problems is much easier than dealing with the toxic atmosphere of Venus.
