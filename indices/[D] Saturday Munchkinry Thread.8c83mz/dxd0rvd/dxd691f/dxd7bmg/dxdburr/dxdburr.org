  Sorry, I meant that you anchored the void to an object in the 3m sphere surrounding you but not contained within the void (therefore setting the void's frame of reference without arbitrarily setting it to the earth).

Oooh. That makes more sense. Okay, void-railgun will be a little harder now, but still doable. You would just need to anchor voids surrounding your tiny bullets in every direction, so you get a roughly spherical blob of voids with a tiny hole in the center for your bullet. This does mean your fire rate will become slower though, since you would need to create multiple voids per bullet.
