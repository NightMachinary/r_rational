Which is why the question is: how small can the bullet be? If the bullet has to be regular size, then it would be as slow as normal bullets and thus be stuck in Earth's gravity well, causing all kinds of havoc on it's atmosphere.

But if the bullet can be way smaller, like on the scale of atomic particles, you can now fire it at ridiculous speeds. Acceleration = Force / Mass, so with a small enough mass you can probably construct railguns that fire out void bullets at way faster than escape velocity, causing the bullets to just carve out a near-instant ~20cm radius cylinder from your railgun to outer space. Not a whole lot of damage to the Earth overall, but absolutely devastating to anything in its path.
