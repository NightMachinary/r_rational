Since the railgun projectile core is effectively in a vacuum it would have nothing slowing it down so after hitting the target would travel in a weird orbit inside the earth (net gravity gets weaker as you go further inside) until it melted due to infrared radiation, possibly traveling back to the surface and causing more destruction. This is probably more than you want from a "super armor piercing round".
