If a void has to be anchored to an object in the void and is dissipated when the object is destroyed, but destroys any matter within the void, then it'd be either indestructible or immediately destroy itself. I assume you had something else in mind?

Selling to the army for super-armor piercing rounds. Making very good vacuums for scientific experiments. Perfect heat sink/radiators for power generators if it treats photons as matter, maybe. Holding the world hostage or you drop one to the earth's core/drain the ocean/destroy the atmosphere.
