It's not quite as simple as little blocks of steel. You would need a constant magnetic field to keep the void levitated. Otherwise it would just eat through the bottom of the block of steel and fall straight to the center of the earth. And you can bet that among the people you sell it to, some of them will forget to keep the magnetic field on and that exact scenario will happen. On a plus side, a 10cm radius tunnel to the center of the earth is not at all stable, and will immediately refill itself with dirt, so I don't expect this to cause an eruption of lava through the new tunnel.

EDIT: Nevermind, the rule was clarified to say that voids can be anchored to items outside them. Little steel blocks work fine.
