Hold on a sec, a void destroys any matter within them, but is anchored to a solid object within itself which, when destroyed, causes the void to stop existing. So whenever you create a void, it immediately destroys its anchor and ceases to exist? Or is the anchor magically immune to the void powers? If the anchor is immune, how would it be broken into pieces when anything that enters the void is destroyed before it can reach the anchor?

Well, under the assumption that the anchor is immune to the void's own destructive properties, the next question is: what counts as a solid object? What is the minimum mass necessary? Does a single atom of iron count as a solid, since iron is a solid at room temperature? If so, do military applications count as productive uses? Because the energy needed to accelerate a really tiny mass to ridiculous speeds is pretty cheap, especially with your void negating any kind of friction or air resistance. You could construct a powerful railgun that launches tiny bullets with anchored voids at absolutely ridiculous speeds, and watch them utterly destroy a 10cm radius cylinder with an absolutely ridiculous range.

It would also penetrate EVERYTHING. No wall or armor will block your bullet from reaching your target, then piercing through the target, and then continuing onwards, thanks to the matter destroying void. It would only ever stop if it enters an environment hot enough to melt the bullet from infrared radiation alone, (or is somehow electromagnetized/gravitized to a stop, which is ludicrously improbable since there would need to be a reverse-copy of your railgun that has to be in the exact path of the void and activate at the exact time to stop it). You could fire your void-railgun at any meteors too close to the earth, and they'll be utterly destroyed one 10cm tube at a time. Though you would need to fire a really large number of shots, so I suggest doing it in space where you won't destroy the earth's atmosphere.
