I'm sure I've asked this before, but if I have, I can't find which thread it was in.

Human beings have an ability (known as "subitizing") to judge how many items are in small sets (about 1 to 4 items) quickly and accurately. This is distinct from counting and estimating in that it quickly considers the group as a whole instead of marking off set elements individually, and tends to have a high degree of accuracy.

What would be a good use of an unlimited subitizing range? To clarify, this is just a "processing boost", not a supernatural "counting ability", so you could tell how many circles are in [[https://i.imgur.com/EW0V6To.png][this image]]^{([[/spoiler][144]])} as quickly and easily as you can tell how many are in [[https://i.imgur.com/RKKeIoX.png][this image]]^{([[/spoiler][3]])} but you /couldn't/ tell how many grains are in [[https://i.imgur.com/DopriwO.jpg][this bag of rice]].
