To clarify, is the problem with the bag of rice because you can't see all of the rice inside the bag? So if say, you dumped all the rice out on a flat surface, such that no rice grain is blocking the view of another, you would be able to count them all instantly? In other words, your ability work as long as you can actually see each item and think "yep that's an item"?

Well, one thing that immediately jumps to mind is that a microbiologist would find this ability very useful. A common thing they have to do is analyze the amount of bacteria that is infesting something. To do that, they take a small sample of that something and put it under a microscope, and then actually manually count the bacteria one by one. (They choose a really small sample so there's only like a hundred bacteria on one). They can't exactly use a computer because some cells aren't easy to recognize for a computer (at least, last I checked. It has been a while since then).

And that would be a general idea. Look for large populations of items that computers would have trouble recognizing, like faces. Or shoes. A lot of mundane things are actually pretty hard for a computer to recognize just because of how vaguely defined they are (what's a shoe, specifically? What's the difference between a shoe and a sock?) and how different they look under different lighting (our brains automatically adjust for lighting in most cases. It's kinda insane when you think about it). With your processing boost, you would be able to count these things far better than a computer can.

This would also be useful for researching the popularity of various events and locations. A single glance would be enough for you to tell how many people are on a street (if you're looking down on them from a building) or how many people are attending an event like a concert.
