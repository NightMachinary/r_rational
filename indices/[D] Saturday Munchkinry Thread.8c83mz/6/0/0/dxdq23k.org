Yeah, that's the problem with the bag of rice; spreading them out in a monolayer would let you tell how many there are easily. I only added that clarification because I've asked the same question elsewhere, and got answers such as "guessing the number of jelly beans in a jar" or "counting how many inhabited planets there are".

You make a very good point about counting things that are difficult for computers to recognize.
