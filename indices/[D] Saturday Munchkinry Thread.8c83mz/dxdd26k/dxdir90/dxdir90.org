Step 1: choose smartest possible person.\\
Step 2: ask the notebook

You situation is having a notebook that faithfully answers the question "what would person [X] do in the situation I'm in?".

They choose to ask the same question, but with a smarter and smarter person.

Eventually someone realizes that they're recursing, and comes up with better idea.

Step 3: Copy that idea\\
Step 4: realize too late that their idea was predicate on being simulated, and therefore involves getting their simulator to unwittingly aid their real-world self in some way.\\
Step 5: Deal with fallout from step 4\\
Step 6: Realize that /you're/ being simulated by someone trying to figure out what to do with their magic notebook.\\
Step 7: Attempt to solve unsolved mathematics problems, so your simulator thinks you're useful and continues to simulate you.\\
Step 8: Try not to cry. Cry a lot.
