Hmm, the notebook is a lot less powerful then, seeing as if you could convince someone into signing your shady notebook so you can ask the notebook what they would do in situation X, you might as well just /directly/ ask them what they would do in situation X.

In this case, it would be more useful as a lie detector of sorts, since the notebook would tell you what they really would do, not what they say they would do. You would essentially force or trick someone into signing your notebook and then abuse the notebook to learn all their secrets.

Just write "What would [X] do if they were somehow forced to say all their secrets?", then, since they are forced to say all their secrets, what they would do is to say all their secrets, and your notebook will show them saying all their secrets. Hopefully your notebook is nice enough to say what those secrets are specifically, rather than just say "They would say all their secrets." If the latter happens, you are going to need more tricky questions.
