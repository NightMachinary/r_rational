If we've learned anything from the recent wars in the Middle East, or the conflict in Ukraine, your absolute best bet would be to move to a safer and more stable country before the outbreak of war.

If you're dead-set on staying where you are, then you'll want to prepare for several problems:

1) *Loss of utilities:* You'll want solar panels and a rainwater harvesting and storage system to serve as backups in the event of power failure and loss or contamination of municipal water supply. This can be an issue with or without war (as we've seen with Flint) and it may actually save you money depending on local tax incentives and mean solar irradiance for your area. Heating is also a concern - consider stocking up on firewood if you're reliant on natural gas and at risk of experiencing freezing temperatures and inability to cook meals if your natural gas supply ever fails.

2) *Fire:* Firebombing, nuclear flash-fires and even wildfires (as we saw in California recently) are a serious potential threat. Your best bet is to get a home which offers you at least a 100 foot buffer zone in all directions where you can minimize potential fuel sources. You'll also want the exterior of your home to be made resistant to catching fire from embers blowing in the wind or radiant heat sources (e.g. wildfires and nuclear flash ignition). Brick or concrete construction with ceramic roofing would be ideal.

3) *Wind:* This includes nuclear blasts, with lower speeds as you get further from any likely targets for a nuclear strike. This also includes hurricanes and tornadoes, which you may face with or without a war depending on your location. Aim for sturdy construction with thick walls, possibly reinforced concrete, storm windows, and hurricane ties to keep your roof down.

4) *Flooding:* Dams are a major target of potential attack in a war, so consider whether or not your home lies in the path of a potential floodplain. Flooding in general is also a significant concern, war or not. Check out [[https://msc.fema.gov/portal][FEMA's flood zone maps]] which you can download to see which places are best to avoid in whatever location you're interested in moving to. In general, try to find a location which is uphill of most of its surroundings.

5) *Famine:* Even if your house is still standing, nearby farms can be destroyed in fires or floods, and routes for shipping in food can be bombed or blocked by flooding or military checkpoints. Stock up canned food and cycle through it, periodically eating the oldest canned food and buying new canned food to keep a fresh supply which won't be expired when you need it. It also wouldn't hurt to grow some edible plants in a garden around your home, as long as you can expand the garden for full self-sufficiency if needed.

6) *Looting:* Having the one house that still has its lights on at night and didn't get flooded, burned, or blown down puts you at significant risk of getting looted or potentially evicted from your own home. Purchasing a gun and a security system to warn you of a home invasion are likely your best bet.

7) *Even worse:* War is really messy, and the aforementioned items are just the common things which create millions of refugees. Even worse possibilities include chemical weapons, or organized groups (military or otherwise) who roam around raping/massacring civilians. Against this, you'll want an escape option. An extra can or two of gas, plus supplies for minor repairs and maintenance (replacing a tire, jump starting your car, etc.), and ready-to-go supplies including food, water, blankets, fire-starting materials, basic tools (e.g. a map, a compass, an axe, some screwdrivers, some wrenches, a pair of scissors, a knife, a sewing needle, thread, a roll of duct tape, a length of rope or chain, etc.) would be a good start.
