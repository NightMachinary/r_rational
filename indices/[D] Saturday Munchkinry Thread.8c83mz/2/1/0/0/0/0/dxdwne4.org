Oh. I misunderstood. That means you actually need to construct a situation that you want to put someone else in, and put yourself in it. Hmm... can other people use the notebook? If so, you're going to need a victim.

Let's call your target X, and the situation you want to put him in S. You need put a victim Y in situation S, and make victim Y write into the notebook "what would X do in the situation I'm in?", without telling the victim how the notebook works. Basically, think about Death Note, and how Light tricked Ray Penbar into killing the FBI team. Same general idea.
