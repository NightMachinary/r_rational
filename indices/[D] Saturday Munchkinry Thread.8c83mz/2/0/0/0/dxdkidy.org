  Also, how would someone know if recursion were happening?

If it's possible for a notebook to simulate someone, and it's possible to simulate a person who used the notebook to simulate someone, then it's much more likely that you're one of the people being simulated by the notebook than the base-level simulator.

Step-4 is just an extension of that. You can assume you're being simulated by someone who wants to see what you do so they can copy it, so you do something that on the surface seems helpful (doing something to further your own goals) so that the simulator duplicates it to further /their/ own goals, but really the intent is that the simulator's actions help your "real" self.

Although that's perhaps too adversarial a view. I could, for example, reveal my time-travel password to the simulator, so they could call up my real self and convince me to help in return for some favor.
