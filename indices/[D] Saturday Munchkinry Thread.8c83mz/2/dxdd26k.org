You have a notebook that can faithfully answer the question "what would person [X] do in the situation I'm in?" However, it takes 24hrs for you to switch people.

Edit: Switching people constitutes actually meeting them in person and making them autograph/write something the notebook. You can also simulate non-human organisms by having them mark the notebook somehow. (ame can be done with objects, but the answer to a toaster's response to an awkward social situation will usually be 'nothing.)
