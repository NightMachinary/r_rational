Mostly the same skills as today? Social skills (and/or con artist skills) to make connections. Science skills and invention skills to make inventions that make your life easier. If you're paranoid, pick up survival skills and martial arts and medical skills, all of which could protect your life in different situations.

The only skills that would be different are skills that depend on the era's technology. E.g. computer skills are useless in the early 1900's, since computers don't exist. On the other hand, library skills would be useful since you would need to look up information in library books rather than just google them.
