I think that the big thing people don't realise about romance is that you /can/ do it rationally - the "I CAN EXPLAIN!" moments in romcom are the prototypical example of "thorin throwing down the key", but there are plenty of romance shows and storylines that include people having adult conversations about their feelings and treating their partners with respect / etc. I recommend /Jane the Virgin/ - which is not rational in plot, I stress - for this sort of rationality. Also it's absolutely hilarious.

I made a comment on this thread last year actually: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5u4cku/d_its_that_time_of_year_again_discuss_romance_in/ddrirq8/]] about my supernatural romance story (that I am still editing! it turns out writing something is REALLY HARD and what I thought was a mostly finished 30k word story in February 2017 is now a mostly finished 60k word story a year later, so go figure. I'd be happy to release a few chapters now but I haven't got enough in the tank to have a consistent release schedule unless I did it like monthly or something).

Like I've been saying since then and before then, though, I hope the genres that people write about in a Rational sense / post stories of become more varied over time.
