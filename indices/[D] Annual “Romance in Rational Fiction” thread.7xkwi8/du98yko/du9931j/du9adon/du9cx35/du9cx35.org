Love is a value. A rational value system doesn't need to preclude emotions, just needs to be self consistent. Like, you value love, what strategies are best for attaining it within the constraints placed by your other values? You love someone and it's almost their birthday? Okay, what actions can you take that would be most beneficial to /their/ values (within reason)? How do you avoid unnecessary conflict with a partner? What sorts of strategies can you come up with for increasing the relationship's mutual benefit? Or if you think you might be in a bad relationship, knowing how to recognize that and call it quits, overcoming your love for the other person for the sake of your own safety and/or well-being.

Love is not /inherently/ irrational. The reason most people who are in romantic relationships aren't all that rational about it is, I suspect, because most people in general aren't all that rational.

Let's remember not to confuse lack of emotion with rationality. ;)
