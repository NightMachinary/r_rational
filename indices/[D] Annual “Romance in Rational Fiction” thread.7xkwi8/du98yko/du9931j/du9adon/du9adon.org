I say that it /is/ a bad thing, and that the oxymoron /doesn't/ work at all. Love is illogical /by definition/---e.g., enjoying a partner, not for the topics of conversation or the pleasing form that he can bring to the table, but for his mere /presence/ near you*. "Logical love" is, /not/ love, but /greed/.

*Not the promise of alliance in unexpected hardship or of availability for companionable recreation that the partner's immediate presence /implies/, but the presence /itself/---indeed, the partner's mere /existence/.
