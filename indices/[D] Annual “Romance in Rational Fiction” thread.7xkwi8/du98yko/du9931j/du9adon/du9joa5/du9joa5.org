Love's not illogical.

We're a social species. Our brains, under FMRI study, function better in the presence of other humans. Exile from other human company is a form of punishment in /all/ human societies without exception. All our stories are stories of interactions between humans or human stand-ins which we can humanize. We have trouble remembering things when they are not somehow associated with a personality; this is why subjects like math can be so difficult for many people.

Human company, human companionship, is the ultimate goal of our brains. All of human history is underpinned by humans interacting with other humans.

Rationality needs to take into account that our species is a social species with social needs and drives, which takes a basic, fundamental pleasure in all forms of physical contact, and all forms of human interaction - even angry, upset interaction is better than no contact. If you don't know how to get attention any way but negative ways, you'll do negative things so you can get what your brain craves. We will literally do /anything/ for human interaction.

Loneliness, being completely alone, drives many people to suicide. We die without meaningful contact.

By this criteria, human interaction in its most positive form - love, be it familial or sexual or platonic - is the most logical thing we do.
