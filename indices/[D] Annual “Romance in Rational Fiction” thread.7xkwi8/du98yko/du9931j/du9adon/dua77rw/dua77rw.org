  Love is illogical /by definition/
#+end_quote

I disagree with your presence-based definition. As a counterexample, if the loved one is nearby, but experiencing great distress, this typically causes distress, not enjoyment, for the one who loves. Conversely, a parent who reads a letter describing the successes and exciting experiences of their (adult) child in another country may be genuinely happy about it, despite the distance.

Presence may often be desired in a loving relationship, but is neither strictly necessary nor sufficient.

I would instead favor a definition based on one's happiness being partly tied to the happiness of the one being loved. Enjoying seeing them smile, being saddened to see them hurt.

In isolation, this attitude would perhaps be quite suboptimal, but when it is /mutual/ - both parties looking out for each other, desiring each other's success - it forms a very solid foundation for cooperation. So it's not inherently irrational at all.
