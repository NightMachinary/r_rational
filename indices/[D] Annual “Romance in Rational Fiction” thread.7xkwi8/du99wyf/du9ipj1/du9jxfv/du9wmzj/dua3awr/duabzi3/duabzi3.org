I actually like what the Alloy of Law books did, Sazed's arc in the old books was complete and it's been hundreds of years since then. The world is different from when he made his decisions and Wax is the one who needs to deal with what's gone wrong.

What seemed like a really good idea at the end of the old books isn't working out as well as we hoped, which I think is appropriate for a pulp adventure story about a lawman fighting occult conspiracies during an industrial revolution.
