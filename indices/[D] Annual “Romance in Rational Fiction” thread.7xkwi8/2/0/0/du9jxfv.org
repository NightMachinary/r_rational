I know some people didn't like the end of his arc, but speaking as someone who is religious and struggled with my psychological need for religion, his journey really resonated with me.

As someone who's always identified with book smart characters like him that support the heroes, I also found the end of the trilogy /super/ satisfying for completely subjective reasons.
