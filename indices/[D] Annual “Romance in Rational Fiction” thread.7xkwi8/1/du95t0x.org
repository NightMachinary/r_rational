Although I'm sure there are others, my personal favorite work was Wildbow's /Twig/. This story had many, many excellent romantic moments between various characters, and the webserial format slowed the slow burn grow into more intense scenes. The story is a great case of a mastermind trying to optimize for happiness despite the conflicting desires and love polygons which occur.
