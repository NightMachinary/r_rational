It is a travesty that no one has yet talked about the fantastic sci-fi romance [[http://www.webtoons.com/en/romance/always-human/1-i-guess-thats-why-i-admire-her/viewer?title_no=557&episode_no=1][Always Human]]. Everything about that story is beautiful and this couple should be held up as an exemplar of how to properly communicate in a relationship. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6t1qn5/d_friday_offtopic_thread/dlhfiz5][Read my full pitch here.]] (yes I finished it and the only thing I was disappointed by was the fact that it ended)
