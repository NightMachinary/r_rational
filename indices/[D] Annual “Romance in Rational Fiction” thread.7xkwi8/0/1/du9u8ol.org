Read it from the same rec thread months back; very much worth and very enjoyable. Beautifully done romance that felt very moving, grounded and realistic and also involved transhumanist elements without being an action/sci-fi/adventure story. That's rare. It also focuses on a same sex couple, which was a refreshing read as well as I don't often experience media with same-sex couples as the thrust of the story. Can't recommend enough.
