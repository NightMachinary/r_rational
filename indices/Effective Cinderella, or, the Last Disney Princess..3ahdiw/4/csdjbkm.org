I don't quite understand what "the keystone" is supposed to be from the content of the story, so I'm worried that the Fairy Godmother would be similarly puzzled and may take it literally, i.e. "follow this yellow brick road to the Library and you can learn to be a scribe!"

I get that it is similar to the Aladdin and Princess Jasmine omake -- and perhaps it builds on top of Jasmine's last wish!

(Side note: the Jasmine and the Lamp Omake ends with "I wish for everyone's intelligence to gradually increase at a rate of 1 IQ point per year." The intent of this wish is evident to me, in terms of creating a gradual and inevitable intelligence increase for the immortal and vigorous "everyone," but IQ is based on a norm with median of 100 and a SD of +/-15... so the educator in me wants it clarified that the term IQ is meant to refer to criterion-based tests at the time of the wish rather than using the norm-referenced definition, since Jasmine is wishing for the goal posts to shift each year.)
