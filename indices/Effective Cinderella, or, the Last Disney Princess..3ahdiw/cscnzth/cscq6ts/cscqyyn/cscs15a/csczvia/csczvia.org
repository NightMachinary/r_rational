My point is, a rational story still has a thematic nature. Fairy magic will not build you a 1589 version of a supercomputer running an FAI, because that violates the theme of a fairy godmother. Evil genies have their own theme, sure, but fairy stories have specific depths as well.

You might wish "wrong" and a good fairy will still help you, but you also can't trick them into making you queen in one step. Often you won't understand the possibly ironic results and think yourself tricked at first. Even in the original, the wishes wasn't meant to be more than minor assistance for achieving something normal but beyond her reach. A bootstrapping of a wunderkind's natural growth.

Mine was a critique of both OP's story and the evil-genie humorous response that you commented on. I could have posted one level deeper, but thought yours a good point as well, and my comment a complement to it. Hope that makes sense.
