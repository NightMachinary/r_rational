I didn't say that it was the point. It's not. It is, however, still a fact, that SOMETHING with power values impulsivity, whether it is the fairy herself, or the AI powering the magic. (Or possibly that it values humility, which is a much more tolerable thing, and something I'd be willing to work with.)

That said, the rich woman was being irrational. The effect was clearly spelled out in the boon: The work will last all day. If we're genre-savvy enough to acknowledge that an impulsive wish is best, then we're genre-savvy enough to realize that the catch is often spelled out right there.
