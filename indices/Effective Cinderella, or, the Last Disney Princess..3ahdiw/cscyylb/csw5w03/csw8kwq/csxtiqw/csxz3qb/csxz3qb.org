  Let's face it, the best form of government possible, in principle, is enlightened absolutism, provided you can find an enlightened dictator and admittedly only working for his/her generation.

"In principle" is nothing before "in practice", and /in practice/, mixed-member proportional parliaments and various other degrees of representative democracy are the system used in the most peaceful, prosperous, enlightened countries the world has ever known -- /despite/ the attempt by capitalism to wipe out democracy as an interference with monetizing literally everything.

But you are certainly welcome to keep on paying your Voluntary Defense Fund contributions, lest the enlightened monarch show up to your house and smash it with a big rock as an example of the kinds of things that happen when you leave your great nation undefended.
