In principle, yes. In practice the one elected are the ones with enough money for advertisement, making it effectively a covert oligarchy. Though thinking about it, it would probably be more applicable in a state with way less population, like in the age the story is set in. But at the same time population would be largely more ignorant and susceptible to demagogy.

Let's face it, the best form of government possible, in principle, is enlightened absolutism, provided you can find an enlightened dictator and admittedly only working for his/her generation.

In practice, well I really don't know, but my favourite fantasy concerns a form of randomly chosen (among the whole population, with the criterion for eligibility being a decent score in a test to determine wisdom) constitutional monarch with a mandate of only a few years. And then another one. I call it Random Monarchy, and it's pretty much unfeasible.
