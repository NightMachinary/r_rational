The only place left to go is the double-subversion. The main character does /exactly/ what you'd expect a storybook heroine to do in every situation, because she's caught between incredibly powerful magical forces and she's doomed if she forfeits her plot armour even for a moment...

... actually, I think Pratchett's done that one as well. Never mind.
