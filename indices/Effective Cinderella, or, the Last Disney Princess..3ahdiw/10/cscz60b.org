Her "solution" depends entirely on a loose interpretation of exactly what "goes away at midnight" means. Come midnight, and she could equally well find that any objects she has obtained during the wish period that she couldn't have obtained without it have vanished, she no longer even remembers how to find them, her attempts to write the knowledge down have turned into pumpkins, and she has nothing.

Also, she seems curiously reluctant to use the word "and" in her wish, which is odd since the fairy godmother already said she could grant a wish for a carriage and a dress.

(And fairy tales like this have this habit of granting good wishes for people who make humble requests and bad ones for the "greedy", which may mean that any attempt to logically decide which wish is best for her will get her in trouble just because she is using logic at all.)
