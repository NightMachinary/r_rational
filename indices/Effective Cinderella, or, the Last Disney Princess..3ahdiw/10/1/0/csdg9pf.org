"Greedy" is in scare quotes, and "humble" probably should have been as well. The problem is that reacting to a wish by saying "I want to rationally determine how to gain more benefit from this wish than I would if I just asked for the first thing that came to my mind" is, /all by itself/, grounds for having the wish granter decide that you're being "greedy" and giving her cause to twist the wish. The fact that the fairy godmother is benevolent won't change this; benevolent fairies still punish the greedy.

What you're supposed to do when faced with a fairy godmother wish is to wish for what comes naturally, and not think it through rationally. If you are a good person, doing this will naturally lead to you blurting out a good wish, and if you're a bad person, doing this will lead to you blurting out a wish that lets the fairy see how greedy you are.
