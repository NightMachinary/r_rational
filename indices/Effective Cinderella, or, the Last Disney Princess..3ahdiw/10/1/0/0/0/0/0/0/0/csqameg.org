The point isn't that impulsivity is a terminal value for the fairy, but rather, it's something demanded by the genre. If you're even in most fairy tales, trying to think out what kind of wish will give you the most benefit is bad because it demonstrates your greed. You're not supposed to ask for too much and optimizing the wish counts as asking for too much.

Remember [[https://books.google.com/books?id=mWIVAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA176&lpg=PA176][this one]] for instance? Impulsive wishes are good. Try to use a well-thought out wish, and you will slip up out of greed.
