Counterpoint: If someone is naturally thoughtful, then blurting out a wish is not what comes naturally. It would, itself, be a forced action, something you would only do if you believed that it would result in a better outcome. And if choosing your wish based on reasoning about improving the outcome is a reason for the fairy godmother to brand you as greedy, then someone who is contemplative by nature is caught in a no-win situation.

This, then, means that the fairy godmother considers impulsiveness to be a moral value and rationality to be a moral wrong.

I do not want to make any transactions with this fairy godmother.
