This Cinderella's wish is morally quite sound, however, and not particularly greedy, and reasonably humble. She seeks the path to enlightenment. She seeks to make the world a better place. And furthermore she chose this wish INSTEAD of less moral choices. She's not just trying to raise her own standing in life -- if THAT'S all she wanted, she could have gone to the ball. Furthermore, the wish implies an acknowledgement that she ISN'T so clever as to be able to figure these things out on her own, but rather she wants to know what the best path for her life would be.

And this is a fairy, not a genie, so the wish will be fulfilled benevolently as it was a benevolent wish.
