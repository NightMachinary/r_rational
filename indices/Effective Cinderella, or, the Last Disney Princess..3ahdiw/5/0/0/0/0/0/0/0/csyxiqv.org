And I agree, and also do not get while you would think otherwise.

EDIT: oh, now I do. Yes, we differ on the criteria. I deem an enlightened despot to call a compulsory tax on defence "Compulsory Tax on Defence", and if you don't abide the despot would confiscate from you values comparable to the tax amount and sell them in a bidding.

An enlightened depot is not a dictator, as intended in the common usage of the word. Rather a dictator in the Roman sense. The name is just inaccurate because we lack a better term.
