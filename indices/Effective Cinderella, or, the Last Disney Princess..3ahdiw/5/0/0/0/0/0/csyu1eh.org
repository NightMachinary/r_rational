Surely. But standing by my previous assertions, that's much like saying oligarchy is a very successful form of government. Which I agree upon, the ancient Greeks pulled it off incredibly well after all.

Probably better that anything else we have now, but hardly optimal. Even less optimal when you have a fairy with reality bending powers at your disposal.

By the way, an enlightened monarch is *ENLIGHTENED*, that's kind of a crucial point (and also the reason why he/she wouldn't destroy your house as an example of what happens when you don't pay your share for the Voluntary Defence Found).
