Personally, I think parliamentary demcoracy is a bunch better than most other structures of government. It's democracy in a nutshell: messy, but ultimately nonviolent and /actually effective/. This is a contrast to presidential and semi-oligarchical "democratic" systems, in which the misguided impulses of the population are blocked from implementation because /the vast majority/ of the population's desires are blocked from implementation, quickly degrading into /outright/ oligarchy.

In multi-party, proportional-representation parliamentary systems, elections can be high-entropy random variables, and their outcomes /actually explain substantial portions of the variance in which laws get passed/. Mixed-member systems then give many of the stability benefits of more regional systems without the drawbacks of oligarchical ones.
