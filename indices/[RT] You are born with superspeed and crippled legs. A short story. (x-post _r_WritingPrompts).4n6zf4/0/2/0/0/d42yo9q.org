I was thinking more about if you were only dealing with the super thought speed, however given the /absurd speed/ the character is thinking in the story..\\
it would be impossible to move his eyes fast enough to avoid the sensory deprivation effects unless you can move FTL, you could try and thus kill your opponent via gamma rays though...

Basically the character is thinking so fast, that the lightspeed barrier would make it impossible to avoid his body being immovable and stationary from his perspective.
