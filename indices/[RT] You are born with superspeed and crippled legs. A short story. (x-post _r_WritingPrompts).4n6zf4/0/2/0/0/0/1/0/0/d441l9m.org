I /just addressed that though/, perceiving anything at that kind of speed is impossible you think way too fast to see the world.\\
The problem with saying physical limitations, is that /your eye's have to move to function/ that can't be hand waved away without making the character have obviously inhuman black eyes that don't have to move. It's not comparable to thinking because he could easily have his brain altered by time dilation, or some other handwave, it's easy to come up with a way for him to think super fast. But one's eyes can't operate in the same black box way.

Also even with black eyes that don't move, (and thus don't necessitate FTL eye movement) everything is so slowed from your perspective that you can't see anything anyway, like how the faster a high speed camera is the dimmer it makes things.

/No remotely human character can get around this problem/ if you think sufficiently fast you just can't also perceive the world in any meaningful way.
