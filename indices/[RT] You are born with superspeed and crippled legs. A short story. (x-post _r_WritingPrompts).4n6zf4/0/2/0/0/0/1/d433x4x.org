Because you can easily imagine his brain being replaced by some magic black box.\\
However one's eye's must necessarily interact with the world through physical interaction by moving.\\
Unless he has pitch black 180 degree eyes he /has to move his eyes/ to see.

The reason he can't move his eyes at that speed is same reason you can't move FTL, and even if you got close to c your eyes movement would release enough gamma rays to kill everyone nearby. Unless you invoke speed force BS but at that point you are basically saying "/because magic"/
