Thinking requires movement (of neurotransmitters, if nothing else). Electrochemical signals in the human body travel about 200 mph, IIRC. If we're allowing him to think at those speeds, his powers clearly include "move neurotransmitters at N times normal speed". Why shouldn't they also include "move eyes at N times normal speed"?
