I don't think it's that bad. I would assume that your powers let you move your eyes as fast as you want, just as they let you move your legs as fast as you want when you run. (Assuming you aren't crippled like this character.)

Smell could be a problem, since only so many scent particles reach your nose in any given second, but you can move to them. Light still moves at c, so you'll have no problem seeing. I'm not sure what happens with hearing -- Doppler effects would be enormous. Taste and touch aren't issues. Overall, I think that at least four of your senses aren't affected by superspeed, assuming you have the required secondary powers.
