Nothing like ours. The transition across the boundary of her inertial damping field hashes most sounds, and if she is supersonic (read: moving) the shockwave does the same thing. There are a few tricks she can use if she wants to, say, listen for how many bullets were fired from a machine gun just before she showed up, but mostly she uses sight and listens to her headphones. Any information she could get by sound, she can generally get more quickly some other way. If not, she stops to listen.
