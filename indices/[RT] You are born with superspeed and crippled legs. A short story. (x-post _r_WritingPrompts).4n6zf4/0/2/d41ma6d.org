I agree that having massive amounts of time isolated in your own mind wouldn't be quite as useful as depicted.\\
You would only ever see the exact same image frozen before you because your eyes movement (like everything else outside your mind) is frozen from your perspective. Except that's not even true, /your eyes and indeed nearly all your senses stop responding to unchanging stimuli/, so basically what you have is as long as you desire inside a /sensory deprivation tank./\\
In conditions like that a normal mind wouldn't be able to do that much, your memory is limited and you can't write anything down. Not having any external stimuli to spur your thinking would it hard to do anything that wasn't rote.

However the biggest problem is that you would probably go insane after less than a few subjective days. Even just relatively tame sensory deprivation that involves muffled dark rooms can have quite intense affects, unfortunately I can't find any links on sensory deprivation tanks being used for long periods of time but I can't imagine it's great.
