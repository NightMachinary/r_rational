I found some of it hard to believe. Just because you have super speed doesn't mean you're any better at memorizing, let alone capable of memorizing every possible chess game. Also actually having to spend all those eons doing nothing but computing chess games would take its toll on anyone's sanity, and the story doesn't try to address it.
