This community discusses rational literature which is based around eliminating plot holes, exploring the logical limitations or conclusions of certain conditions in stories and creating protagonists that are realistic while avoiding PIS and CIS.

I chose your story because I liked the exploration on a speedster's analysis abilities and we discussed the limitations of such an ability, mainly that the human brain is only able to process a limited amount of data at a time before it gets overtaxed and the energy we would require to operate at such speeds.

I like your story and I think it was very well written.
