If you're planning on devoting the substantial amount of time it will take to read, then you can do what I did and put your own ebook together. If you're strong with python and such there is an ebook creator script on github that you can run. I didn't have luck installing it as well as the necessary add-ons to make it work, so I made my own ebook with a little autohotkey scripting. I just automated the process of copying and pasting the text from the blog post which was extracted with a Readable bookmarklet. It took a few hours of mostly babysitting the script, but when I'm devoting the next month or two of my life to reading this thing, I wanted it on my Kindle and with chapter headings.

I would pop onto the wordpress to read comments on some particularly insane chapters, but other than that I tried to stay off because spoilers could abound since early chapters were still open to comments after the subsequent ones.
