Who said anything about raising minimum wage? That's why /comprehensive/ is important. It's not gonna be a talking point that made a TV executive a bunch of money. But you get a bunch of experts in a room to design studies which pit their best ideas against each other, then run those studies, and finally have a competent team design a program based on their conclusions, and you'll get something much more effective.

Imo the method most likely to work involves a multivariate approach. A complex issue isn't going to have a simple solution. Multiple causes need to be addressed with redundant safeguards against points of failure. These "one magic pill" approaches won't work unless you do all of them and even then they're so clunky that they cause an unacceptable burden on everyone. But you figure out the actual marginal utility of different approaches at each stage and the solution becomes simple to figure out.
