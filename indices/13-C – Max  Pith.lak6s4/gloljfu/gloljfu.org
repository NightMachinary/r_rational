I'm so glad that Max is still alive and kicking. She's a really interesting character, and as much as I hate that her revolution has failed and she's lost her best friend, I'm eager to see how that affects her moving forward. I hope she gets the spotlight a bit more in the future, now that she's no longer occupying the role of "shadowy villainous mastermind." At this point, Max has more in common with Ana and Wes than not, so I don't think it's entirely out of the question. Plus, that dream world thing is still super intriguing and I want to see where it goes.
