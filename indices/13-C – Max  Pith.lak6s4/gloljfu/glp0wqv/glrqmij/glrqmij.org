  The simple life was never possible for me. A ‘simple' life required financial stability and free time. Her boss at the bike company had taken that from her when he decided to pay her starvation wages.

Reminds me of [[https://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&id=2012#comic][a SMBC comic]].

  Two days ago, we orchestrated our greatest attack yet against the imperialist butchers of the Principality
#+end_quote

I like how the guy has absolutely zero shame using "imperialist" as an insult right after calling himself "Conquerer of the Nekean Islands, Ilaqua, and the Principality, and Grand Marshal of the Shenti Empire".

  Leo's Place
#+end_quote

Heh.

I wonder if Leo is even aware that the spoiled epistocrat he helped get her status back is the girl who helped crush Commonplace?

#+begin_quote
  Her lieutenants lowered their guns, and stared at her. Then, one of them spoke up. “Ma'am?”

  “I told you,” she said. “‘Max' is fine.”
#+end_quote

Wait, is that a password?

That's so clever if it is.

#+begin_quote
  Max strode to the edge of the room and threw open the curtains, letting in dim light from the streetlamps. From this window as a vantage point, they could see some of the larger streets of Lowtown.

  Even at this late hour, tanks rolled down the boulevards, past storefronts and apartment buildings, accompanied by soldiers and the occasional Guardian. Far more soldiers and firepower than Commonplace had ever gathered in one place.
#+end_quote

Is that really wise, Max? If you and your men can see the soldiers outside, the soldiers outside can see you and your men conspiring around a table.

  “Two weeks ago, national support for Commonplace sat at thirty-one percent,” said Max. “Four hours ago, it sat at fifty-three. Paragon's crackdown. Our revelations about Parliament. They didn't fall on empty ears.”
#+end_quote

Holy shit.

This is a poll filled by people who just learned that their government mind-raped their own parliament, and murdered them when they outlived their usefulness.

Either Paragon poll workers are /really/ good at getting honest answers, or the actual numbers must be even higher, and /almost everyone/ hates the government in place.

#+begin_quote
  “Maybe it's not important, which world is real,” said Max. “The important thing is which world I care about. Even if they're both real. Or if they're both fake.”
#+end_quote

Max is really not thinking through the consequences if both worlds are real. Like, if it is, that means there might be other conduits. It means Paragon might eventually figure out a way to communicate with alternate!Paragon and leak all the intel she knows.

Conversely, if they figure out how to communicate with Maxine's other world, she can start a revolution there too, learning from her previous mistakes (and maybe free herself while she's at it).

(Also, I just realized, Max being split in two worlds gives her kind of an advantage; she has an extra day every day to think about everything she's doing, everything she just did the previous day, etc; when the whole revolution was decided in the span of a few weeks, that's a big advantage; the fact that the doctors force her to recite everything that happened probably helps her structure it too)

#+begin_quote
  Max leaned forward, placed her palms on the woman's ears, and kissed her forehead. “Hope you're ready for war.”
#+end_quote

I'm so happy Max isn't dead.

That woman is a fucking legend.

#+begin_quote
  Max reached into her bag, pulled out a thick piece of bacon, and bit into it. The tastes of salt and fat and pork blossomed in her mouth.
#+end_quote

Yaaaaaay!

First Ana looking in the mirror and seeing a woman, then Wes maybe-quitting alcohol, then this.

This ending arc is weirdly upbeat.
