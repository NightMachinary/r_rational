I love that she's halfway between a mook and the big bad, and still somehow more of a heroic character than the protagonist team. All her efforts were appropriated by tunnel vision the first time around but maybe she'll do better next time.

I also can't wait for her to meet Hira and learn what's going on with him/her.
