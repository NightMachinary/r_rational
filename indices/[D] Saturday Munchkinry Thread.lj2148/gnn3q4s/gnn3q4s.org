*You wake up in Westeros*

(or similar low-fantasy, medieval-ish world).

You are unarmed, naked and alone (assume it is a pleasant summer day, and you are in the middle of safe and pleasant valley). At the moment the realm is relatively at peace. Assume your carry no diseases and are immune to theirs, their language is identical to modern English.

*You gain ONE superpower*: You can infinitely copy an item, provided these conditions:

- the item must be made of wood, or other tree-derived materials. No non-tree derived materials can be included in it, and if some happen by accident, they are not copied

- the item cannot be bigger (mass and size) than you are

- the item must be made by you personally, using only materials and tools found in nature (ie: if you want to whittle a stick using a knife, you must first create a knife from base materials upwards, and at no point accept help or materials made by another human in making that knife or whittling that stick. Taking advice is ok, physical assistance is not).

- you can copy one singular continuous item a second, provided there is enough room for it. To copy an item the original must be in your right hand, the copy appears in your left hand.

Tasks:

1. Survive at least one year.
2. Achieve a living comfort comparable with the one you have now.
3. Take over one of the Seven kingdoms.
4. Take over Westeros (either as a king or a shadow-behind-the-throne).
5. Industrialize Westeros so that by the time you die at least part of it achieved Industrial Revolution.
