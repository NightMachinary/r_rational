You live in a fairy tale-esque setting where the Dark One (a local Satan/Loki analogue) is allowed to punish people who transgress against certain culturally mandated standards of behavior. The severity of punishment scales with the degree of transgression, but does not ameliorate the transgression itself - as long as a person continues to go against the expected behaviors, they continue to be open to bad luck, tricks, sickness, monster attacks, etc. sent by the Dark One as punishment. Knowing transgressions are treated more harshly than unknowing transgressions, but even unknowing transgressions can provoke an initial punishment. It is easy to tell if someone is being punished by the Dark One, and religious professionals have the ability to identify the cause of a curse.

One such standard of behavior has to do with gift-giving: If a free person (not a vassal, a child, a houseguest or a prisoner) is presented with a gift, they are culturally required to accept the gift; to reciprocate with a gift of comparable value; and to refrain from selling, renting or otherwise profiting economically from the gift. The gift-giver is in turn expected to accept (and refrain from profiting off of) the reciprocation-gift and avoid coming into the possession of any physical object which they have gifted away. It is acceptable to re-gift a physical object on to a third party, but not to gift such an object to any prior owner. It is acceptable for subordinate (a vassal, a child, guest or prisoner) to give a gift to one of their superiors (liege, elder, host, jailer) and to expect a reciprocation-gift in return. An oath of vassalage, an unqualified favour or release from either of the same is considered to be a 'comparable' reciprocation-gift no matter what the original gift might have been. The prohibition against using gifts to make a profit apply in full to oaths of vassalage and offered favours, but not to release from the same - if you 'profit' by being released from your duty to pay rents, that doesn't count as 'profit' for the purposes of running afoul of the custom.

It is possible to argue with the Dark One and convince to rule one way or another on ambiguous cases, but the Dark One is a malicious sadist and does not care for justice - it only agrees to serve in this custom-enforcing role because doing so lets it hurt people that it would not otherwise be allowed to hurt. As such, it will always pretend to be swayed by whatever seemingly-plausible, easily-articulable and self-consistent set of standards lets it inflict the greatest amount of suffering through the exercise of its office while still being able to pretend to the Sky Father that it is simply upholding its role as God of Retribution with well-intentioned impartiality. Finally, it should be noted that the Dark One is not exempt from these rules and may be summoned on any number of pretexts, only to be presented with a gift and forced to use its Evil God Powers to provide a comparable gift in return.

- As such an unscrupulous person, what is your best Wicked Plot to abuse the gift-giving rules in order to extract wealth and/or power from the community around you without being exploited in turn? How do you avoid your Wicked Plot being turned around on you by the next person who hears about it?

- As the Dark One, what sorts of dangerous gifts do you offer to witches who summon you? Assume that the Sky Father will not permit you to use your evil magic to give the mortals anything which they have not learned how to make for themselves - no epidemic diseases, strong AI, nanotechnology, etc.

- As an average farmer, how do you avoid getting caught up in weird gift magic curse bargains? Assume that you don't have to carry a gift around with you, but that you do have to set off right away to retrieve and present the gift if you promise one to someone under these rules.
