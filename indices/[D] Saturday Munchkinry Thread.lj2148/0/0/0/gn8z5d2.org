With the Rai Stones idea, I feel like you could probably just put up a stone with the owner's name carved into it as an monument to their honour. This has the added advantage that the stone can't even be re-gifted, since it is far less valuable to someone whose name isn't even on the stone. But there's also probably an upper bound to the stone's value unless you're constructing an actual stone building.

If someone dies with outstanding debt, they likely rise as a frequently tormented ghost who then harasses passers-by into fulfilling their unfinished obligations.
