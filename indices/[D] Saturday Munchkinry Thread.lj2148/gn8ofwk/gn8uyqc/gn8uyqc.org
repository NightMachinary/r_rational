For a unscrupulous person... giving gifts that seem like tiny tokens but are actually worth immense value (made of concealed precious material, useful but hidden magical enchantments, non-obvious high level of craftsmanship, etc.) seems like a clever trick.

You could give the Witches blackmail information. Given that you by your evil nature know gifts that are exchanged and when someone breaks the gift rule (and other rules) you surely know a lot of blackmail worthy material.

For a peasant farmer... one exploit I can think of is a bunch of heavy stones which the entire village agrees have a variety of large values. Kind of like [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rai_stones][Rai Stones]]. Whenever evil noble man tries giving a precious item to an innocent peasant, they return the favor with one of their heavy and totally valuable stones (more specifically, the village as a collective gifts an appropriately “valued” Stone to the peasant who in turns gifts the valuable item to the village, then the peasant gifts the stone to the evil nobleman. The evil nobleman can't refuse the stone. Overtime, the village builds up a collection of stones that are “owned” by evil noblemen serving as a reminder that collective action can overcome the oppression of the nobility. And if any noble tries objecting... they get a extra valuable stone. If the Dark One shows up to complain that stones aren't actually valuable... he gets the most valuable stone, valued at an entire kingdom. As to establishing the stone's value the village could use various tricks... maybe establish that similarly carved but much smaller stones have a certain value related to their carving and weight through actual usage and then have the giant stones get their immense “value” this way. Or build up precedents with less valuable stones? Or use complex financial derivatives? If the stones have to actually be used, they could use fractions of stones as “barter” items internally to establish value that way (never using using the same fraction twice to maximize accumulation of wealth).

Also, obvious exploit... what happens if someone dies, or worse, is murdered? Do outstanding gift obligations get passed on, or fade away, or become Dark Lord fodder? The Village might be in trouble if someone decides killing all of them is a viable solution, but they could setup a nasty revenge like creating a death obligation worth entire kingdoms by giving away their remaining stones in a collective will.
