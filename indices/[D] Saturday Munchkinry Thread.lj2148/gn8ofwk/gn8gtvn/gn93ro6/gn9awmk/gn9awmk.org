“Minor” refers to the fact that the class of effect is limited by what can be induced by surrounding “conditions”... which I suppose under extreme enough conditions ceases to be minor. So I guess not so minor?

If you want free energy... just take coil of wire as the object, move it through a electromagnetic field repeatedly, and then you can make it output unlimited AC electricity.

You need to be directly using the object in some way. So the nuclear power plant is a bit beyond that... so if you want free electricity at industrial scale, turning a giant coil of wire through a magnetic field is your best bet.

The mind control is a solid application I didn't think of... overlap a bunch of minor effects like causing jump scares, helping someone relax, normal hypnosis, vertigo, dizziness, etc into a single object.

Getting unlimited knowledge from a book/laptop is an interesting mind bending application. Depending on how you read the book it might just passively and continuously emit knowledge (related to the books topic), or it might fill your mind with knowledge in response to queries, or some combination of the two.
