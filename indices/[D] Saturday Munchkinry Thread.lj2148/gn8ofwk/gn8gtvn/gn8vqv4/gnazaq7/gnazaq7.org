Is there anything in [[https://irradiate.space/stories/teleportation-circle-installer/][this short story I wrote]] that seems muchkinable to you? It's a DND-style world, with:

- inexpensive mass-production walking buildings
- cheap shaping and casting of stone
- some species with life in the hundreds of years, on the human scale
- recently-adopted (past couple hundred years) standardized currency
- a reliable postal network
- reliable network of teleportation circles, including NTSB-style accident investigations
- ability to teleport mana crystals
