By repeatedly (for several hours) using an object in a particular way while focusing on it, you can grant it minor magical powers related to that usage. These magical powers are generally limited to stuff the object might do normally under particular conditions and the "magic" allows the object to ignore those conditions.

You can share these objects with people and they retain their powers, but powers that require careful intentions or direction might not be reliable for other people. To use an example given below, the knife that blinds people with light may turn on the user and blind them if they aren't careful with it.

- For example, reflect the sunlight off a knife repeatedly, you can allow the knife to emit that same level of light even when not in the sun. If you also reflected the light into someone's eyes, you could further modify this power to allow the knife's emitted light to automatically target people's eyes and temporarily blind them.
- For another example... allowing the knife to repeatedly slip out of and into your hand could give the knife the power to jump a few feet into or out of your hand.
- For a really simple example, have the knife cut smoothly through soft objects like butter or paper for several hours and then you get a knife that can cut through anything like butter or paper.
- Play a particular song on a recorder as someone falls asleep repeatedly, and the recorder becomes able to put people to sleep whenever someone play that song. Actually, you could allow the recorder to play itself, since someone playing it is a condition, but then it would not be controllable by other people.
- A wind suit used in a vertical wind tunnel could allow for upward flight.

So best usages you can think? For reselling for money? For everyday use? For big impact that you couldn't accomplish without the magic?

The single most powerful big impact usage I can think of is divination objects... for example use dowsing rods to find arbitrary things or a particular category of things (if you plan to resell them to other people and want to keep the usage reliable) that you already know where they are, then they gain the power to find things that you don't know where they are.

Edit 1: The object must be directly used by you, ideally something you can wear or carry by hand. Operating a nuclear power plant is too far of a remove. Something big and static but directly muscle powered by you is just within reach of your power (requiring more time of use and getting weaker end results), or something small and handheld but with lots of hidden complex systems, like a phone or laptop is also only just barely within this powers limits (granting a book a knowledge granting power would be faster, easier and more effective than granting the same power to a laptop, but the laptop might make up for it with multiple overlapping and interacting powers).
