How minor are we talking? Because being able to put people to sleep with a recorder or a wingsuit which generates magical upward flight seem to be pushing the definition of minor powers.

Not to mention if these magical powers don't fade, then it seems you have a bunch of ways to generate free energy. The knife is already generating light and the wingsuit produces gravitational potential energy. If you're allowed to do something similar to the knife with solar mirrors or power satellites beaming microwaves to Earth, then that's free solar energy even when they're not in sunlight.

It feels like cheating, but is there anything in your rules which says I can't just run a nuclear power plant for a while and then get energy out of it even when there's no fuel? It's a much bigger scale than upward flight or magical knife sunlight, but I can't see how it's fundamentally different.

It feels like there's a bunch of mind control you could achieve too. Play a horror movie on your phone and then even when your phone's not playing you can scare people. Read some educational materials on your laptop for a few hours and you can keep learning from it even when it's not turned on.
