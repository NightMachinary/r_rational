In the vein of "a knife that cuts", I'd make:

- A pen that communicates
- A clipboard that gathers data
- A stethoscope that measures health, and a ??? that improves it.
- A set of weights that makes you stronger
- A sunlamp that improves mood, and a grow light that grows plants
- An alarm that notifies people and motivates appropriate action
- [[https://youtu.be/aPZ8kEq9nkA?t=20][PPE that protects you]]

As for /obvious/ magic:

- "perpetual motion machines", including self-charging batteries and all other sources of free energy
- storage devices, such as a backpack which fits items and can be carried easily
- A sieve that separates things according to arbitrarily-defined criteria instead of size
- Similarly, a compass or plumbob that points towards arbitrary criteria instead of magnetic fields
- A map which shows the territory
