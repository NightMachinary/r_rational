- <conveys information at an unrealistic speed> by practicing speed reading,
- <is readable by many people simultaneously> by using technology to have several hundred people read it at the same time,
- <convinces people of its contents rapidly> by having people read convincing rhetoric from it,
- <works without seeing the book>, by having people listen to an automated audiobook playing from the ebook device
- <has any information needed at any time>, by loading significant information off of the internet
- <brainwashes people>, by using it as a cult indoctrination tool
