I can't think of names off the top of my head, but I know that I've read a few with more harem-style romances in recent memory. Though they usually skirt the edges of what I'd consider "rational"; rational until it has to do with other people, usually.

That said, if anyone can find fics with poly main characters, I'd love to read them. Part of why these three are poly in the first place is in response to the lack of that, but maube I was just looking in the wrong place.
