I really like Leftover Soup! And the relationship shown in it, while certainly made narratively interesting, isn't actually that idealized. The characters have personal problems, in addition to cute moments, which they mostly resolve through communication. That's... pretty much every successful poly relationship ever.

Hell, that's ever successful /relationship/ ever, full stop.
