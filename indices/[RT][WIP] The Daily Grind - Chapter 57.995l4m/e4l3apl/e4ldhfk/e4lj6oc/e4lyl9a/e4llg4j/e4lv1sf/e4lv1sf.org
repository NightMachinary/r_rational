This has not gone well is a really interesting example, because it's sort of a fake-out harem? Like, almost literally every character that isn't the protagonist is female. I think Arno is the only male character who gets repeat screen time through more than a few chapters. And almost all of those women are described through a very masculine lens; they're attractive, sexualized, and frequently sleep with the protagonist

But the main character is monogamous. And generally pretty chill about it, too. It's not his fault as a character that the author didn't want to write more than one guy.
