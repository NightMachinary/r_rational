The two examples I'd give is "Well this hasn't gone well" over in [[/r/HFY][r/HFY]] and Savage Divinity (which skirts being rational).

Though thinking back on it now, both of these are more harem-esque than an accurate representation of poly-amorous relationships, so I rescind my complaint; as long as it doesn't deteriorate into a harem fantasy.
