I'd suspect that the trust in that particular city's diviners would evaporate quickly, since adventurers make a living listening to local rumors. And while you can't verify an Identify spell on something unknown, checking a diviner's qualifications is as easy as giving her a control group of items.

All in all, I don't see an arms race to the bottom happening among guilds, since they can still compete on reputation. Guild A's lower costs only help them until adventurers start hiring Guild B's diviners exclusively, even if it means traveling to a more distant town.
