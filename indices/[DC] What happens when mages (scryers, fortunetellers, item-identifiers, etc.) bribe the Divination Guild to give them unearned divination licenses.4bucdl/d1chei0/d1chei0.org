/tl;dr:/

When an adventurer brings an unknown magic item or potion to a diviner for identification, or wants a scrying to be done for him, he doesn't just blindly trust that the diviner knows what he's doing. Diviners are licensed by the Divination Guild, which takes money to test aspiring mages on their divination skills.

It takes a long time for a person to gain enough skill to pass a divination exam, and this cuts into profit margins--so the Divination Guild announces that it'll give a bonus to apprentices who pass their exams faster. The apprentices quickly find that they can just bribe (by borrowing against their expected future earnings as licensed diviners) the Master Diviners who make up the Divination Guild in order to get their licenses. Money goes to the Master Diviners taking bribes, to the bankers making loans, and to the thieves and bards facilitating the bribery, as well as to the bribing apprentices who eventually get paid by too-trusting adventurers.

However, this ends badly for the adventurers, who no longer can find any diviners actually capable of casting divination spells...
