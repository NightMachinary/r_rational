Hehe, I giggled a little--this is so India. You go by word of mouth and lean towards private firms/institutions who only hire the real deal. You'll also see external accreditation pop up and for legitimate diviners to go for it in hopes of getting a competitive advantage.

With divination, it might be even simpler--have the diviner predict the result of ten coin flips or something else that's easily testable (depending on the specifics of the magic system in question.) Also, go to practicers who are older, and who went through the accrediting system when it was less corrupt.
