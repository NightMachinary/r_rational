If there's any organization who would be able to look at a person and discern whether they're a diviner or not, it's the Diviners Guild. You might as well try to bribe the temple of Brodin into letting you skip leg day.

Unlicensed or fake-licensed diviners come in three categories: fools, silly enough to pick "diviner" as a con story instead of something safe like "lawyer" or "doctor"; /the real deal/, who can divine the methods of the Guild better than the Guild can divine theirs, and want no part of the institution's control; and the archmagi, who are "diviners" in the same way they are "war-magi" or "astral travellers", because it is necessary for the task at hand, and the Guild can divine what kind of trouble comes from hitting up archmagi for dues.
