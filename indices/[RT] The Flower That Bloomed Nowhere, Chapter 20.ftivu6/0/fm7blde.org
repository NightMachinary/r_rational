I had some trouble writing this chapter, particularly in regards to balancing the exposition with the pace of the fight without making it drag too much. I think it turned out okay?

This story probably suffers as a result of overplanning a bit. Often I have so much I need to convey before certain beats that it can feel like trying to squeeze putty through a keyhole.

As always, general feedback appreciated etc.
