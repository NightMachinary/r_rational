Great chapter. The fight scene was really interesting, I love how they're fighting within these restrictions that were built intentionally by the ironworkers. It's a great concept.

Really curious to learn why utsushikome doesn't have her N resistance. She doesn't expand much on what the magic is actually checking with regards to neurology, but we can bet her lack of resistance has something to do with her disorders.
