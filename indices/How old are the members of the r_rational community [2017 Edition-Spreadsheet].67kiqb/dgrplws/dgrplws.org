  Data will be uglier because some people will look at this and choose just one or two but most won't and will choose several. The sort of person who ignores this will be nonrandom. Going to select several because I think everyone else will.

  I wish more people participated in the biweekly writing challenges; maybe if something was done to lure more people in that would work. In any case, the less people who participate in them, the less attractive they are to participate in.

  I miss being able to just toss out ideas as posts and actively discuss them. I still visit for discussion of various web serials, but a lot of the initial draw of the sub has been lost. The closest thing to what I'm talking about might be the power munchkinry threads on [[/r/parahumans]], where you take a concept, sometimes inane, and run with it to find cool usages and ideas.
