#+begin_quote
  Actually, really easy hack:

  Just find and replace the string with the comma in it with an abbreviated form with no comma. Then you can use comma as a delimiter. Easy!
#+end_quote

Holy Fuck. I think you're right. How dumb am I for not thinking of that! Some CS major I am -_-

Thanks man!
