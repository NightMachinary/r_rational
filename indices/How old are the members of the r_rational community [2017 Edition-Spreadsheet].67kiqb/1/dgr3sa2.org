So here's the spreadsheet! Got some tabs at the bottom where I've created some pivot tables and charts and what not! I also have a chart where all of the comments have been placed into their own little pivot table.

Only issue is formatting for that last section where I asked you guys what your favorite part of the sub was. Because I'm a dumbass, I put checkboxes instead of multiple choice to give you guys a+n illusion of+ choice. And because I'm a super dumbass, I put commas in some of the checkbox answers. So there goes my plan of just splitting them up with commas as a delimiter!

I've changed the questions so that they use hyphens instead of commas in them but any data before row 353, which I've highlighted in green, may not be incorporated into the table I'm planning to make, marking out people's favorites. If any of you guys are excel wizards and have suggestions on how to somehow format the data to be usable in my sheet without deleting any inputs, I'd be very grateful.
