Facebook has an option (enabled by default) to memorialize your account if they find out that you died, so assuming that any of your Facebook friends are IRL friends, one of them would probably click some buttons to tell Facebook that you died with a link to your obituary, and then Facebook would switch your account over, which would /probably/ show up for anyone that you're Facebook friends with, which includes a number of people that frequent this subreddit and would make an announcement (I would probably be that person).

(I had this exact thing happen to me yesterday; an acquaintance from high school died and I found out through the automated systems Facebook has set up.)
