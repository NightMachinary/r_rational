Was sort of joking, but Category 5 Hurricanes shouldn't be underestimated. Even sitting in a somewhat sturdy condo with shutters and lots of food/water, I'd be lying if I didn't say I'm a little worried, and it would suck if I actually do die without being able to finish the story :P Particularly if none of the readers know why it happened and think it was just abandoned.
