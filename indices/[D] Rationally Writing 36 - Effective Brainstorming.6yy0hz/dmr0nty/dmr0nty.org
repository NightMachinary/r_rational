Hey everyone, sorry it's been so long on a podcast episode. Recorded this before August, but was too busy with my license exam then teaching at ESPR to edit it until now. Hope you enjoy it!

(Also if this is the last you hear from me, I may have died tragically in Hurricane Irma. If so, sorry in advance for not being able to finish Pokemon)
