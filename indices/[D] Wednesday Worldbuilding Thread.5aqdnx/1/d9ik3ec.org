Ever since seeing an EcoSphere in an issue of Popular Mechanics decades ago, I've had a sort of fascination with small, closed ecosystems. I've had a few terrariums, but it's really hard to make a terrarium that's properly balanced so that it doesn't require intervention, and even in the ideal it's pretty far from a closed system. Fiction is more aesthetically pleasing than reality anyway; that's why I spent a lot of doodling time mapping out enclosed systems (floating islands, microplanets, cities in a bottle, etc.).

What's the smallest size for functional enclosed societies? [[http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn1936-magic-number-for-space-pioneers-calculated.html#.VBiC_XtDLwo][80 people]] is supposedly enough for ten generations with no genetic defects, assuming that you have some social engineering. But that leaves basically no wiggle room in case of unexpected deaths, and eighty people doesn't seem like enough unless the tech level is really high or really low; a population of eighty seems appropriate to a small Iron Age fishing village on an island or a small space-faring colony whose needs are largely met by automation. I have some question about the inbetween areas of technological development, but historical records aren't a great guide because your average 1600s village would assume some level of trade.

There are obviously different levels of enclosure; if you've got a floating island, there's still interaction with the aerial biosphere and native weather system of wherever it's floating. I know basically nothing about how you would /actually/ set up a bottle city so that biowaste gets turned into food and oxygen levels are balanced against carbon dioxide, I just know that those are things that need to be done (and in space habitat diagrams that I've seen, can be done in a space smaller than a shipping container if you only care about a few people).
