I just looked up some clickbait on "weird things the human body/brain does". Here's some of the more applicable ones:

- Afterimages (negative color images in your eye after looking at a bright light) are a form of postcognition. With magic, you can get afterimages from things you haven't seen.

- Vertigo is from being in an eddy of a mana flow, and the chaotic motion is throwing you off.

- Forgetting why you entered a room is a method of clearing out your short term memory to store the new scrying/clarivoyance you automatically do of your surroundings (unfortunately, with no magic, it just clears your memory without replacing it with anything.)

- Your brain is awful at probability because the (magical) world is awful at probability. Humans perform better at probability calculations in a magical world than naive Bayes does if it doesn't account for the probability bending effects of magic.

- Phantom limbs represent where your spirit/soul is in the real world. They can interact with other spirits, but not with inert matter.
