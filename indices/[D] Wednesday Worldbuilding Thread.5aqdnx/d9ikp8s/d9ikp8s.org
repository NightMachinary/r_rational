Imagine that earth once had magic (and magical creatures), but for underspecified reasons, the magic left. Now, magic is returning, and the magical creatures along with it.

But as it turns out, Humans are magical too-- some of our little ticks and quirks come from our brains trying to invoke magic, but not quite succeeding. For example, the feeling that there's something watching you comes from your brain trying to use a magical danger-sense and recieving a false-positive.

What would be some cool innate abilities for humans to get?

The idea here would be to think of some way to make humans reach some parity on an individual level with fantasy civilizations (think dwarves, fae, giants), but still leaving humans bad enough at magic that, combined with technology, we wouldn't just steamroll over a bunch of medieval-stasis type kingdoms (or whatever.)

We wouldn't have access to any sort of magic system, though; that would be restricted to some other species, so technology doesn't steamroll them immediatelly.
