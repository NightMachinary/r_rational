So, when you say "now", do you mean, like... /now/ now? Because technology has been just stupidly overpowered since at least World War I. Honestly, if you kitted out an army of elves with circa-1500 gear, each one twice as good at everything as the best human Olympic athlete, supplemented with a magical communication network and magical artillery, with a full battalion of dragons, and you set that army against Napoleon, I'd expect the elves to be speaking French before the end of the decade. The sorts of magic you'd need to overcome our technological advances wouldn't let you look anything like a medieval-stasis kingdom. If you want us to be balanced, then it's probably not a great idea to give us both magic /and/ machine guns.

Unfortunately, I'm not very good at the sort of free association that would help with the question you actually seem to be interested in, but I hope you get interesting suggestions.
