Speaking as a former believer in pseudoscience, debunked ideas that retain popularity are a gold mine for this universe. One of the main reasons I originally got into New Age spiritualism, ESP while meditating, and reiki healing was because something about them felt fundamentally correct, like a world with those thing was one that intuitively made sense. After discovering rationality I have since backpedaled on my claims, of course, and now side with the skeptics.

In this universe, the reason humans would have believed in things with no scientific basis is because our predisposition towards magical thinking was a survival mechanism. However, when we made the cultural transition from revering the supernatural to trying to understand and control it, the supernatural faded. Skepticism probably shouldn't be a form of anti-magic, but the trend of humans towards thinking more scientifically even pre-Enlightenment should have something to do with the backstory.

In the distant past, humans had so little knowledge of or control over their environment that we had to have blind faith in forces beyond their understanding. As we survived and learned, however, we began to question our old ways even if we didn't abandon them completely. Religion was institutionalized because it was logical for gods greater than us to be the same everywhere on Earth, people claiming to possess magical abilities gained high status in society for their apparent service, mystical artifacts were always incredibly valuable, and monsters were legally hunted down to be punished for their local crimes.

That is largely the western cultural perspective, though, which emphasized individualism and rewards the exceptional. Eastern cultures were all about collectivism and recognized no difference between the magical and mundane, mages were as likely to run businesses as fight evil. The perspective there was one where the universe was subtly manipulated by supernatural forces, with their own bureaucratic institutions, who chose to share their secrets with those who met their qualifications and would work against any who displeased them including governments.

Sorry that my response has been so abstract and I haven't given you any specific examples, but I just love the premise you've concocted and had to share my thoughts. I REALLY want to see what sort of story you end up telling.
