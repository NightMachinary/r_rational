A bit of a case of [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeurodiversityIsSupernatural][Neurodiversity is Supernatural]] but synesthesia could be an uncommon but natural talent for seeing the shape of magic. Each word/sound/letter/color has an effect on local magic flowing through it. Most of the time it has some random innocuous effect that doesn't amount to anything (like light or radio being refracted or reflected in different ways by various objects), but if you combine them into the right combination (like an incantation, or inscribed rune), you get a useful effect. Synesthetes can see this effect (and as a result are better at discovering new spells/inscriptions) but because there is no magic it gets mismapped in their head as some other sensory effect.
