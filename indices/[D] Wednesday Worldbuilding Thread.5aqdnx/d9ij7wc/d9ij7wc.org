Hello. This is my first time trying this.

I have a rather well worked out setting in mind, which I plan to use as the basis for a player quest on sufficient velocity.

Here's the link to what I'm trying to do:

My current main concern is that I do not know how to push potential players towards following a certain plotline. There are loopeholes, I discovered, which could allow the player to exploit the 'tutorial' part of the setting without ever taking a step in the real world.

The setting is called ElectroSphere and its a post-human, post-material, approaching post-technological singularity where about ten duodecillion humans live in a structured electron shell bound between the gravity of an Earth-sized neutron star and the electrons' own self-repulsion.

The player is supposed to wake up with no memory of previous events, a small toolkit of programs and helper-bots, a timer counting down from 3 seconds and a cryptic message.

Ask below for more about the setting, the plot I'm trying to play through and suggestions on how you tried handling this sort of problem.
