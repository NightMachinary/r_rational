So the tutorial is just a dream to help demonstrate the mechanics of the world? What's the problem with just having it end? Need to pass certain milestones in order to learn what you want?

Can you just introduce artificial conflict to push them to progressing? If it's a dream or something have some force decaying reality behind them, forcing them on, representative of them gradually waking up or the kind.
