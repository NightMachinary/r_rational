The inhabitants of electrosphere live at different frequencies.

Public servers render people at a Megahertz: 1000000 seconds simulated for 1 second of real time. Private servers offer different frequencies. The richest have access to Gigahertz, 1000 times faster than the rest. They have access to their own slices of reality The poorest can sell their simulation time and live at 1k or less. Blanksleep is a method of time travel, where you are rendered more slowly than reality, and costs very little.

The protagonist wakes in a state of 12GHz, inside a public server. Everyone else seems motionless and unresponsive. The players learns a bit about the world before their special status ends. If they learn too much, they might exploit their situation without bothering to follow the trail of clues I laid out.
