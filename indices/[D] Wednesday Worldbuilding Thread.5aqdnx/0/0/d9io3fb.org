Deja vu (the generally false feeling that you're experiencing something you've experienced before) as a 'false positive' on innate ability to be aware of magical memory tampering? Perhaps 'elves' (or whoever) mainly were potent due to secrecy abilities and the capability to conceal their cities, lay false memories, strike then retreat beyond retaliation, etc, and 'I think I've experienced this before' comes from innate attempts to pierce this? Yes, I'm cribbing from The Matrix and 'They Changed Something!'.
