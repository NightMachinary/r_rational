Dreaming was originally an autonomous and un-controllable low fidelity scrying of the future, intending to prepare you for events before they happened. In cases that there were blind spots the ancient human brain used already stored knowledge instead.

Modern day human brains have been operating for a long time on the assumption that the whole world was warded from scrying, only preparing us based on knowledge we actually already have and vague predictions of the future.

Working as intended this would manifest in vague ideas about notable events in the near to medium term future, and feeling as though you've practiced important tasks once or twice before.
