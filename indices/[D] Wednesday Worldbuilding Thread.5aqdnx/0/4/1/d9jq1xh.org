I think you're a little TOO optimistic here.

Firstly: communications. If you have 30000 guys with 1800 tech versus 10000 guys with 1800 tech PLUS wireless communications, the 10000 guys with (magitech) raio win almost every time.

Secondly: Just HOW powerful is this "magical artillery"? Is it more Napoleon-level, or WWI level? If it's even Crimean-War level, the Napoleonic army probably loses unless it has a huge numbers advantage.

Thirdly: Napoleonic armies don't have good AAA. Depending on how tough the dragons are, and what weapons they carry, they might have the potential to cause massive direct damage, ON TOP of the advantage provided by aerial recon.

The point where technology starts allowing you to TRULY blast a medieval army to bits with minimal effort comes in the late 18th century. (See: Battle of Omdurman, the entire second half of the Anglo-Zulu war, etc.)
