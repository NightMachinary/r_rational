Indeed, a napoleonic army would struggle against an elf army as I described, and victory is not assured. I agree that winning isn't a virtual certainty until later. I meant that more as the earliest point that it is reasonable to argue that technology matches most magics that neither cause nor require an industrial revolution. If the elves had a good magic-industrial complex with theater-spanning communications, and a modern howitzer in every hand, and mature air support doctrines, they'd win against a napoleonic army, sure. But those magical innovations are exactly the things that would transform their economy and culture to be incompatible with anything like our middle ages.
