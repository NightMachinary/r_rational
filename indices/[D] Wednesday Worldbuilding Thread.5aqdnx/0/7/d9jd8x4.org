I thought up a couple innate bits of innate magic a while ago for humans in a little worldbuilding project. The first one was a passive immune system buff, effectively the magic tries its best to help it along and suppresses the symptoms while sick. I figured it was pretty fair. You'd still feel the illnesses and the worst of them would still likely spell death, but a case of the common cold could come and go without much of an effect.

But the other idea I had was for humans to not starve. The idea is that the magic takes the food you just ate, your immune system, and if they're not compatible, bridges the gap. We don't eat grass, but if you had this magic you could eat grass and your passive magic would try and squeeze nutrients out of it anyhow. You'd still find it disgusting, since your taste buds still prefer 'edible' food, and any magic spent on digesting grass is magic not spent on buffing your immune system, but what's notable is that your magic bridges the gap. It doesn't just squeeze nutrients out of the grass for you, it slowly alters you to be able to handle the grass easier and use up less magic.

The farthest-reaching versions of this passive magic have humans able to survive, in a miserable existence, eating nothing but the sand of the desert or simply drinking seawater. Over time, however, the passive magic that keeps you alive would adapt you to this type of food, matching the composition of your body and the mechanics of your digestive system to the food you eat to minimize strain on your magic. People who eat nothing but sand are adapted by their magic to have drier bodies, with cells formed more and more out of the chemicals that make up sand. People who only drink seawater slowly become more and more water-based on every level of their biology. With a generous interpretation of this adaptation effect, this is how demihumans came to exist in my world. Some people would go off to a hostile environment and, in order to survive on the 'food' there, adapt to better match the 'food'.
