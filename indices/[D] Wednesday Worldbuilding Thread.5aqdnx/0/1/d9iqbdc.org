  But as it turns out, Humans are magical too-- some of our little ticks and quirks come from our brains trying to invoke magic, but not quite succeeding. For example, the feeling that there's something watching you comes from your brain trying to use a magical danger-sense and recieving a false-positive.\\
  What would be some cool innate abilities for humans to get?

Aside from the obvious things like prayer (alter the odds of an event occurring by a measurable amount with sufficient meditation) and dreaming (which could enable clairvoyance, telepathy, and/or future-telling) --- I would particularly add enhancements to the placebo effect, allowing a human to enchant anything edible for the purpose of curing the ailments of others.
