Hmm, so the problem is guiding them along the path without letting them realise they're living at 12000x speed? Unfortunately doing the latter should be tricky, even at that level over a timespan of a few hours it should be clear that things are moving, just incredibly slowly. You'd need to keep them moving so they can't stay still long enough to notice.

I presume the clues are related to whatever mystery trigger ends the effect? Hmm. There's limits, you can make the clues more obvious, but in a quest people will often try to explore. What it really sounds like you need is a method of preventing exploitation of the situation, or at least pushing on a time limit to guide them along the path. Are there any negative consequences of existing at 12000x speed on a public server? Seems like the kind of thing law enforcement would be after, watching for people running at higher speeds as naturally doing so would greatly aid lawbreaking efforts.
