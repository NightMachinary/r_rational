The 12000x speed is one of the clues required to understand the situation the player is in. It lasts for about an hour in subjective time, or about 0.3 seconds of public time.

In Electrosphere, calculation power is simulation time is money. You can be rich if you have a lot of currency to your name, if you can live for a certain amount of years, or if you can command a certain amount of calculation time from a server.

The hour is so that the players can learn about their inventory, the value system, and the first clues that will hook them up to the main plot's mystery. If the hour elapses and they haven't done anything except wander around aimlessly, they will find themselves looking like a drunk homeless mute and dumb man stumbling around at rush hour. Arrested quickly, and find themselves unable to answer the police's questions.

The player is supposed to find out rather early that the hour they spent was very costly. It was paid for by someone who wanted them to circulate through a public server without being noticed. To escape? To exfiltrate? The other clues will help them.

So far, I think the solution is making the 'helper bots' much more vocal, by offering help and asking questions rather than just answering requests.
