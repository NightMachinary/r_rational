Make sure you stay around to stave off heat death of the universe.

Is the overheating an upkeep cost (such that you can do short bursts of change cheaply) or a one-time cost (such that you can highly stack the effect on the area you're in)? Do changes persist after you leave the vicinity?

Can you have heart surgery to slice off a bit of heart, and distribute minuscule amounts over a large area that you want to be able to affect? (Test first whether the affectable area is any point that is within 2 meters of any part of your heart.) Similarly, extract some unneeded tissue and try to grow some tumors out of it, so there is more body to spread the heat over.

For completeness' sake, check whether there's a lightspeed delay.

There ought to be some configuration of matter, perhaps some crystal, that visually reacts to your influence. That would be useful for a [[http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/silent-image][Silent Image]] effect. Translating thoughts to video is useful for at least:

- Art. Animating something no longer requires the, I'm guessing seconds per frame, a professional animator requires in the best case. If you're good at it you could just get a television channel where all you do is read books live and supply imagery.
- Teaching. You could probably just plop down next to some uncontacted tribesman and /show/ him you two standing there, then zoom out to find that the Earth is a giant rock hurtling around the Sun.
- Anything you might want pen and paper for, except it's instantaneous. Any geometers in here salivating at the thought?

Similarly, you could set up a mind -> computer interface with your power's bandwidth.
