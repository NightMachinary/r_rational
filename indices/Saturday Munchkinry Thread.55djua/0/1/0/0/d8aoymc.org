Funny story about the fantastic feeling mundane. A few years ago I was in Australia. I made a blog post about how I had just paid my electric bill on my phone from the opposite side of the world. I got a response saying "uh, yeah? Welcome to the 1980s. 1950s if we count wire transfers." It was the most oblivious thing anyone had said to me in a long time.
