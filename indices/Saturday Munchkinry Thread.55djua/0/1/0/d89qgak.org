As much as I love the idea of stories like Twilight and True Blood being vampire propaganda, I do think the public consciousness processes fiction differently enough from nonfiction that it would present a problem. As much as we empathize with vampires, we still recognize their condition as metaphorical rather than literal. If the people vampires were killing were no longer fictional, I doubt we'd take it well.

The key driver behind fantasy stories is escapism. We want to enter a world unlike our own and bring ourselves back to reality afterward. How does our psychology respond to fantasy becoming reality, even if it's a fantasy we like? The only example I can think of is that despite the modern miracles of science and technology, there's still an attitude of I Want My Jetpack. The fantastic ends up feeling mundane.
