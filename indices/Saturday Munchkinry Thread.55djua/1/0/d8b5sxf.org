Hmmm, there's got to be a way to make lots of energy from this power. If it can break through any barrier by continuously growing in strength, then if we can absorb energy from it breaking through (just use it as a super-strong lever) we'll have a good source of free energy.

There's a lot that can be done in propulsion somehow.
