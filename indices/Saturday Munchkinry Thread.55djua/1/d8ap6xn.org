Power:

You can straighten thread. It only works on a particular brand and thickness of thread. Limits:

- When you activate the power, all of the thread must be within 100m of your center of mass.
- Any part of a straightened thread that leaves your 100m AoE will go limp again, and re-straighten when brought back in.
- The effect lasts for as long as you concentrate and up to 10min afterwards if you want it to.
- The power works by making all parts of the thread invulnerable. (Cannot be cut, burned, etc.) Immediately after making it invulnerable it makes all parts of the thread repel all other parts with a force equal to the cube of the distance. This means that you can end up with a knot pulled incredibly tight while the thread is overall straight.
- The thread will never harm you. If it hits your skin / hair / etc its momentum vector is instantaneously reversed so it bounces away. If you hold it in your cupped hands and straighten it it will simply vibrate back and forth furiously.
- Aside from the above, the thread will straighten regardless of what's in the way. Assume that the force involved will simply keep increasing until it breaks through any barrier.

(If this power sounds familiar it's because I literally wrote a book on it.)
