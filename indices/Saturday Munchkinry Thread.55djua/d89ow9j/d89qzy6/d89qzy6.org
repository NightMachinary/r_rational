Offer to make the politicians into vampires in exchange for their loyalty. They get powers and immortality, and the only cost is they have to prey upon the common people, so business as usual. Since most of them have no qualms about pushing legislation in exchange for personal gain, it will be easy to get a majority to agree. Actually, you don't even have to ask for anything in return. If they are vampires themselves they will automatically pursue pro-vampire legislation just out of self interest. Regardless of whether they make some sort of committee that maintains the secrecy of vampires, or they make vampires popular or a protected class, I expect them to do a fine job of it. Politicians can do anything IF it benefits themselves.
