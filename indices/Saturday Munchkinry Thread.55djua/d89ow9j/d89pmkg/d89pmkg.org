Start a campaign to prepare for your eventual reveal. Make vampire stories popular, make vampires sympathetic tortured figures deserving redemption, and make vampires fascinating and interesting to everyone. When love for fictional vampires are at their peak, do a grand reveal where you minimize the scary aspects of yourselves, and emphasize the beneficial parts where you are /useful/ towards human society and can provide an irreplaceable service. Can't think of anything, but vampire abilities are so varied that something can be used for something.
