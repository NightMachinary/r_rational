I think a lot of this is going to depend on what their powers are and how they work. If they have mind control then they can easily just seize power for themselves, same thing goes if they can control new vampires they sired. How feeding and turning works will also make a difference; if you can easily feed on humans without endangering them or turning them then you are going to find it much easier to have good PR.\\
Another somewhat important detail is how much does power increase with age? If the only increase in power is via the experience you gain, then older vampires won't be able to stay in control over the vampire world (unless they have supernatural control over their childre. Of course if there's no large scale vampire government then the masquerade never would have held up this long anyway..
