What happens to the air?

I assume jogging in place doesn't work, so I'd do a lot of running in circles.

Obviously I'm going to need to be at least a marathon-level athlete, but thankfully I can also train absurdly quickly. Buy lots of audiobooks, download lots of podcasts, and practice reading as I run without crashing into things. (Actually I already have practice at that last one, so get back into the habit.) Hopefully my lifespan is extended, but if not, at least I'm not /wasting/ huge chunks of my life.

Combat - blades and explosives work OK while running. "You can manipulate objects as you normally could" - to what extent are they immune to damage, then? A punch doesn't work, but what about a stick? A sword? An electrified sword? Explosives are probably ideal-est, toss them in place and then run to safety.

... I could wear a computer on my back. This is useless in a combat situation but still neat, assuming my clothes aren't frozen.

Combat, combat ... toss gasoline + match on someone, toss caltrops in their vicinity, throw paint in their eyes. If I miss, eh, I have multiple tries. Presumably my clothes move with me, but there are no chemical reactions for stuff I pick up, so in theory I could smear metaphorical-or-literal FOOF around people with my bare hands (although only if I can reach a LOT of water to rinse them with - does swimming count?) Hell, I could assemble a critical mass of plutonium near them.

The biggest issue is space. Confined space, all my best options will kill me as well; confined enough, I can't run at all! Stuff for tunneling etc. is heavy and hard (though not impossible) to use while running in circles near a wall. Does spinning count as movement? The weight is a bigger issue here. Assuming I don't age a small tool might do, but that's a big "if" - probably the same answer to that as whether I get hungry, so check that first.
