#+begin_quote
  Is it possible to, while running, aim and fire?
#+end_quote

Fire, yes. Aim, no. You could /probably/ hit the broad side of a barn from the inside, but I wouldn't bet on anything better than that. Of course, you could just run right up to someone and shoot them from one foot away.

#+begin_quote
  And keep running during the recoil?
#+end_quote

Yes. Recoil isn't very strong. In terms of actual force, it is roughly equivalent to catching a baseball.
