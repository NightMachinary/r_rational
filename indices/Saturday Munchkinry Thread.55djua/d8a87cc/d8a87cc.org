You have the power to cause a timestop, but only when running. If you slow down too much, time goes back to normal. You can manipulate objects as you normally could. To the outside world, it appears as if the objects teleported into what position you put them in. If you punch a person, it will appear to them as if their head just teleported into a new position; this is disorienting, but not strictly damaging.

How do you use this in combat? The fact that you have to run to maintain the timestop seems like a big problem.
