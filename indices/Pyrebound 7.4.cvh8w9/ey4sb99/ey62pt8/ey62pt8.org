Strictly speaking, he might have preferred an equal-temperature cauldron of something with a higher specific heat than water. If you can come up with a plausible reason why they would have such a thing handy at that place, in that time, I might feel compelled to swap it in.

EDIT: Possibly not, now that I think it over. The interaction between physics and magic is a ticklish business. I may have to ask my science consultant.

SECOND EDIT: Science consultant (meaning "longsuffering friend of mine with a BS in Astronomy") confirms that a material with higher specific heat would have been more valuable. Now I just need to find out why they'd have a giant pot of (consults Wiki's list of specific heat capacities) ammonia, I guess.
