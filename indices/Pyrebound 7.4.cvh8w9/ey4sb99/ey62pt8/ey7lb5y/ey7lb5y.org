Is it heat, or the symbolic and physical connection to the suns lifegiving energy?

That is, the fire burning wood, coming from trees, nurtured by the light of our sun, with the broth having plants grown under the suns light, both bringing a connection to the life giving properties that the pyre channels and the haranu (probably?) looks for?

Plus the only alternative to food I could see would be clothes washing or something, and i am not sure that wash water would be hotter than soup.
