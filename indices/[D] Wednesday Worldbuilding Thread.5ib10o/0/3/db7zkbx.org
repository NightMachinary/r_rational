An upload running at about 1000x speed can spend a figurative year researching one person - their likes, dislikes, what they'll buy, what they won't - and designing the perfect advertising campaign to appeal to /that exact person/ inside of a single eight-hour workday. Since this costs one point eight million dollars, it'll only be used when there is a good chance that the customer will spend enough to make the company a profit of /more/ than one point eight million dollars; therefore, there will be a whole new type of super-targeted advertising intended for the super-rich.

This upload, spending a year analysing a single person, is going to need to take the occasional break. Rest and recuperate a bit. Regain some mental energy. Which means entertainment. Music, films, games, enough to last a year, will need to be included to get the best work out of the upload.

Penny-pinching CEOs might scorn the cost of giving their 1000x uploads the very /newest/ movies. These CEOs tend to get sulky uploads.

Other CEOs have an arrangement with movie houses to get certain movies a few days before the official release date, to give to their 1000x uploads. This does wonders for employee morale.

It also means that almost every movie has spoilers out on the net two or three days in advance. The film industry is choosing to see this mainly as free advertising.

It /also/ means that several movies have been leaked to the net well before their official release. The uploads responsible were immediately excluded from the early viewing list, and are mostly still in court arguing the case.
