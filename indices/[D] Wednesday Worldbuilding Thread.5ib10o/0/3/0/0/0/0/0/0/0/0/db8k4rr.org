Hmmmm. Well, if it's just a temporary upload to create a spur, then the super-rich guy can keep the upload on servers on his estate, not connected to the Internet or any other network, with all necessary data on hard drives attached to the server, and all assets held in the name of the still-living meatbag body... then the upload isn't super-rich, it's just a slave that /really/ understands how the boss thinks.
