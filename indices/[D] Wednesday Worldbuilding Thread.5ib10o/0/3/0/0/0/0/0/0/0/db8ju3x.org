As of the present in this work, anti-Skynet computational-arms limitation treaties have resulted in all known clusters of uploads living under what's effectively slavery. If there are super-rich uploads, their servers are evading some pretty Orwellian surveillance.

(I'm hoping to insert a few lines of dialogue about how people are getting used to the idea of immortal people, but if they thought people could be immortal /and/ rich then no number of security guards could keep the data-centres from being burned to the ground.)
