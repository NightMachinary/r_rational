I'm going to assume that uploads have been around long enough for an initial process of weeding and evolution to have been finished; maybe that sort of surprise wasn't uncommon in the first few months, but then when that upload kept getting one-star ratings while others got five-star ones, the upload who couldn't hack this particular methodology focused on other sorts of business plans they were more compatible with.
