It's an interesting idea, but I'm afraid that it doesn't quite fit well with my overall plans for this particular story. More specifically, as part of my "a future I wouldn't want to live in" goal, I'm trying to apply as much Moloch as I can without actually referring to it by name, and within the bounds of the general existence of Eutopia at The Geysers, and while trying to write "It's just like tomorrow, except..." instead of "It's the strange and wonderful future!".
