I have a kind of weird idea for a consequence of this. The race to run uploads faster has actually resulted in the physical world being too slow to keep up with them. It's still good for society to have engineers creating new designs at thousands or millions of times the normal rate, but physically building all that stuff before it is rendered obsolete by new designs is impractical. Replacing and recycling technology constantly just isn't that profitable.

As a result, the a lot of upload labor is spent producing immaterial goods and services, such as apps and entertainment. Economic growth is regulated so well so quickly by accelerated uploads that progress is all but guaranteed, so time and money are being invested in industries with more uncertainty just because there are no other options for companies to make more money than they're already expected to.

This means that consumer culture has expanded dramatically among both normal humans and uploads. Everyone has so much time and money on their hands they're are just looking for something to do, and producers have to put more stuff out faster to keep up with them. People could do more productive things instead, but everything is already so efficient and continuing to rise predictably that there's no much gain to be had from doing more.

Basically, we end up with the world of 15 Million Merits from Black Mirror. Abuses of power may be less common due to better regulation, but there's still the fundamental problem of consumerism. The best and brightest among us have built the best world they can for us and it's still getting better, but when progress can't be sped up any further what do we do with all our free time?
