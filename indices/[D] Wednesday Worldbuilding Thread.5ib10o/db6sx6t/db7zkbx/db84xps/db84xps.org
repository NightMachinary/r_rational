Since, according to my research, some geothermal power can be supplied at half the cost of standard grid power, this also suggests that Eutopia may have an additional niche, studying people who only provide $900k-$1.8M of profit in sales, in addition to $1.8M+.

I can also foresee the possibility of a Red Queen's Race, as various super-rich individuals hire their own fast-running uploads to act as equivalents to present-day computers' anti-malware software: running interference, acting as filters, and generally making the analysts' jobs harder.

Another thing the fast-running uploads could use to entertain themselves: other uploads that are being run at the same speed, at the same time. A rather small community, all told, but even a virtual hamlet is probably better for most uploads' sanity than complete isolation. (Either that, or the uploads that end up getting selected to be run at such speeds will be ones with a natural propensity to the hermit's life.)

Another thing fast-running uploads can do: Nina Paley put together "Sita Sings the Blues" pretty much on her own, with around 9,400 hours of work. The tools available to the uploads will probably be enough to let them put together photo-realistic movies on any topic, and at least some of them will be developing narrative skills to make decent products; which could imply that anyone who wants to drop $10 million could have a custom movie that would be considered a blockbuster in today's market, within a single day. Now /there's/ something that'll /really/ upset the movie industry...
