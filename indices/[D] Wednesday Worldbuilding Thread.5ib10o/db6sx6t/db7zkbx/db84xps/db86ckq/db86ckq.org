  I can also foresee the possibility of a Red Queen's Race, as various super-rich individuals hire their own fast-running uploads to act as equivalents to present-day computers' anti-malware software

  Another thing the fast-running uploads could use to entertain themselves: other uploads that are being run at the same speed, at the same time.

Um. So.

The other uploads that are running at the same time as the analysts are the filters. (For cost reasons, and since the super-rich individual doesn't know when the analyst will be running, the filter may only be running at 100x speed - most of the time - but /continually/ at that speed, with the ability to occasionally burst to 1000x or even 10 000x if necessary)

Both analyst and filter need to be connected to the Internet - pretty much continuously - to access the data needed for their job. Which means they're connected to the far-future equivalent of Reddit, or discussion boards.

There are probably discussion boards dedicated to the super-fast, threads which jump from zero to a thousand posts in mere minutes and it turns out to be two people having a conversation. (Talking to normal-speed individuals is just so very, very /slow/ in comparison. Talking to a merely 100x sped-up individual is slightly annoying).

Which means that the analyst and the filter working against him are probably spending a portion of their off-time chatting about irrelevancies on some obscure internet forum. (They're certainly /not/ talking to their respective employers - the guys are just so /slow/).

And since they're talking mainly with each other, they will sympathise more with each other than with their respective employers...

I can easily imagine one analyst/filter team deciding to simply flip a coin - heads, the analyst gets the right data and makes a decent targeted advert with the help of the filter; tails, the analyst deliberately takes the wrong info and makes a terrible presentation (again, with the help of the filter) and they spend the rest of their time chatting and playing games against each other (chess, anyone?). You could get a whole Romeo and Juliet story in that space, easily...
