  The trunk copy gets the benefit of the payments for work he never actually had to do
#+end_quote

Further complication - there's the sort of mind that will try this, and then get very surprised when the spur copy decides that if it's just going to get deleted anyway, it's going to eat, drink and be merry and not bother with work for money it'll never see. And will do this with the main copy paying for the power to run it.

And then, sometimes, this sort of mind will buy a virtual torture chamber - the spur copy can either do the work or have a /really/ bad time, let's see if this motivates the stupid thing.

And then he'll be very surprised one day to find himself waking up to find a notice that says "You are the spur copy. Now get to work, you lazy bum, or the torture chamber activates in ten... nine..."

  Put another way, that Romeo and Juliet might have both known they were going to suicide before they ever met.

Ah, but they now also both know that their main copies are probably compatible, and likely (unless they're in torture chambers) wish their main branch to be happy, so they might point their main branches to certain email addresses...
