One further complication of this particular scenario: uploads who are willing to make "spur" copies of themselves, specifically in order to perform a task and then be securely deleted. The trunk copy gets the benefit of the payments for work he never actually had to do, the client gets the benefit of increased privacy, and the spur copy gets the relatively minor but possibly more-than-zero benefit of knowing they're improving the station of their trunk copy (and all copies deriving therefrom).

Put another way, that Romeo and Juliet might have both known they were going to suicide before they ever met.
