In [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jPU6QKEohcrw6l6O3SxorIxf2Tnq54h36LtQO6Qv86w/edit][Extracts]], I've been writing some economic worldbuilding notes today. Can you think of any interesting extrapolations or consequences that might not be obvious?

  ... the cost of running an upload at realtime or slower is dominated by the cost of the RAM required to store everything, and with the standard accounting practice of setting computer-hardware depreciation to 55% per year, that works out to a cost of roughly 11,000 bucks per upload per objective year. Which has just dropped below the modern Western nations' poverty line, meaning that since we can't organize for higher wages, it's generally cheaper to pay for an upload than to hire a bio-human for any job that can be done by someone not physically present. Which, given how clever humans are at finding ways to save money, is now most jobs. Which means that us uploads are the obvious cause for the massive unemployment levels to be found just about everywhere, and imply that I'm unlikely to find any significant political support amongst the (formerly) working class - though there are some exceptions, in groups demanding that people who hire us uploads should be taxed severely enough to make hiring humans more economical. Or, put another way, same usual higgledy-piggledy mess, slightly revised gameboard. If it weren't for the universal basic incomes (more delicately called "negative income taxes"), and the fact that the governments have been clamping down on upload populations under the rubric of public safety, I suspect the normal political processes would have been tossed aside entirely in favour of violent revolution. But things are still drunkenly tottering on.

  Running an upload at more than around 100 times realtime speed, the costs are dominated by the electricity required to run the CPUs, and are roughly linear. For servers located where power costs $100 per megawatt-hour, running an upload at 1000 speed for one objective year costs about $1.8 million - and running it at a million times is closer to $1.8 billion. For servers located where electricity is available at half that cost, the costs are nearly halved. Which explains why Eutopia's server farms are physically located in a place called "The Geysers", a literal hotbed of cheap geothermal power. Many other countries, without access to similar cheap renewables, have to burn dirty coal by the ton to have a chance of matching Eutopia's productivity-per-external-dollar, and the various geoengineering projects to reduce the effects of global warming bring that cost right back up.

  Mind you, that economic advantage isn't unlimited - it only extends to the 3,000 MegaWatts of generating capacity that's been built here, and if Eutopia ever needs more power than that, it has to be imported through the standard grid at standard grid rates. Still, with 3,000 megawatts of power, and CPUs capable of 4.5e14 operations per joule, and 1e18 operations to provide an upload with one second of existence, some basic math indicates that Eutopia could use up to 2.6e14 joules per day to provide up to 1,354,166 subjective days for all its uploads, each day. Not that it does, usually; we're not the only project bidding for the power generated here, and due to politics, the budget available to be spent for us on power is only a tiny fraction of the overall economic benefit we provide to our host nation. It would cost something like $1.3 billion, just for the power, to run Eutopia at full capacity for a year.
