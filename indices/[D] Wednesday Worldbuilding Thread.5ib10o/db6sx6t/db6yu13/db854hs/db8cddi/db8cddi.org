I am stretching the truth at bit of how economic incentives work. My basic idea is that the Bayesian Critical Path has resulted in a planned economy that predictably produces growth and prosperity, but businesses are still looking for ways to make more money so they invest the rest of their budget in frivolous consumerism.

I've based this around the idea that with uploads in accelerated time and guaranteed incomes, the world is essentially on autopilot. Everyone still has work to do to keep civilization running and growing, but the Critical Path has mapped it all out for them in advance so they know exactly what's going to happen based on what they do.

In reality, of course, economics has far too much uncertainty for this to happen, there's always some inefficiency that could be rectified, and something novel be created anytime. This scenario assumes that progress has been sped up to as fast as it can possibly go, so everyone is just waiting for utopia to get here and doesn't know what do with themselves in the meantime.

It's a world where capitalism has been perfected to the point where it could easily be called socialism, but people still have the drive to pursue selfish desires even though they have been all but guaranteed to them. You could just work harder, but you don't really need or want to, so instead you consume frivolous good and services while companies produce the same because they have no direction.
