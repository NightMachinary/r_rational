I think the idea that republics are based on the threat of armed rebellion is a bit overstated. At least in American political history, republicanism was more about ensuring that no authority should become so powerful that it can't be held accountable, but that the transfer of power should still take place peacefully within a larger legal framework.

I do like the idea of nations arming for a war that hasn't happened yet but their projections indicate is coming eventually. It's actually my headcanon for Eclipse Phase that every military in the world was trying to reach the singularity first in case anyone else did, so the military-espionage-industrial complex was turned into hive minds called TITANs (Total Information Tactical Awareness Network).

The only problem is that I'm not sure how you make a conflict of values interesting if it's based purely on logic. If any party is willing to resort to violence and will escalate to total war if necessary, then you have no choice but to respond in kind. I think a more interesting question is what do you do with all the biological workers that uploads are rendering obsolete?
