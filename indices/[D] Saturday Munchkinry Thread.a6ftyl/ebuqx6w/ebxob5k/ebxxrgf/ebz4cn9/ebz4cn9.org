Right , forget the qm bit I was thinking about a different kind of loop.

About optimization processes lets say I hock up my computer to a source of randomness that changes each instance of the loop, and use it to turn on its webcam if the number it gets its not a prime factor of a large integer.\\
The universe would loop until I got the correct number of the camera malfunctioned or something else.\\
Or you can just use it as an outcome pump([[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4ARaTpNX62uaL86j6/the-hidden-complexity-of-wishes]])directly, It just has the same dangers.

What repeated time looping does is basically find a combination of the random variables of the universe that makes me avoid the camera.\\
The universe just resets until something happens that makes me avoid the camera.\\
(I call this an optimization process )

Exploiting it is a question of ensuring outcomes where I'm not seen by the camera are outcomes I like.\\
If I let it run too much it will just kill me or make the cameras malfunction.\\
So there's a balance on how much repeats I can use.

The lops being 1 second long makes it a bit more difficult to use , but using a computer whith a webcam gives me more options.\\
Mostly solving np problems , cheating at some games etc.\\
I can easily manipulate any rng that I immediately know the output off .

Not sure how much times I would feel safe rerolling the universe though .

The 8 numbers things doesn't seem that useful since I don't have that much time to react.\\
Maybe for specific fast actions If I have an easy to turn on camera whith me .\\
And I could have a key to press if it reaches that point in the computer example(or just something to cover the webcam whith ) .
