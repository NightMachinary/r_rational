Whenever a camera sees you, the last second of time is undone, including everyone's memories, including yours. Once per day, choose up to 8 numbers. You are always aware of the last of these numbers exceeded by the day's reset count. When the last number is exceeded, you fall unconscious and your power turns off for an hour.
