I'd want to explore what constitutes a "camera" "seeing" me, but the first order of business is finding any way to actually know the effect has triggered, since it essentially reverses time, which seems observationally identical to the triggering /not/ happening at all. It seems like without any loss of generality we can characterize the same effect as looking /forward/ one second and preventing any course of events that leads to being seen by a camera. "It happened and then unhappened" seems to lead to back to the exact same world-state as "it hasn't happened", except for the reset count going down by one.

If the universe is deterministic, then any number of reset counts has the exact same effect - none. There is only one possible timeline, and whenever it passes through being seen by a camera you'll fall unconscious after it pointlessly resets a few times. Observational history will be identical the anomaly to having no effect except "being seen by cameras knocks you out".

If the universe is fundamentally probabilistic, then you could observe the effect as making being seen by a camera anomalously unlikely, with you falling unconscious if you push it by being exposed to lots of cameras lots of times. You might be able to get an angle on what the day's reset count is if you can measure just /how/ anomalously events where you're seen by cameras just fail to happen. Maybe some setup with rolling a die and opening a shutter to a camera if it comes up 6. 6's should suddenly appear to happen less often as the attempts where the effect is triggered cause a reset (assuming rolling a die is sufficiently probabilistic. If it's not, try radioactive decay triggering geiger counters or something). This should be quantifiable, but you'll have to consider that /other/ ways the camera-incident could not occur will also be effectively boosted, like the camera failing in some way.

  Once per day, choose up to 8 numbers. You are always aware of the last of these numbers exceeded by the day's reset count. When the last number is exceeded, you fall unconscious and your power turns off for an hour.

This just seems like a puzzle for gaining partial information about how many times the effect will work. I'm not sure I really understand it though. Is the idea that you can say "1 2 4 8 16 32 48 96" and then learn which is the last-occurring number that exceeds the day's reset count? So if it's 16, you know the effect can trigger between 8 and 15 times before you're knocked out?

Best I can tell this is "you've got unconscious reality-bending that's camera-shy, but if it gets tired you pass out", with a side of being able to gain limited information about how strong the effect is that day. I assume it varies from day to day?
