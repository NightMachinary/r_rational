Under 'what counts as seeing', I'd also add /when/ does 'seeing' take effect? Say, for an old-school photographic camera---am I "seen" when the lens is pointed my way? when someone looks through the viewfinder? when the shutter button is pressed?

Under 'what counts as seeing me', I'd also ask whether the process can be /blocked/ by anything---can an infrared camera get me through a wall? does a camera see me through a thick fog? how thick? Does seeing my clothing/hair/bodily-fluids count as seeing "me", or do they obscure "me", or does it depend?
