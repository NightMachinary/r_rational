Film works, digital works, with no film it doesn't work, if the digital camera doesn't store it it doesn't work, pinhole camera with film works, enough unfocusing and it doesn't work.

Photons that interacted with you. A camera seeing a picture of you doesn't trigger it. Of course any such picture was produced when your power was offline. An unresolved speck doesn't count. Seeing around a corner with a mirror counts the same as seeing directly. If the image is scrambled enough it doesn't work.

Any body part works. A closeup of a bit of skin works. It stops working when the skin is taken off. Clothing and objects you carry work. A car you're driving works! If you're merely a passenger it doesn't work.
