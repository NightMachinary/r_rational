  This is kind of a nitpick, but burning pewter provides a flat bonus to your physical abilities, it doesn't multiply your pre-existing strength.

Huh, I was referring to that exact conversation with that bit, but apparently I completely misremembered.

  Also, the amount of strength pewter grants is somewhat beyond two/three times a regular person's

There is a direct [[https://wob.coppermind.net/events/9/#e7674][WoB]] for regular burning roughly doubling and flaring roughly tripling your strength. Though obviously these are deliberately vague numbers and the allomantic skill of the person in question probably also plays a role.
