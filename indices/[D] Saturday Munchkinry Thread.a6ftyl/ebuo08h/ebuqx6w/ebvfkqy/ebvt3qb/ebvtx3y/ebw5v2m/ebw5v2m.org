  minimum security prisons don't have any perimeter fencing
#+end_quote

I just heard back from my friend in the prison industry, and he says there's fencing "but it's not very secure and the gates are usually open" and "Pretty sure they only put them in in the last 20 years and purely for political reasons. Probably less secure than your average high school"

So really, for entertainment value, he needs to be a high school student and change just before gym class or something. Pfft.
