Worse would be transforming before a court witness appointment for an inmate and being forced to miss it. Depending on how nice the judge is feeling, you can be charged with contempt, fined, or sent to jail. Your job would also be /very/ unhappy.

It's also pretty boring though, since there isn't any resolution other than "miss your appointment and beg for leniency".
