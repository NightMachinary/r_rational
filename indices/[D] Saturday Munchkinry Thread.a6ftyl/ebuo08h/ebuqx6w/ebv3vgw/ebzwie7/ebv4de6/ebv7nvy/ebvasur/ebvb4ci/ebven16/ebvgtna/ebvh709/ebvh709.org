I try to publicize the anomaly in a way public enough to avoid being simply disappeared as a lab rat, calling further attention to your existence. Eventually ending up as a research project is fine as long as I'm getting benefit out of it and maintain informed consent instead of being unpersoned.

Starting to look less interesting since I'm just the toy of a bored god that won't respond to feedback.
