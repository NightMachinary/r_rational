Yep. You could use this as some sort of probability pump as long as you can tether control of a camera to some sort of random event and you can trigger it within one second.

I don't think you could win the lottery this way, since you can't get feedback about whether you won or not within one second. You could perhaps get some sort of monitoring device that checks whether you had a heart attack or have been shot or some other serious trauma, and opens a camera to look at you if you have, which will pump all the probability into scenarios in which these things don't happen, but you'll still run into issues if the initial cause and the detection are more than one second apart. Also, you'll pump probability into scenarios in which your aparatus spontaneously fails rather than whatever you're trying to prevent, so this puts a soft cap on the unlikelihood of scenarios you can cause, based on how reliable you can make your device.

You might be able to use it to solve NP-hard problems and factor large numbers to crack cryptography and stuff. If you have a computer randomly guess at solutions and open a camera at you if it's not correct, then eventually it will guess the right solution and you can keep it. You'd need some source of randomness like radioactive decay or something, and you'd still only be able to solve problems that have higher probability than your computer malfunctioning, but if you get a reliable set-up you might be able to make a killing at cryptocurrency mining or something.

But for most problems one second is way too short to do anything really useful, this power is probably a net-negative, and probably the best you can do is practice avoiding cameras so as not to get knocked out, or set the theshholds incredibly high and use it as an ability to spontaneously destroy cameras.
