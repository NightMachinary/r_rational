Good point - the count is the only thing /not/ reversed, and you can gain immediate information about it when the count exceeds one of the thresholds. This can influence your actions, even in a deterministic universe.

I hadn't realized at the time what they meant about being aware of the chosen numbers being exceeded.

Looking back at it, doesn't this let you set an arbitrarily high number as the last threshold where you'll be knocked out? It sounds like you could push this as hard as you like. In a deterministic universe it isn't as big of a deal (you'll just repeat the same scenario a lot in the last interval of activation counts, since there's only any new influence on you when you cross a threshold), but in a probabilistic universe this seems to amount of reality-warping with dialable strength. Put the upper limit at some ludicrously high number, and the universe essentially rerolls all the relevant dice up to that many times a day whenever a camera would see you in the next second. Any unlikely-but-possible occurrences over those one-second intervals that could prevent that outcome become much more likely. Cameras will spontaneously fail, etc.
