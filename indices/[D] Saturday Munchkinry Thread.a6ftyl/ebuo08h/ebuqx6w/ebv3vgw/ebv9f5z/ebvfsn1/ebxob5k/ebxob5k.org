So I can basically run really powerful (and dangerous) optimization processes on the universe, just by setting up cameras to see me unless something I want happens, and choosing a really large number. Of course in practice that would probably just make my own existence too unlikely(well depends on the right interpretation of Qm and its interaction whith the loop )or reward hack the universe, So I shouldn't pick really big numbers, and be really careful when designing camera setups. The rollback of the universe being just 1 second makes it less convenient, and the falling unconscious would interfere a lot whith my life , but apart from that it's not that different from all other powers that let you run optimization processes via time travel.
