If the universe is deterministic then having numbers with gaps between them would be useless.

Say the first number is zero. You're walking down the street and your number-exceeded sense pings, so you know a camera would see you if you continued for 1 seconds. You change course, problem averted.

Say the next number on your list is 10.

Later that day you walk into view of a camera and get reset... and you loop, walking into view of that camera 9 more times. The 11th time, your sense pings and you know to stop. Absolutely nothing happened/changed during those extra loops. The outcome is identical to if you had picked 1 as your second number and your sense pinged before you entered the view of the camera.

No matter what numbers you pick, you will always only find out about the first 7 camera-sees-you events you might have encountered with 1 second to avoid them, and the 8th one will knock you out.
