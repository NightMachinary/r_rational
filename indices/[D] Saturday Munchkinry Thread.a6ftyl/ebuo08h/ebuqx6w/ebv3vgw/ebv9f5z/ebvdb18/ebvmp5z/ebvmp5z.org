Okay, so one obvious danger is getting into a situation where you are unable to find a way to avoid being spotted after eight tries. Or you exhaust six tries, figure it out, and then try to retreat from view only to end up getting spotted and using up your last two tries. This creates danger in the form of potentially serious fall injuries.

The other danger is the random effects that may occur if you set your threshold(s) really high. If the lowest number you set is 10^{10^{10,}} you can almost guarantee that something that could be astronomically improbable will occur to prevent a camera from seeing you. This could mean you suddenly die, or the camera malfunctions, or its line-of-sight is broken.

If you want to use high thresholds, you may want to get or make an electronic device with a true random number generator based on radioactive decay. Something like a USB geiger counter, a bit of Americium from some smoke detectors, and a tablet or laptop to plug it into. Write a short script to sum up the number of detected particles from the geiger counter in the last millisecond and play a sound based on the improbability of the result (1 in 100,000, 1 in 10 million, 1 in a billion, etc.). As long as you pre-commit to certain actions for certain sounds, like ducking, turning around, activating a small incendiary to instantly release a cloud of smoke, etc. you should be able to iterate through all pre-planned actions until one of them breaks the loop.
