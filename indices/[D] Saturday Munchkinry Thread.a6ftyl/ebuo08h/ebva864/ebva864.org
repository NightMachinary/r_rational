A Pewter compounder is an easy source of biomass for any project which needs it. You can get effectively infinite muscles, cut off some irrelevant and easily-healed ones, and survive the process with Pewter endurance. Furthermore, since burning Pewter protects you from the effects of crushing as well (mild Mistborn spoilers, there), a compounder could use their ability to become arbitrarily large to destroy any room/building they were in by just overfilling it.

I'm now imagining a world dominated by ever-swelling mounds of living flesh cascading outward from particularly distrought Pewter compounders.

Infinite muscles means infinite blood and skin, which means you just need to find cooperative pewter compounders of all blood and tissue types to solve blood shortages forever. This also gives scientists a limitless supply of human tissue to experiment upon.
