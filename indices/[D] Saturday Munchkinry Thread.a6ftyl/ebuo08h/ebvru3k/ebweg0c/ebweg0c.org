  Does Pewter Feruchemy also protect you against the consequences of having such high/low muscle mass?

  Does it protect against hypo/hypertension due to the massively changed blood pressure requirements for all the new muscle mass?

  You'd also start experiencing loss of breath due to not being able to oxygenate all those new cells

  And even then, you wouldn't be able to do "superhuman" strength feats without tearing your muscles from your bones since the weak point is as the connective tissue

  Also, muscle mass isn't all that important. It's muscle density
#+end_quote

Feruchemy always adjusts the body to be able to handle whatever powers it gives, but only to an extent. I imagine the connective tissue between muscles and bones (as well as the bones themselves) just get strenghtened to match the new muscles, otherwise the power just doesn't work. For the same reason I'm assuming feruchemy affects both muscle mass and muscle density.

Oxygination of the cells likely gets compensated for to some extent as well, but I imagine it would become a problem for prolonged fights and long runs. Minor spoilers: All three of the pewter feruchemists we've seen in the story were full feruchemists, so they would have another power, which we'll get to in a few weeks, to compensate for this, but they still tended to only hulk out very briefly whenever they used pewter (though conserving feruchemic charge would also be a factor, at least for two of them).

  It being hard to move around - is that only due to physically reduced range of motion due to increased muscle mass?
#+end_quote

That, and the physical extra weight of the muscles, but that is mostly as a comparison to allomancers who become much stronger while weighing the same (so allomancers can jump higher, change direction quicker etc, than feruchemists).

  Can Feruchemists control what muscles they are storing/tapping?
#+end_quote

No, it's all or nothing. Though note that 'all' here doesn't literally mean every muscle in your body, nor is every muscle affected to the same extent.

#+begin_quote
  There's a lot of things in the human body that are classified as "muscles" that would start fucking up if they just increased in mass in a second.
#+end_quote

Very mild spoilers: Perhaps worth noting that feruchemy is not a naturally occuring phenomena, it is a magic system designed by a pair of sentient, near omniscient gods so there is some intelligence involved in what muscles bulk up and to what extent.

  How does damage to your muscle work?
#+end_quote

Damage to any particular muscle shrinks and grows with that particular muscle. So, yeah, getting damaged while hulked out and then shriking would indeed reduce the size of the wound, though I'm a little skeptical about how much help this would be against getting shot.

#+begin_quote
  You could also constantly store muscle mass and prolong your life for quite a while if you're ever trapped in a rockslide or somewhere without food by decreasing calorie requirements, but that might be dangerous depending on how muscle damage works since you'd start cannibalizing your muscles for calories.
#+end_quote

That should absolutely work, yes.
