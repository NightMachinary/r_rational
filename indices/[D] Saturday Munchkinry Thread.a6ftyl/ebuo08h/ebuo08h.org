*Mistborn Munchkinry Miniseries Part 4: Pewter*

Ok, week four of the mistborn munchkinry miniseries. For a general overview of this series and the magic systems in question, see [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9zz4sa/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ead595h/][part one]]. I strongly recommend reading the first part of that comment if you weren't here for the past weeks and aren't familiar with the mistborn setting.

/Spoiler note/: I will avoid things that I consider excessive spoilers, but the exact workings of the magic system are moderate spoilers themselves, so if you intend to read the books and are sensitive to spoilers you should probably skip this one.

This weeks metal is pewter. Its powerset is probably a little more straightforward than the ones we've seen before, but I'm curious see what you all can come up with. As always I'm interested in what a pewter twinborn compounder can do, both here on earth (where they are the only one with this powerset) and in Era 2 Scadrial.

*Allomancy*

Allomantic pewter enhances your body. The most obvious effect of burning pewter is that you become physically stronger, roughly two to three times stronger than you were before (+note: this means the effect of allomantic pewter is amplified by being in good physical condition+ edit: this is wrong, see below), but that is only the tip of the iceberg. You also become faster and more agile, your reaction speed and sense of balance improve and you tire much slower and heal much faster than a regular person. On top of that an allomancer burning pewter has a vastly higher tolerance for pain and is able to push his body well past its normal limits, ignoring lethal wounds and continuing to fight or run long after normal person would have blacked out from shock or exhaustion.

With enough pewter to burn, an allomancer has essentially unlimited stamina. Combined with the added strength and balance pewter gives you, this allows for a process called pewter dragging: by burning large amounts of pewter continually over an extended period of time, the allomancer is able to run across extreme distances at speeds faster than any galloping horse, even through dense forests and other types of difficult terrain. In a semi-pre-industrial world like scadrial this means pewter allomancers can get to places faster than anyone else and even be in a condition to fight after they get there if needed.

Worth noting is that pewters healing ability isn't Wolverine levels of healing, it makes you recover in hours to days from wounds that otherwise heal in weeks to months (if ever). More significantly, it allows the body to continue to function /despite/ those wounds: regenerating lost blood, preventing you from going into shock and letting partially severed muscles work without tearing themselves appart further. Also worth pointing out is that enough aluminium in the wound surpresses all of these effects (which makes aluminium bullets a good way to deal with pewter allomancers).

Burning pewter is not without its own risks either, if an allomancer runs out of pewter to burn they immediately lose their enhanced stamina and pain tolerance and they run the risk of collapsing to exhaustion they didn't realise they had or wounds that they had written of as irrelevant. An allomancer running out of pewter during a pewter drag can easily kill themselves through over-exertion. Moreover, pushing your body past its limits for extensive amounts of time takes its toll on the body and an allomancer coming out of a heavy pewter drag may need days or even weeks of rest to recover. All of this only happens if you seriously abuse your body though, in normal day-to-day life, pewter allomancers are healthier, more energetic and need less rest than regular people.

*Feruchemy*

Feruchemic pewter stores physical strength. This differs from allomantic pewter in that feruchemy works on the level of actual physical muscles. When storing strenght, the feruchemist visibly deflates, becoming scroungy and weak. Afterwards, they can tap the pewter metalmind created this way to become more muscular and powerful. A feruchemist tapping a pewter metalmind can be much stronger than a allomancer burning pewter, but they do not gain any of the other benefits that pewter grants an allomancer. Moreover, because feruchemy physically increases your muscle mass, tapping too much strength makes it harder to move around as your motions become limited by the sheer bulk of your muscles.

The key difference between a pewter allomancer and a pewter feruchemist is that the former are more athletic and mobile (packing their enhanced strength into a much lighter package), while the latter have more raw strength and the momentum that comes with being physically larger and heavier.

And that is it for pewter, the last of the physical metals. Next week we start with the mental metals!
