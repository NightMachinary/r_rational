I like that idea, but he's in a particular prison and I just checked it on google maps and it definitely has a large perimeter fence. It looks like parts of the prison are outside the fence (it's a prison farm, so I can see a field, and there's what I assume are admin buildings), but probably not the part Our Hero would be in when he changed.

Still, there's something to be said for playing it straight as a dog getting into the prison as being a good way to deal with it. People would be looking for the non-existent hole in the fence for a while.

I figured with him being a prison employee, changing at work would be his worst case scenario, and then a prison break would be a fun thing to do. But is there somewhere else that might be worse?
