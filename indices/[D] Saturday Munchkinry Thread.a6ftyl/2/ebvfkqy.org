Werewolf prison break (only the werewolf is an employee, not an inmate)

A minimum security prison employee is a werewolf, and he transforms out of schedule during one of his shifts. He had just enough time when he felt the change starting to lock himself in a cupboard - and, appearance-wise, he looks enough like an irish wolfhound to not destroy the masquerade if he's found. (Fortunately, he was not working with inmates at the time).

Due to not being an idiot, he's got a backup plan for this situation: a panic button he can press on his person that sends an emergency text message to another werewolf friend of his, a lawyer.

Any out of the box ideas for how she and her assistant can sneak the werewolf out of the prison? They don't need to take him anywhere in particular: as long as he gets out of the walls, he can run home.
