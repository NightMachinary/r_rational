He's in control, but if a prison staff member goes missing, that's a kind of major incident, and the cupboard would definitely be searched, and then there's this giant dog and a torn prison uniform: that dog is being put down very quickly because to all appearances it just killed a staff member.

He has a fake illness he uses to cover for the werewolf changes, so when he gets home he can use his giant, paw-friendly keyboard to send a very apologetic email to his boss and say that he had to leave work suddenly because he felt an attack coming on early and he won't be in for a few days.

Worst case scenario he can try his luck with animal control and bust out of the cage / hope that his werewolf friends bust him out, though. But a cover story for his boss would be harder then as it doesn't explain why a dog was in his classroom.
