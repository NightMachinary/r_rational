Honestly, just go walking down the hallways with your tongue lolling out sniffing stuff. A dog wandering around a minimum security prison is /weird/, but minimum security prisons don't have any perimeter fencing and I think some don't even lock their doors, and if it's obviously friendly there's no reason the response is anything other than "sent to the pound and chalked up to a hole somewhere". Then have your lawyer friend buy you, or break you out from the pound where there's much less scrutiny.
