If you can react quickly enough to the knowledge when one of your numbers is exceeded, then even in a deterministic universe you could potentially stop whatever you're doing (for instance, if you were about to walk around a corner) and hopefully avoid getting hit by a camera again. This would effectively give you eight distinct attempts each day at avoiding cameras that you could predict would see you one second in the future.
