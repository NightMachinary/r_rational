  enough unfocusing and it doesn't work.

  If the image is scrambled enough it doesn't work.

This immediately suggests that the effect has intelligent pattern-matching behind it. The thing that attaches this effect to me also knows what I look like in two-dimensional representations that have only certain kinds of partial similarity to my actual body. It's not the photons doing it. It's the /pattern/ being formed /and stored/ having certain /abstract/ properties.

  A camera seeing a picture of you doesn't trigger it.

  A closeup of a bit of skin works. It stops working when the skin is taken off. Clothing and objects you carry work. A car you're driving works!
#+end_quote

And this suggests that that intelligent-pattern matching is not /only/ looking at what cameras record, but is also paying attention to /me directly/ in order to exclude identical camera-events that only indirectly trace back to me (through a photo) rather than directly, and to /include/ camera-events that have /no/ similarity to my body of any kind.

This isn't a simply physical phenomenon tied to some property that only I have. It's an intelligent process watching me and making distinctions that can only exist in the abstract space of a mind. Even if it's not /conscious/, it certainly embodies high-level abstract concepts and can interpret reality in terms of those concepts.

Found you.
