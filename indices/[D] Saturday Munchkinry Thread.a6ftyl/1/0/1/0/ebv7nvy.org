The only observational test we have is kinda weak, since it only shows up as a shift in otherwise-known probabilities. (edit: though your clarification make it easier, since you can have some definite immediate feedback about effect-triggering at least sometimes) But that never stopped scientists before.

Some possible angles:

*What counts as a camera?*

Film? Digital? What if you remove the film, or set the digital camera to not store anything? How ephemeral can the internal effect of the light be before the effect stops triggering? Does a pinhole in a box count as a camera when you introduce film at the back of it? What if it's so badly focused that it doesn't really form an image?

*What counts as seeing?*

Photons that last directly interacted with my skin? Or does some kind of pattern-matching happen? Does a camera seeing a reproduced image of me also count, or is it something more intrinsic to my person? Is there a limit to how /many/ photons work? Does a photo taken from five miles away where I'm an unresolved speck still work? What if there is very, very low light? Does bouncing the image off a mirror stop the effect? How about bouncing it off of frosted glass, such that the image is scrambled?

*What counts as me?*

Is a body part enough? If so, does any body part work? Is there a size effect? Does a square centimeter of skin do it? I can't think of an easy way to test the same thing, but does getting a skin graft from a donor transfer the effect to the new skin or not?
