Does Pewter Feruchemy also protect you against the consequences of having such high/low muscle mass? You mention it being hard to move around - is that only due to physically reduced range of motion due to increased muscle mass? Does it protect against hypo/hypertension due to the massively changed blood pressure requirements for all the new muscle mass? Can Feruchemists control what muscles they are storing/tapping?

There are a lot of obvious problems with this I can see: Draining/boosting muscle mass seems like it would very easily kill you due to changing the thickness and strength of your ventricle chambers. The muscles that control saccades in your eyes would start overshooting, blurring your vision. It'd enlarge your tongue, making it hard to talk or suffocating you. There's a /lot/ of things in the human body that are classified as "muscles" that would start fucking up if they just increased in mass in a second.

Also, muscle /mass/ isn't all that important. It's muscle density - there are lots of really bulked out weightlifters that can't lift that much due to never cutting. And even then, you wouldn't be able to do "superhuman" strength feats without tearing your muscles from your bones since the weak point is as the connective tissue.

You'd also start experiencing loss of breath due to not being able to oxygenate all those new cells, even if it handled blood volume and pressure for you - there are lots of story about professional bodybuilders essentially always being out of breath as a consequence and how it kinda ruins their life. Things like prolonged fights or having to run anywhere at increased muscle mass would be a very bad idea, and you'd be liable of passing out.

There's the very obvious solution of "use this to get free power" - it very obviously increases their mass, so just get a bunch of them to stand on hydraulic plates and oscillate, even more than the more esoteric "increase momentum but not weight" metals since there's no loss from burning any resource or need for complex setups.

I'd also be interested in what force the muscle expansion would have, like the sibling comment says - best case scenario you could stick a finger in a hole, jiggle your muscle density back and forth, and shatter rocks due to stress as your finger muscles expand and contract like water.

How does damage to your muscle work? If you tap pewter and get increased muscle mass, is it at the same "damage" as the rest of the muscle group, or what damage it was when you stored in the metalmind? If the first, then you have a pretty efficient shield for bullets - bulk up, get shot, shrink and have comparatively much less damage. If it's the second, then you could just store away the damaged mass of muscle again and be fresh as daisies, or do stuff like storing your damaged muscles in one metalmind and tapping unharmed muscle from a second to cycle out any damage you take.

You could also constantly store muscle mass and prolong your life for quite a while if you're ever trapped in a rockslide or somewhere without food by decreasing calorie requirements, but that might be dangerous depending on how muscle damage works since you'd start cannibalizing your muscles for calories.
