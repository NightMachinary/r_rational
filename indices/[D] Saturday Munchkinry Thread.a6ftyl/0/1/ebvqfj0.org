  The most obvious effect of burning pewter is that you become physically stronger, roughly two to three times stronger than you were before (note: this means the effect of allomantic pewter is amplified by being in good physical condition), but that is only the tip of the iceberg.

This is kind of a nitpick, but burning pewter provides a flat bonus to your physical abilities, it doesn't multiply your pre-existing strength. Most pewter mistings still like to pack on muscle because it makes them that much stronger, but a body builder and a starving street urchin would both be receiving the same degree of enhancement.

  "So," Ham said, "an Allomancer doesn't have to be physically strong to be incredibly powerful. If Vin were a Feruchemist it would be different-if you ever see Sazed increase /his/ strength, his muscles will grow larger. But with Allomancy, all the strength comes from the metal."

  "Now, most Thugs-myself included-figure that making their bodies strong will only add to their power. After all, a muscular man burning pewter will be that much stronger than a regular man of the same Allomantic power."

Also, the amount of strength pewter grants is somewhat beyond two/three times a regular person's- Vin, for instance, is capable of swinging swords that weigh as much as she does with a single hand.

  Vin Pulled on the fallen sword. It lurched up at her, but also pulled her down with its weight. She caught it as she fell---the sword was nearly as tall as she was, but flared pewter let her handle it with ease---and she sheared free the attacking koloss's arm as she landed. She took its legs off at the knees, then left it to die as she spun toward other opponents
