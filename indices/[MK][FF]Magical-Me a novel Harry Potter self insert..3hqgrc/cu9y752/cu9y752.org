Ugh, this is one of those stories where somebody "swearing by their magic" is an absolute proof of their sincerity about whatever it is they have sworn.

This would break canon so horribly, if it were part of the universe that I really don't know why any fanfic author ever had the bright idea of including it in their stories. Hey suspected Death Eater, swear by your magic that you're not a Death Eater.

In this particular story, the author uses it to do away with the need of his character to collect any evidence whatsoever in order to prove the tidbits of knowledge he has as a self-insert.
