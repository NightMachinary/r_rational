In canon, we see /one/ instance of their use (and one near-use), and them being used sparingly (for some unstated reasons) is just as canon as them existing in the first place.

Said reasons could be as simple as a bonder being able to sustain exactly one Unbreakable Vow at a time, and Bonder's death causing the Vow to expire some time after. Or, they could have the restriction that at least two of the three people involved be close blood relatives.

I am not saying that this is canon, but there must be /something/ to explain why nobody else on either side uses them. Think of it as a non-constructive proof.
