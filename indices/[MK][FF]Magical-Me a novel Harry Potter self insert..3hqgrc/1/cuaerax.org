The pace seems a bit slow. I feel like we're 90,000 words in and there hasn't been much conflict or tension yet. The tension that has occurred has been almost immediately resolved, instead of being allowed to build up for even 5-10 minutes. You can sort of see trouble on the horizon, but there isn't a sense of the stakes being real or tangible.

edit: To add to that, it seems like a story where the protagonist can't lose. I get the feeling he has plot armor much thicker then anything the author will throw at him.
