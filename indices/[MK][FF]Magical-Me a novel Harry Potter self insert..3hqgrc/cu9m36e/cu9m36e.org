I have came across a rather interesting self insert in which an american collage student is replacing the one and only Gilderoy Lockhart. The summary of the story is what caught my attention, "Most self-inserts are exercises in vanity, and nothing says 'vanity' quite like Gilderoy Lockhart. But with a new personality and knowledge of the future, who knows? Maybe Lockhart will turn out to be a useful DADA teacher after all."

The story has been quite thoughtfully put together and has recently updated today. I think that most people here would enjoy it as well.
