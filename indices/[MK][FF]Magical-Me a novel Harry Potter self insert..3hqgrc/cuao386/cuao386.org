It's alright but I wouldn't call it rational. Dialogue is very stilted and unnatural, and it takes itself a bit too seriously. As most people said there's barely any action and mostly exposition. Maybe you can call it rational when the MC actually makes rational plans and put them in action, but right now, nope.
