Right, I think this community is very good at planning their stories ahead of time. I was hoping people would be willing to share their outlines for things they've already finished writing (or parts of the outlines for things they've written so far). Taking a look at real examples along with the written work is much more useful than just theory. Do you have anything you're willing to share?
