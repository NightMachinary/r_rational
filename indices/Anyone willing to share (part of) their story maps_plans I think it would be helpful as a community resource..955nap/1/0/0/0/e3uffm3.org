Thanks a bunch! What I most wanted was outlines from before the writing process started, so this is perfect. I know I tend to edit my outlines as I write to keep them at least somewhat updated with what I ended up writing, so the "original plan" ends up not existing anymore. I wasn't too hopeful that I'd be able to find any in its raw form. Thanks for this. I'll be reading your story over the next week.
