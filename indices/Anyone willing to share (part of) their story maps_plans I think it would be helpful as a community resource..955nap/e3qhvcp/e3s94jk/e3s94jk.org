Thanks, this is great (though that means I have to read your story now to see how it compares to the outline o.0).

You mentioned in your third post you were planning to put together a "pseudocode" version of the story before you started writing. Did you ever do that? If so, would you mind posting it or sending it to me? (I know it's a bit like walking around in your underwear though, so I'll understand if you don't want to. I think that's why I haven't gotten any responses of this kind yet.)

Though it's still useful as a general framework for the story as a whole, Harmon's story circle isn't a great fit for multi-arc stories, series, or sprawling epics, so the main thing I've been looking for has been those "pseudocode" story plans, especially when there's a posted work I can compare them to.
