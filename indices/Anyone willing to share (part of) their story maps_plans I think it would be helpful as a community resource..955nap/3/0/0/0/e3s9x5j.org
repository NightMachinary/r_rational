Gotcha. Just for the record, I'm not looking for something well organized (my notes sure aren't). I just wanted to see examples of what people are working with, so the raw, unfiltered version is exactly what I want (though I realize it could be embarrassing to share it, I figured the rational community would be more open to doing so than other writers).

That said, if you haven't written or posted the story yet, I obviously won't ask to see the notes. Nobody likes spoilers.
