[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HNPzM2CiRMehpr3kbcCEbimyGfz0qMkqEKSkhWvzKSw/edit?usp=sharing][Here you go.]] That's v1 and v2 of the psuedocode, so you can see some of the evolution.

Edit: Note, the last edit on that doc was October 29, 2014, which was a handful of days before the first words of the story were written. There are some obvious changes in the text itself, some of which are a result of writing that document, some of which came from more spur of the moment things. Sofia and Rowan originally had a brother, who the psuedocode revealed didn't really have a point. Henry used to be named Harry, Omarr used to be named Omake. I /think/ the way the v2 version was written was that each un-italicized sentence was written first, then the italicized paragraphs were written after all the individual sentence descriptions of chapters/scenes were finished (edit 2: confirmed to be the case through revision history). The whole sub-plot with Sofia's mother wasn't in there at all.

Also, because I forgot to link it, you can read the first draft of /The Dark Wizard of Donkerk/ [[http://www.alexanderwales.com/darkWizardNaNo2016.html][here]].
