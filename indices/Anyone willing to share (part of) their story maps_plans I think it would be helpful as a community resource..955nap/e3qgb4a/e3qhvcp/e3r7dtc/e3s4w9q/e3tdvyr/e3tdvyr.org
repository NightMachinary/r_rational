Not exactly what you were asking for, but since my process is a bit different as I work with another person in an extremely collaborative way, I thought I'd show the "house map" I sketched out once I realised, in editing, that I'd need to make sure the house the story is set in is described in a consistent manner.

Even though it's not to scale and not "official" in any meaningful sense - I might decide I need an extra room later on - I can be confident that when I describe the kitchen as being through the dining room from the sitting room, or that the bathroom is at the end of a long hallway, I'm not going to write myself into a corner.

Like how the simpson's house has a door that leads to the basement or the closet, or how the bathroom on the top floor moves around between episodes. Boy, I really hope somebody got fired for that blunder!
