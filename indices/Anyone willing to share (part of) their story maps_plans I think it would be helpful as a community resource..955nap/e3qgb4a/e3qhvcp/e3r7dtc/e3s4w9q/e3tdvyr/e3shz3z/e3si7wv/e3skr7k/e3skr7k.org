Here's the only extended part of my notes on Rebels Can't Go Home that isn't spoilers:

/Barder bland tan the witch is a leopard head/torso and has two minds, in a crash site near Basecamp, points at tach harvesters down the hill working for days, lifeboat is trashed, and barder tells the/ story in the worst way,

/Other yellow eyes, rounded, furry ears, black line on front, patterned white, nanites/

/The ranger who'd suggested scavenging--Atil of Subclan Tahl'. The warrior who'd volunteered his cathan to pull the monster--Vren of Subclan Gorth'. Cupping a hand to the shoulder Hett of Yatt' his-saah/

/( burial of elder and missing others + sick + herbalist + 23 archers + 3 cathan rider (score of prisoners, 12 porters, 6 knights, 2 red robed)/

/many huntmasters, re'eef (bray) backed adapted runners )/

Probably not what you're looking for, but it's a start. Components that refer to plot points include 'harvesters down the hill' (refers to a search in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/94np29/rebels_cant_go_home_chapter_22/][Chapter 22]]) and 'burial of elder' (refers to a burial in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/94d379/rebels_cant_go_home_chapter_21/][Chapter 21]]); most of the rest is character description/characterization.

EDIT: I imagine more useful than what I've provided is Brandon Sanderson's online posting of [[https://brandonsanderson.com/books/warbreaker/warbreaker/][Warbreaker]], which includes chapter-by-chapter commentary of his writing process.
