I've had a few different approaches to outlines, but my big personal rule of writing prep 'best practices' is to be able to describe the whole arc of the story before I start, including the climax, the conclusion, and what the main characters are trying to achieve. For a given story, sometimes I've had many pages of notes before I started writing, and sometimes I've just started with a blank page, but for the stories I've been most satisfied with, the common denominator is knowing what I'm writing towards, even in a broad sense.
