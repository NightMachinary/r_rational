Not precisely what you're asking, but I find that one of the most important things for me is to keep a careful timeline as I write. It helps me track how long various things should have lasted, if it's feasible for the cavalry to ride to the rescue in time, etc. It also tells me where I have space to go back and insert a new scene if I want.
