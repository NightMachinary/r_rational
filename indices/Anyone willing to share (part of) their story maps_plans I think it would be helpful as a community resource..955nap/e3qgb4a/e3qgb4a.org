Not that I've published anything under my name in a long time, but I do NaNo every year, which is writing! Anyway.

My usual thing is that I start with a thesis. Speculative fiction at its best, whether it's original fiction or fanfiction and whether it's SF or Fantasy, is about an idea as seen through the lens of people and persons; this is just as true for the old classics (Foundation, 10,000 Leagues) as it is for the more modern stuff (Jo Walton's 'Tooth and Claw' asks what biology would support the claims of regency romance, Bakker's 'Prince of Nothing' asks what an ubermench is).

So let's say my theses are "What does an urban fantasy that doesn't beg the question actually look like?" (in homage to Mage's Technocracy) and "What would someone from outside our context think of our attitude towards environmental/ecological issues?" (hi, Modesitt, thanks for the feels, you jerk). I answer those questions, and that brings up more questions, and I answer those questions.

Somewhere around there I have ideas for cool scenes or people or abstract concepts, and I turn those into vignettes or structure them out; as I do this, more questions pose themselves.

The last thing I do is I pull up some random "give your character more depth" questionnaire and answer it for literally every character I have the patience to, then figure out what progress they're making on their personal goals and how their life is changing while they're offscreen.

After that, I'm ready to write! Bonus, I have vignettes that I can slot into what I've already written to cheat a little on the wordcount. I'd never win NaNo without that, probably; I'm bad at writing, especially compared to the titanic work ethic of the web serial authors whom I really shouldn't be comparing myself to.
