This is something you do as/after you write, right? Like after writing a bit, you'll fill in your timeline with how long things lasted? I can't imagine writing out a timeline /before/ you write that's detailed enough to use it the way you do.

Edit: To answer your other question, I'm asking if anyone is willing to post their point-by-point story plans, or as alexanderwales referred to it, the "pseudocode" version of the story. I'm looking to improve my technique in this area, so I was hoping to have examples I could look at of what other people have done.

Being able to look at this kind of outline side-by-side with the final product that was written based on it would hopefully allow me to see not only what works for other people, but also how much of the foreshadowing, hints, plot twists, etc. was actually planned from the beginning, which were happy accidents, which were done on the fly, etc.
