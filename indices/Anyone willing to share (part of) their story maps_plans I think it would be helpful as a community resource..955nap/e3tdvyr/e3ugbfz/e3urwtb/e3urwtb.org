It helps to conceptualise the story by making me think about it: the house in question is being rented by the protagonist from the antagonist, so I thought about what the /antagonist/ would put in her house. The top floor, in particular, caters to her sensibilities concerning servants. So it was a tool that helped me conceptualise /that/.

Plus, it helps with some atmospheric stuff: vampires are scared of the sun, so how do they avoid it? In this case, I have lots of "airlocks", so that way accidental door openings during the sunshine don't end up deadly, and have the vampire quarters in the centre of the house so e.g. a falling tree is less likely to affect it, and the stove at a far corner surrounded by thick stone walls.

I had an underground vampire compound in a nWoD campaign I GMed, and I gave that tons and tons of ornamental reflective pools, so that way in the event of attack the vampires could jump into the pools to put out fires/etc.
