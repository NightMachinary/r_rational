  The MC feels less sympathetic than he did at the beginning, more clueless despite knowing a lot more about the world, and the focus on the extended cast doesn't really do the story any favors

Yeah. It's like the MC is getting more stupid as he becomes integrated into this new world, rather than less. I get that part of it is supposed to be driven by his soul damage and whatnot, but at this point it's been ages with just increasing levels of naivet√© and self-absorption. It's getting old, and the story is only becoming less focused on actual forward progress as time goes on.
