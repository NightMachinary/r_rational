  Has Rain ever been portrayed as socially skilled? People fell in line behind him because he's powerful and was doing something, but actually skilled? I recall him shutting up and letting smoother members of the party talk whenever the stakes were high.

No, it's been clear that Rain is not that socially skilled. That's not the problem. The problem is his arrogant insistence that he's still right, even in areas where it's clear he's not very skilled. That's why I say I'm getting neckbeard vibes. It's not a compelling character trait, and it's honestly not even that believable for someone who's been put through near-death situations for months. Rain appears incapable of actually learning humility. The author says he learned from his failures, but the character himself doesn't actually show that. Honestly, i think it's more just poor writing than anything.

  When I re-read it, it felt spooky but not really high stakes.

Maybe I'm misremembering, but there were several cliffhanger cuts that made it seem like things were about to go wrong. There was an chapter end where rain forced to use his heat aura, even though it had just been established that the lair punished such use with extreme cold and snow fall. The last line of the chapter was Rain making a forced action to use an ability that had been established as a bad idea in this lair. Then the next chapter was other characters outside the lair being very worried that things were taking too long. Maybe this is just an attempt by the author to make things seem high-stakes, but if that's not mirrored by /actual/ in-story risk, then it's just mediocre writing.

It simply doesn't work to have both a main character who is supposed to be very cautious in planning things out ahead of time, while also having high dramatic tension due to the predictable results of that characters actions.
