Mmm, I guess two things come to mind that rubbed me wrong. The first is the MC's heavy-handed insistence on operating the company as a direct democracy, despite widespread resistance and ignorance. He demonstrates no political savvy or leadership ability whatsoever, yet pushes forward with a seeming certainty that his ideas are best, and no one else's opinion on the topic matters. It gives a very neckbeard vibe, and it seems likely to cause real problems with faith in leadership of what amounts to a paramilitary unit.

The 2nd thing is that they tackled the very first lair they came across with an insufficient level of power. The MC made a huge deal over many, many chapters about being slow and taking things with a large degree of caution... and then dives into a lair with what clearly wasn't enough firepower to make it safe. I don't know if this is just a mediocre writing decision to try and make the stakes seem high, but it makes the MC seem like an incompetent planner.
