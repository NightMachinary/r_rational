  Sure, I agree the motivation makes sense. The total lack of competency in the implementation is what bothers me. It turns me off the story, but obviously you're free to like it if you wish.

Has Rain ever been portrayed as socially skilled? People fell in line behind him because he's powerful and was doing something, but actually skilled? I recall him shutting up and letting smoother members of the party talk whenever the stakes were high.

To me this feels like a natural evolution of what we've seen so far. He's not a charismatic politician, but he doesn't want to be what he is good at which is giving picking reliable subordinates and giving them sensible orders.

When I re-read it, it felt spooky but not really high stakes. It was full of creepy villagers, but as soon as the battle started rain took them all down with a single blast because they're level 3. The blizzard was more of a threat than the spirit caller, and once they got to the turtle they just dismantled it safely by using boring but practical tactics.
