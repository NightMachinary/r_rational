  The democracy one makes sense to me. Rain's experienced all the drawbacks of being under someone else's thumb, both in the sense of being overpowered by someone's high level magic and being under the rule of an unstable tyrant. The former one explicitly traumatised him - hence wearing amour everywhere. So Rain's insistence on not becoming like them makes perfect sense, if it's a bad idea it's a bad idea that very much fits his charachter.

Sure, I agree the /motivation/ makes sense. The total lack of competency in the implementation is what bothers me. It turns me off the story, but obviously you're free to like it if you wish.

You make a good point with the fight in the lair. It's true that no one was too badly hurt, but it was definitely played up as a big risk with a lot of uncertainty and fear. Maybe this was just a choice by the author to make the stakes higher, but it kind of undermined the entire point of what Rain was doing. Ramping up the tension just to make the stakes seem higher isn't great writing, even if it's not actual in-universe failure on the character's part.
