The democracy one makes sense to me. Rain's experienced all the drawbacks of being under someone else's thumb, both in the sense of being overpowered by someone's high level magic and being under the rule of an unstable tyrant. The former one explicitly traumatised him - hence wearing amour everywhere. So Rain's insistence on not becoming like them makes perfect sense, if it's a bad idea it's a bad idea that very much fits his charachter.

For the lair, I just went back and checked and it looked like Rain did bring in as much firepower as he could have. He would have brought more but for some reason Ameliah said no. (Talhart and Stevvo saying no makes sense though). And as Rain says "Bringing a Fire user into a Cold lair sounded like common sense, until you considered that their two options were a little girl and an impulsive teenager who couldn't hit the broad side of a barn."

There is a question of why they pressed on after the first fight didn't got perfectly, but then the first fight did go quite well. Everyone finished with near 100% health - with the only damage they took being from Rain's mage burn. We see a party screen after the first fight when everyone's back to 100% hp. And honestly I think you're wrong about an insufficient level of power, the boss fight we saw against the turtle didn't even scratch them.
