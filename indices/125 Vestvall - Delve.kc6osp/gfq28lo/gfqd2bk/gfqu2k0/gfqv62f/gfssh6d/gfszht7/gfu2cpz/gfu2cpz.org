I think these are valid criticisms, especially the weird democracy implementation. The MC feels less sympathetic than he did at the beginning, more clueless despite knowing a lot more about the world, and the focus on the extended cast doesn't really do the story any favors, as it's not a strength of the author. The math obsession has also almost never paid off, despite math stuff being like 20% of the story.
