Honestly, I think I'm done with this story at this point. I liked it; I even liked the 'stuck in the cave' arc. But it's starting to feel like the author is just milking it now. I don't really care about all these different character perspectives and minutia. More critically, the main character hasn't stopped doing stupid things without proper preparation. It was forgivable for the first 3/4 of the book given that he was out of his element and had no time to figure out a plan. But now? He has all the time he needs and he still fails to prepare properly, instead just rushing in and figuring it out as he goes. He should be dead. It's not a compelling read for me anymore.

So yeah, when you say that, I'm not actually surprised. Like, I'm joking, but I'm kind of not really. Maybe I'll check back on this work in a year when I can read it as a block. We'll see.
