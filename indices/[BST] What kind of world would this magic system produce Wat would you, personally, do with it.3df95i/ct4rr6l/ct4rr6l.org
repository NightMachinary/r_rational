What does teleporting do to the objects momentum? Can you just drop objects off of a cliff and teleport them, or do you have to limit stuff that you don't have to worry about breaking, and teleport normal stuff by using a pulley system and tying it to a boulder you toss off of a cliff?

The magical uploads would give you post-scarcity economy. Find some people who like working and upload some copies of them. Since they won't have to worry about much themselves, they'll work for you. And since you can copy the people who work more, you can find people who are really willing to work.

Since uploads don't seem to have to worry about lifespan, it seems likely that they'll end up in power.
