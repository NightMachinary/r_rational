How is anyone still alive to teach or learn this stuff? Even if you assume people doing any magic at all aren't immediately killed by a political or religious inquisition, magic based on items does not result in a happy world full of daring adventurers. It means control is possible, and /will happen/. Brutally, totally, crushing all opposition. It won't even be interesting if, like demonstrated here, the effects aren't much better than throwing a bunch of people at any problem. Powerful people already have a bunch of people to order around, and they won't let commoners get that sort of power. They'll kill them and ban magic first.

Crystals (not just magic ones) are made illegal a day after crystal magic is first demonstrated to be able to kill someone politically important. Crystal Hunters roam the land with crossbows, killing anyone at range who even has a rock collection.

All previously constructed magic items and other advanced technologies are under control of the people able to command the most crossbow soldiers. The magic items are stored in vaults, guarded by even more crossbows. Private research is very illegal, and this limits where items so produced can be used. Only state actors do this research, and it is blamed on other countries to justify first strikes.

Why did you have to mention mind magic? Powerful people /hate/ mind magic they can't directly control. Bloodline mind magic means anyone with mental disabilities in public who looks even vaguely dangerous is killed by someone with a badge and a crossbow...sorta like right now, really. </politics>

Anyone stronger, smarter, or just weirder than normal is killed, along with their children and extended families. Political opponents are accused of controlling or reading minds, and fake trials convict based on political influence and bribes. Anyone not of a powerful political family who sticks their head up or is too successful is killed by someone with a crossbow, with or without a badge.

Use of controlled medical poultice substances is punished by summary crossbowing, usually during no-knock raids on dispensaries. Commoners trying to use it to heal loved ones are jailed, and the dungeons of many a castle are full of wanna-be Robin Hood medical suppliers.

The powerful, of course, still use them. A lot. Anyone merely middling-powerful has to kowtow to the powerful to be allowed to continue illegally using the medical poultices of life. Basically, if you are powerful and rich enough, you are allowed to continue living forever. Old age is an injury to cells, after all.

Uploading is illegal because crystals are illegal. Except for the politically powerful, of course.

--------------

No one can ever rise up to challenge this immortal group of plutocrats.

- If they are of the upper class, they are disconnected from any possible popular revolt. No single "noble" would have enough personal military power to win against the whole. They are silently assassinated, or just exiled and denied medical poultice until they die of old age.

- If they are of middling power, politicians directly working with the commoners for example, and try to involve themselves in common revolts, they are arrested and killed. Publicly and brutally.

- If they are commoners somehow in possession of widespread political influence or magical item stockpiles, they are hunted down by overwhelming quantities of soldiers with crossbows. They are all called terrorists, regardless of their personal actions, and are killed without trial.

--------------

If you want a happy fantasy world, you need to give the politically powerful something that a thousand peasants doesn't. If weapons are possible, they need personal or paid defenses. If mind magic is possible, they need absolute defenses. Otherwise, they'll throw wave after wave of people into the worst witch hunts in human history.

--------------

As for me, personally? I move somewhere in the far hinterlands and study crystals in a cave, planting poultice ingredients and training tiny little golems to scout the area for anyone with a crossbow.
