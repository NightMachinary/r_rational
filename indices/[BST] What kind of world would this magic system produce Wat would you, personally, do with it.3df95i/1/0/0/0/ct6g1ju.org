I would assume that members of the ruling class that used crystal weapons /themselves/ would be sufficiently effective at killing their own enemies that it would become universal among the ruling class. Am I overestimating the offensive capabilities here?

The industrial applications are such that at least one member of the ruling class would use it for such, or allow a member of the merchant class access; and from there it would become universal among the merchant class. I ... honestly think this is true even if they were illegal at first, but maybe I have a more tech-driven view of history than you.

The peasant class would probably remain fairly unchanged, yeah, unless society was completely revolutionized. (Since slaves are cheaper than crystal golems.) But we tend to consider the upper classes' tech level and society when discussing a culture anyway, right?

  As for magical healing items, why wouldn't they hoard them, making a greater profit off the rich upper class?

Because ... economics? That "objection" seems like it would apply to literally any good.
