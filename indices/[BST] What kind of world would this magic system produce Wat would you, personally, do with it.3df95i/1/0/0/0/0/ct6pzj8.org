  Am I overestimating the offensive capabilities here?

If they are no more expensive to make and use (and as they don't run on anything, that last part should work out) then yes. The powerful would slowly equip their forces with the better weapons. But I was assuming these crystal weapons weren't much better than swords and civil-war firearms, and were vastly harder and more expensive to make. In any case, making them military-only seems logical.

  The industrial applications are such that at least one member of the ruling class would use it for such, or allow a member of the merchant class access; and from there it would become universal among the merchant class. I ... honestly think this is true even if they were illegal at first, but maybe I have a more tech-driven view of history than you.

Tech is almost always driven from a single exceptional individual coming up with something, then having it spread out. Individual ideas like this can fail to take off, be lost because of a failed business venture (see, subs several times until the early 1900s), or be lost entirely to time when a civilization collapses. The very act of copying a Bible with a quill and ink has been banned in human history, as has the printing press, brewing, distilling, and gun manufacture. All are an order of magnitude less intrusive in daily live and (including guns) less dangerous than crystal magic.

Once the tech takes off, sure. No one would think nowadays, /in the relatively-free Western societies/, of banning a laser printer, but try to set up a nuclear pile in your shed and see how long that lasts. That's what I'm saying these primitive screw heads will think of crystal magic. That it is like playing with radiation and firearms and the worst propaganda of Thomas Paine.

The elite will play little games with the banned tech, but they won't set up factories with it, /because no one knows what the assembly line process even is./ It would take /another/ genius to figure that stuff out once crystal magic is around and common, and that won't happen in a medieval social order. I think you're still working from the end and trying to justify a crystal-punk ideal that isn't supported by historic function.

  That "objection" seems like it would apply to literally any good.

That the medicine could bring everlasting life only means it'll be illegal to sell to lower class people, those without the moral ideals required to live forever. Access will be controlled because it is the ultimate luxury. De Beers will have nothing on the herb cartels. Allowing cheaper access for the lower classes would break that monopoly, and so it wouldn't happen.

Your objection /again/ assumes modern free-market economic realities that literally haven't been invented in a medieval society. They're all about oppression for social control and insular mercantilism to ensure the elite get their fruits, wines, and spices. And if you're a good enough merchant class worker, you'll get to sample some of the life-giving cure-all.

Please try to consider the social realities of a world that doesn't have humanism, Walmart, or even Adam Smith. Saying something would be like a post-Enlightenment situation simply doesn't make sense for a medieval world.
