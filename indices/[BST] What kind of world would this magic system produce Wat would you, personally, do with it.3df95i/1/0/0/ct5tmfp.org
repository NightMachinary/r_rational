I purposefully used crossbows in my examples. Crossbows at the time are only good for one thing: shooting people. Bows (short and long) at the time were much cheaper and easier to make and hunt with, even though crossbows were better at taking down large game.

(Side note: crossbow hunting would have mostly been /poaching/, also illegal and annoying to the nobility. There were virtually no free woods to hunt; someone owned them and the large game animals inside. So why let them have such weapons? You don't need a crossbow to kill a squirrel, after all.)

Historically in many places (IRL), crossbows were illegal for commoners to own, because they could kill a knight in full armor on horseback from a distance, and relatively safely and cheaply. Same with crystals, no matter how "fun" it would be to make magi-tech perpetual motion machine walkers or whatever. The people in such a world wouldn't see it like that.

What do these crystals do that would convince a ruling polity that it is worth risking their own elite military forces just to allow worthless peasants, or even the merchant class, access to such powerful, mostly-offensive magical items? Like crossbows, allowing widespread use of them, or even private ownership, would be worse than pointing a crossbow at their own heads. What advantage would they /personally/ gain from allowing such magic item tech to flourish?

As for magical healing items, why wouldn't they hoard them, making a greater profit off the rich upper class? We do nowadays, with poorer nations having to risk international sanctions just to get cheap-to-make versions of brand-name drugs to stave off horrible diseases. Why would it be important to have a more healthy populace, especially if such healing items would allow them to fight longer and harder in a revolt? It wasn't until just before the Enlightenment that lower-class people being healthy and able to work harder was actually an important factor for the upper classes. The growing middle class also meant more people demanding previously upper-class advantages. That's not going to be the case in a standard medieval tech world.

You don't get Enlightenment values by default in your world setting, just because the story is being written by a modern, moral human being. If you want such, fine. Explain why Prince Blueblood thinks it is immoral to allow Joe the Dirt Farmer to die of syphilis. Or why Princess Inbred thinks advancement for advancement's sake makes any sense. But that doesn't come by default.

The default reaction from ruling people /at that tech level/ should be first, why? And second, how do I defend against it? Since it doesn't show obvious advantages over current military tech, they won't use it in war. A single hawk defector on that won't win the day. Even an army using gun-tech magic items will be defeated by the numbers with the masses of crossbows and horses equivalent manpower and money would buy. It isn't actually a force multiplier, just in base form.

I think you are extrapolating a jump to interesting society-wide modern approaches to using the tech that powerful medieval-society people facing this for the first time simply won't make. They'll hate change, fear the field-leveling advantages in /personal/ offensive power, and still work behind the scenes with the more interesting mechanical and mind-copy uses. But there won't be sky-boats or mecha-catgirls. Nothing interesting like that.

*Unless* you put in some sociological strange attractor, like say...an example from a physically distant and more advanced foreign power /already using/ the interesting approaches that makes contact with the medieval society. Maybe a crashed sky-boat, or a transporter accident. They bring crystal magic items of their own that are torn down and analyzed, jump-starting the field while providing a real and present threat to existing orders. Then it is a tech race, even if the tech they are figuring out at first isn't /really/ better than current designs.

Think moonshot-level research crunches for Princess Inbred to have her /very own/ local-made catboy mechanical, and for Prince Blueblood to have his own shiny new crystal-gun elite guard. Now you're cooking with socio-economic factors.

For real-world examples, think either (theoretical) crashed alien ships, or more realistically the British and Americans opening up Japan to trade using guns and steamships.

Pretty soon, only a couple of generations in fact, they would be the ones using guns and steamships against their neighbors. That's the sort of thing you should be looking at, I think.

You could also go back to first principles, and just design a fantasy medieval-ish world that has always had magic crystals, and whose entire social and economic order is based on them. It won't have knights on horseback or nobles, though. Power will be defuse and small city-states with magi-technocratic rulers with high turnover seem likely. You'd also have to work hard to define the effort required to make certain items, or else everyone will just end up in walking suits of iron, stomping through a Mad-Max hellscape again. It would be a lot of work to avoid illogical tropes creeping in, but it might be fun to make such a world. Very hard, but fun.
