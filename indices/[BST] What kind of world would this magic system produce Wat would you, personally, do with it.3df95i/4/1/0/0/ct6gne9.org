Yep.

Basically the meteor thing (corpses of slain gods in prehistory.) There are quite a lot of them, but they are of essentially limited number.

With that said, not all of them have been discovered yet; there are sites which are fairly rich in crystals and would take a while mine out. I could see the crazy miner who crafts himself crystal golem clones succeeding in completely mining one out ... you're right, this might be a plot hole.
