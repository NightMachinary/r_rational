How are crystals obtained? Can they be mined in practically unlimited numbers by a crazy old miner that crafts himself more arms (and magical-blade-pickaxes, and self-contained-fireball-dynamite sticks - are those reusable?) as he goes? If so, how long does he need to double his arms? (I smell an incremental game cooking.) (Same thing if they're chemically synthesized - or maybe they originally came from a meteor and are continually recycled?)
