Re: price:

Darn it, I should have mentioned that all these things need roughly the same amount of crystal, so the prices of all magic items are going to be roughly the same. (More for things with built-in AI and so on.) That was the whole point of using vaguely-defined "magic crystals" in the first place.

Golems cost more than children, but copying a master is probably cheaper than finding and training a child to the same level of skill. If only because you can always copy the most skilled craftsman you can find. So ... yup, excellent point.

Do bear in mind that crystals are a limited resource, though, so you'd probably hit diminishing returns on your Non Neumann process. I think?
