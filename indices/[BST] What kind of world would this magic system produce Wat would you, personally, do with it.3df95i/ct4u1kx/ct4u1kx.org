  They don't require any kind of power, thermodynamics be damned.

The creation of magical perpetual motion machines is energetically favored, and there is a half-life-per-cubic-centimeter rate at which space spontaneously becomes transformed into magical suns. Once created, they release energy into the regions around them which, while subject to the inverse square law, still provide energy to use to accelerate the process in the surrounding space since it has a higher energy density to use to spontaneously cause the transformation.

Your universe catches on magical fire and burns down immediately because you made hard vacuum flammable and the kindling point absolute zero. In the next one, don't damn thermodynamics.
