Seems like a pretty deadly place, heavily biased towards offence rather than defence. A teleport spell, but no tele-blocker to keep your house safe from invading teleporters. Fireballs, and unstoppable blades, but no magic shields or anti-fire potions. Seems like the thing to do is to gain a decent stockpile of fireball amulets, build up a force of magical uploads then build a castle. The uploads are weak at close range, so make sure they never get close. Keep them behind defences and arrow slits. If you can just graft on golem limbs, why stop at just 2 arms for a warrior? Especially if 2 can hold normal weapons while the others all hold crystals. It seems more and more that a properly outfitted person would have an extreme advantage.

As for the bloodline mages, they'd pretty much be walking natural disasters. I mean really, mind control and precognition alone is enough to make the Simurgh fearsome. Telekinesis of swarms of magical razors would cut down just about anything. Biokinesis to harden skin into armour and re-route injuries. The only thing for it would be to hope they're too mentally compromised to plan properly or else they're going to be in charge of the place, or at least some local places. It would make a good Warring Gods age which destroyed all that came before, Shinsekai Yori style. From there you can imply various things about how this all came to be if you like. Sufficiently advanced arseholes or whatever.

The magic crystals don't run out of charge, so it seems fighting would be limited basically by population total number of crystals. A large part of war would be capturing enemy crystals seeing as i'm assuming that more don't get built often (if at all). If you have them, and your enemy does not then you've basically won. Consequently a decisive battle would be doubly so, because their force is suddenly much stronger for all the extra uploads and fireballs that they've looted that you no longer have.

Looks like wars would come pretty often, no real limit on it on the arms side, teleporting carts would sure make dealing with a supply chain easier. Works for messages and orders too.
