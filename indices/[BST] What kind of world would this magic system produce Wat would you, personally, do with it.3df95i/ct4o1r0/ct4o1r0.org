How was crystal magic discovered? The history is important, because the people in power back then are presumably still around.

How viable is a von Neumann upload golem? To quote HPMOR's chapter 119:

#+begin_quote
  Someone would think of it, someone would talk, someone would try it. The probability was as close to certainty as made no difference.
#+end_quote

Or, to put it another way: What costs more, constructing an upload golem or raising a baby to mastery? Because that's the way the malthusian trap goes.
