What does it do to the direction? Could a drop something off of a cliff, and then teleport it so it's moving to the side? Can I teleport it a quarter of the way around the world, so that what was down is now east? Does it carry velocity relative to the earth or to something like the sun or the cosmological background microwave radiation?

How precise can you teleport something? Can you teleport cannonballs out of a cannon to a castle you want to knock down? Even if only one in a hundred shots hit, it would still be pretty effective.
