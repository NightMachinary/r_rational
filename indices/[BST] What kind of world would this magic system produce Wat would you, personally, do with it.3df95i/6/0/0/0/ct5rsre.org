  What does it do to the direction?
#+end_quote

Heh, I knew I should have kept the longer answer.

Strictly speaking, /speed/ is conserved, not momentum or velocity; direction is always at the same angle to the Earth's centre of gravity, but otherwise tends to drift randomly the further the target location is from the starting point.

I doubt the locals are actually /aware/ of all that, admittedly, although I suppose they have compasses.

  Can you teleport cannonballs out of a cannon to a castle you want to knock down?
#+end_quote

You ... should actually be able to do the teleport-cannon trick, yeah. Heck, if you sent a team of surveyors out first, you could probably shoot straight through their walls.

Expensive in crystal, though, come to think. Unless you set up some sort of large, reusable cannonball that would teleport back to you ... hmm. This is a really good idea!
