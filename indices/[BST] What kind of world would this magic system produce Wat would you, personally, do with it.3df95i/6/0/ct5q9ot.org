  What does teleporting do to the objects momentum? Can you just drop objects off of a cliff and teleport them, or do you have to limit stuff that you don't have to worry about breaking, and teleport normal stuff by using a pulley system and tying it to a boulder you toss off of a cliff?

Teleportation retains momentum, since I originally envisaged it as used on vehicles.
