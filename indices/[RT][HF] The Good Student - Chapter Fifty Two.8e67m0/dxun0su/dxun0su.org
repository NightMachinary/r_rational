Is there any chance we could get a 'recap episode' for Volume 2? I think I understand what's going on, but there's so many twists that even if I've understood 90% of what's going on, that means I've still missed or misunderstood at least a dozen plot points.

--------------

Winnum Roke

- Winnum Roke was the only one in the far realm, meaning all the demons were already in the real world.\\
- Winnum Roke and Simole are the only second generation female mages in recent memory
- ^ they are stronger mages and have demons in them that are more changed\\
- Winnum Roke lied to the All-Mother and the All-Mother lied to her
- ^ The All-Mother lied to trap Winnum.
- ^ Winnum Roke lied to the All-Mother for...?
- She is somehow more powerful than the Archmage, All-Father, Simole, and all the other mages and dragons put together.
- She is crazy and might kill everyone because she can't have children without dying(?)

Crazy Demon

- The crazy demon wanted to free Winnum Roke
- ^ Nobody else (including the other demons) wanted her free because she's crazy
- ^ Except there's the Librarian and at least 4 other mages on her side, including 2 Gwuer mages, so some demons are working with it(?)
- The crazy demon was the 'other half' to Winnum Roke (?)
- The demon planned to use Minister Delacroix to wage a one man war on Ranvar's magic users (dragons and mages), but Nic stopped it.\\
- The crazy demon thought it had failed to free Winnum Roke
- ^ Nic succeeded in freeing Winnum (accidentally and unexpectedly?)

The other demons

- Made a deal with the mages to give them their power in return for being changed\\
- Willingly work with the Mages
- Are happy with the status quo, even though they're going slower
- But some of them were working with the crazy demon by making mages in Gwuer(?)
- The Librarian isn't a demon, but is similar.
- The Librarian prepared Nic to be the door for the Far Realm, but she knew that only Winnum Roke was on the other side and didn't want Winnum Roke free.
- ^ ... so why?

Nic

- Nic had been groomed for the other realm his entire life
- ^ ... by the crazy demon and librarian
- Dizzy is not very pretty, but Nic's desire for Dizzy(+) and other girls(-) has been artificially manipulated\\

The mages

- Thought that there would be an apocalypse.\\
- The Archmage trained Simole to go to the far realm and fight(?)
- ^ ... but why?
- The Archmage has the All-Mother in him (and has since after Winnum Roke).
- ^ The other mages didn't know about the All-Mother and thought she was in the Far Realm
- The Archmage committed treason, or at least everyone pretended that he committed treason
- ^ ... because why?

Overall, I'm fairly unclear on the motivations and plans of the Archmage (along with the All-Father), the Librarian, and the crazy demon. Everyone else seems to have been working under bad information or manipulated in some way.

But those three seem like they each had all the information and still did weird things that I don't understand. The Archmage prepared his daughter to go fight in the Far Realm when there's nothing to be gained from it; the Librarian groomed Nic while not wanting him to do what he did; the crazy demon has no motivation I can comprehend.
