So, Nic has Winnum Roke inside of him. Kinky.

I liked the conclusion though we're still missing key parts of the puzzle. The Dizzy and Simole ending was awesome, I very much enjoyed their interactions. The demons + mages cooperating makes sense. Winnum Roke wanting revenge being the big driver of the story feels... unsatisfying? Incomplete?

I hope something serious and personal happened to her to lead to all this. Maybe she was pregnant, realized she would die and decided to have an abortion, or to kill her unborn child. I could see how that would cause a lot of trauma and take her on a path of revenge.

The All-Mother was sidestepped by the Archmage, which is a pain. I was hoping to find out what actually happened there. On the plus side, the All-Father calls the Librarian "Pilot". Was this sci-fi hiding under fantasy all along? I hope so, there was a ton of other hints in earlier chapters.
