  On the plus side, the All-Father calls the Librarian "Pilot". Was this sci-fi hiding under fantasy all along?

I sincerely hope not, I have had really bad experiences with genre shifts as plot twists.

Both pilot and ship can be used for maritime vessels as well as aircraft or spaceships, so I'm holding my thumbs the story will stay as labelled: fantasy.
