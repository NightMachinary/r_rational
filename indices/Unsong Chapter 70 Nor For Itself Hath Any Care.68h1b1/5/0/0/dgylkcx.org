I think Salvation War: Pantheocide had it too. Michael-lan gave someone a salad made from cocaine and shrooms or something just to see what would happen, and he didn't realize someone would actually write it all down. He did a pretty good job of figuring out how to actually make a lot of that stuff happen.
