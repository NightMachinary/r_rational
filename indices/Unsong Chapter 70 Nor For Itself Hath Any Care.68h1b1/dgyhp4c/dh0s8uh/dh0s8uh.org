I think the reason the link between Erica and Ana was because they flubbed the ritual. Or maybe it was just one of those inexplicably bizarre bugs of Uriel's, like Boiling A Goat In Its Mother's Milk. Uriel had just a day to design and implement the ritual; he probably didn't have much time to debug it, and he probably only cared to make sure it's going to work between him and Sohu. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_poor_design][Wouldn't be Uriel's first flawed creation.]]

As for whether the ritual was meant for Platonic or romantic relationship: given this exchange from chapter 52

  “IN THE OLDEN DAYS, THE ANGEL SAMYAZAZ AND HIS FOLLOWERS FLED HEAVEN TO ESTABLISH A KINGDOM ON EARTH, WHERE THEY LAY WITH THE DAUGHTERS OF MEN. I DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHY THE DAUGHTERS OF MEN WERE SO INTERESTING. UM. BUT. UM. YOU ARE VERY INTERESTING.”

  “Um,” said Sohu.

...I'm not sure if Uriel understands or cares very much for the distinction. Though ironically, this may mean that contrary to what the exchange between Aaron and Ana in chapter 5 suggests, 'marriage' really /is/ 'just a word' even in the Unsong universe, of all places.
