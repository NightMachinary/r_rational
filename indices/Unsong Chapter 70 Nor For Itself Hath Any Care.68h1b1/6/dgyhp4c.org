Awwwwww! I was right about them being kabbalistically married! That is the sweetest thing ever, and I'm so relieved that Uriel is still around despite having been killed.

(I wonder why he made the ritual only work "properly" with opposite-gender partners. It clearly wasn't even intended as a romantic ritual, since A. that would be gross and B. he calls Sohu his friend. Maybe there's some other reason it wasn't as strong between Ana and Erica. Or maybe he could only get it to work by repurposing a marriage "framework" that still had the original RAM-conserving restrictions in place.)

That whole chapter was badass. It was so satisfying to see all the factions we've met over the course of the story rise up against Thamiel together. And the knock-knock joke was /perfect./

I groaned at "strong arm" though. God /damn/ it.
