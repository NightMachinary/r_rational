Your description had me interested, but the story itself didn't manage to keep it.

Thoughts while reading:

Chapter 1: Boring repetitive background exposition. When will things start happening? Please show don't tell.

Chapter 2: Not interested in reading about a fetus. When is something going to happen?

Chapter 3: Still nothing happening, more exposition, encountered phrase "Suffice to say" where you've summed up your own exposition, checking out.
