  Why? I mean how much mana did the battery have in comparison to the mana he needs?
#+end_quote

Rob's power supply is mana-infused water. That's the standard power source for most magic items, since water is easily obtained, non-toxic, easy to move around, and has a decent thaumic capacity. Lead, on the other hand, has about 11 times the capacity on a volume basis. The battery was partially expended but it still held enough charge to make it worth grabbing, especially since Rob was starting to run /really/ low.

  Also, the 'Previous Chapter' link is sending me to the third chapter instead of the fourth chapter.

Oops! Fixed, thanks.
