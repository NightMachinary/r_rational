After sleeping on all of this, and going back to it, I realize that I should spend a lot more effort on condensing information (or even omitting some!) when posting something with intent to generate discussion.

As is, I believe this comment, and the linked paste IS valuable, since it is a rough outline of how I came across some of these conclusions, but I don't think reddit is the correct place to /explore/ concepts and their consequences. I'm not sure what form of communication would be right for that purpose. (wiki? public google doc? multiplayer notepad?)
