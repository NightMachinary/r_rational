The first meeting of my Applied Bayes group went pretty well! Thanks to those who offered [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/dekobl/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/f2yg8c2/][mascot suggestions]]! Advertising the group was a bit /too/ successful, if anything -- the classroom we were in was packed, with people having to line up along the walls. I think that contributed to its major failing: it went well for a /lecture/ but not a /discussion/, and the 5-10 people who participated primarily engaged in 1-on-1 conversations with me instead of the broader audience. For some reason a solid third of the attendees consisted of math / stats PhDs, postdocs, & PIs, despite my advertising the group as 'beginner friendly' and 'non-rigorous'*. That probably didn't help overall math anxieties (a lot of questions to me were prefaced with 'this is probably really stupid / basic / simple').

Gonna try a few things to open people up in the next meeting and make it more group discussion-y (e.g. include alcoholic options in the snacks / refreshments). We'll see how it goes.

Also chatted to a director of the broader program and was told that while I definitely wouldn't be competitive for their "/senior/ research data analyst" positions, if I were to stick around I should definitely consider applying to their /junior/ role. Which gives me hope that after graduation I won't be hopelessly unemployed & destitute (or, well, mooching off my wife's residency stipend wherever the match puts us).

*(where they were for the previous, more technical iteration idk. Although it can't just be the level of rigor -- my deep learning group from last year was decidedly basic & received a tenth the interest, if that)

edit: in unrelated news, we recently upgraded our coffee machine to a Breville Barista Express (BES870XL) and I've been really enjoying my morning lattes. Coffee connoisseurs might scoff, but to my indelicate palate the shots I pull are definitely comparable to those I get from the 10x as expensive grinder & espresso machine we have at work. Big fan of it overall!
