I was beating myself up pretty bad when I posted that, it was a good experience and I only missed my arbitrary goal time by five minutes but achieved my actual goal of finishing without injury.

In hindsight the pain wasn't too bad, it was just the duration of it. The worst it got was 5/10 for me, just constant invasive muscle soreness pain, which is a level you can "push through" and focus on ignoring. But I was pushing it from mile 14-21 with a "this hurts but I'm doing well" mindset that failed me at mile 22 so I started walking anything I could pretend was a hill.

My 3 training tips: follow a plan, find a running group (especially for the long runs), and avoid the treadmill if you can.

Sticking to a plan helped me feel calmer going into it and prevented me from moving runs around or doing anything crazy/lazy.

Having a running group is great for your spirits, especially when you see them at the actual marathon, and having one that sets up water stations is vital for long runs.

I find running on a treadmill is mentally the hardest, since you can hop off at any time for any "reason". Knowing you just have to run back to where you started is a lot easier than thinking you still have to stay on the treadmill for another half.
