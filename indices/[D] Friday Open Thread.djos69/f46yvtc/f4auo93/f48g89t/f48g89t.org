There's something I've been thinking about and maybe I'll make a topic later if it warrants it.

​

Basically munchkinry tends to be either immoral, or illegal IRL. e.g tax evasion, cheating, manipulation, lying, deadbeat dads, cuckoldry, nepotism etc. Those are all in some way or another exploits that if used with proper planning and creatively could give an immoral actor big advantages with little to no risk.

​

Yet we inherently consider those things immoral, even if rationally some could be used while causing little harm and suffering. Do you think characters in stories where munchkinry is possible in ways we don't consider immoral would see them as inherently immoral ?

​

It's interesting, because when you actually think about potential exploits in our own world in a vacuum without our biased morality lenses, many do exist and could be easily applied but most good people would never even consider using them. We just see them as inherently immoral and evil.

​

Our rational MCs attempting to exploit anything would probably be either severely reprimanded, ostracized, or jailed, for even suggesting the use of said munchkinry. To the npcs it'd likely be akin a colleague casually suggesting you team up to scare some travelers into giving you some snacks, and justifying it by saying the travelers will barely miss it and nobody will actually get hurt.
