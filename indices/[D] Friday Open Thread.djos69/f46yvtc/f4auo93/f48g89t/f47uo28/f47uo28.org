So I just finished Storm Front by Jim Butcher on Audible. I enjoyed the narrator but the character himself was wobbling back and forth between me enjoying him and me calling him an idiot.

Does the series/character improve as it goes on? He seems to handle the idiot ball in quite a few ways that I wouldnt expect someone that describes themselves as a "powerful and experienced wizard" would.

I DID enjoy him as a person though. His humor is dry enough that I enjoy it and I like that he doesnt just complain about everything the whole time.

Secondary point, Ive listened to The Nightmare Stacks by Charles Stross on a recommendation from a few users here. How is the rest of the series comparatively? I was thinking of getting book one and reading through them all.
