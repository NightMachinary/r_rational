It's worth pointing out that the earlier books have a different main character, but the quality is pretty consistent throughout. Perhaps the Jennifer Morgue is an exception; I enjoyed that one the least as it didn't seem to follow the rules of the setting as closely as I'd have expected.

Reading from the beginning gives a lot of nice running jokes and back-references, it's probably worth it.
