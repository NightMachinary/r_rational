Do we ever see a sith deflect blaster bolts? I'm not sure how often we ever see them getting shot at in the first place, but I had the thought and didn't immediately feel like going through a days worth of movies. I guess video games or the tv series-es is acceptable, but i'm primarily thinking of the movies.
