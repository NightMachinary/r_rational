I didn't read all of your comment, but:

  Negative reinforcement

In psychology there's negative reinforcement and punishment, you're mixing them up. The point of torture isn't to reinforce anything, is it? It's just punishment.

I'd say that torture is systematic inflicting of pain against one's will. It works because (most) humans have strong negative utility associated with pain. You could "torture" an AI by systematically inflicting negative utility upon it in ways that it could do nothing about. But at that point the word's definition is stretched a bit from normal use..
