Aside for [[/u/xachariah][u/xachariah]]'s (quite accurate) answer, I'd say people do munchkin and get rewarded for it in real life.

We live in a culture that places a high value on entrepreneurs, and especially start-up makers, people who see an optimization that hasn't been done before and think of ways to apply it at scale.

We have a vibrant, extremely developed ecosystem for finding these people and giving them guidance, funding and leverage; in some countries, we even have the government treating these people has a strategic assets worth subsidizing.

This is nothing new either. The concept of entrepreneurship, and gathering capital to invest in upscaling new innovations is in large part what led to the industrial revolution.
