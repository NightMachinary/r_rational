You're cherry picking examples using the criteria of munchkin AND illegal/immoral, when you should be looking for legal munchkins of which there are plenty but they are pretty "common sense".

Most real life munchkin's are just specialized professionals, like corporate accountants. Corporations are great at munchkining within the law to maximize profit. For example there's a government grants for the common person munchkin named Matthew Lesko, he publishes books and has a website to help people find and get government grants for things you would never think there are grants for like LASIK.

Most of life's optimizations for laypeople are small, or have high costs. We still have revolutions from new optimizations, but they aren't as dramatic as in fiction.
