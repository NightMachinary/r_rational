I used to think that things like eg. manipulating others by telling anything but the literal truth was somehow morally wrong. The problem was - I actually acted on that belief and the results were horrible for me and the people I cared about. So clearly there is some “munchkinry” (ie; using your brain) which is totally fine to apply to everyday situations. But you're right that stories tend to focus on combative situations because, ... uh... it's more interesting?

I'll give you an example of “munchkinry” applied to the real world that I did: the scenario was that I was depressed and my flatmate's cat (which he loved) was missing. For me, it was a substantial effort just to get up and make breakfast (as things are when one is depressed) and I saw a brief glimpse of the cat while doing so. I wasn't close with my flatmate - we pretty much did our own thing. But I thought - if I write a quick text (30sec of my time) that's gonna make his day (and I quickly got a reply saying exactly that), and since I myself enjoy making people happy then it improves my mood significantly too. This, pretty much costlessly, has in all probability made both me and my flatmate significantly more productive (him because less cat worry and me because good start to day where I accomplished something real) - and all it took was a quick text.

When you look at it like that, it seems like an impossible hack - two people getting something (long-lasting benefits) from essentially nothing. But I find the point of view which produces these results in the real world is rare.
