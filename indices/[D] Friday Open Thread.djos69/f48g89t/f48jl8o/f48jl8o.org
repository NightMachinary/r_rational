I don't think that munchkinry is inherently likely to be immoral--it's just that there have to be reasons why people don't take advantage of obvious exploits, and one of those reasons can be "it's immoral."

Real life munchkins that are moral:

- Use electricity and transistors to rapidly do calculations.
- Build structures out of concrete.
- Take advantage of hormonal offswitch for preventing pregnancy.
- Carry water in containers so you won't run out.

These things don't feel like munchkins because they are just things that we do. Munchkins that we /don't use/ have to have a reason why we don't use them.

Examples:

- 3d print an army of 3d printers. (Too complicated.)
- Build structures out of solid steel. (Too expensive.)
- Eat tons of protein to get buff. (Kinda works--but strength depends on a variety of factors.)
- Rent a deceased-person's home for cheap because everyone else thinks it's haunted or creepy. (This one works!)
- Steal money to get rich. (It's immoral and other people will punish you.)

I agree that it would be nice to see munchkins in fiction that are unused for moral reasons. It's hard to write a convincing fictional moral framework.
