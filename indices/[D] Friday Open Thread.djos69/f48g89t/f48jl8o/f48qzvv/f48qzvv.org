Great comment. This is why we should share our thoughts people..

â€‹

Some examples of less commonly used real life munchkins that some of us could actually apply and why most people don't use them:

- Skill focused learning. (It's hard, and requires access to information and enough humility to be willing to learn).
- Exercising. (it's hard, requires a system, habit or planning to do consistently, requires being comfortable standing out).
- Live frugally, save money, retire early. A.k.a FIRE (Saving money is hard, living frugally is hard, having high paying jobs accelerates the process by a lot).
- Hire people to work for you, pay them less than they make you, get free money, repeat until it becomes inefficient. (What most businesses are built on, requires an efficient way to turn labor hours into money, it's hard and risky).
- Buy a duplex, or bigger as your first home. With some special loans for first time home buyers people can buy houses that actually make them money and live for free without needing insane amounts of money. (Saving money is hard, credit ratings, lack of information, housing market needs to be good, people have different priorities when buying homes [neighborhoods, school districts, location, status]).

If anybody has more of these, please share them with us ;)
