Economies of scale to get more for less effort - need to coordinate more people to work towards a bigger goal, any risk is magnified by the bigger size of the project, flooding the market could crash the price.

Marry a rich person to get rich - tons of competition, feeds into the problems of socioeconomic inequality (rich people have better selection of mates to choose from), spouse has reduced incentive to be faithful.

Hypnotize yourself into the ideal person - hypnosis isn't as powerful as people think, risk of unintended side effects, risk of delusion.

Start a cult that does good things - likely to backfire, successful cults tend to have sociopathic leaders that teach insane things.

Train the brain to work like a computer then "download" skill books and study them in your sleep - brains are bad at memorizing large amounts of data, you'd need megabytes worth to be much use.
