It would have to depend on the situation. IRL, we can't munchkin anything because all the low hanging fruit has already been taken. The only things left to munchkin are things that are immoral. I think the same holds true for fictional worlds.

However, a lot of the time characters are able to munchkin because they're categorically different than the the non-main-character. In HPMOR, Harry can munchkin because he's got access to a unique depth of knowledge. In Worm, Taylor can munchkin because she's the only one able to control a million bugs at once. In MoL, Zorian can munchkin due to multiple unique circumstances.

But in D&D where anyone can create an infinite loop of Wish spells? You better believe there's a reason nobody does that, and your best case scenario is a quick and painful death instead of a more eternal punishment.
