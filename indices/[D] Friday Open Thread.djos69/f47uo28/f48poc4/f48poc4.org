Dresden gets better at taking exploits and power as the series goes on, and matures into the talent he has at the beginning. But the people around him are the rational ones - Johnny Marcone, though he falls in prominence, and Thomas Raith, who is introduced in Grave Peril (book 3). If you read through Grave Peril or already know the important spoilers about Thomas ( he's Harry's half-brother ), then check out the novella focused on him, which is called Backup and is published alone and in the collection Side Jobs. (Be warned, the short description of the novella on its Amazon page reveals that spoiler.) It talks about a secret Masquerade-within-the-Masquerade with a war which is conducted much more like a rationalist story.
