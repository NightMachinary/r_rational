Just completed my first marathon! Happy to have finished, not so happy I was mentally weak and walked some parts so I missed my time. I really thought all the "20 miles is the first half" comments were jokes, but they weren't.

I would recommend any lower impact exercise over running, but I do think the marathon was a good experience in self suffering for me.
