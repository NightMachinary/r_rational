Dresden is pretty rational but not extremely intelligent, I think. His emphasis on preparation is very strong. The inciting event of Ghost Story is a particularly strong example. He also regularly attacks problems with a [[https://old.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/c0nqg7/people_seem_to_think_thieves_should_lockpick_or/er6huvz/?context=2][hacker mindset]], IIRC, although no examples come to mind since I haven't read any of the books in a few years. Having values such that he's not willing to sacrifice innocents to save innocents doesn't speak to the quality of his thought processes, so I don't think you should count it against him.
