It's not a series, it's a collaborative piece of fiction on Sufficient Velocity. The background of the setting is basically Infinite Stratos, if you're familiar with that.

If not, the Earth is undergoing alien invasion, and everybody is trying to fight off the aliens together. That's the "Battle Action". The Highschool part is that, using a standard anime trope, the high schoolers can use the fancy war machines to fight said aliens.

Harem + Side Character: The collaborative part controls a side character, not the main harem protagonist, as a trope subversion.
