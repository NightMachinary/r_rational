I liked it, but it was never anything special. The dialogue especially could be extremely trite and cliched at times. The animation/cgi was pretty great though.

Overall I found it kind of depressing, actually. Imagine using those resources on a worm adaptation, or something similar. Then again I was never a fan of anthologies, so maybe it's just me.
