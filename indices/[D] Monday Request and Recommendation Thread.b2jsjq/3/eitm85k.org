Are there any other stories where the main character is the member of a harem rather than being the protagonist-like individual that a typical harem tends to focus around? The following two stories are great examples where the first one has the protagonist be an haremette and the second one is the male friend of an harem protagonist. Even though Leo ends up having a three way relationship later, the story still has novel takes on the typical harem shenanigans.

Training as a member of the United Nations Air Force to combat the growing Antagonist forces, Koujirou is one of less than 100 males out of the 20,000 Valkyries in service. Surrounded by women, can Koujirou find a way to fight the Antagonists, save the world and maybe even find love? It doesn't really matter, cause that's not who this quest is about.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23173/the-simulacrum][The Simulacrum]] [Original Fiction] - An amnesiac guy from our world is sent into a harem romance comedy show, except instead of being the protagonist, which is the typical thing for how these stories tend to go, he is the idiot friend of the protagonist. The world closely follows narrative tropes from the genre and he uses his genre savviness to avoid awkward situations that normally arise out of these stories, and figure out what's going on and why he is here.

Another type of work I'm looking for is where a relatively normal person is thrown into a world that operates on porno logic. Erogamer is the only example I can think of and I'm hoping for more that similarly plays around with the conventions of erotica.
