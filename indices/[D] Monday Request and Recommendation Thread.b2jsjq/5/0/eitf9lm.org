Puella Magi Madoka Magica, available on Netflix (US). I went in blind, highly recommend it.

My two favorite David Fincher movies, Se7en and Fight Club, though it would be hard to be blind for either of them if you hadn't seen them yet.

I'm not sure how obscure you're looking for, as those are all fairly to extremely mainstream.
