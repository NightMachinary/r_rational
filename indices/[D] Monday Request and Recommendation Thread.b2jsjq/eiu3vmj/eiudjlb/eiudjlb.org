The Inheritance Cycle's magic system can do literally anything except resurrect the dead, and the only rule is that your body must contain enough energy to do the thing you are trying to do "manually" or the spell drains all your energy trying to complete and kills you. Comes complete with an explicitly magical language which can be used literally or metaphorically to produce whatever effects.
