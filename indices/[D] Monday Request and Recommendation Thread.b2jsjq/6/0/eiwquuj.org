[[https://needtobecomestronger.wordpress.com/][Need to Become Stronger]] is pretty good. It's a naruto fanfic and the magic system has been revampted in a way that allows for losts of inteligent exploitation. Considering how simler MoL is to naruto (chakra control = shaping skill, Shaping exercises = tree/water walking exercises, indidual spells/jutsu takeing lots of practice the master, etc) the rational naruto magic system starts to look quite simler to MoL.

When I read it the chapter quality went like so: 1-2 (bad), 3-12 (ok), 14-20 (very fucking good), 20-28 (good), 28 - 43 (very good).
