Can anyone recommend me some original English language Xianxia (rational optional). I've read the Cradle Series and the SV quest Forge of Destiny. Both were enjoyable. I've tried to read some translated Xianxia web novels but even the one's I've been told have good translation come across as just about unreadable to me.
