Anyone have any recommendations for fiction with broad but hard and well thought-out magic systems? Broad as in Mother of Learning magic rather than Mistborn magic. It's not too hard to make a hard magic system with very specific and limited abilities like in the Mistborn novels, but I'm looking for examples where magic as a whole can do a lot of things, but somehow still manages to be explained well enough that problems can be solved with it without it seeming like a deus ex machina.
