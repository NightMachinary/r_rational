Here's a list of "power fantasy" books, that might fit your request.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][Worth the Candle]] by cthuluraejepsen - An amazing webnovel that imo blows every other litrpg out of the water. A story of a teenager that finds himself in a world that seems to be a mix of all the worlds that he created as a DM for his DnD group. If the description doesn't appeal to you, try it anyway. It's that good. Almost 1 million words of quality writing in 2.5 years, and *it's free*.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/192821-cradle][Cradle Series]] by Will Wight - Everyone is born with an one of 5 aptitudes in the sacred arts, which shape their paths for the rest of their lives. Lindon is an unsouled, born without.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/45765-night-angel][The Night Angel series]] by Brent Weeks - about an orphan who becomes an apprentice to the best assassin in the world. Pure action, very tightly paced and executed, just like Cradle. Some extreme themes and violence though, be warned. Also, it's the author's first books, so a bit amateurish.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/49673-lightbringer][The Lightbringer series]] also by Brent Weeks - a fat loser teenager discovers that he's a mage when his village is attacked. Great action, great magic system, great worldbuilding. A vast improvement from his first series, which was already pretty good.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13569581-blood-song][Blood Song by Anthony Ryan]] - A young boy is abandoned by his father at an order of warrior monks and learns to become a deadly weapon for his (atheistic) religion. It's pretty cool and original, but the sequels are not as good.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/129874-world-of-prime][World of Prime]] series by M.C. Planck - Middle-aged Guy enters a world where humans are surrounded by monsters and at the risk of annihilation and tries to start an industrial revolution.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/40346-the-dresden-files][The Dresden Files]] Series by Jim Butcher - A story of a small time wizard in Chicago who doesn't care who he pisses off if it gets in the way of doing the right thing. First few books are kind of rough, but they're short and by the 3rd or 4th book it really comes together. If you don't like it by then, give up. It's also a bit too episodic at times, but increasingly connected in later books.
