I read the prologue and I really don't understand why do so many authors name their protagonist with bland, generic, Caucasian names. Fred and Jeff are two of the main protagonists of the novel you mentioned and I don't know if its just me but, I feel very disinterested when I see a Caucasian name like "Joe" as one of the main characters. This is very prevalent in royalroadl as well. Are the authors trying to target a demographic to attract more readers? I for one can't picture a guy named "Bob" as the legendary isekai hero that saved the world.

I don't think I am being prejudiced because I am fine reading novels with Caucasian names. Such as if a character is named "Michael." Prevalent Caucasian name but it has a lore to it as Michael is one of the archangels. Or a character named Harry as in Harry Dresden. Jim butcher the author of the dresden files explained in the beginning that his name is a keepsake for the late magician Harry Houdini.

But for all of the Bobs, Joes, Freds, Bills, and Jeffs in the world, I have no love for you.
