I was thinking about it recently, and I realized that the [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZQMLMS6][Dream trilogy]] is pretty rational, in a gritty sense - the characters have limited intelligence (in both meanings of the term), but they examine their options and do as best they can despite imperfect information and limited time to think.

It also has an interestingly complex story; the antagonists actually take the time to mislead the characters, and the characters have to figure out what's wrong with the narrative the antagonist is spinning in order to figure out what they really need to do to get home.

I'd definitely recommend it, especially if you're into the "pulled into a world with a video game-like system" genre.
