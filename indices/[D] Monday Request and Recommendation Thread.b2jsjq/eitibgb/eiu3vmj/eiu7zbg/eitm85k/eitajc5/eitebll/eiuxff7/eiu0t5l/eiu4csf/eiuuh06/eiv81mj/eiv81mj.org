I do a small amount of amateur writing in my spare time and I find coming up with interesting names is hard. Very hard. You have to think deeply about the symbolism of the name and how it relates to the character. A name is something the reader will hear most often about the character so if you get it wrong you've just made your entire story worse with a single decision.

So sometimes I just say 'fuck it' and write something with a "Jeff" or "Dave" or "bob." They are nice and simple only using a single syllable and I can just start writing something without having to think about it.

Baced on what you said though I don't think the problem is with Caucasian names but with single syllable shortend names. Like Michael, Jeffrey and Fredrick aren't terrible names but when they get shortend they become Mike, Jeff and Fred which are kinda dull.
