I just stumbled on [[https://gamesoftranscendi.wordpress.com/][Simulacrum: A Post-Singularity Story]] and finished reading it today. How do I best put this.....it's a story that follows an insane logic, but in a way such that you can learn to understand the insanity.

It's set in a world (although there is no guarantee that the world isn't real or a virtual reality) and modifying any intelligence to be beyond human is impossible. The only way to become a post-human is by creating a clone (via brain uploading) that is fundamentally smarter than you, and then delete the less intelligent version of you to make way for the new and improved version. Self-improvement is a continuous cycle of iterative death and in-story called 'necromancy' for this very reason. There is a deliberate invoking of the trope, [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance][Values Dissonance]], to convey the counter-intuitiveness of this idea of self-improvement through death and to show the majesty of the Singularity.

I don't consider it a rational story because the setting doesn't feel like it is completely thought out, but the protagonist(s) can be considered rational due to how strongly they commit to their logic of self-improvement.

The webpage I linked to is a little confusing because the author has a log of his life in the same place as the table of contents, so just scroll down for the links to the chapters. Here's the TV Tropes [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Simulacrum][page]] of the story for anyone interested. I'd be interested in discussing this story with anyone.
