Current: Captain Marvel is better if you manage to go in spoiler free. This may be too late.

A girl who is corrupted by the internet is the summoned hero is also enhanced by going in blind, though I doubt many people in this reddit have not read it.

Rosemary Kirsteins Steerswoman series is very good, and more fun if I do not tell you some of the reasons it is fun.

Iain M. Banks, Use of Weapons.

The Prestige. (the movie)

Stross, Halting State and rule 34. Not quite to the extent of the rest of this list, but they are enhanced by it.

Uhm. Past this point, I think my recommendations would start to degenerate into a general rec list, or the things that come to mind are buried 30 episodes into five season series, so I will stop here.
