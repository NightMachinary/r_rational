Does [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/5701/savage-divinity][Savage Divinity]] qualify? There is cultivation and ridiculously powerful experts. I find it quite enjoyable. Not at all rational and later on there is a lot of filler but characters are likeable, fights are fun and MC does try to uplift society with his (quite limited) modern world knowledge.
