  Baatar sighed. Taduk had told him the boy was smart. Did he lie? “The purpose in the demonstration of the Forms is two-fold. First, to build up the body to withstand the infusion of Heavenly Energy. The stronger the body, the more Heavenly Energy it can absorb. The more Heavenly Energy absorbed by the body, the more powerful the warrior. Understand?” The boy nodded after a moment.

  Baatar frowned. The boy spoke a word he didn't understand. “Explain.”

  “I do the Forms and strengthen my body, to absorb more Heavenly Energy, which strengthens my body. Does the strengthening of my body using Heavenly Energy, allow my body to absorb more Heavenly Energy?”

  It took the boy drawing the process out in the dirt for Baatar to understand. A simple circle diagram. Seems Taduk wasn't lying, the boy is smart. “Ah. You are asking if the process is cumulative. No. There is a limit, based on the level of your natural body.”
