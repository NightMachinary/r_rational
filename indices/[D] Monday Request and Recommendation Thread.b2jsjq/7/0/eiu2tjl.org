What a coincidence! I binged the entire season yesterday. LDR doesn't have as much to say as it thinks it does, and a few of the episodes were kind of contrived, but it's definitely a worthwhile watch for the quality of the animations alone, to say nothing, of the interesting worlds it builds.

Personally, I think ZIMA BLUE was the best episode from a "thinky" standpoint, while "LUCKY 13" was the best from an "I-liked-it" standpoint.
