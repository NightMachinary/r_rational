I only know of a few OEL Xianxia to recommend:

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/white-collar-cultivator.44460/][White Collar Cultivator]] was pretty good with an everyman character isekaied into a generic wuxia world and with him digging into the mental differences between mortals and cultivators. He's basically using common-sense and his mastery over bureaucracy to stay alive. Unfortunately, WCC is dead so you might not like the abrupt ending.

You've probably already read [[https://www.amazon.com/Sufficiently-Advanced-Magic-Arcane-Ascension-ebook/dp/B06XBFD7CB][Sufficiently Advanced Magic]], but the power levels of Xianxia is very evident in the books and I think it's adjacent to the genre even if it's missing the Asian cultural influences.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/11397/the-dao-of-magic][The Dao of Magic]] is a fantastic story about a man from Earth who seeks out to scientifically investigate Qi and wants to completely rebuild cultivation society into one where everyone isn't back-stabbing each other all the time.
