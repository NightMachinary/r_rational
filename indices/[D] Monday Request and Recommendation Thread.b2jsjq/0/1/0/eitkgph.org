Thanks. I might give The Dao of Magic of much a try.

I'm honestly not sure why there aren't more OEL Xianxia. I mean, there's something of a fad for Xianxia at the moment, driven by the translated web novels. Books like the Cradle Series are selling really well. Quests like Forge of Destiny are really popular.

Why aren't there a thousand follow-the-leader stories out there, just like the thousand isekai clones and the thousand LitRPG clones?
