Not much. There's some influence in the characters' names which sound Asian for the most part. There's also the trappings of the Xianxia genre itself, but that's not very Asian since a lot of it is similar to the leveling up and skills of LitRPG, minus any stats.

I suggest reading the free sample of the first [[https://www.amazon.com/Unsouled-Cradle-1-Will-Wight/dp/0989671763/ref=asc_df_0989671763/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312195849562&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=1165998674239578925&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9007926&hvtargid=pla-495222356045&psc=1][book]] on Amazon. It gives an accurate idea of the tone for the series. If you don't like it after reading the free sample, then don't bother.
