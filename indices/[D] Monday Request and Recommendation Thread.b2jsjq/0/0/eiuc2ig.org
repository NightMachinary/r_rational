[[https://lsdell.com/chapter-001-first-floor/][Taint]] is an Xianxia that I quite enjoyed, in fact I am just about to start re reading it.

The bad:

- The first few chapters are kinda dull. It took a while (chapter 13-ish) to get the point where I was actively enjoying it and not just reading it for answers to the mysterys.

- The main character is not a good person. She has a goal to which everything else is secondary. Not only that but she spends years traped in a tower alone with nothing but demons and as a result is quite feral. Like she flat out murders innocent people because she couldn't understand a simple social cue.

The good:

- There are some fucking amazing fight scenes. They really manage to capture the enormous power of the characters involved and it only gets better as the story gose on.

- The magic system is well thought out and, dare I say it, quite rational. Every so often a new rule will be introduced and there will be an ah ha! moment as every thing up to that point slides into place.

- I for one found a few side characters quite like able and I found my really feeling for the main character. I wanted her to do well and succeed on an emotional level.

If you hate the translation then you could try a pictographic medium which relies less on language.

Try [[https://ta1.taadd.com/files/img/logo/201506/201506051350475547.jpg][Zui Wu Dao]] or Tail of demons and God's.
