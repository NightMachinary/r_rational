  as opposed to a sentient being with a strong moral compass being the gatekeeper to such destruction, we get Jake.

Are you saying he's not sentient? Or maybe that he doesn't have a strong moral compass? :P

He's smart, and he's got (what I think is) a good moral compass, he just has a failure-to-think-ahead problem.

As to him destroying the world...well, he threatened it, and was prepared to go through with it -- only because he knew that, as long as he was prepared, he wouldn't have to. Still.

(In case anyone's wondering: he sacrificed the 'blow up the world' idea to Herrún back when she was being re-reified. That big, overcomplicated plan that he used to escape Flobovia, that required him making deals with basically everyone? His deal with Herrún was to get that idea back, hence why he was able to do it.)
