I think my wording's just kind of ambiguous. I was comparing Jake to Superman. With Superman, the threat is purely within him. No one (beyond mind control not present in Metropolitan Man) is going to make him do anything, beyond your regular threats and manipulation, whereas with Jake's situation, once someone gets their hand on a Wish scroll, they've got autonomy to fuck things up.

So I was moreso saying on one hand, the threat is a super powered sentient being. On the other hand, the threat is a cache of items, free to be used by anyone that can subvert Jake.
