I see what you're saying. I'm sure you've read Metropolitan Man, and I'm thinking kind of like that story's Lex Luthor. There's plenty of potential good to be had, but does the statistically small (but still possible) chance of complete human extinction worth said good? And even worse, as opposed to a sentient being with a strong moral compass being the gatekeeper to such destruction, we get Jake. I don't think he'd ever destroy the world, I just really doubt his capacity to predict consequences of his actions and/or protect the scrolls from those who would abuse them. Although, for all I know, he'll Wish up certain contingencies. Most likely after his first big fuck up. It fits his pattern :P
