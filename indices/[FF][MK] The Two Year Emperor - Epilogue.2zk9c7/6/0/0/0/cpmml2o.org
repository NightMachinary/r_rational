Like I said, Jake's not the most forethoughtful guy. I think his thought process was first "Sure, why not?" and if he thought beyond that it was "meh, it can do just as much good as harm so I'll just be careful to only use it for good. Better to have the option and not use it."

EDIT: For the record, I don't always agree with my characters. This is one of those times where I'm not sure if I do or do not.
