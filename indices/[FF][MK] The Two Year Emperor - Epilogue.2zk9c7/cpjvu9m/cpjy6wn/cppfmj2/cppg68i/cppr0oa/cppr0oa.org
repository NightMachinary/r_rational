We don't know that we're on a separate multiverse. We could just be a separate plane, so gods could get here just as easily as they could go to the plane of fire. [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/planes.htm#deadMagic][We wouldn't be the only plane without magic.]] I think not having immortal souls is the norm outside of the Prime Material Plane. Mortals managed to take Jake from our universe and send him back with other stuff. If mortals can move to and from this world, it would be surprising for gods not to be able to. There are gods worshiped here. It's possible for a god to get power through means other than worship, such as the god of death getting power from undead. We don't know whether or not gods in our world would be able to get power from worship in another world.
