When Jake was filling his backpack did he toss in just any magic item he could find or were there any items he refused to bring with him due to being too dangerous? Also how are they(as in the governments) going to handle any wish scrolls that were brought over? Can you imagine what would happen if some omnicidal lunatic got his hands on a wish scroll then decided to cause as much damage as possible, made even worse if he has an internet connection or is an experienced and creative D&D player. Loved the ending by the way and looking foward to reading your future works.
