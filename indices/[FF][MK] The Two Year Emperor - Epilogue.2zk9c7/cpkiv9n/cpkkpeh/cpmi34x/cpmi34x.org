Personally, I kinda feel like the wish scrolls should've been left behind in that case. Unless he's planning some hard-core regulation, and has a way to say "Fuck Off" to every major world government and organization as well, once his claims are proven valid, and the wish scrolls are proven valid, I feel like any number of agencies will hunt him down to obtain them. Even if it's just to lock them away so that no one else can use them either. I get that some people will argue that they can do just as much good as bad, but rational statistics aren't always correct. It only takes one fucked up wish to wipe out all life in our universe, even if that wasn't its original intent.
