  Y'know, if they're worried about Jake raising an army, then why let him have all of those magic items? Was him bringing that HH a condition of the bombs not going off?

Yep. At that point he could have said "and before I go, I want you all to paint yourselves blue and dance the Watusi naked on Jeweler's Square" and they'd pretty much have said "well, crap. Maybe this whole 'planning to murder him' thing /wasn't/ such a good idea." ...and then gone and done it.
