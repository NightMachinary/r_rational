Y'know, if they're worried about Jake raising an army, then why let him have all of those magic items? Was him bringing that HH a condition of the bombs not going off?

  Anyway. The plan was too complicated by half, but it worked. A month before I was going to be executed, I went to the Archmagi and told them that, unless they sent me home, each of my two thousand spell engines was going to go off and Polymorph Any Object a pebble into a cubic meter of antimatter neutronium. Then, of course, I had to explain what neutronium is, which took a while. Anyway. Moving on.
