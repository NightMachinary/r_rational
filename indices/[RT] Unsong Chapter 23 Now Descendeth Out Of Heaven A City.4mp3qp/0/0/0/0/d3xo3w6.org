Not a Metaphor anagrams neatly to Hop a Metatron - possibly displaying their intent to 'jump' the Metatron, as a group.

Honestly, I think the one thing that Captain Nemo very definitely is not is an ordinary human being.

Edit: Actually, I could see him turning out to be some super enlightened guy, actually. I could see it turning out that Captain Nemo is in some respect a reaction to The Illuminatus! Trilogy's Hagbard Celine (and therefore a second-order reaction to Atlas Shrugged's Ragnar Danneskj√∂ld, who Hagbard Celine is in some respects a reaction to). The whole 'mysterious figure who is enlightened and sails in a mysteriously amazingly powerful ship that is colored unusually dispensing whatever plot-actions are required' archetype is something I could definitely see Scott drawing on.
