This is probably irrelevant, but:

#+begin_quote
  “IN ORDER TO INSTANTIATE THE NEW JERUSALEM, YOU MUST GATHER TOGETHER ALL OF THE LSD IN THE CITY AND PLACE IT IN A RESERVOIR WHICH I WILL SHOW YOU"
#+end_quote

It feels like this "which I will show you" formulation is very similar to God's demand of Abraham that he take his son to be sacrificed:

NIV Genesis 22:2

#+begin_quote
  "Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on a mountain I will show you.”
#+end_quote

(I only remembered this because of Hyperion. The Scholar's Tale: The River Lethe's Taste is Bitter has left scars)
