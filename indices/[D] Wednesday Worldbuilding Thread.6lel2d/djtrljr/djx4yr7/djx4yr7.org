  Sluggy Freelance keeps pulling random new ideas about of nowhere, but the rules about how the setting works are pretty darn consistent. I'm wondering if it's possible to create a goofy kitchen-sink setting like this on purpose rather than the usual method of adding more wackiness to an already goofy story as it goes on?
