Every now and then I hear an idea so absurd that I just want to see it brought to life. A film company run by mobsters who kidnap actors and rob banks to make movies and tv shows, dragons hosting a show about food who travel around the world eating exotic /people/, or robots who attack live theater performances because they hate live theater. These are the kind of wacky ideas I love to see in sci-fi/fantasy comedies, but what puts my favorites in this subgenre a step above the others is when the story makes a surprising amount of sense.

The Bill & Ted movies are actually kind of rational, even the titular pair are self-aware of their own stupidity. Sluggy Freelance keeps pulling random new ideas about of nowhere, but the rules about how the setting works are pretty darn consistent. I'm wondering if it's possible to create a goofy kitchen-sink setting like this /on purpose/ rather than the usual method of adding more wackiness to an already goofy story as it goes on?

I haven't read One Piece yet, but from what I've heard about the setting it does a pretty decent job of justifying the weirdness from the get-go. Islands are relatively isolated by weird science rules and sea monsters, random people find Devil Fruits that give them unique superpowers, and the oligarchical government's desire to control everything encourages people to become pirates. The world lends itself to weird adventures and characters with unique backgrounds.

However, I don't want to rip off One Piece right now. I'd much rather rip off something like Rifts (or the much better Breachworld) where a bunch of extradimensional insanity has been dumped onto Earth and reshaped the world. Base Raiders has an interesting framing device of breaking into abandoned bases that belonged to superheroes in a kitchen-sink comic book universe, but that almost seems too grounded for what I'm trying to do. Any thoughts?
