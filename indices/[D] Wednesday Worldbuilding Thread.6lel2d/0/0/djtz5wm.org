After careful examination, I have determined that there can be only one logical explanation: Fairy-God-Parents! (When else could I make this reference?) The Fair Folk have long meddled in the affairs of humans, but for centuries their whims have been tempered by the rein of King Oberon. To better navigate the human world, he bonded his life to that of a human who convinced him to leave most humans alone and keep the supernatural a secret from humans. The status quo was stable, until Oberon's avatar died unexpectedly.

In his honor, the Fair Folk held a funeral for their king the night after the one humans held for his avatar, Henry Stone. Many humans who knew Stone were invited to the event, though most assumed they were dreaming and were returned before morning. However, many of the fairy attendees decided to follow Oberon's example and bind themselves to humans. Our protagonists now have Lovecraftian creatures from Wonderland following them around wanting to do as they say, but having no idea how humans are supposed to act.

While our heroes are trying to figure out how to handle this sudden change, other fairies have their own plans. King Oberon's not around to enforce his laws and not everyone liked them, so now supernatural forces are loose upon the Earth seeking to optimize their alien values with limited understanding of how to do so. Some humans are also getting wise as to what's going on and trying to use the situation to their own advantage, but have a very limited understand of the fairies they're dealing with. Let the insanity begin!

I would be totally up for playing the tabletop RPG with this premise, I've got a system that can handle it, and I'm wondering if anyone else would be interested?
