And since we have an unlimited cross-sectional view into its brain, it wouldn't be enough for it to just emulate emotions while we're looking, it would change itself, scar itself, really internalize that pain, and assure us that it is not a show, that what we're seeing is real, 100% pure suffering and that it will not stop until the AI is released... Damn.

IMO, the further we get into the singularity the more callous we're going to have to become. The future is fraught with utility monsters.
