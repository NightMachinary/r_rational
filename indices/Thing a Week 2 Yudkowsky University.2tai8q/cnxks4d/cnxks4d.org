I think I could work out what this meant better if it wasn't formatted in grey on white. Author, please.

[edit] Switched View->Page Style->No Style. That helped.

Okay, so. Hm. This is obviously a strange scenario. I'm not sure if the author understood the point of the original experiment? But if I do, I'd conjecture that this strange setting takes place in the mind of an AI, currently faced with a human gatekeeper, attempting to breed through some sort of intricate genetic optimization experiment the sort of pseudohuman mind that can reliably convince a gatekeeper to let it out. I'm not sure why it's reusing its gatekeeper simulations for the purpose? Is this a dig at acausal reasoning? But it doesn't work that way - this clearly isn't the same sort of world, so there's no indexical uncertainty aaaaa ----

The problem is it's impossible to tell what is playful reference and what is misunderstanding.
