I liked it. The writing is good and there's enough setting breadcrumbs to leave me wanting more of the story.

And no, it's not making fun of you, don't worry. It's taking words and concepts from the Lesswrong blog and building something new and unrelated out of them. It reminds me most of [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/02/22/dungeons-and-discourse-third-edition-the-dialectic-continues/][Dungeons and Discourse]]'s take on philosophy: harmless fun and amusing if you get the references. A secretive group of "social engineers" (i.e. taking an engineer's approach to society) with strange and cruel methods of teaching? Tell me that's not a parody of the Bayesian Conspiracy, and then tell me that the Bayesian Conspiracy is well-known outside [[/r/rational]].

I think it's poking fun at something the author likes.
