I'm not sure it was trying to say anything, really. It felt a little bit like it was trying to poke fun at some of the LessWrongian hero worship. They're trapping people in boxes and doing a warped version of the AI box experiment ... and the whole point of it seems to be that they're trying to figure out how Yudkowsky did it, divorced from any real objective good.

But mostly I think it's not trying to send any sort of message at all.
