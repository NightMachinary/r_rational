I had trouble understanding too.

Um, I think they are putting people (Negotiators) in boxes, and there are Gatekeepers. At the end of the contract, the Gatekeeper becomes a Negotiator and enters the box. New admissions are prepped with info on becoming negotiators.

But I don't understand what they're trying to get Nick to do, or what a placebo is.
