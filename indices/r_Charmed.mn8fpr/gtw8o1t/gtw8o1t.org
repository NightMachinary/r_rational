It's ben a long, long time since I watched any of that show, so I barely remember anything beyond the premise.

And there isn't really much here yet to critique, so I'm going to reserve judgement, beyond one note:

#+begin_quote
  an ancient line of magic practitioners from Salem
#+end_quote

I know that's part of the original show's mythology, so I'm not going to blame you if you keep it, but this is a [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SalemIsWitchCountry][trope]] that really annoys me. Part of what makes the Salem Witch Trials so despicable is that the accusations that got people killed were completely unsubstantiated, and putting real witches into historical Salem undermines that.

Again, this is directly from the show, so I understand if you want to keep it. And there are some opportunities there to do something clever and yet respectful to the victims of the original Witch Trials. But just be mindful that this trope can be very problematic if used carelessly.
