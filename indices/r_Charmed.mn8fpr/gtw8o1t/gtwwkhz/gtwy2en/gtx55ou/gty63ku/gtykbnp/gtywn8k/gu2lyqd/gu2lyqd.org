  No, because the source of the power was the point of the name. If you called someone a "witch" in Salem in the late 17th century, you were explicitly accusing them of bargaining with Satan for the power to do the things you were also accusing them of doing.

Well, you enter a pact with a supernatural entity, it provides you with power, and you do whatever the entity likes, good for some entities or evil for others. Sounds still conceptually the same to me :)

Anyway, even if we consider "witch" to be /defined/ as "Satan-worshipper". Either it's true in-universe - that's a very different premise from what we have been discussing, and it will preclude us from having "good witches" in our plot either (and I tend to agree that using an IRL place famous for witch trials might not be a good decision for that plot. though Lovecraft had used it, IIRC); or it was a superstition in medieval times, which were plenty IRL as well, and which will be treated in-universe just like other old superstitions are treated IRL.

  But what if those fictional German Jews traced their ancestry in Germany back to the (non-existent in real life, but frequently appearing in Nazi propaganda) Jews who sabotaged Germany's war effort in WWI?

If all, or most of the Jews were involved in that conspiracy - this plot would be problematic for the same reason, implying that nazis were right and justified. But if we play around with an idea of a conspiracy... A benevolent Jewish conspiracy spanning the whole world or country: oddly specific and unrealistic, but at least not antisemitic, okay from that point, I guess. A local "good conspiracy" of Jews just helping each other: that's just a normal Jewish diaspora :) Or if we're back to evil conspiracies on a local scale, that would be Jewish mafia, not impossible as well. And imagining a world where such mafia did indeed exist, or there was a couple of high-ranking officials in Germany that secretly worked against it in WWI, which happened to be Jewish - that wouldn't make Holocaust any less horrible or justified by any measure, and contemporary stories about Jews any less appropriate, even if they feature descendants of said officials.
