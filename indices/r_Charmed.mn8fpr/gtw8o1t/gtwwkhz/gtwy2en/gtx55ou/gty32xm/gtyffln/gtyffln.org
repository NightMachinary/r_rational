Agreed. Now if we look at the issue from that angle, the person being tried for causing harm with magic could theoretically do it by non-magical means - the issue was that they didn't do it, whether with magic or anything else. Magic itself is only tangential here, the core of the issue is "something bad is happening, let's blame the outsider". In our world, outsiders were baselessly accused of causing harm with magic; in a world with magic, magical abilities would likely make one an outsider, and they would still be baselessly accused of causing harm.
