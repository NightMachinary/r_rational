  You wouldn't choose New York as your urban fantasy witch homeland because NYC isn't /known for witches/.

+I don't care.+ I don't mind NYC isn't known for witches.

But perhaps you mean that my hypothetical story would lose readers in such a case? If so, I don't care about losing readers whose moral compass is incompatible with mine.

Or perhaps you mean that such a story would no longer be, /by definition/, urban fantasy? If so, I'm fine with that. It would just be a different kind of story.

As a side note, my criticism is in the moral level, and so it can't be countered by pointing out supposed literary conventions - I'd simply declare those hypothetical conventions morally flawed as well.
