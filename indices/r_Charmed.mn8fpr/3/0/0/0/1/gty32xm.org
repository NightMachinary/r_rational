  I think the objection is beside the point anyway. Imagine that witchcraft is real, and people executed for it were actually witches; does it make executions any more justified? Not in the slightest, I'd say.

Executions for /only/ being a witch are not justified. But my very shaky, very brief familiarity with that topic suggests that the trials were the result of what were perceived as consequences of evil magic rather than simply being a witch. So, the trial was for casting hexes to make people feel worse or hurt them rather than casting good magic to grow crops or make people taller or just doing something completely neutral like making a playing card disappear or making a rock shinier.

Are executions for evil magic justified? In modern times, people are almost never killed as a legal punishment for anything but if someone does something evil using power that could potentially be overwhelming and let them escape any other punishment, there's not much other choice left.

  And from the story perspective, if you have a story set in a world "exactly like ours, but also with magic", it's logical that places associated with magic in our world will have established magical traditions in that one.

I don't think it's logical to make the setting one where the association with magic is the most negative in the world. The second most famous magical work in the world and the origin work of this subreddit wasn't set in Salem and never actually went there. Britain isn't the most magical place as a setting for Hogwarts but IMO a neutral place is better than Salem. I'm sure there are other magical places that can be used where witches weren't actually killed IRL, e.g. Stonehenge.
