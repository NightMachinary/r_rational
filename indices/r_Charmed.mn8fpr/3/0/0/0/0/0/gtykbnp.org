  either you were a saint working miracles in God's behalf, or you got your power from Satan, and used it to harm people

Well, given this view, isn't a saint basically a "good witch", just by another name? The concept itself of someone using supernatural powers for good is anything but new. In our hypothetical magical world, I could easily imagine people who didn't call themselves saint (either for moral reasons, or because they were known before for un-saintly behavior, or whatever) but wanted to prove with their own example that magic users can be as good as anyone else - only to utterly fail because of overwhelming prejudice. Or knowing that but still not wanting to join the religious lot, and practicing magic secretly.

I agree completely that the core of the problem was persecuting innocent people, not magic; but I still think it doesn't change anything for our discussion. Let's consider a real life parallel: there were (and still are) lots of conspiracy theories about Jews, accusing them of all possible mortal sins. Nazi Germany was quite (in)famous for putting those theories into practice and persecuting lots of innocent people because of that (it doesn't make Germany "famous for Jews", of course, but if there were only a handful of places in the world where Jews lived, it would be famous for them too); yet I don't see any problems with a story about Jews in contemporary Germany. I /would/ see a problem with a story about an evil Jewish conspiracy being uncovered by nazi heroes, but that's not what we were talking about?
