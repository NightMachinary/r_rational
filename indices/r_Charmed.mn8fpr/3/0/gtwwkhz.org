  Part of what makes the Salem Witch Trials so despicable is that the accusations that got people killed were completely unsubstantiated, and putting real witches into historical Salem undermines that.

As opposed to what? The actual completely valid witch hunts that caught witches using their magic powers?

It sounds like you're just saying that he shouldn't be allowed to make a story where witches are real at all.

If you're making an urban fantasy story that says that witches are real, then /anywhere/ known for witches that you name has a history of which hunts. There were tens of thousands, and not just limited to one city in the US.
