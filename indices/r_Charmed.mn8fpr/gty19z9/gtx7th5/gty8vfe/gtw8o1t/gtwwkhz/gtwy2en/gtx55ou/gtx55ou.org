  It might be kind of like people centuries from now jokingly referencing modern police brutality.

No need to wait for centuries, pretty sure that Charlie Hebdo or someone did it already.

I think the objection is beside the point anyway. Imagine that witchcraft is real, and people executed for it were actually witches; does it make executions any more justified? Not in the slightest, I'd say. It doesn't make that history any better or lighter. And from the story perspective, if you have a story set in a world "exactly like ours, but also with magic", it's logical that places associated with magic in our world will have established magical traditions in that one.
