Isn't that the basis of every single lawsuit ever made though? Something bad happened, someone gets accused. You can't just take "they didn't do it" or "it's a baseless accusation" as an axiom - we know magic doesn't exist so from an outside perspective it's available as an axiom but it would not have been in Salem times. If you had only all the knowledge available to a Salem resident, there would have been enormous gaps in understanding of natural phenomena that could have been understandably filled with magic.
