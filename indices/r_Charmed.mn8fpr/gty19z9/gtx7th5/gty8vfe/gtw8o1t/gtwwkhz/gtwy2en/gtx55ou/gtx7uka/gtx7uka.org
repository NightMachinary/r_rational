By that argument no fiction about witches should allude to any Euro-Christian myths, because any use of that makes light of the unwarranted bigotry and massively brutal crimes against people of non-Catholic faiths, users of folk medicine and women in general. Any mention of relationships to horned entities, contact with non-angelic supernatural beings, flight, manifestation of harmful phenomena through non-Christian chants, above average beauty, hook noses, portrayal as unmarried adults, magical sacrifice for personal gain, divination and anything else really is all just bigoted caricature and fear mongering against various real people that were marginalized and oppressed throughout history.
