  As opposed to what? The actual completely valid witch hunts that caught witches using their magic powers?

Setting it in Salem isn't potentially objectionable because the story can only have powerful witches come from a place where the real world /also/ had real witches, but because in that place in the real world, there were innocent people framed for witchcraft and murdered by the system, and having a story with real witches coming from that place can be perceived to undermine those people's suffering.

So I'd perceive actual witches in e.g. New York to be less objectionable than actual witches in Salem, as far as a story goes.

Edit: But I'm not faulting the author for not realizing this - before I read the comment, I hadn't realized it either.
