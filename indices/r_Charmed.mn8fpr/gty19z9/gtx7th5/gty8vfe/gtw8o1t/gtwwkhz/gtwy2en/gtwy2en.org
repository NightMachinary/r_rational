I guess having witches come from a place known for the brutal injustice against people accused of witchcraft kind of makes light of that brutal history.

It might be kind of like people centuries from now jokingly referencing modern police brutality.

I personally don't have a problem with the Salem witch thing, but I can see why someone might if their personal experiences cause them to relate heavily to those victims.
