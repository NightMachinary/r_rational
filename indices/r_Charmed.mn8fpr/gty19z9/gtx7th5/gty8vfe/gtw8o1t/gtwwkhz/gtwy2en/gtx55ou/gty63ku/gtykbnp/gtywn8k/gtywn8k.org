  Well, given this view, isn't a saint basically a "good witch", just by another name?
#+end_quote

No, because *the source of the power was the point of the name*. If you called someone a "witch" in Salem in the late 17th century, you were explicitly accusing them of bargaining with Satan for the power to do the things you were also accusing them of doing.

And "good Satan-worshipper" wasn't exactly a concept that existed back then, either.

  I don't see any problems with a story about Jews in contemporary Germany.
#+end_quote

Of course not. But what if those fictional German Jews traced their ancestry in Germany back to the (non-existent in real life, but frequently appearing in Nazi propaganda) Jews who sabotaged Germany's war effort in WWI? To my mind, that would be a better parallel to a witch tracing their ancestry back to Salem.
