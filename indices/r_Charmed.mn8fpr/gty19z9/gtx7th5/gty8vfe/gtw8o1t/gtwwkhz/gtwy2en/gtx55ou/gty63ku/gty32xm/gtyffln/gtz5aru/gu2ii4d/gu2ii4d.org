  Isn't that the basis of every single lawsuit ever made though? Something bad happened, someone gets accused

Yes, sure, but you need some evidence for the accusation, and the evidence needs to be better than "he has a gun, he must be the murderer!" (and no matter that the victim was stabbed, not shot). I assume the evidence in witch trials was more of the kind I described. It was a baseless accusation not just because magic isn't real, but because there was no good evidence for it (and we can say for sure that there wasn't any good evidence, because where could they possibly find it when magic isn't real :) ).
