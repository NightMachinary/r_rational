  Well, you enter a pact with a supernatural entity, it provides you with power, and you do whatever the entity likes, good for some entities or evil for others. Sounds still conceptually the same to me :)

Exactly. You're coming at this with a modern sensibility. You're not thinking like a colonial Puritan from 17th Century Massachusetts. And, if your story is just set in the present day, then fine. Call your magic users "witches" and I have no problem with it. Heck, have them hail from Salem. Plenty of modern-day Wiccans there. It's when you reach into the past and put a modern definition of the word into the minds and onto the lips of people who thought about "witches" very differently that you start encountering problems.

  Either it's true in-universe - that's a very different premise from what we have been discussing

...At which point, when the universe is supposed to be basically "Ours, but magic is real," you have to start justifying why colonial Puritans from 17th Century Massachusetts had a different definition of the word "witch" than they did in our own world, and things get sticky.

  or it was a superstition in medieval times, which were plenty IRL as well, and which will be treated in-universe just like other old superstitions are treated IRL

And yes, I would think that's absolutely fine; it's one of the suggestions I made [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/mn8fpr/rcharmed/gty63ku/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3][a few posts ago]]: to "use it as a pejorative, with practitioners preferring a different term but being called 'witches' by ignorant mobs."

  If all, or most of the Jews were involved in that conspiracy - this plot would be problematic for the same reason, implying that nazis were right and justified.

Why would numbers make it more problematic? The parallel is that both sets of fictional, modern-day protagonists would be descended from people who, in our world, were made up to justify the killing of other, innocent people. Whether you would agree with that justification or not, it's converting lies -- horrible lies, that to a contemporary sensibility, were considered sufficient justification for trial and execution -- and making them truths in the narrative.

The whole historical point of the Salem Witch Trials is that *there were no witches in Salem* (also, no witches anywhere else, but that's not as important to the point about Salem). The entire saga is a lesson we should learn about how petty grudges and paranoia can reach a critical mass and result in a lot of innocent people getting killed. Undermining that point because the town's name is a convenient pop culture reference is just sheer lazy writing.
