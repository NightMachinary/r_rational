  Imagine that witchcraft is real, and people executed for it were actually witches; does it make executions any more justified?

Well, that depends on what the witches were doing, doesn't it?

Historically, witches have been accused of causing infertility, blight, drought, plague, birth defects, and all other hosts of things. If someone, by their very presence, is wreaking death and destruction throughout your community, letting them continue to live among you isn't really a good option, and exiling them is just outsourcing the sorrow to someone else.

Part of the problem I'm having composing a reply to [[/u/Xachariah][u/Xachariah]]'s question is that the idea of a "good witch," in the sense that J.K. Rowling or L. Frank Baum wrote about them, is historically new. At the times and in the places that witch trials like the one in Salem happened, there were only two sources for supernatural power: either you were a saint working miracles in God's behalf, or you got your power from Satan, and used it to harm people. So bringing the modern definition of "witch" as "something not necessarily bad" back into the time of the witch trials creates an anachronism, which makes it difficult to bring it back forward again.

Personally, if I were writing a story from scratch, I'd either avoid the word entirely, or date its use for actual magical practitioners back to no earlier than when it started getting used in a positive sense, or use it as a pejorative, with practitioners preferring a different term but being called "witches" by ignorant mobs. Likely some combination of the last two, with the "it was used to historically persecute us!" people perpetually annoyed with the "we're reclaiming it!" folks and vice versa.

But even if I did use the term, If stay the Hell (pun intended) away from places like Salem, because they're *not* "famous for witches:" what they're famous for is the ignorant persecution of innocent people. And confusing "hunting witches" with "persecuting innocent people" is *exactly the problem*.

([[/u/Xachariah][u/Xachariah]], I'm probably not going to compose a separate reply to your own post, as I think the above answers your question about as well as I am able to answer it)
