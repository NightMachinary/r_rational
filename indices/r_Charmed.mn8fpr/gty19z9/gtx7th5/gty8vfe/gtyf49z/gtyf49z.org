I hear what you are saying but I dig the new Charmed because it does hit the marks with the nostalgic feeling. I think their first season, they were trying a little too hard but it's nice to see them working in multi-season arcs and taking things a little slower. The problem with the original is that it kept trying to reinvent itself and wandered off into Sillyville.

As a fan of both, just my thoughts.

Cheers,

Martin
