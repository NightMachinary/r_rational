Thank you all for your kind, insightful words. I really appreciate knowing there's an audience that is enjoying my story at face value. I posted the first chapter and probably won't get back to this until sometime this week, but I do hope you are enjoying.

Healthy conversations about urban fantasy/magical realism are my favorite. Charmed was very much so that show for me.

Cheers.
