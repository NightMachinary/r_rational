Yup, that's me! And you're welcome, you deserve it. I'll probably bump up my pledge eventually, I'm just still trying to figure out what a reasonable monthly budget is for me to spend on supporting the various authors and translators whose work I read.

About how I found it, I'd known about it for a while, just from having seen the chapters posted here on [[/r/rational]], and I've been following your Rational Writing audio series. I had a long backlog of stuff to read though, so I just hadn't gotten around to it until recently. (btw, if you got a bunch of spelling/grammar reports in the last 48 hours, those were probably mostly me.)

Now it's gonna be torture having to wait a month between updates because I'm so into it! But I followed HPMOR from the time the very first chapter was posted on LW, so I'll manage somehow. Planning on starting on /Mother of Learning/ tomorrow.

(As a random thought, have you considered setting a Patreon goal for more frequent updates? Like once you reach $X/mo, posting a chapter every 3 weeks instead of every month? I know a few fan translators for Japanese light novels who do something similar, but I'm not sure how extensible that is to original writing, or for your personal situation. Might help bring in more patrons and/or increase the pledged amounts, so just figured I'd bring it up.)
