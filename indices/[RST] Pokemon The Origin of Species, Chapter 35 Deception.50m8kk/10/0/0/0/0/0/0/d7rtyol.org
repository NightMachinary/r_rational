  Uh oh. I haven't received any... my plugin might be on the fritz

Well, I said a "bunch", but it was more like 5 or 6, spread across all 35 chapters, so not a huge deal if you missed my feedback specifically. The only spelling mistake I remember is in the second(?) interlude where you said "Was" instead of "Wax". The others were just minor subject/verb plurality or conjugation agreement and a missing preposition (a "to" I think) somewhere. But yeah, worth taking a look. I actually thought that plugin was one of the coolest things I'd seen in a while, so would be nice if it worked properly, though if a comment/explanation field could be added to it, it'd be even better, as I sometimes had trouble trying to figure out what to highlight to convey the issue when it wasn't just a spelling mistake.

  there's no realistic pledge amount that would free up time to write that much more.

Yeah, I figured after reading your FAQ. Just wishful thinking on my part. :) When I've had to make similar work-time vs money tradeoffs in the past, I started using pickup-dropoff laundry service instead of going to the laundromat myself, paying for a house-cleaner instead of doing it myself, and having a Virtual Assistant take care of some of the more tedious aspects of running my business.

#+begin_quote
  I'm still thinking over ways to expedite the process so that maybe, with some reader assistance, I'll be able to get through those parts faster.

Well, if you ever feel like test-driving anything, I'm open to giving it a shot. I can do near-professional-level editing of academic and business writing (so sentence structure, phraseology, & spelling/grammar) and probably slightly above average content & storytelling editing/feedback from a literary perspective (I used to be involved in some creative writing feedback groups on sffworld), and I'm a seasoned LessWrong veteran for all that's worth. Feel free to give me a shout if you want to run anything by me, even if just as an experiment.

Cheers!
