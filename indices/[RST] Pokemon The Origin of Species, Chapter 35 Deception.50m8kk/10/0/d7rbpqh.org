Thanks for the feedback!

So there's something I'm struggling with a bit, and namely it's that there's only so much screen time to devote to every activity Red and the others engage in. I try to summarize their travels to keep the story going, and I've been also trying to do the same with their training. Red and Leaf are both still training their pokemon to make them stronger: they just don't focus on it the way Blue does, so it doesn't take up screen time.

I'm planning on only highlighting his training when it's in reaction to something specific, or has some particularly important thing happen (like when a pokemon evolves). But the trade off to that is that it seems like he's not doing it all that much, which I'll definitely have to work on making more clear.
