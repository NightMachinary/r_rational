After the past few chapters, something's been bothering me.

I really feel like Red is completely ignoring how unprepared he is to deal with emergencies, which seems out of character for him after being exposed to so many dangerous situations already. I get that he doesn't care about becoming a strong battle trainer, but it doesn't seem like he's even considered training up a few of his pokemon to be strong enough to protect him when the shit hits the fan.

It just seems strange to me. I mean, he reflects on his mistakes and comes up with countermeasures for the future, he's been shown to have good judgment and forethought when it comes to preparing /stuff/ he might need to increase his safety, and he can usually make sound situational judgments, but he hasn't even /considered/ making a deliberate effort to strengthen, let alone evolve, his pokemon. In a world where you can get attacked at any time, where he's already had some of his pokemon killed, and where he's already witnessed like 10 people die who had stronger pokemon than he does, it just seems really out of character for him to ignore this key part of risk mitigation when he's supposed to be smart.

I guess maybe he could be subconsciously avoiding doing so because he wants to maintain his self-image of being different from "Blue the Battle Maniac", or he could just be caught up in his intellectual pursuits and ignoring it, but it should be REALLY obvious to him that *survival is priority number 1* and that he's woefully unprepared from a pokemon strength standpoint.
