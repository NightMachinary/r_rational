Finally some fighting, I love how you included switching around pokemons to get exp and STAB. I'm not good at keeping count as I read, are pokemons still limited to 4 moves?

Also reference to Alola, this is getting better as I continue reading.

And Bill, that was just great.

Also can you believe that a dark alola rattata was just announced? I find it extra funny considering the psychic rattata comment by red
