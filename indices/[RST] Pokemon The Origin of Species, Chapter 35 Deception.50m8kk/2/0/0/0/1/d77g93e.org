Well there's plenty of stuff that seems like magic. Organised by type (not all of this has been shown so you could just not have half the moves exist, but I expect you can do better than that):

- Psychic is the big one, practically everything they do seems like magic, teleportation, mind reading, telekinesis etc..
- Fire, while mostly sorted out as not magic with the flammable materials being expelled, still has the question of why things like fire punch don't burn the user.
- Water, while absorbing and expelling water seems not magical pokemon seem able to hold more than their own volume in it (I won't mention this again if I see any other examples of it), though with things like pokeballs it might not be magic. Moves which affect external supplies of water are pretty magical though, being effectively water only telekinesis.
- Grass, there's a mix of simple muscle like hitting things with or shooting out plant parts, which isn't magical, spores which might be magic but are probably just drugs, and then you have absord which magically sucks the life out of things to heal you and solar beam for a sun powered death ray.
- Rock and earth (they seem pretty much the same), are a mix of simply throwing rock, mud and dirt at things, which isn't magical and limited telekinesis that only works on rocks, dirt or mud.
- Poison doesn't seem to have anything magical.
- Ice seems to have the ability to instantly cool things to sub zero temperatures, which is probably magic.
- Fighting is a mix of non magical muscle and magic by another name ki and aura based attacks.
- Dark and ghost seem to be magic, it's mental attacks and 'energy' blasts (can't think of any other way to describe things like shadow ball and dark pulse).
- Dragon appears to be a mix of brute force, like dragon claw, and magical stuff like creating twisters, fire that doesn't count as fire typed, dropping meteors on people and whatever dragon pulse is.
- steel type seems to be mostly hitting stuff while being made of metal, though there are things like flash cannon which might be magic and there's the occasional bit of metal only telekinesis.
- Normal is a mix of muscle power, supersonic and hypervoice style sound based attacks which are probably all nonmagical, and some weird stuff like hyper beam which seems rather magical. Probably other things, not much pattern to the normal type.
- Flying seems mostly wing and beak based brute strength with a few wind based attacks which could easily be perfectly mundane as wings are used as fans thrown in.
- Electric types have kind of been explained, but the details of how they create the differences in charge and such haven't and certainly seem like magic.
- Bug type moves seem to be mundane physical attacks bugs use, a few mundane web based attacks, the sound based bug buzz which might well be mundane, but there's some stuff like signal beam and leech life that seem like magic.\\

I think that's the lot, if there are mundane explanations for all of that I hope you include some of them in future chapters.
