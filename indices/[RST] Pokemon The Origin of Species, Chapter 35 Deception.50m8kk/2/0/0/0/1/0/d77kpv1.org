Great write-up :) I guess I should have clarified that I meant human-based magic, since we were talking about Bill, though that list only includes the vaguely magical psychic and "Ghost" powers, and "Ki," none of which approach the kind of powers that pokemon can use.

I'll definitely be explaining more of those as the story goes on, though some of them will definitely get cut, or changed somewhat. For example, I'm thinking Hyper Beam is going to be a sound-based attack, since all other Special Normal Type attacks are sound based. Maybe a beam of sound so intense it forms a defined beam of kinetic force. What do you think? Too much of a cheat?
