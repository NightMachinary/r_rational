  Considering you referenced Alolan forms, I'm curious if 6th gen Pokemon are in Origin of Species's universe or not (dunno how you'd explain/work around fairy types though...)?

This was discussed a bit in an earlier chapter, but I'll add it to the FAQ when I get home: Fairy type exist, but as an "inactive" type. Right now they're considered a myth, but when a Xerneas awakens from hibernation, its Fairy Aura activates those around it, who then activate those around them, and so on, until the Xerneas goes into hibernation again.

  How do Pokemon that are said to get along well with humans (Eg. Goodra, Lapras) fit into the more overtly hostile nature of wild Pokemon in Origin of Species (as compared to the main series)?
#+end_quote

As [[/u/EatZelda_ShitAwesome]] says, they're much more friendly than most, though some still cause harm to humans. For the most part though, they don't go on rampages or attack towns.

  Have human psychics and sensitives in Origin of Species ever considered/researched if their powers are some form or parallel of synesthesia as a possible explanation?
#+end_quote

As far as I'm aware, synesthesia isn't consistent across people, while psychic phenomenon are. What I mean is, two people with sight/taste synesthesia might describe the "taste of Green" differently from each other. Psychics tend to have different power levels, but the same stimulus brings about the same sensation/feeling.
