Hey all, welcome back! Here's another 10,000 word chapter, and this one was able to fit in most of what I wanted it to. Edits might come a bit slower this time, since my computer decided to implode yesterday, and I'm still in the process of replacing it. Hope you enjoy, and as usual, all feedback welcome!

Also, quick note for my Rationally Writing podcast, we've paid to upgrade our Soundcloud account, so downloads aren't so limited anymore. Thanks for listening!
