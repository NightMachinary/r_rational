  She ends the call with relief, and begins to spin it around and around in her hands again.
#+end_quote

Sounds like she somehow put the call on the table.

#+begin_quote
  breathing deep
#+end_quote

deeply

#+begin_quote
  the Cerulean North's heart
#+end_quote

"Cerulean North's heart" or "the heart of Cerulean North"

#+begin_quote
  Blue's fingers trace the lid of his pokeballs for Kemuri, Gon, Maturin and Ion.
#+end_quote

lids

#+begin_quote
  weighs heavy on his mind
#+end_quote

Should be "weighs heavily", but this can be artistic license I guess.

#+begin_quote
  But the only way to regain his momentum from it is to take Misty out in their first fight
#+end_quote

I would remove "from it"

#+begin_quote
  based on the amount of badges their challengers have
#+end_quote

better to use "number of" with countable things like badges

#+begin_quote
  between getting one's first badge and their second
#+end_quote

"and one's second"

#+begin_quote
  but Leaders would always pull the most punches against someone who's untested
#+end_quote

I would pair "would" with "was" (so "someone who was untested"), but you could also just do "someone untested".

#+begin_quote
  incase she gives you something too
#+end_quote

in case

#+begin_quote
  stopping to let some people off and others board
#+end_quote

"off" and "board" don't quite match. I would use "off" and "on" or "leave" (or something) and "board"

#+begin_quote
  Red and Leaf get off when the bus reaches Cerulean North's Trainer House.
#+end_quote

Subjective (I think), but maybe "when" -> "as"

#+begin_quote
  which might make it harder for him to climb the ranks faster and challenge Misty.
#+end_quote

"harder to climb the ranks faster" is weird. Maybe "harder to climb the ranks quickly"

#+begin_quote
  The sight makes Blue's heart fill his chest
#+end_quote

Sort of an awkward phrasing.

#+begin_quote
  It's only been a couple weeks since he beat Brock, and an eventful couple weeks at that, but he still feels like forever ago.
#+end_quote

An "and... at that" comment should amplify the preceding clause relative to what follows, but this diminishes it. Try "albeit an eventful one" or something. Also either "it still feels like forever ago" or "still feels like it was forever ago".

#+begin_quote
  There are few better ways to showcase how well the gym can train their pokemon than to put a bunch of them on display in a public area and trust that all would be well.
#+end_quote

and trust that all will be well

#+begin_quote
  only to come up a few meters away to fire back at the spot Zephyr was a moment ago.
#+end_quote

I would use "before" in place of "ago"

#+begin_quote
  His pokemon lashes out and strikes the poliwhirl just before the water crashes down around him, but Amy's pokemon is sufficiently distracted by the strike to follow up properly.
#+end_quote

"too distracted by the strike to follow up properly"

#+begin_quote
  just as Amy sends her poliwhirl back into the water, then shoots another Water Gun that Joey just barely has time to dodge
#+end_quote

Here it reads as if it is Amy rather than her poliwhirl that is shooting the Water Gun.

#+begin_quote
  Blue keeps an eye on the water just incase there's any obvious amounts of blood from the wound he inflicted
#+end_quote

in case

#+begin_quote
  If it's one thing Blue has learned from watching a thousand competitive trainer battles, it's never to underestimate the depths they'll go to hide their methods and mislead opponents.
#+end_quote

"If there's one thing", "the depths trainers will go to" (not the depths the battles will go to)

#+begin_quote
  The battle continues more even than ever, with Amy's poliwhirl having to dodge the sprays of acid his ekans shot out of its mouth every time it was attacked.
#+end_quote

Maybe "more evenly than ever". Also the tense is weird for the second clause. Maybe "his ekans shoots out of its mouth every time it is attacked". Also you use "him" to refer to the ekans in the next sentence, but "its" here.

#+begin_quote
  A beam of white light flash-freezes the ground below it traces a path toward Kemuri.
#+end_quote

Hard to parse.

#+begin_quote
  but he'd rather not reveal it until he faces Misty, just incase...
#+end_quote

in case

#+begin_quote
  suddenly reminded of his sister. She and Amy would probably get along
#+end_quote

You say the same thing a couple of lines up.

#+begin_quote
  long enough to relax or clear his mind...despite
#+end_quote

space before "despite"

#+begin_quote
  his mind i still offering up distractions.
#+end_quote

is still

#+begin_quote
  tucked under his right knee the wya it is
#+end_quote

the way

#+begin_quote
  ...But now he's busy thinking that
#+end_quote

space before "But"

#+begin_quote
  What really irks him is that he's going to have to share the method with other.
#+end_quote

others.

#+begin_quote
  verdant green fields
#+end_quote

Maybe a bit redundant.

#+begin_quote
  which slowly resolves itself into a distinct shapes.
#+end_quote

"into distinct shapes" or "into a distinct shape".

#+begin_quote
  Technically the house could be referred to as a cottage, relatively small and quaint looking, but it's connected to so many wider, more modern buildings around it that the whole thing can easily be referred to as complex.
#+end_quote

Maybe use "can" both times, instead of using "could" the first time.
