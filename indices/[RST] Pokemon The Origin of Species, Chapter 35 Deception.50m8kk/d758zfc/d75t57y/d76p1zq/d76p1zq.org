  Confusing, isn't it?

In Game of Champions, it was some sort of mind-transfer... that doesn't seem technologically possible here. In a parody web-comic (Nerd Rage I think?), Bill was actually cosplaying and was trying to distract Red from realizing this with the science stuff. Metronome seems like it can do anything...? Maybe the mechanism is some sort of ability to copy moves from other Pokemon and implement them, and Bill figured out how to leverage it into getting the Clefairy to temporarily copy his mind? Or just copy his vocalizations, for something more moderate?
