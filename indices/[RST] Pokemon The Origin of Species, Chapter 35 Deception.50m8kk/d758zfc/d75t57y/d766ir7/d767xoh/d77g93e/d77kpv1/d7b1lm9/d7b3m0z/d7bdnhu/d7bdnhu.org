  Tri Attack is a strange case, because it's clearly a Fire/Ice/Electric attack, but because it was made in Gen 1 I guess they decided to just balance them out and consider it a "Normal?" Maybe the technology wasn't there to make it count as all 3 types, and they figure it would be too complicated for kids to have a move that acts like all 3 types at once. In any case I have no qualms about making it an actual mix of the three elements it represents.

I have always seen Tri Attack as an indication that there is something more to normal than meets the eye. If you had an attack that is both Fire, Ice and Eletric and launched at a Grass type, it would be super effective, since both fire and ice are SE and Eletric is resisted. In game, however, it behaves like a normal type move. And then the Pokemon God is normal-type. And as you said, every move that can change types is normal.

It works in my headcanon.

  I'm not sure why Wring Out is Special, there's nothing in the description that makes it seem like it should be.

To give Lickylicky a special stab, I guess.

  And the stars formed by Swift seem to be just magically formed sharp objects thrown at something, so there's no real getting around that.

Trump Card is arguably even worse. I can understand pokemon launching energy in a form that just happen to resemble stars, but cards? And it gets stronger the cards you have to use?
