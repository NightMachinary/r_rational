Many of the non-Sound based Special Normal Attacks are variable types, like Weather Ball and Judgement and Hidden Power. They can be Normal type, but they're clearly some form of magic that only include Normal in their permutations because their Type changes based on other factors

Tri Attack is a strange case, because it's clearly a Fire/Ice/Electric attack, but because it was made in Gen 1 I guess they decided to just balance them out and consider it a "Normal?" Maybe the technology wasn't there to make it count as all 3 types, and they figure it would be too complicated for kids to have a move that acts like all 3 types at once. In any case I have no qualms about making it an actual mix of the three elements it represents.

I'm okay with Razor Wind as Normal instead of Flying as an exception because it seems to be similar in effect to other Normal attacks, ie, getting cut.

Swift and Wring Out, however, I don't really have an explanation for. I'm not sure why Wring Out is Special, there's nothing in the description that makes it seem like it should be. And the stars formed by Swift seem to be just magically formed sharp objects thrown at something, so there's no real getting around that.

So you're right, there are enough exceptions to this rule to invalidate it. I guess I'll treat Hyper Beam as an energy based attack after all :)
