I can't find the exact comment, and its not in the FAQ on the website, but DaystarEld definitely said that they weren't limited to 4 moves, although practically speaking a trainer needs to actually teach all the moves to a Pokemon and keep them fresh in its memory. Looking at the [[http://www.daystareld.com/pokemon-team-roster/][Team Roster for example]] some Pokemon only know 2 moves... Blue, the competitive battler that he is, has trained his Squirtle with 9 moves.
