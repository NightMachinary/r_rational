Hey, no problem. Thanks for the quick response! I totally agree that screen-time shouldn't be wasted on mundane things. I feel like it'd be fine to have it happen offscreen, as long as it's mentioned at some point, because otherwise it just seems to undermine Red's character a bit. Might be a good chance for some introspection too.

For example, maybe when the three reunite after they'd split up for a while to do their own things in Cerulean like they did in Pewter, one of his companions makes a comment like "Oh, your Charmander looks bigger" or something. Then Red can explain that after seeing the Charizard save the day at Mt. Moon and realizing how ineffective Charmander's ember was during the crisis, he's been spending some time each night battling in the trainer house to try to get Charmander closer to evolving so he'll be more prepared the next time there's an emergency and he'll be less likely to have his pokemon die again.

Just an example, but probably wouldn't take up too many words, provided the events you have planned for their stay in Cerulean have room for Red to do something like that.

Even if he doesn't have a chance to take action yet, I think it would increase the realism just to have him consciously recognize the fact that even though he's not aiming for being a battle trainer, he'll still need to put more effort into increasing his team's battle ability some way or other so he and his pokemon will have a better chance of surviving the next disaster. (Though I'm sure you can figure out a more interesting way of addressing this).

Anyway, really enjoying the story a lot. Just caught up today and signed up as a patron for you. Thanks for the story so far and keep up the good work!
