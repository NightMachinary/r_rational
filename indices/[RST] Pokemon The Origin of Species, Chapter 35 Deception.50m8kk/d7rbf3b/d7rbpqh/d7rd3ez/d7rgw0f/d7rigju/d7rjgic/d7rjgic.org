  I had a long backlog of stuff to read though, so I just hadn't gotten around to it until recently.
#+end_quote

Oh man I know, there are like half a dozen stories on here that I've been meaning to catch up on or start. I just so rarely read off my phone or browser lately.

  (btw, if you got a bunch of spelling/grammar reports in the last 48 hours, those were probably mostly me.)
#+end_quote

Uh oh. I haven't received any... my plugin might be on the fritz. I'll have to investigate, thanks for the heads up!

  Planning on starting on Mother of Learning tomorrow.
#+end_quote

You're in for a treat, it's pretty great :) It's nearing the final arc soon, and I both can't wait for it to resolve and don't want it to end.

#+begin_quote
  (As a random thought, have you considered setting a Patreon goal for more frequent updates? Like once you reach $X/mo, posting a chapter every 3 weeks instead of every month? I know a few fan translators for Japanese light novels who do something similar, but I'm not sure how extensible that is to original writing, or for your personal situation. Might help bring in more patrons and/or increase the pledged amounts, so just figured I'd bring it up.)

Yeah, this is something a lot of people have requested, but unfortunately there's no realistic pledge amount that would free up time to write that much more. So much of my time is spent researching and revising that it's too inconsistent to promise three weeks instead of four, but I'm still thinking over ways to expedite the process so that maybe, with some reader assistance, I'll be able to get through those parts faster.
