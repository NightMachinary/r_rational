Great chapter once again, interesting to get a few more specifics about evolution, though waiting a month for an explanation about Bill might be a bit annoying (though that's just my own impatience lol). Anyways, I have a few questions if you don't mind me asking:

- Considering you referenced Alolan forms, I'm curious if 6th gen Pokemon are in Origin of Species's universe or not (dunno how you'd explain/work around fairy types though...)?

- How do Pokemon that are said to get along well with humans (Eg. Goodra, Lapras) fit into the more overtly hostile nature of wild Pokemon in Origin of Species (as compared to the main series)?

- Have human psychics and sensitives in Origin of Species ever considered/researched if their powers are some form or parallel of synesthesia as a possible explanation?
