Thanks for the answers, I now have two follow up questions:

- I'm still genuinely curious if all 6th gen Pokemon are in OOS's universe? (sorry for being pedantic but you only mentioned Fairy types in your first answer and OOS started before 6th gen was released)

- What type are Fairy type Pokemon classified as before activation, Normal? Or does it vary per mon species?
