Hmm... if Xerneas' presence activates the Fairy type in a viral spread, it strikes me that Yveltal should be able to do something similar. After all, they are yet another set of counterpart Legendaries, with one focusing on life and the other on death.

Obviously, Yveltal can't activate a type like Xerneas does, since Fairy is the only type that needs an explanation like this. I'm curious about whether Yveltal will 'suppress' a Fairy typing, or suppress some other type, or if the phenomenon will be marked as a rare case of asymmetry between counterparts.
