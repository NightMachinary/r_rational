It's interesting that this chapter talks about both "true" evolution through natural selection and Pokemon specimen-level "evolution" (which is actually metamorphosis). I maybe would've expected a rationalist story to poke at the confused terminology, but I guess in-universe it's the established term (and two evolutions are mentioned within different POVs).
