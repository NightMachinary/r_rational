Soo a power ring without the AI, pretty much.\\
How big is this machine? Relatively portable? Can I build it into, say, a gauntlet? Can the hard light stop, for example, bullets? Could I make lightweight practical bulletproof armor with it?

How small can the hard-light-constructs go? Small enough to move around individual molecules? How about individual atoms? If I can program it to move around individual atoms then I'm going to set it to knitting together a space-elevator cable out of pure carbon fiber.

Rescue equiment. Build evacuation-slide projectors into every building taller than two stories, and suddenly the death-toll from a fire in the Empire State Building or another World Trade Center is a lot smaller.
