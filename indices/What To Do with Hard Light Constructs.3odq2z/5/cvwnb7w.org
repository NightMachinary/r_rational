Do hard-light constructs have mass (if not, easy space tech)? Do they require some sort of continuous support (by that operating machine, or something else)? Depending on it's cost, it can substitute wide varieties of industry.

Can it create molecular-sized constructs, and can those interact with matter on chemical level? If true, it can be extremely useful in pharmacy (or any synthesis) or even food industry (and eventually humans may change into light-constructed humans).
