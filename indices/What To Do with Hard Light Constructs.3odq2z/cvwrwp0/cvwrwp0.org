First, figure out how it changes the computational landscape. If something it does can be used to solve NP-hard problems, privately acquire omnipotence. If not, figure out how it changes the military landscape. If it is powerful enough to circumvent the MAD of nuclear weapons (which must be pretty damn powerful), choose the world power closest to your ideology and give it to them so they can quickly and painlessly take over the world. If not, patent it patent everywhere and use the gigantic revenue to fund value alignment research.

How can it be used in the latter case? Most importantly, shorten the feedback loop to produce more hard light constructors. From what I'm reading, that just means circuit boards, i.e. mining, electricity and machinery. Can it command a generator to spin for a perpetuum mobile? How much power can it use in the commands? "Drill that mountain down and centrifuge it into its component atoms."

Other than that, drive every menial laborer out of a job. (Maybe I can use some of my gigantic funds to provide global base income.)
