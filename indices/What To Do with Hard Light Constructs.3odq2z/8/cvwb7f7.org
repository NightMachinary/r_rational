How much light can it transform at a time? Can it be used to make more than one construct simultaneously? Do you have to know what it is that you're making? Could I do something like make a cure for Alzheimer's disease out of light using this machine, even if I didn't know anything about the cure for Alzheimer's except that it would cure Alzheimer's?

Turn light into gold, then sell it for lots of money, then use that money for effective altruism. Since the technology you're using is cheap, others will have their own and will be doing the same thing, which means if you want to make gold and sell it for a lot of money, you have to do it before the value of gold goes down too far from its overproduction.

And again, you could make medication with it.

Make weapons, like Welexi's spears of light in Alexander Wales' "Shadows of the Limelight". Probably not effective against modern artillery, but would be cool.

Haven't thought of any others yet.
