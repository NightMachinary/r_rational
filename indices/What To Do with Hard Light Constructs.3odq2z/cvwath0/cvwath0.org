... Everything? Built houses, cars (if the machine can use those panels to move itself), clothing, furniture, complex machinery...

This machine effectively solves a lot of material problems, only food is left. It also reduces the amount of labor needed like everywhere.

Why build a house out of matter if for a low energy cost you can have a new mansion every week or so? You'd get funny cleaning procedures: during a rainstorm, tell the machine to cocoon every real thing, then vanish the house; then re-appear it again.

We'd get a huge market of free, proprietary, and cracked blueprints.
