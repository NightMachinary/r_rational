MSPA is probably the most popular of these, though there are a fair number of ass-pulls and it gets pretty text-heavy later on. I thought problem sleuth was better, it was more action-heavy.

There's also prequel adventure or "making a cat cry" the adventure that started updating again after like 2 years that's pretty nice, though it's not very rational either, just fun to read.

There were a bunch of other pretty nice adventures on the MSPA forums but I think the forums died in a fire for some reason.
