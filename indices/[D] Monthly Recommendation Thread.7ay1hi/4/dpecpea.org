I've been reading some quests on Spacebattles and Sufficient Velocity recently. In case you don't know what quests are, they're choose your own adventure stories where the readers vote on the course of action that the main character will take. Here are my recommendations:

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/forge-of-destiny-xianxia-quest.35583/][Forge of Destiny]] is a xianxia-style quest. The story is good, though slow-paced, and the magic system is pretty interesting.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/paths-of-civilization.36410/][Paths of Civilization]] has already been mentioned on this sub, but it's a very good civilization-style quest where the readers play as successive kings of a civilization. The details are surprisingly historically accurate in terms of how the technology develops.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/hunger-frozen-disney-dark-fantasy-au.40401/][Hunger]] is a quest where the readers control Elsa in a dark AU of Frozen where Elsa's powers come with the cost of a constant hunger for heat and food, including human flesh.
