I'm going to do something different from the usual story recommendations. I will be posting the authors I follow on reddit.

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Luna_Lovewell/][Luna Lovewell]] - She is an author who started out by posting to [[/r/writingprompts]] and has never failed to write a short story that I enjoyed reading and feels self-contained when I normally dislike short stories. My favorite story by her is [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Luna_Lovewell/comments/6h9hxn/the_batman_delusion/][The Batman Delusion]] which is a crossover between Batman and Inception.

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/leoduhvinci/][Leoduhvinci]] - He mainly writes adventure stories and just like Luna, got his start by posting to [[/r/writingprompts]]. While I can't say the characters are rational, they are well-developed and what I find rational are his settings. He is amazing at writing how the fantastical would realistically influence the world. In fact, he has two books available for free and one book heavily discounted on Amazon [[https://www.reddit.com/r/leoduhvinci/comments/7ay4fv/free_and_discount_day/][today]] only.

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSnakeReport/][The Snake Report]] - Okay, okay, this isn't an author, but it's the only story written by wercwercwerc that I'm paying attention to. It's an amusing story of how a man has reincarnated as a magical snake in an RPG-like world and while it starts out as a comedy about horrifying situations, in the most recent chapters it has evolved into a mystery about how the current world's magic and where it came from.

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/search?q=author%3Ademons_dance_alone&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=relevance&t=all][Demons Dance Alone]] - A great horror story writer. I don't think he posts to [[/r/nosleep]] anymore, but I've been going through all of the stories he used to post. His stories often include family horror (how do you deal with a monster when you are related to the monster?) and some supernatural.

Is there anyone you follow who writes and posts to reddit?
