Ooh I actually have something new to contribute to one of these. I don't think this game has been mentioned anywhere else on the sub, though I might be wrong.

Doki doki literature club is a free steam game that has themes that this sub tends to enjoy/talk about. I want to remain as vague as possible to avoid spoiling any of it though. It's a "dating sim" - read the steam store page description (I skipped it and dove into the game and regretted doing that later) and try to get the bad route first (don't date anyone), that's probably the best way to see if you'll like it. Getting the good route might be good too but I've only finished the bad one so far.

[[#s][After you play that one, a similar game is]]

I also think it's a good idea to caution people away from stuff sometimes. "the leftovers" tv series has pretty high ratings on metacritic but at least the first episode is pretty irrational.

I also watched a few episodes of "supernatural" and that's not really rational either.
