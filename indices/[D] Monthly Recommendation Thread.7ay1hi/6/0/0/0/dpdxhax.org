While it's possible that he just stopped, I doubt it. He was well known for being such a prolific writer that he would joke about having an Anti-Writer's Block. Him stopping like this was way too abrupt at the time. It would make more sense if he took longer and longer to post in between chapters beforehand (and he was going at a fairly rapid pace at the time).

Furthermore, he even has another chapter of [[https://m.fanfiction.net/topic/88086/107502467/1/Compilation-Beyond-the-Outer-Gates-Lies-Dragons-by-Gabriel-Blessing][Beyond the Outer Gate Lies]] ready for posting that hasn't gotten onto the fanfiction website (the 'fourth' chapter starts halfway down the second page, just search for 'My Inner Feminine Side?').

Also, there's a RWBY [[https://www.fanfiction.net/topic/88086/81161745/100/Anti-Writers-Block][snippet]] by him. Just scroll down to find it in the middle of the page. It's the very last thing he ever wrote (with the exception of three comment replies further down on the same page).
