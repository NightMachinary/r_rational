Question: Does this story eventually get away from [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStationsOfTheCanon][stations of canon]]?

So far apart from the beginning and a few chapters here and there, it seems like the story is just a retelling of Young Justice with a new character added. Most of the events even play out more or less the same way.

I do like that the interpersonal stuff is shifting around because of the SI's presence. But I think I may drop it if there isn't any major divergence from Young Justice.

edit: for reference, I just got past the Amazo part.
