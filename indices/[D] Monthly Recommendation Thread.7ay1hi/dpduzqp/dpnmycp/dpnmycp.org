I came here to recommend With This Ring. Here's what I said about it on another thread:

...

OK. I used to read a few comics when. I was young and I have enjoyed the Avengers movies but I'm not I to Marvel or DC. But there's this fanfic on Sufficient Velocity called 'With This Ring' that has me hooked. The author posts about 1,000 words every single day and haven't missed an update since he started over two years ago. I kid you not.

It's the story of a rational Orange Lantern (you might not know what that is but you've probably heard of a Green Lantern) who is pretty darned rational in his desires and how to achieve them. It's absolutely brilliant and I can't understand how this can be as consistently good as it is.

If you don't like superheroes because you think they aren't smart enough then you'll love this.
