Piggybacking off of that Young Justice SI recommendation, I'll promote [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/life-ore-death-young-justice-crossover.489535/][Life Ore Death]], a Young Justice Not-SI story.

The main character is Renka, an OC with Feruchemy (from /Mistborn/) as a power set, a history of being a wanted runaway in a violent empire, and no knowledge of Earth before she drops in. The first thing she does on-screen is ask for a meeting with Superman, because being a hero is better than her other option of being a criminal. She has mildly blue-and-orange morality which puts her into conflict with the Team, and is learning the language throughout her time there (though most noticeably at the start) which has some funny moments as well.

It's a highly underrated story IMO, and the (pseudo) predictability and consistency in both her magic and her interactions with people are a good fit for here.
