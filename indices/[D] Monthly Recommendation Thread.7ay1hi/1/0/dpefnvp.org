While not the /best/ rational fic out there, there is a lot to like about WTR. Character interaction is well done, dialogue is realistic, combat is continually interesting, and there are just so many moving parts that are just begging to be munchkined.

Also, it's hard to understate the value of a sizable update */every single day/*, and that the author takes community advice, criticism, and general comments with due respect.
