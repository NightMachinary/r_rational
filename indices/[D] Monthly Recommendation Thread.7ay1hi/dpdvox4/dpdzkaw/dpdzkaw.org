Following up on this to share my single favorite entry on [[/r/WritingPrompts][r/WritingPrompts]] that isn't as easy to find now that it's no longer the top post. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/PaulsWPAccount/comments/3q223j/index/][A day before the Earth is destroyed by a collision with a rogue planet, time freezes. You, a completely normal person are untouched and cannot die. Text on your arm appears that reads, "however long it takes, save us".]]

The closest thing I can compare it to is The Martian, but it's not /as/ rational and it's appeal for me was very different. As a person with autism, the story of a man basically trapped alone with his thoughts and having to solve an intellectual problem with no clear solution in order to escape social isolation /hit home hard/.

Reading this forced me to confront some dark existential fears within myself that I couldn't even admit to feeling. Seeing that fear of indefinite social isolation presented so well made me bawl in anguish for hours on end. I emerged with a better understanding of myself and will be forever thankful for the dark place it took me to.
