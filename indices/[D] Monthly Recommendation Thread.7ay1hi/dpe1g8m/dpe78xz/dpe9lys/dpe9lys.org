Cerberous Syndrome is when a series becomes more dramatic and less comedic as it goes on, in this case because of the reveals brought by the overarching plot. It takes a long time for that to happen here, but if you liked the first arc you should enjoy the rest plenty. This was when the DM realized that combat wasn't interesting by itself so focused on creating crazy scenarios.

The initiation test is pretty boring compared to the rest of the series, but I listen using the app Overcast that can speed up the recording so it was no problem to get through for me. It does not represent a sudden shift in style for the series, the next arc is even funnier than the first one and has way less combat.
