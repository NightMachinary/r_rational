Now that I've finally finished the RPG/comedy podcast [[http://www.maximumfun.org/adventure-zone/ep-1-here-there-be-gerblins-chapter-one][The Adventure Zone]], I can wholeheartedly recommend it as hella fun pulp fantasy. It's put on by the same guys behind the comedy podcast/VRV Exclusive TV show [[http://www.maximumfun.org/my-brother-my-brother-and-me/mbmbam-336-twenty-something-teen][My Brother My Brother and Me]] and the YouTube series [[http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaDrN74SfdT6duuVl_8qxJ5eaaPHRX_ij][Monster Factory]] and [[http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaDrN74SfdT6FvTs9d2JPLJnVRjnjIlfo][Car Boys]], which are all worth checking out, as these hilarious improv comedians play Dungeons & Dragons with their professional radio personality father.

It's like HarmonQuest, except I like it more in every single way and there is a lot more of it. The players and DM are better improvisers and have great rapport with one another, all of the characters are funny and likable, the scenarios they get involved in are very imaginative, and the overarching plot may be one of the best examples I've ever seen of [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome][Cerberous Syndrome]] with a wonderfully emotional conclusion. It's not very rational, especially at the beginning, but I was damn satisfied by it.
