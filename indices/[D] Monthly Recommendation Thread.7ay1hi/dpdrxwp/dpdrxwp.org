I finished volume 1 of [[https://wanderinginn.wordpress.com/][The Wandering Inn]] the other day and found every chapter engaging. Has fantastically written characters who are trying so hard in a world that just doesn't care about them.

Also completed recently [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6154638/1/The-Hill-of-Swords][The Hill of Swords]]. A Fate/stay night crossover with Familiar of Zero. Has great chemistry between the two leads as you watch Shirou over the course of the story influence a stubborn child Louise into a capable and rational adult.

Finally, there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10202330/1/Beyond-the-Outer-Gate-Lies][Beyond the Outer Gate Lies]]. A Dresden Files crossover with Highschool DxD about one, world-weary Wizards adventures in a (comedy/harem/magical) high school. He's just so underwhelmed with teenagers and their problems. There's also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10752206/1/Beyond-the-Outer-Gates-Lies-A-high-school-library][Beyond the Outer Gates Lies... A high school library?]], a continuation by a different author. It's more focused on harems than plot though, but I still enjoyed it.
