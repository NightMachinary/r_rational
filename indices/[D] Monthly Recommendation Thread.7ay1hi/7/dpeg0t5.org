Recently re-read webcomic [[http://unicornjelly.com/uni001.html]] and its just such a great work of fiction. In scope and detail and execution.

Story plays in another universe with very different laws of physics; see [[http://unicornjelly.com/alt115.html][here]]. All planned out in sufficient detail to satisfy [[/r/rational]]'s requirements.

Author is (in)famous Jennifer Diane Reitz, known here as author of [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/69770/friendship-is-optimal-caelum-est-conterrens][Caelum Est Conterrens]].
