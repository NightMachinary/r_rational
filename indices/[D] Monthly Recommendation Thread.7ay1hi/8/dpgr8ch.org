*Request:* Looking for rational or rationalist fiction with a strong theme of [[https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/SGR4GxFK7KmW7ckCB/something-to-protect][Something to Protect]]. Where the character feels a thunder in their soul so strongly you begin to feel it too.

Prefer Audio/TV/Film/Anime (in that order) but other formats are also totally cool if they resonate strongly.
