It's simple, what he says is pointblank falsifications about why Islam is supposedly still in some draconian era.

The middle class of Afghanistan was doing fine in the 1950s, then the U.S. funded the Mujaheddin in the 1970s, used UNICEF to teach Afghan children a puritanical and barbaric version of Islam that was heavily encouraged and approved by Congress and the U.S. military, and it's highly suspected that the U.S. gave them intelligence cables too (which is how they evaded U.S. intelligence and committed 9/11 in the first place) because the U.S. sealed the records of how much intelligence was given to them.

Now, the Afghans still live in a third-world country and it's all the U.S.'s fault. Al Qaeda's entire religious philosophy was invented by the U.S. military.

Now we have this dumbass Atheist extremist who just happens to be espousing military rhetoric in the guise of atheism. Even if you think religion is stupid, how the fuck can anyone /rationally/ believe that warring with religious people who war all the time is the *right* answer?
