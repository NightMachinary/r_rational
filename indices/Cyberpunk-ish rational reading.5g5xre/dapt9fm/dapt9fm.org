Well I don't know about "rationalist", but I can give you some recommendations in general.

I really like [[/u/cstross]]'s [[http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/fiction/accelerando/accelerando-intro.html][Accelerando]]. It's more post cyberpunk, but still. I feel it has the cyberpunk feel, but it's a lot less "low-life" until the vile offspring. And even then the protagonists are immortal and living post-scarcity.

The other big one is "Snow Crash", which is more traditional cyberpunk. Although somewhat of a parody. It explores some really cool concepts, and if you haven't read it I encourage you to find a copy.

Finally, a fan work. [[http://www.shamusyoung.com/shocked/][Free Radical]], a system-shock fanfic by Shamus Young, has one of the best descriptions of a neural interface and one of the best handlings of AI I've seen in a novel.

None of these are exactly "rationalist", but they're rational, with internally consistent worlds and all that. They explore interesting concepts, even if they don't teach rationality skills.
