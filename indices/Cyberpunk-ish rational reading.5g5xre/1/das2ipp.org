I feel like parts of the Takeshi Kovacs series by Peter Morgan approach being rational. In particular, there's a lot of interpretation of people's actions, and reducing those actions down to basic motivations. Unfortunately, it does stray from rationalism occasionally - but when it does that, it tends to be relatively self-aware about it. The first book is Altered Carbon.
