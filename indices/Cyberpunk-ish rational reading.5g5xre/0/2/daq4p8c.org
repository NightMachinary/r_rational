I read Singularity Sky and (to me at least) it came off as very preachy in parts, is Accelerando better?

EDIT: I probably sound pretty contentious right now so I'll try to explain a little better. Not preachy in terms of the technology and picture of the future, I actually believe the book was very well made. My issue is that he used Rachel and Martin as nothing more than author mouthpieces in the later part of the plot. It felt like he was pushing a libertarian agenda and extremely over doing it. I don't have an issue with political messages in books, however this one was pretty annoying
