I think you will find accelerando less preachy, I agree singularity sky does have a lot of "Use of Weapons", "Player of Games", "HPMOR", "Atlas Shugged" moralizing with a sledgehammer's subtlety. Accelerando, does have some some moralizing but aside from one story-line railing against the RIAA I find it a lot more Peter Watts style extrapolation, and a lot less sledgehammer pounding ideology indoctrination.

Alternately the arguable post-singularity post-crash follow-on novel "Glasshouse" is less subtle than singularity sky, but is still worth reading (there is about a quarter to a third of it you may find a very unpleasant rehash of several aspects of sociology and identity freedom rants) because it does some fairly clever things with digital humans.
