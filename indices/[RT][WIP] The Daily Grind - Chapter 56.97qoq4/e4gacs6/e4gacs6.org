So I just binged this whole story. I'm such a sucker for gradual power up stories.

Anyway, purple orbs seem to be the best by far. You stack physical upgrades so you can fight better and loot more without getting hurt since injury downtime is a major reason they aren't going in constantly. Don't understand why they aren't prioritizing trading in yellows for them when they realized it was doable.
