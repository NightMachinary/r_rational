Yeah, popping purples to reliably stack physical buffs is clearly a solid game plan.

I think there is some real hidden potential with the red orbs though. The emotional resonance seems to promote maturity with the stated emotion. Allowing you to communicate your feelings more effectively and causes you utilize the emotion more productively. Keeping a clear head is important in achieving the optimum results.

Although that does seem like the sort of thing that would slightly alter someones personality. I can see why most of the group doesn't like them.
