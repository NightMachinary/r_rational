Remove One Half Of is vague enough that it sounds incredibly broken.

Instantly bisect any object of any material? In combat it pretty much oneshots any hostiles they've encountered so far.

Does it have a size limit? Could it work on, say, one half of a building? A mountain? A country?

Does it work on concepts? Remove one half of all your problems? Remove half of the hostile creatures in the dungeon?
