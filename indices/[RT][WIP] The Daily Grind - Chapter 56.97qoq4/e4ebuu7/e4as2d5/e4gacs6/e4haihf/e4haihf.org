I, too, just finished binging. I agree completely. Purple orbs are super powerful, rivaled only by yellow orbs with combat skills. They've honestly been wasting yellow orbs by cracking them and getting mostly useless skills. A more rational course would be to prioritize getting an iLipede farm, characterize all yellows, and trade any yellows that don't sound useful to the tree.

Other irrational things they're doing:

Wasting green orbs on anything other than their own apartment. Gaining sleep or lowering costs increases your dungeon capability! You can wait a few years to improve the hospital, right now you need to do everything possible to bootstrap your dungeon exploitation ability! Everything is an investment!

Most importantly, a few chapters ago, they made a critical error. They turned Frank over to the police instead of keeping him and interrogating him. This is horribly stupid for two reasons:

1. Frank is insane. He sells people out to die. There is no way the police are going to contain him for life, which is what needs to happen. He's going to get out of jail and he will remain a threat.
2. More importantly, he knows things. There are clear gaps in his knowledge, but he has valuable knowledge about the enemy. He knows how to interact with the stuffed suits, and he knows something about the process of selling people off to them. He might know what happens to those people! He might know where Thea and Susan are! By not interrogating him, they threw away their best possible lead.

So yeah, the protagonists have made some real bad mistakes. But that's just realistic, most people make huge mistakes when there's a lot going on.
