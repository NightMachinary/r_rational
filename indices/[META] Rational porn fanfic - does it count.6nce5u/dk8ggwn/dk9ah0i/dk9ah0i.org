/Personally/, Rational stories and fiction which /involve/ Sex become more real to me - more rational. In the real world, sex is a fundamental feature of The Human Experience. We wouldn't exist without sex. In almost every story, there exist characters. Those characters came into existence, not due to the author, but due to imaginary sex (for the most part). That's in-line with how this sub-reddit views rationality in Stories.

My point being, Sex should be in most stories because it aids Plot, World Building, and Character Creation /wink/ /wink/. Not to mention that it makes the overall world of that story more Rational and believable. I also read too much erotica, and I wrote this with a grin on my face, so potential authors would add erotica in their stores.
