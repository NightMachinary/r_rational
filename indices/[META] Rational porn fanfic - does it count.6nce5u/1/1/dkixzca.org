Well, that was far better than the premise would suggest. Recommended. I'm now a bit annoyed it's not finished and wondering where the author will go with the big mysteries. I'm not sure how much familiarity you need with the genre it's drawing from -- having played a few games of that nature did help me understand, but I think it's likely not essential to enjoying the story.

[[#s][The superpower]] was awesome and terrifying and interesting to read about.
