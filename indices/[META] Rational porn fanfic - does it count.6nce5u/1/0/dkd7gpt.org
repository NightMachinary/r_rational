Oh, wow; this.

The quest format doesn't normally lend itself to the Rational genre of fiction, since it is frequently the case that the rules are getting made up as the story advances... behind the scenes, by the QM, in response to the choices of the players. This is /especially/ true for Gamer-type quests, which are defined by mysterious and incredible powers appearing in response to the PC doing random things.

Turning that around, with a character intelligently /responding/ to the sudden appearance of an individual with strange and potentially world-shaking powers, and having deep philosophical discussions with them in an attempt to avert the potential horrible consequences of such a being invoking those powers at whim...

That's significantly deeper and more compelling than I was expecting from pornographic fiction. The hosting site does provide a bit of an entry barrier, but it's well worth the attempt. Enthusiastically recommended!
