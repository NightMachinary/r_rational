So, what, you're basically saying that "sex itself isn't necessarily rational, so in a rational work, it would not be explicitly rational"? Because I endorse that, more-or-less. (You could have the sex scene further Rational Goals, like wanting to distract someone, wanting to make the Evil Ejaculate of Doom go into your Resistant Vagina Of Awesomeness instead of the metropolis water supply)

I'll hold the /Crystal Society/ sex scene up as a good example - you get a /lot/ of character development and stuff happening in what is otherwise a very graphic sapphic sex scene.

I think we're conflating Rational and Rational/ist/ fiction? Rationalist has a huge helping of, well, prosthelytizing, whereas Rational just basically means "makes sense".
