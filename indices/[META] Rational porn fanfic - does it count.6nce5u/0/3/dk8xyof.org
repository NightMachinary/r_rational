In fight scenes, the practical goals are often paramount. You don't care about how you feel while you take someone out, you just want to find a way to win. You could write a brawl where emotion is most important, but it isn't meaningless if the characters focus on the technicalities instead.

Sex, on the other hand, is primarily emotional, which makes it much harder to be intellectual about in the moment without defeating the purpose. The same goes for comedy - while there are no sex scenes in HPMoR, there aren't any rationalist procedural scenes about characters trying to be funny either; there are just people making jokes.

You could undoubtedly write a good sex scene in a rationalist work, and have people act rationally outside the scene and rational-but-preoccupied in the scene. You can probably write an interesting or even engaging sex scene where a character rationally tries to approach sex, or a rational description of having sex. But a pornographic rational sex scene doesn't seem possible, any more than a funny rational comedy writing scene, or an emotionally charged rational fight scene for that matter.
