We could also just have a bad guy with distorted values; they may honestly believe that a lust filled world is the best world for all of humanity. Selling that to the reader would obviously take some effort and set up but I could easily be convinced of something like that. Most bad guys have twisted methodologies anyhow and one that prioritizes sex to the point of societal collapse seems like he/she would fit right in.
