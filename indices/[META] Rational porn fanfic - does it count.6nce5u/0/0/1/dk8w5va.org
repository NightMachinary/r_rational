To sort of tack onto the concept that "if you titillate your readers you are doing the wrong thing", I think if a good writer makes someone feel scared during a scary part of a story, then why shouldn't a good writer also make someone feel, well, /sexy/ during a sexy part of the story?

That said, if a story is all jump scares and no plot then it's not a very good story; equally if a story is all quivering members and no plot then it's not a very good story. (In both cases, unless you want nothing but jump scares/quivering members, in which case they're /perfect/.)

FWIW I read the Crystal Society story that people referred to in other posts, and I found the sex scene both titillating and vitally important to the plot/character development.
