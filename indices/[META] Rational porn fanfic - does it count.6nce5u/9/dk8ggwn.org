This is going to depend on your definition of rational fiction, which is not something that the community currently comes to a clear consensus on.

/Personally/ I think that appeals to an interest in sex are likely to dilute the rational aspects, and in some cases that will be enough that I'd instead say "rational-adjacent" or "thing you might like if you like rational fiction". If the /primary purpose/ of the work is appealing to sexual urges, then I probably wouldn't give it the label "rational", though I reserve the right to be surprised by execution.
