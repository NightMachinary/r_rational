Can rational fiction have sex scenes? Absolutely.

Is the sex depicted rational? That's a whole different question.

If you're committing to a rational setting, your sex has to take on the characteristics just like your other action scenes. No massive breasts without attending back problems, no random unprotected sex without STD risk being addressed, and if the female reliably climaxes multiple times a scene, then by God you'd better describe what their partner is doing in detail so the readers can test for accuracy ;)

Unless of course the superpowers are related to or impact sexual things, which could be fun too, but then I'd want to see the consequences of that explored too.
