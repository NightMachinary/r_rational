Proof by induction:

Base case: rational fics are rational (duh) Inductive case: adding a sex scene to a rational fic doesn't make the fic non-rational, providing the sex scene keeps to the rules of rational fic.

So from an intellection perspective a fic with arbitrary amounts of sex can still be rational.

However, from a past-experience perspective, any time many authors even come /close/ to writing about sex they tend devolve into wish fulfilment fantasies that are decidedly non-rational, so it's going to be something of a challenge to make sure you stay on the straight-and-narrow (so to speak).

But hey-- don't let random nerds on the internet tell you what to write. If it's something you want to do, do it. Whether it's "rational" or not doesn't matter.
