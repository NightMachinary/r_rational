On that note, [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1246519/chapters/2562553][Forever After Earth]] is the most rationalist porn fic I know -- it even pays homage to EY by having the ship named "Eliezera". I heartily recommend it.

It begins as a crossover between Buffy, Stargate SG-1 and the author's original universe, and it eventually turns into a mega-crossover that also fuses variants of Harry Potter, Madoka Magica, Nanoha, Fate Zero... That made it slightly confusing for me towards the end, and I think the early chapters are better, but still heartily recommending it.
