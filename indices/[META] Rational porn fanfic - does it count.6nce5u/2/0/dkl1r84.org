The ship name initially went right over my head, until the other details started to pile up, and then I was like "Wait, is this ship named after me?" and a chapter later "Yeah, this ship is named after me."

I'm still not used to having an influence on other fictons. It feels a lot like walking down the street and seeing a new shop has been built exactly like one you dreamed about last night: "These are my thoughts, what are they doing outside my own head?"
