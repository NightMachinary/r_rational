I don't see a reason why a rational fic cannot be porn, and vice versa.

In fact, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][Time Braid]] - essentially universally agreed to be a rational fic - is banned from TVTropes due to being too porn-like (which I can't help but find both hilarious and frustrating), and meanwhile [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/238368/friendship-is-mind-control][Friendship is Mind Control]] is definitely porn (with all that that includes), while at the same time having a rational plot (not as rational as HPMOR, maybe, but definitely on or beyond the level of HPN20), and even some rationalist themes.

So yeah, just as you can have feminist porn, you can have rational porn. It's just going to be a bit different from normal porn in some regards.
