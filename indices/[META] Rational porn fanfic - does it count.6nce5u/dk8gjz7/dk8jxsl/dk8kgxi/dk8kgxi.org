Yeah--I'm asexual and completely indifferent to the BDSM stuff, but the cool worldbuilding aspects held my interest for a long time. I stopped keeping up on it once it entered a phase where the sex-to-plot ratio got too high to keep my interest, but I could tell that it was very well written for people who are into BDSM. I thought the seraphim were really interesting.
