Yeah, seems you're right. Looking at the thread where it happened, it kind of seems like the mod in question made the decision to remove at least partly because they personally didn't like the writing, which...It's not a hill I'd die on, but I don't love the decision-making process there. The post they made right before they looked at the story didn't give me the impression that they were going into it with an open mind, either.
