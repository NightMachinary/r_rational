It's not banned! I removed /one chapter/ because it was confusing and difficult to comprehend what's going on. Seriously, /erotic/ is fine, but make it /recognizably/ erotic. If all I can tell is that something messily biological is going on, please just make the text clearer.

Here's an easy compromise: can we get warnings or ratings for how readable a text is?
