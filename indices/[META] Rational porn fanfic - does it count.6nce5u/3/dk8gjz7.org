I know there's someone here who regularly posts installments of their BDSM-themed story that is unambiguously straight up fluids-dripping erotica, in a "let's figure out the rules of this universe and its magic system, rational-style" framework. And as I recall it got a reasonably good reaction from the sub. So I'd say that's proof of concept that rational or rational-ish porn is a thing that can be written and that has an audience here.

Edit: Turns out that story was banned, so I guess it's not proof of concept for this after all.

Edit 2: Actually it was just one chapter that was removed, the story was not banned.
