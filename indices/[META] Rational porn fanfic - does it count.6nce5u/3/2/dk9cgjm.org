“The story is like a puzzle; readers can reach the same solution as the characters by using the information provided earlier in the story.” - the sidebar.

I too was very sad to see this story (rather unfairly I thought) banned, but I might try posting links to it myself when a more plotty/technical chapter turns up. I'm not the author, just a big fan.

Discussion continues elsewhere, on questionablequesting, you'll need to (free) sign up to see and post on the NSFW forums.

I've posted a number of commentaries on the forums there, including how the strange magic gravity might work, why the plot was damped while they were finding their way to their new digs, how the magic system might work, thoughts on the use of succubus nectar in transhumanism, speculation on the appearance of Limbo, why demons might be scared of copper, and getting way too into it asking questions to the characters. I've honestly found this to be one of the most thought stimulating stories I've read, up there along with the puzzley parts of HPatMoR.

Also, if you message me personally (here or there, either is fine), I'll tell you what's been going on with pets voice since near the beginning. It's such an agonisingly clever bit of writing that I decided against posting it to the forum proper.
