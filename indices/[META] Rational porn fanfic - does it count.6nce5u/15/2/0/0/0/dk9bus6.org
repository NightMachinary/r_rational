Rational people, are people, and people have sex. Period. Rational people carry intellectual genes that should be passed on. If rational people didn't like having sex, I'd say the Earth is in trouble.

Sex doesn't provide /negligible/ positive consequence, it's bonds two people together primarily, both mentally and physically. Trust, compassion, love and euphoria are created and established during sex. I'd say it's rational to want those things.

The act of creating a child further bonds those two people together. It's also a healthy activity, which promotes physical health and healthy eating. Maybe you could argue that sex is irrational from its evolutionary standpoint, where the act itself leaves you vulnerable, not to mention pregnancy itself, where even falling down can be a hazard. But then we'd be talking about the Rationality about Nature and Evolution...

Sex is a complicated topic that even involves Natural and Sexual selection. To say it's irrational with the reasons you mentioned is irrational in itself.
