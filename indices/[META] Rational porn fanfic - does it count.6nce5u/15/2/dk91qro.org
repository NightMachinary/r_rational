  Adopt a child, it's faster and safer. No point in taking risks like [...] getting murdered for inheritance.

I think you may be misunderstanding inheritance laws here.

And I think you may have some issues that are not entirely rational, too. You're afraid your children may decide to kill you? What is the probability of that happening, as opposed to being taken care of by your children in your old age? That is, after all, the traditional "rational" reason for having children.
