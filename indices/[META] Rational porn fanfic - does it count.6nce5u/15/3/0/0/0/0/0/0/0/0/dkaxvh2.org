  Does the existence of the placebo effect prove that your body is refusing to make itself healthy until it receives medicine?

Yes. Or well, not exactly. The placebo effect doesn't really have anything to do with medicine, it's about believing you will become healthier. So, even believing that your arbitrary daily routine is somehow "medical" allows the placebo effect to activate and make you healthier. It is a bit odd that your body refuses to be as healthy as it can be if you don't believe it will, but at least that's easily munchkinable: just always believe you will become healthy. A bit of a pain yes, but a relatively minor problem.
