  I'm going to assume you were being serious (as your post could've been taken for a sort of dramatically dry sarcasm, possibly)

I am being serious. Look, think about what it means for sex to have health benefits. How is that possible? I mean, sex is not injecting vitamins and vaccines into your bloodstream, nor nutrients into your stomach or oxygen into your lungs. So how in the world is it making you healthier? That makes no sense.

Yet there are studies which show that sex "makes you healthier". So think about these studies. How did they reach the conclusion that sex makes you healthier? Well, they must have compared two groups of people, one group that had sex, and one group that didn't, and found that the first group had better health than the second. (+ whatever control groups and so on for avoiding bias.) Since we have established that "having sex gives you health bonuses" makes no sense, the obvious conclusion is that "not having sex gives you health penalties".

After mulling over it for a while, I concluded that the most likely method by which "sex gives you health bonuses", is by releasing something like a signal hormone when you have sex, and the hormone then tells your body to make itself healthier. The act of having sex does not give you the special chemicals needed to construct this hormone, your body could just as easily make that hormone, or make itself healthier without that hormone. But it won't. It purposefully refuses to make itself healthier until you have sex.

In other words, if you refuse to have sex, your body refuses to make itself healthier. It could, but it won't. It just half-asses its life-sustaining activities. That is pretty much a health penalty by definition. QED: people who do abstain from sex, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, *are all suffering ill effects from it.*

  Does that put you somewhat outside of the norm, neurologically?

I'm not worried about norms and social customs. I'm worried about death. What I just found out is that virginity is comparable to malnutrition, as absurd as that sounds, just lesser in magnitude depending on how large these "health benefits" are.

- Malnutrition: Your body lacks to nutrients to conduct proper life-sustaining activities.
- Virginity: Your body has the nutrients, but refuses to conduct proper life-sustaining activities with them.

So abstaining from sex has similar health penalties as not eating sufficient amounts of nutrients. And so refusing someone's sexual advances is analogous to refusing to give a starving person food. Sure, maybe someone else could give them food, but if everyone thinks that and refuses to help, that person is just going to wither away from malnutrition until they die. Does this not weigh on your conscience? Because it does on mine. I do not like dying, or causing other people to die. Yet it seems that a lot of my actions have been raising the probability of both, and I am honestly freaking out about that.
