Consider that 'statistically significant' isn't always large, and that you should probably read the study before freaking out and should then keep the freakout proportional to the size of the possible gain plus or minus an order of magnitude.

It may be that you value an extra on-average half hour of life enough that you'll engage in sex even if it's not enjoyable for you, but I wouldn't make that tradeoff. It may be that I'd make an equivalent tradeoff -- like abstaining forever -- in exchange for several more decades of life. The quantities involved matter, basically.
