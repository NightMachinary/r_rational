There are other non-transient benefits to regular sex. Studies have shown it contributes to immune system growth, partner intimacy and trust, lowers the risk of heart attacks (one of the largest single causes of death), releases enough endorphins to function as an analgesic, and lowers stress and anxiety. There's even some tentative evidence that it increases short-term mental acuity.

Many of these are actual significant benefits that people would seek out.

The fact that they also come from a pleasurable activity just makes it even better.

As to desires: Rationalism is used to acquire your goals, not to define when those goals are. Quirrelmort is no less rational a character simply because he delights in causing death to others and maximizes his ability to do so. Rationality isn't morality.

For some people, sex is a terminal value (or biological children are). You don't use rationality to convince someone to change their terminal values, they use it to maximize those values.
