I would say that's true of all writing, and not to such a lesser extent that it suddenly becomes only important for sex.

The vast majority of fictional authors write because of intrinsic motivation, it's another thing when you're talking about mandatory essays or reports but as long as humans are a bunch of chemicals and physical processes rather than a set of rules there will always be irrational/arational motivations.
