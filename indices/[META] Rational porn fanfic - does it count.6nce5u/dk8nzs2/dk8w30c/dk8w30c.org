I agree with you, but in the interest of steelmanning the opposition: sex is an extremely... well, /arousing/ thing, and it's reasonable to assume that an author of erotica is driven, at least to some extent, by his/her own fantasies. There's nothing wrong with that, of course, but it does mean that there are additional factors at play during the course of writing a story wherein sex features heavily, and that these factors tend to be at best /arational/. (Something similar could be said of high-adrenaline fight scenes, of course, but to a lesser extent.)
