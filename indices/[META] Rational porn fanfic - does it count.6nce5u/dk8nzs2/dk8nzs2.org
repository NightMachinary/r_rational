Replace "sex scene" with "fight scene" and all of a sudden it doesn't seem like it's a question that you need to bother asking, if you get me: I assume everyone would be fine with a rational superhero fanfic where spiderman gets into very well described karate battles that get into explicit detail. Maybe people might not enjoy reading well-described fight scenes like that - I know that's not really my jam - but nobody would think that your story was /not rational/ just because you thought that including detailed fight scenes was helpful to your story.

The fact you replace "scenes where they're trying to poke each other with swords" with "scenes where they're trying to /poke/ each other with /swords/" and all of a sudden there's a question says a lot about what people think about the "prestige" of different stories in general.

If you want to write a "low-prestige" story, more power to you, I say. We always need more diversity, and the rational space is no exception. I'm working on an original supernatural romance (non-explicit) partly for this reason (mostly because I wanted to write one).

More power to you, I say. It's not really something I'd like to read personally (I'm not a fan of superhero stories, and I like my titillating stories to be very light on plot), but if I see you post it here I'll try to give it a shot.
