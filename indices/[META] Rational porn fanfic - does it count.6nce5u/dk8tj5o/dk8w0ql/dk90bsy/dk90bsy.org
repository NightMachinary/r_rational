Okay, I'll bite.

  Whether their utility functions are selfish or selfless, having sex usually provides negligible positive consequences.

Are orgasms and physical pleasure negligible? They're transient sensations within a moment, sure, but I don't see that as a reason to discount them. Generally, the reason we optimize for the long-term is because we anticipate that eventually the future we've planned for will become the present, and we'll be able to reap rewards at the end of the day.

Is physical intimacy negligible? I really don't think so, considering it brings me so much satisfaction, as a means of achieving emotional intimacy.

  Want an heir? Adopt a child, it's faster and safer.

I think you've already baked your presumptions into the question by talking about 'heirs'

Some people just really, genuinely want biological children. You can argue with them until you're blue in the face about how adoption is faster and safer, or about how they're contributing to overpopulation, or about how they can find an heir in some other way, but the fact of the matter is - they want biological children. That's it. That's just something in the bedrock of their value system.

  No point in taking risks like STDs or death from childbirth or getting murdered for inheritance.

This is just an issue of optimization trade-offs. Some people will value risk-aversion over their sexuality and reproductive drive, so they will be chaste. Some people will value sexual satisfaction and reproduction over risk-aversion, and so they will be promiscuous. And some people will compromise, using birth control (temporary or otherwise) and risk management.

Now, that's not to say that some of these people might not be acting against their better judgement, but I don't think we can say that it's /prima facie/ wrong to engage in any of these behaviors, or to have these desires.
