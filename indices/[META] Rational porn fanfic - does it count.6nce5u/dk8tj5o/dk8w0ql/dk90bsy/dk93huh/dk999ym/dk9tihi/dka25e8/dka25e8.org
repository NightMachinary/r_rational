Ok. Let's take it down a couple notches there, my guy/gal.

I'm going to assume you were being serious (as your post could've been taken for a sort of dramatically dry sarcasm, possibly) and I'll respond in kind:

Sex is an important facet of the human experience for most people. It has a number of health benefits, though I must point out that most of these benefits are nothing you couldn't obtain from a modicum of exercise. It provides a level of intimacy on a biological and emotional level. It feels /awesome/. Pregnancy, while not without its risks, is a generally safe process, especially if you're consulting your OBGYN regularly, as there are ways to evaluate how well your body would handle a pregnancy even before you're pregnant.

All of the above being said, that doesn't mean you should be scared/worried that you don't value sex in the same way. That's perfectly fine. Natural selection isn't holding a gun to your head. There are obvious built-in incentives for humans to have sex but that doesn't mean you'll be harmed in any way by choosing to abstain yourself. You won't suffer any ill effects from abstaining from sex because you honestly have no desire for it. Does that put you somewhat outside of the norm, neurologically? Sure. Asexuality certainly isn't anywhere close to the majority. But every human is outside of the norm in some fashion. For some, it just happens to be in that way. And they'll be none the worse for wear for it.
