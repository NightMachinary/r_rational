As I said before, dial it back. Most of the benefits attained through regular sex are just as attainable through regular exercise. There's nothing inherent about sex that will extend your lifespan to the point where you should be concerned about the amount of sex you're getting from a medical standpoint.

Do you feel as if you would die from not taking multivitamins on schedule? Or not closely adhering to typical nutritional guidelines every day? If your answer to those questions is no, then you shouldn't concern yourself with the thought of the potential downsides of not having sex. They're really not all that bad.
