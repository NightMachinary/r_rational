  I am being serious. Look, think about what it means for sex to have health benefits. How is that possible? I mean, sex is not injecting vitamins and vaccines into your bloodstream, nor nutrients into your stomach or oxygen into your lungs. So how in the world is it making you healthier? That makes no sense.

  In other words, if you refuse to have sex, your body refuses to make itself healthier. It could, but it won't. It just half-asses its life-sustaining activities. That is pretty much a health penalty by definition. QED: people who do abstain from sex, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, are all suffering ill effects from it.

Does the existence of the placebo effect prove that your body is refusing to make itself healthy until it receives medicine?
