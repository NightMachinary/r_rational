  Most of the benefits attained through regular sex are just as attainable through regular exercise.

Erm, what? If that's true, then how does sex give you health benefits? That just makes it sound like the exercise part of sex is what's giving you the benefit, and surely the studies made a control group for that. Like, compared the health of a group of people that exercise and have sex, versus a group of people that exercise but not have sex, and found that the first group had better health.

  There's nothing inherent about sex that will extend your lifespan to the point where you should be concerned about the amount of sex you're getting from a medical standpoint.

They literally said that one of the health benefits is reduced risk of heart attacks. In order for a study to say that, the difference must be *statistically significant*. I.e., the group of people that exercise but don't have sex are significantly more likely to get heart attacks than the group of people that exercise and have sex. Heart attacks kinda kill you, that's lifespan shortening.

  Do you feel as if you would die from not taking multivitamins on schedule? Or not closely adhering to typical nutritional guidelines every day?

I'm honestly quite concerned about these issues too. Improper eating probably does have significant health effects. Unfortunately, nutrition is one of those really confusing problems since everyone needs different amounts of different things, and it's not even consistent from day to day. If I had the money to spare I would hire a team of nutritionists/doctors/etc. to tell me what I had to consume.
