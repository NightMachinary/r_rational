I'll be blunt: your and [[/u/MasterfulSandking]] 's replies terrify me. I was not aware of all the health benefits of sex, and I can't believe other people aren't freaking out about this.

Do you understand what this means? It means that all along, your body had the power to make itself healthy. But it doesn't if you don't have sex, even though it can. Because of course it can, you aren't getting special health nutrients from having sex, sex is obviously just a trigger for the release of hormones that tell your body to be healthy. In other words, we are slaves, being held at metaphorical gunpoint by natural selection. Unless its demands are met, it will ill-treat our bodies until they break down. And its demands are for us to have sex and thus produce more slaves for natural selection.

I had always thought of natural selection as a will o' wisp, encouraging people to take actions that endanger themselves and everyone around them as long as it helps to produce more grandchildren. Now I learn it is also a vengeful god, writing down the names of the disobedient people who refuse to have sex and killing them via heart attacks and other health problems. If you choose to be abstinent, your body just goes "Oh look, doctor smart-ass brain doesn't want to get with the program. Screw it, why bother to keep it alive then! Let's just half-ass our maintenance until it gives up or dies."

And you know what the worst part is? This means that every time you reject someone's romantic/sexual advances, you could be condemning them to an early grave. By denying them from having sex, you make them unable to appease the vengeful god of natural selection, and so it destroys their bodies from the inside. It doesn't even care that they aren't at fault for not being able to have sex, it kills them anyway.

I don't even know what to say at this point. In light of this, it seems that having sex is not only rational, but enforced by threat of death. I'm going to need to rethink many of my life choices...
