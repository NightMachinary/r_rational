  Now, that's not to say that some of these people might not be acting against their better judgement, but I don't think we can say that it's prima facie wrong to engage in any of these behaviors, or to have these desires.

I do not believe it is wrong (in any sense) to have desires, since desires may not be fully controllable. What could be wrong is whether one acts on those desires. For example, there's nothing wrong with having murderous rage, but actually murdering someone can be wrong. So the question isn't whether it's wrong to have sexual desire, but whether it's wrong to have sex.

Consider drug abuse. Drugs can give you an inordinate amount of transient happiness. But is it rational to abuse drugs then? Considering the long term consequences, which includes risk of death by drug overdose, I would say no. Because while transient happiness is not nothing, isn't it negligible compared to the risk of death?

By the same logic, I cannot see the transient happiness of sex as a good reason to have sex, not when there's plenty of evidence for sex-related deaths. So if sex isn't wrong, if it is indeed rational to have sex, then there must be some long term positive consequence of sex.

The problem is, for most of the long-term positive consequences of sex, it seems like there are better/safer alternatives. Children can be adopted. Intimacy can be achieved in other ways. You can engage in physical activities that are close to sex but do not involve contact between reproductive organs. If you want biological children, you can donate sperm/eggs, or have babies produced in vitro rather than via sex. So I find it odd if these alternatives are not used instead of sex.
