I'm confused by sex in a rational fic, because rational people tend to not have sex. Whether their utility functions are selfish or selfless, having sex usually provides negligible positive consequences. Want an heir? Adopt a child, it's faster and safer. No point in taking risks like STDs or death from childbirth or getting murdered for inheritance.
