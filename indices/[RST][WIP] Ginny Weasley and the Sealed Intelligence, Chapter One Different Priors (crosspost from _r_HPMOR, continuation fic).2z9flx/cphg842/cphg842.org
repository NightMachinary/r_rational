I like the set up so far, but some of the characterisation is really off. I don't mind the totally-not-canon Molly and Arthur, because maybe something prophecies something, and Ginny is fine because that is the point of the fic (presumably), but Ron saying "stupid little sister" like a stuck up Slytherin? It sounds like he is about to call her vexing and push his glasses up his nose.

Ron /was/ present in HPMOR, and he didn't sound like that.

The last line is very crackish, too. Is it meant to be? Ginny cannot possibly know what a velociraptor is.
