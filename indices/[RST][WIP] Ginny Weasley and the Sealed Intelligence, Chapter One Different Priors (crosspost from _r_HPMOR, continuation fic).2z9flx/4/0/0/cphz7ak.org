While I DO agree, I will say the line there is quite murky. While HPMOR and this fic are both third person, they're still clearly from the protagonist's perspective. Very rarely are we omnisciently narrated to. So I think a line like that can come off as being something Ginny would think/say, as opposed to the omniscient narrator. Hence the confusion.
