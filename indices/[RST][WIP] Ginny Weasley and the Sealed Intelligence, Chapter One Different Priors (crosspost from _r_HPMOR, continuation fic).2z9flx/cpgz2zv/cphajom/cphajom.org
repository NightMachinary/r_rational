  "They never cared to find the optimal solution to anything, only the nearby one." That complaint seems like something a straw-rationalist would say. Almost optimal is really good enough in most cases.

I liked that line in the story. While I agree that the almost optimal solution is usually good enough unlike you, I don't think the "nearby one" is "almost optional".
