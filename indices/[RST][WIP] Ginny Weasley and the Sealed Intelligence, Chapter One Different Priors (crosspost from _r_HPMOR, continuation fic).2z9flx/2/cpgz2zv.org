I like it. I think almost all HP fics I've read had Harry or an OC/next-gen as a protagonist. /The Very Secret Diary/ being a notable exception.

I liked the nod towards the beginning of the Philosopher's Stone and MOR.

I don't think Arthur, at least in canon, would argue with his wive. He would be more likely to stonewall. I don't think Arthur ever shouts unless it's about something really important, such as the safety of his family.

I'm not sure what reasons---besides her hero worship, of cource---Giny has for thinking that Harry outsmarted You-Know-Who or that he set up his fall.

"They never cared to find the optimal solution to anything, only the nearby one." That complaint seems like something a straw-rationalist would say. Almost optimal is really good enough in most cases.

It'd be funny if she were sorted into Slytherin. I'd like that. Her family would go crazy. And the reformation of Slytherin is something that would definitely happen in Harry's second year, I think.

I've to confess, I never saw the word 'storge' before.

It doesn't really show in canon, but in my opinion Ginny and Ron should be quite close. They are almost the same age and they spend a few years alone together with their parents (well and Bill, I suppose), their siblings all in Hogwarts or having moved out already.
