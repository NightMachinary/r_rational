Love that.

I'll raise it even higher: Fel Seed never actually cheated, he just /also/ had an enormous cache of synergistic and abusable entads, all touching a small fragment of his body in a hidden vault impervious to all known forms of destruction...

But anti-matter wasn't known.

Or maybe that'll just be the DMs excuse for the nerf. "It's not like i wanted you to win or anything!"
