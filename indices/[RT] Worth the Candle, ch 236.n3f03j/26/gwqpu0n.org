Fantastic chapter; my satisfaction at seeing various plot points wrapped up and my sadness that it's going to end soon have been at odds all week.

It seems like the full-power vorpal blade destroys, not just the physical target, but the very /concept/ of the target. Seems like that would be an essential part of the "kill everything" sword in a world with memetics. I wonder what the implications of that are in the broader "Juniper's therapy session" metanarrative.

I'm curious in upcoming chapters to see how far-reaching the "antimemetic" effect is- will Joon remember the /original/ Fell Seed Incident?
