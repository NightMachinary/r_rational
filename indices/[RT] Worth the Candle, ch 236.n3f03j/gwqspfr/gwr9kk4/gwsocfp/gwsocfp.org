FS also attributed his relatively lacking victory last time to the locus, which was not present this go around, so he may have been taking it easy on them / overconfident / savoring the moment / curious about them potentially opening the door.

I'd note that FS only punches Pallida /after/ she finishes her work on the door.

The fact that the door opened at all was definitely DM fiat, but FS probably didn't understand that and expected to take control of the door after the party opened it.
