the first time through WAS different, because he was an invincible narrative monster. then the GM cut the strings that let him cheat, and a practical rules-hack to gain godlike power worked.

I do think it had a bit of a weird tone in the final fight scene, it felt slightly perfunctory. not sure if that was intended or just the author's mental state. if the hell sequence was a few chapters longer with some challenges & character growth, and this scene was written more dramatically, I think it would have run true.

but maybe the whole point was anticlimax.
