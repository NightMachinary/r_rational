I think the problem is that it feels unconnected. Yes they earned it by literally coming back from hell to make it for a round 2, but the party barely changed up their approach to Fel Seed. It feels like they didn't learn from their last fight and just completely relied on the DM nerfing Fel Seed to guarantee a win. Even though it worked out, it still feels slightly unsatisfying.

It probably would have been better if Juniper and co had learned or found something in the hells to directly use in the fight to make the hell-diving an integral component to the solution instead of relying purely on narrative to secure the win.
