I think the fact that it wasn't so special this time around is the 'fair second chance' they were banking on. For similar reasons, I think that a Bethel-copied Vorpal Sword would not have worked last time, for one of a variety of reasons.

The narrative kept mentioning the hope of a fair fight or no cheating the second time around, and that's what this was. What made Fel Seed special was the unstoppable 'you lose' built into his definition, and once the DM stripped that away he was reduced to 'merely' an overwhelming puzzle boss.

The disappointment you feel is sorta intentional. The emotional set-up for a transcendental victory over Fel Seed could only happen if they won according to the original rules, but instead they were handed a different, nerfed, Fel Seed, and even if AW tried for a transcendental emotional victory it would have rang hollow, so he just didn't.
