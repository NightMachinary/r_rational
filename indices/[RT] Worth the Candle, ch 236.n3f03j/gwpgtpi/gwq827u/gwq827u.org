I feel like the narrative answer is "DM Fiat to metaphorically excise what Fel Seed represented from Joon's psyche". It's telling that he specifically couldn't avoid the vorpal strike; I'm not sure if it's the only thing that could ever have worked on him, but it feels like ending the fight with it was what "needed to happen"

As for the in-story explanation, it honestly might be all three. The idea of Fel Seed being unbeatable might need to be slain in order to beat him, and the vorpal blade might allow the Mome Rath antimemetic properties to propagate into where they needed to be in order to handle that.

...come to think of it, burning the Mome Rath bone should have given Joon himself antimemtic properties, right? That seems...curiously absent from the whole affair.
