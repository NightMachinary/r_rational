So what caused the antimemetic effect on FS?

- Was it a side-effect of the Mome Rath bone's use?

- Is it a standard power of the Vorpal Blade that its full strength destroys things even at the memetic level (which may be what Joon describes when he feels it cutting through more than the physical)?

- Was Fel Seed a meme, (hence allowing to return in the Library timelines and this one just like Figaro Finch, and also giving a bridge between Joon's creation of Fel Seed on earth and Fel Seed's origins on Aerb), and thus any true destruction of Fel Seed would necessarily occur at the memetic level?
