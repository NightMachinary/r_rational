Yeah, that was a thought I had as well.

Joon assumes that he's cheating, but early on he has a glimpse at Fel Seed's true nature, as a Death-Star-like giant organic factory and weapons platform.

Given that fact, and the huge number of entads Fel Seed would have at its disposal, /and/ the fact they're explicitly never harming it as much as blowing up the puppets it sends at them while hoping it humors them for long enough...

Saying that it cheats might be a bad assessment. Rather, it's like a larger-scale version of Bethel, where it has so many tools and super-powerful techniques accumulated over the centuries (maybe even something like in the DFEZ, where it breeds generation of mages of various categories to unlock new powers) that anybody taking its superficial form at face value would interpret what it's /actually/ able to do as diabolus ex machina bullshit.

(eg we see in an alternate timeline that the Fifth Empire tried to raze the zone to the bedrock, and nuke Thousand Brides... but it's possible FS just had backup "facilities" under the bedrock, or in other dimensions, etc)
