It's very interesting how Joon has begun referring to Arthur as Uther even in internal narration; the DM corrected him to "Arthur" in Hellfall, and here he thinks to himself "Somewhere in there, Uther lay ahead of us.".

Speaking of Arthur, he's spent something like 500 years inside Long Stairs. That's a lot of time to spend reflecting on American jingoism in the middle east, and I eagerly await his conclusions.
