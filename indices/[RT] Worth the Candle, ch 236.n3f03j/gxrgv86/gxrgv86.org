Dropping in from far back in the chapters cuz I'm getting a teeny tiny bit tired of the "marriage" between the mc and Amaryllis never really being discussed between the two. Does it ever happen at one point or do they just keep pretending it's a mercenary arrangement and nothing more about apparently loving each other? I know I'm asking for spoilers 😁 Just getting frustrated. I like the story but it drives me mad at times 😅
