I dunno, it just feels right to have the asspull that kills FS be the fact that Juniper was the True Master of the copy, because of the way that the original FS no-sold the attack.

But I've been off base about a lot of things. Sometimes I wonder if part of the fun for WtC for me isn't coming to conclusions and inferences that are wildly, thoroughly wrong and get thermonuclearly dismantled.
