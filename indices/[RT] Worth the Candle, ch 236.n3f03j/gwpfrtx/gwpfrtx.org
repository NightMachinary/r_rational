This is my headcanon; Toad-son, abandoned by his deadbeat dad, did not slip into hatred and resentment the way an unenlightened being would have. Rather, he only felt love for his father. Knowing about the impending fight he snuck into the FSEZ, waited for the perfect moment, and used all his power to do one thing; slow Fel Seed down enough that he could not dodge the sword. He didn't even need to tell anyone that he was the real hero, being with his dad after the fight was reward enough.
