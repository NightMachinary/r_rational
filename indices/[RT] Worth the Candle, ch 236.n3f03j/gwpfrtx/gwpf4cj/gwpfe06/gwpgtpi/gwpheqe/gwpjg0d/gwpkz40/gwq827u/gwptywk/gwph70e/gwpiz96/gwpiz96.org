I don't think he's a meme exactly.

As I speculated below, I don't think he is the biomanipulation exclusion. Rather, his exclusion is about fear and drawing power from people's fear - all your inner dark shit. Body horror was just how he did that.

Joon created Fel Seed in the real world to deal with his grief. Fel Seed was a manifestation of that grief.

This Fel Seed is the same. As long as people remember him he can regenerate form the fear and despair and depression he germinates in their hearts.

Someone, likely Amaryllis, realised this and set up the antimeme. Defeat Fel Seed and then wipe away all knowledge of him and he can't come back.

The line between this and being a meme is narrow but I think the difference is there is/was a real Fel Seed and the magic was about drawing power from people's fear rather than being it.
