  So what caused the antimemetic effect on FS?
#+end_quote

My head canon is that Mome Rath and this antimemetic effect of the Vorpal Sword are part of the same magical phenomenon which is related to the briefly mentioned magic of Carrollism. Carrollism is one of the possible magics that Juniper thinks of when trapped in the illusion exclusion at Speculation and Scrutiny, and antimemetic magic could certainly cause some of the same effects. Mome Rath and the vorpal sword are obviously connected to the Jabberwocky poem, as is Fel Seed (A Manxome Foe). I think it's also tied in to Juniper's comments during the Mome Rath chapter about finding an idea that unified and tied together the idea of the vorpal sword in his Jabberwocky Cinematic Universe - he said that the idea of "cutting off the head" is scarier than it seems, and this kind of fate where all memory of you is destroyed, seems thematically appropriate.
