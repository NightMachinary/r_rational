Honestly, I'm kind of dissappointed with how they killed Fel Seed. I don't know what I was expecting the solution to be, but "hitting him even harder" feels like a letdown. Yes, I know the DM wasn't letting him cheat this time, and yes, I know the vorpal sword is a special weapon that kills things really hard, but still. There was all that build up, we had the first attempt to demonstrate the futility of the direct approach, we had the DM outright saying that Fel Seed's weakness was the existence of the DM, and what does it all amount to? The same thing that got them killed the first time, except now it works.

I'm still enjoying the story and I'm eager to see where things go with the Long Stairs, but I'm not a big fan of this chapter. It's just unsatisfying.
