  The one drawback, aside from trying to fight fucking Fel Seed, was that we'd lost a fair number of entads. Everything I'd been wearing was gone, left in the FSEZ and then presumably completely annihilated. I counted us lucky, very lucky that Amaryllis hadn't lost all her inherited entads when she'd died, since there was no known precedent for what happened when you brought someone back from the dead

Uther will get all his stuff back then

Would seem bs if you got resuscitated and lost everything. Speaking of which what counts as dead for entads. How about zombies?

If Uther counts as dead since he's in Long Stairs is that true for Amy too?
