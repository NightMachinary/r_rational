  I counted us lucky, very lucky that Amaryllis hadn't lost all her inherited entads when she'd died, since there was no known precedent for what happened when you brought someone back from the dead.

It's not valid precedent as it doesn't involve the Hells at all, but I wonder how entad inheritance works for renacim. Do they inherit permissions from their bioparents? Do they keep permissions from their previous incarnations? Do they lose them, but regain them when they age into the age-band they had the permission in?
