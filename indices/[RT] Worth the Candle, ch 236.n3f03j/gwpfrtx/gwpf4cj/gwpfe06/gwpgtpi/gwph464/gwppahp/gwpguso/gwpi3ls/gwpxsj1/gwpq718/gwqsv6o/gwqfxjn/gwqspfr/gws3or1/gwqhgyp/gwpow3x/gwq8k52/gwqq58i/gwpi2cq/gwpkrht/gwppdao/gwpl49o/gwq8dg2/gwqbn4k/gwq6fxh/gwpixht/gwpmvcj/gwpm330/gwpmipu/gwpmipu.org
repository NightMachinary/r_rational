That's fair enough, and I think even in text it's been clear that it is narratively tricky to write out of the hole of an invincible monster. I wouldn't say that it's “just” copying the sword, but that the answer would never show up unless the proper character development occurred.

I'm as satisfied as I think I could be, which is considerably less than I was for the DFEZ, but I can't think of a better solution for this one than we got, with the current setup.
