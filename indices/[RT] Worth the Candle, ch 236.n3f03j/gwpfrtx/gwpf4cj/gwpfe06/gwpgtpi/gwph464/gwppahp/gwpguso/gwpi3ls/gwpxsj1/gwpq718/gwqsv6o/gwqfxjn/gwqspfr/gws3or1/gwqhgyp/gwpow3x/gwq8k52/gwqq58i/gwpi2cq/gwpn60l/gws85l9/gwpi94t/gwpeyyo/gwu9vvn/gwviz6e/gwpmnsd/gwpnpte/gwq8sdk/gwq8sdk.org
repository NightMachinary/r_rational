It's worth noting that they used the Vorpal Blade in the initial attack but with less power, and it did in fact dismember the Fel Seed copy that it hit. In contrast, the blade in the original campaign did literally nothing. I'm not sure if this means full committing to the attack the first go around would have worked, but it's interesting to think about.
