I get that, but that still means the answer was just finding a way to hit him very hard. It still makes Fel Seed feel like just another boss monster, where up to this point he'd been presented as both a statement on the nature of the "game" and an indictment of Juniper's character.

Regardless of what explanations you can give for why things worked out this time, however much the in-universe mechanics of it all might make sense, on an out-of-universe level this chapter completely ignored what made Fel Seed interesting. This fight wasn't meaningfully different from the fight with Mome Rath or Onion when I feel like it really should have been. I get it if I'm in the minority on this, I just needed to get it out there.
