You're assuming that the DM is special in some way that the Layman isn't. My assumption is that the guy in the sweatshirt is just another convenient way to interface with the system but doesn't accurately reflect any sort of secret truth about the universe any more than the game layer throwing up error messages indicates that the universe actually runs the risk of a null pointer exception. They're all part of the same creation that includes Earth and Bumblefuck, Kansas.
