I suspect that the layman could be sweet talked into saying so, but my first instinct is to say no, Bethel is still the master of the sword at that point. The ickiness is in the notion that mastery is transitive and Bethel has a master, thereby permitting Bethel's mastery to wield (if it's Joon) or bestow (if the master is Amaryllis; alternatively you could double down on the ick factor by saying Joon is Amy's master) the sword as the sword's master.
