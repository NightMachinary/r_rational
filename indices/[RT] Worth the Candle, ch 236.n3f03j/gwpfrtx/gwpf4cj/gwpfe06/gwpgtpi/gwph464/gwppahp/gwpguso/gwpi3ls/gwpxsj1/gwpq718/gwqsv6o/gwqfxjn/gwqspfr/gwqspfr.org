So... Is Fel Seed actually dead then? If so, that felt really wrong. I like how they won, it meshes, but it felt so much less dangerous than before. In the last fight it felt like every second spent fighting was a second spent in imminent death; he was one shotting invincible wards faster than people could perceive. He was killing people during the loops constantly but this time, he slashes at Raven and she survives? I mean he punches Pallida in the head, and she lives. This is the same guy who squeezed real hard and started breaking something inviolable. Iunno, it was almost like the GM turned down the difficulty.
