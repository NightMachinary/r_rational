I can't help but notice that we still have the whole thing with the Layman and the Architect and all these other something-or-others that the Layman and the DM have hinted at existing. Presumably it's a collection of entities that the DM uses to help manage the game, but are they just going to remain assumed background lore or is there still room in the story for them to come into play in a bigger way?
