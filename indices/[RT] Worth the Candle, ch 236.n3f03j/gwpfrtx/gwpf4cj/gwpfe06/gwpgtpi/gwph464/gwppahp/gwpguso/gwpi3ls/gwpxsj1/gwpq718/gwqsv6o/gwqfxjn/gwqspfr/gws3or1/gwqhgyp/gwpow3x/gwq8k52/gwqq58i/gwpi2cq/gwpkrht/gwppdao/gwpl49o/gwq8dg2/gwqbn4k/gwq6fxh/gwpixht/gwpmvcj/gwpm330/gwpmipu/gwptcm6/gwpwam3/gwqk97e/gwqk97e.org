I agree with you about the scene feeling unconnected, but I think the events themselves have been getting less and less important in WtC than the narrative has. I mean, Fel Seed is here literally not as the big bad, despite how much he was built up over the series, but as a stepping stone because that's not the level that Joon and co are operating at any more. So from a "reader looking at the narrative" rather than the events perspective, to mirror the shift in focus the characters have had, Joon getting rid of the person he once was and being better than he used to be (as was bought up in the chat with Fenn just last chapter), signified by wiping away the incarnation of his worst moment that he was frequently reminded of and constantly regretted throughout his time on Aerb, this scene works at that level.

I think the sidequest montage from earlier reinforces this too, as the lack of focus on having scenes that flowed together like earlier parts of the series is because the story as an adventure has taken a backseat to the story as focused on characters, drawn more from their overarching motivations than from their individual actions moment to moment. After like 1.5 million words, we've reached the point of getting an understanding of the characters, as readers, that skipping over the finer details for a larger scale perspective is doable, and fits with the plans of the characters themselves being concerned with the larger scale of their world/s too.
