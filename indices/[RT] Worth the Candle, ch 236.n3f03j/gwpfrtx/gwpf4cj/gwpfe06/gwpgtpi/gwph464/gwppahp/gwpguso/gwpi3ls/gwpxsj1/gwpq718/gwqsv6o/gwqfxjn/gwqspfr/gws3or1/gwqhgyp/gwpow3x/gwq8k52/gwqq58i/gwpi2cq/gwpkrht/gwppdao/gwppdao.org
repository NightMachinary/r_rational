My theory is as following: FS was unbeatable during Joons real life campaign, because he as a DM could just make up any power he wanted to, to counter the players actions.

FS in Aerb operated the same way. The DM could just retroactively give FS abilitys and preparations to beat anything they would bring against him.

When Joon died, the DM left the game. so FS would get no new abilities when needed and there was no more DM cheating than previously established. That way, they could beat FS by using a new approach. I'm quite sure the "clone Vorpal Blade" strategy wouldn't have worked on their first try.
