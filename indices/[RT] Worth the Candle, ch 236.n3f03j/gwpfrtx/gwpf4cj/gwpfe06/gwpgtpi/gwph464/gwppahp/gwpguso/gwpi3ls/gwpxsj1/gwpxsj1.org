  "At the point in time when bullets can pass through the interdimensional walls, when firepower takes up the entirety and eternity of space and time, all beings stuck in a never ending life and death cycle as bullets recover and destroy their bodies in quick succession, no one able to think about anything but the sheer force of the bullets rapidly flying literally everywhere in Aerb, turning the Void itself into nothing but a sea of semi-automatic weaponry - Then there will be enough dakka.

  Or at least almost."
