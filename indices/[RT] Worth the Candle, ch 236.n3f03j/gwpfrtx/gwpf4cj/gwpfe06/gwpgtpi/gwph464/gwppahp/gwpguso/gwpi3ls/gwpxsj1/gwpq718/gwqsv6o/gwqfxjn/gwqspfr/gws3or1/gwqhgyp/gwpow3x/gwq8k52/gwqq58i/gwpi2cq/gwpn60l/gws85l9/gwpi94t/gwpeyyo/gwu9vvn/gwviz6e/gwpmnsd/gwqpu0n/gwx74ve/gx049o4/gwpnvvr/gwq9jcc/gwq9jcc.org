I don't get the idea of trying to use the Vorpal blade against Fel Seed. It's pretty much the most clearly established thing to not work. He shouldn't have been worried about using a copy. That's important. The Vorpal blade might be capable of harming Fel Seed, but it's not willing. An inferior copy is less likely capable of harming him, but it at least might be willing to.
