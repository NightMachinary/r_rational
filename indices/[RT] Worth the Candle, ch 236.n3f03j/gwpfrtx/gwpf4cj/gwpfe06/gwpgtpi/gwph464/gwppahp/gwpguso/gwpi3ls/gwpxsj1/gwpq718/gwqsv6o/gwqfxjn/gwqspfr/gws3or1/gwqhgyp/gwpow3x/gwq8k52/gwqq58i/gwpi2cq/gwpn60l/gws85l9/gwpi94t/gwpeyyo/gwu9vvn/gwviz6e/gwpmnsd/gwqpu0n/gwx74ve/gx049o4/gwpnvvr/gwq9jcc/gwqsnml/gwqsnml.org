The true Vorpal Blade won't harm Fel Seed because Fel Seed is the Vorpal Blade's master. (Edit: Maybe wrong.) Joon was using another sword, bound to him, that copied the powers of the Vorpal Sword.

Fel Seed didn't have immunity to the Vorpal power, he had the loyalty of the (a, now) Vorpal Sword, which is different.
