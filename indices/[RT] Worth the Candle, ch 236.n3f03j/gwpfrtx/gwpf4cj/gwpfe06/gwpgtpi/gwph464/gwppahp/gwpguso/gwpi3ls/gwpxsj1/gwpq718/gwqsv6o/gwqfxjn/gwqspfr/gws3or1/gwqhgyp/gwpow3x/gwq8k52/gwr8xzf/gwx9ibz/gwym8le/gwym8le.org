I am, yeah; the whole thing makes the most sense to me that way, in the sense that there's SOME animating intelligence behind the whole thing (even if it is just Joon's subconscious and/or typical thought processes being extrapolated and put to purpose by...something) and if we're going to refer to that as something it may as well be the something with a face that we're familiar with. He seems to be nominally "in charge" of the whole process.

That said, thinking of the whole shebang as essentially a convenient display device for something much more abstract is honestly something I hadn't considered before now and makes a lot of sense. I suppose in that case even the "other entities" might not really be a thing so much as representations that will pop in and out when a specific manner of interface is required.

The only quibble I have is the DM at one point stating that he leaves some things to the Architect; this does imply a certain level of mental coherence/separation on their part, although if we consider the extrapolation thing above to have formed "a mind" that is managing Aerb, the DM could just be (or represent) the conscious, directing part of it.
