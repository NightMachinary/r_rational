  Was Fel Seed a meme, (hence allowing to return in the Library timelines and this one just like Figaro Finch, and also giving a bridge between Joon's creation of Fel Seed on earth and Fel Seed's origins on Aerb), and thus any true destruction of Fel Seed would necessarily occur at the memetic level?

This was my theory. We saw Figaro Finch return from death, and to me it seemed that this was suspiciously similar to how Fel Seed was described as returning from death. IMO the reason why Joon was able to kill him was because of drawing from Mome Rath (who?) bones, with their antimemetic effect.
