Supposedly it was the sword that cut through the marvelous creation of Hiawatha’s, killing man and oracular contraption in a single stroke. Supposedly it killed King Hal in a duel the very moment it touched him — not even breaking skin, just grazing the layer of wax that his armor was polished with. And of the Rilchiam, the less said, the better.”  “Dead though, right?” asked Tom.  “There are fates worse than death,” I replied. “And deaths so final they’re hard to speak of.”=

He falls apart, head falling off his neck, vertebrae disconnected, the knuckles of his fingers making a staccato sound as they hit the ground one after the other. He lays on the ground, completely dismembered. You get the sense that something more has happened to him, some metaphysical dismembering, but it’s beyond your ken.”=
