I took it as "overdamage". Which is to say, that normally the most you could possibly drain yourself for the Vorpal Blade was 100%, but the sheer weight of the Mome Rath bones let him pour 10,000% of his strength in instead (and crucially, not all of it sourced from him himself).

So if 10% of Joon's own formidable life force was enough to smear an avatar of Fel Seed, and (say) 1000% of himself was enough to actually kill Fel Seed the person, then 10,000% of himself was so much overkill it spilled over into erasing the very idea of Fel Seed.

Either that or something something mixing in the antimemetic effects of the Mome Rath life force into the Vorpal Blade altered its effects. Perhaps burning Unicorn bones while killing a lesser being would retroactively remove it from history.
