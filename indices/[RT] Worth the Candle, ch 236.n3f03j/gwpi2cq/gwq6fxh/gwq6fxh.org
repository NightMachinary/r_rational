Password thing also feels like a bit of a cop-out, it was set up as a mystery, and the solution was... meh.

I'm still a big fan of the story, but I agree, I was hoping for more from the Fell Seed fight.

It feels like a deus ex machina (which maybe it pretty literally is). First time it didn't work because the DM didn't want to let them win, now it worked because he decided to let them win. Joon didn't even do anything interesting or clever to convince the DM to change his mind. I kept expecting a clever solution to defeating an invincible monster, but it doesn't seem like they've had a lot of agency in the whole entire thing.

To be fair, I have no idea how I would make it more interesting or insightful. But I was hoping it was something on meta-game level.

I also loved the idea someone here suggested about erasing/redefining him in p-space.
