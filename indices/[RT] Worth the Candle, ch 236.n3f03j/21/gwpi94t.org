Go guessing here. Joon created Fel Seed in the real world to deal with his grief. Fel Seed was a manifestation of that grief.

WtC Fel Seed works on a similar method. He's not the biomanipulation exclusion. That's just a lie, an easy manifestation, He's the 'all your dark inner shit made manifest' exclusion, with body horror just a way for him to tap into that.

This means that as long as people remember and fear him, as long as he can exist in peoples mind as an aspect of fear and desperation and grief, he can keep coming back. Per the Infinite Library even from a god confirmed total exclusion wipe.

Someone, likely Amaryllis, realised this and set up the antimeme. Defeat Fel Seed and then wipe away all knowledge of him and he can't come back.
