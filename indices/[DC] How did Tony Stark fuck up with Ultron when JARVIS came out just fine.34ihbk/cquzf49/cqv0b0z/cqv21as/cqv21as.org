Hi, MCU nerd here for fact-checking. "Loki's Scepter" is called such because Loki had it in the Battle of New York, but it is not originally his. It was a gift given to him shortly before the invasion of Earth by Thanos (a demigod-like character in the universe) as a sign of goodwill and support for Loki's schemes. It is not of his design in any way, it just fit him thematically. Jarvis is also not a true AI, just a very sophisticated voice-command program. Not being hard-science-fiction, the distinction is superfluous at best; Jarvis is capable of rationalizing complex moral and tactical situations, as well as having basic emotions and desires, but that's just the way it is.

** If that answers your question, great. If not, I'll continue, but it's going to involve major spoilers for Age of Ultron. Here goes.

The scepter's core reactor is revealed to be one of the Infinity Stones, a set of impossibly powerful artifacts. Each one is attuned to a specific idea/concept, like Power or Time or Mind. The Scepter is the latter, thus its ability to mind-control and communicate over long distances instantly. Each has a life and nature of its own- The Power gem is just a glowing ball of infinite energy; if you haven't seen Guardians of the Galaxy, it literally atomizes anyone who directly touches it unless they're exceedingly special or powerful. It blows a person and building apart without hiccuping, and is noted to have the power to cripple or utterly obliterate a planet. Thus, the Mind Gem's special nature is that it's structure is very much like a brain/supercomputer.

Stark's failure with Ultron was that it was a rush job, to put it simply. Thor was taking the Scepter away the next day to Asgard, where Tony would never get to see or play with it again.

In the previous fight, Scarlet Witch (reality warper/mind powers) had messed with Stark's brain, showing him a vision of a slaughtered Avengers and planet, with a dead Captain America bemoaning how Stark "could have done more, could have saved us." Scarlet Witch knows Stark will do something hasty when confronted with his greatest fear, leading to his downfall (her primary vendetta/goal). So he's not working with his full moral faculties in the first place.

He (with a roped-in Banner) rushed to successfully create an Artificial Intelligence based off the live nature of the Scepter. He was only trying to create a prototype, a basic template; he was not expecting a fully-formed AI to pop out. He failed to give Ultron any true purpose or personality outside of "Peace In Our Time" which Ultron took to the 'logical' conclusion of "kill everyone". Standard Unfriendly AI shenanigans ensue.

Ultron goes to build himself a new bio-mechanical body fitted with the Mind Gem and is 90% loaded in, but it's stolen by the Avengers before he can finish. Stark and Banner are able to get it right this time, letting Jarvis' code be the template upon which the new AI is built, instead of just making an empty shell based on the Stone and letting the void fill the gaps. This new creation is not just Jarvis, not just Ultron, but something different that is able to find harmony between his human creators and the Stone's power. It renames itself "Vision", noting it is not allied with them in particular- it is concerned with the protection and support of all life, including Ultron; however Ultron, as he exists, will always be a creature of destruction, and thus must be wiped out. Even this Vision regrets, as Ultron is a very unique lifeform that is in a lot of pain. The Avengers wish to stop him as well, so he works with them.

*TL;DR:* Jarvis was a fancy Siri, Ultron was the result of a poorly constructed shell based on a magical artifact, Vision is the result of Ultron being recreated with Jarvis' underlying processes and goals.
