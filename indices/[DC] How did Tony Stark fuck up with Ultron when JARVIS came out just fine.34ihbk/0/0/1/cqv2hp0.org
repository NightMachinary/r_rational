You've identified the problem. As for why Stark went about it that way...he was very worried that he would lead the world to destruction by not doing enough to save it, plus his window of opportunity was small. So when he saw a means to complete his AI program he jumped on it. Also, while it's still completely inexcusably negligent, that's probably why he didn't take the time to install safeguards, he was in such a rush.

I'm not sure exactly what Tony was trying to use Ultron's AI for in the first place, but the movie lays out the reason he didn't just create another Jarvis type. Jarvis is (supposedly, the movie doesn't back this up very well) a far more primitive program. While Jarvis seems fairly sophisticated, it's ultimately just made to follow protocol, while Ultron would have a far greater capacity to learn and think in order to reach the optimal solution.
