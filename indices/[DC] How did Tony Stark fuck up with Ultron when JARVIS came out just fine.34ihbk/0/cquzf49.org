Thematically, it's got to be Hubris.

My guess: Jarvis has fairly modest goals, which are well within the range of human understanding and social boundaries - serve his creator (and family, and protect, and... less scope creep than Ultron)

Ultron, by comparison, is the child of Tony's arrogance and pride. Why negotiate peace, when you can bring it about by force? Why involve humans at every level, when the computer is infallible? We're all familiar with the story - both from all the mythos in the cultural background, and the specific UFAI fears laid out by the MIRI.
