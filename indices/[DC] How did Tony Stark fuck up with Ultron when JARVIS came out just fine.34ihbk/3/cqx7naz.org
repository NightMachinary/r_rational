It isn't actually that unreasonable. Tony found what was basically true AI in the scepter and used that framework together with his knowledge of basic AI that he had previously used to build up Jarvis.

Jarvis had been tested and gradually been improved (tony said Jarvis began as a voice recognition software) so that's why he came out fine. Ultron, on the other hand was hastily brought together because they only had three days before Thor left with the staff and it wasn't intended that he would just be let go without further ado. Intron broke free from Jarvis control and stopped him from sounding the alarms.

A rushed and flawed creation that was never supposed to be given autonomy broke free. Had Jarvis been able to contain him Stark would have had a fully functioning AI permanently that he could perfect.
