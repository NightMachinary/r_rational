I'd find the nearest source of iron, gather about a ton around me, and use its rest mass to propulse myself to the moon (or Venus) as fast as I could.

As people mentioned, there are billions of people on this planet, if they are all holding megaton nukes I want out of here fast. A ton of iron can be converted into whatever I need while keeping enough momentum to reach the moon easily (I assume the power can be used to keep something like a bubble of air around me, otherwise it's always possible to use the iron mass as a shell).

Once I'm convinced enough time has passed that unstable people have blown themselves up and the rest can be more or less trusted, I can come back.

Another cool thing to do would be to have a billion people go to Venus, and propulse it to the Goldilocks zone.
