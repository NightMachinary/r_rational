Oh boy alright lets get started.

1. The power recognizes you (your body and everything inside of it like food, body heat, nerve electricity, bacteria, and air) as well as anything made of matter by the power, unless you declare that it is outside your possession.
2. Yes you can, though I'm rather curious as to why you would.
3. No you can not.
4. You could create organic matter, but you would have to understand its cellular construction down to the atom.
5. It implies that you can work with one ounce of matter at a time. It also implies that I'm a moron and that the wording needs to be tightened up on the second rule.
6. Yes and its one of the basic spells that is built into the power.
7. Basic speech should be enough to concentrate you mental focus.

And from a story stand point your right, it would be bloody difficult to rule over that many people. But if you did control that many people with that kind of power they might make a pretty good army against a foe that can devourer raw energy and matter to make exact replicas of themselves. Or it might end in everyone dying.
