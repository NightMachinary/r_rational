To be honest I think this comment was poorly written on my part. Yes you could add more heat to the system by converting matter (at the cost of 1/4 of the energy of the matter that your converting into energy), but I still am unsure as to how Gurkenglas plans on creating energy from a Maxwell's demon style system.
