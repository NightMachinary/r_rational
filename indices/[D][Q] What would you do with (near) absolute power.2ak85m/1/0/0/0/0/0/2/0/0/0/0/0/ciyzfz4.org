Well it takes however long it would take to move the particles around at near light speeds. Of course there is the limit of your power to consider so if its trying to move more than 2.1X10^{15} joules worth of particles (as the amount of particles the spell has to work with is considered part of your energy limit) then some operations might be a bit slower.

Energy is a little more tricky. Best solution might be to define an amount of energy before hand and should the program exceed that energy usage, have it print out what operations it was working on on a sheet of paper. Not perfect, but if you think about the problem for more than a minute several fail-safes come to mind.
