Alright I'm going to break down how I believe a heat engine works and I need you to point out my flaw. If I can figure out a way to get rid of this exploit I will, but if it's inherently going to be a part of the power then I want my characters to abuse the hell out of it. So here we go.

Lets assume we have a heat engine, one that transmutes a system with maximum entropy into usable work energy.

Using the diagram from before we have T^{h} which has 2 heat units and T^{c} which has zero. The engine sends heat energy though, Q^{H} ,and produces 0.05 units of work energy, W. Both sides now have .975 units of heat and we have made 0.05 units of work energy.

Now lets say we pulled out entropy from T^{c} and added it to W, making W= 0.78125 due to the quarter of lost energy. Now since there is an imbalance between T^{h} and T^{c} the engine starts up again and we go through the process once again.
