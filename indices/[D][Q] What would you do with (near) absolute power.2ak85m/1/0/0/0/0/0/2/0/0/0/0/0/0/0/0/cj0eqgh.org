So... if I make it calculate by brute force whether the number of primes between 1 and 10^{10^{10^{100}}} is even or odd, then accelerate that stone in front of me to one meter per second over the course of one second, to the left if the result is "odd" and to the right if the result is "even", then the whole spell takes as much time and energy as would be taken by a spell that simply propels the stone away from me to one meter per second over one second?
