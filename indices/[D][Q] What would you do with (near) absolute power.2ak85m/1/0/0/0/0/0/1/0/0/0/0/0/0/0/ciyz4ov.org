Ah okay, but here's the thing. After running the system until there is effectively 0 heat units in T^{h} and T^{c} then W would only be about 1.5 units of energy. We decreased entropy by a significant margin but we lost potential of .5 units. If we were to reconvert, say, one unit of the work energy back into heat to start the process over again then we would lose .25 from our remaining .5 work energy, leaving a potential of 1.25 in the system.

With this system you could create a large amount of actual usable energy, true, but we've still lost heat from the system and thus the potential to create more energy is lost.
