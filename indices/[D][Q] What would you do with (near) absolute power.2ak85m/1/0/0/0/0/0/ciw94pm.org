Ah the protection spell could be specified to set up to prevent depressurization and the the traumas that rapidly leaving the earth's atmosphere would induce, but it won't just conjure up air. You'd need to consistently create some and keep it nearby.

And no, Maxwell's demon only shifts energy from place to place creating a pocket of high energy and low energy, it doesn't spontaneously create energy.

Lets say that we did have Maxwell's two chambers and demon set up. You then proceed to pull out all the heat energy from the high entropy side but then the system as a whole has lost that energy. The demon could constantly switch out the molecules for ones that now, comparatively, have a higher amount of energy but at the end of the day you would eventually run out of raw energy in the entire system.

Now lets say your in the system and use the entropy that you have created and sort out high and low energy. Your still losing a quarter of the energy irreversibly, it is fundamentally being removed from the system.
