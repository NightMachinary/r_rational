I could store it in more matter directly next to me, as the scans purpose was copying anyway. I assumed that the defenses as per 6 included things like keeping oxygen levels above a critical treshold and counteracting violent pressure.

As for acquiring possession of other people, please. I merely have to arrange for their matter to pass through the inside of one of my bodies.

By the way, can I implement [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_demon][Maxwell's Demon]] to slowly generate arbitrary amounts of energy? If yes, scratch the sending back a trillion: I should be able to build some apparatus whose power output grows with the square of the energy I have available (for example, invest half in a superheated plasma contained by magnets, and the other half into me-bodies playing Maxwellian gatekeepers) in order to acquire infinite energy. You heard right, not arbitrary energy. [[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=f%27%3Df%5E2][This differential equation is scary.]]

Talk about a literal singularity.
