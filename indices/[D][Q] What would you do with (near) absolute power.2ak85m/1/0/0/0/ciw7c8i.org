I like this, its exactly the kind of thing that I would expect from you guys once you got over the fact that you could accidentally blow up the planet. However I think your over estimating how fast you can think in a clear logical patter.

You have to supply each spell with the exact information on what you want done. You can create "functions", if you will, that are large spells tied to a short word combination, but you would still need to set up a function that is tied to each kind of cell in your body.

If you wanted to brute force the spell and list out the exact molecular placement of each individual molecule of your body, that would take a much longer period of time than if you created a set of functions to create a "generic" of each one of your cells.

Also while you could scan your entire body rather quickly (the spell would probably be as easy as "locate and identify the exact atomic and energy composition of my being with relevant data points being particle locations, amount of energy in joules and relative direction each particle is traveling in.") you would have to store that information somewhere, and I would recommend against uploading it to your brain directly, as I could see that frying your brain in short order.

There are a few other minor things like setting up livable conditions in space, the fact that you can't directly interact with anyone else who has this power since they are in their own possession, nor could you directly interact with their constructs. Most of these are just time limitations and should be easily circumvented with enough thought through.
