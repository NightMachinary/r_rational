I'm going to need a whole bunch of clarification on the rules here.

1. What does it mean to say that energy or mass is "in your possession"?
2. Can I convert matter to antimatter?
3. Can I in any other way exceed the joule limit by producing two kinds of matter that react to create more usable energy?
4. How much control do I have over the end result of the mass I create? Could I convincingly create organic matter (like wood, for example)?
5. I kind of suck at physics - what does the energy limit imply about my ability to transmute matter?
6. Is it possible to erect defenses that have a consistent drain on my power limits?
7. How much thought and focus does it take to use my power?

From a story standpoint, I have to wonder why so many - the majority of the population gets this power, which means it's going to be really hard to actually be a dictator, since there are equally powered people that can stop you.
