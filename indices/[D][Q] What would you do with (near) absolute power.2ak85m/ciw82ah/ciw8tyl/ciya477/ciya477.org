Let's see now... Earth's atmosphere masses 5x10^{18} kg, Venus's is 5x10^{20} kg (yep, 100 times heavier). We can transmute matter at 23 grams per second per person. With a billion people working in concert, that's 23 million kg per second.

That's 7000 years to terraform Earth's atmosphere by brute force, and 100 times longer for Venus. Good to know.
