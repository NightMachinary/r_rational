There are mundane ways to disable that which allow one to bypass it. You could have a steam gun, made of gas. Presumably the spell doesn't block gaseous atoms or it would block air which moves at 500m/s. If it does block all types of matter then maybe a laser gun would work, if you block photons then you can't see.

Possibly a small number of well trained and non psychotic people, carefully monitored, could be allowed to cast diagnostic spells if they are relatively low power and cheap so potential power users could be slain more swiftly. Maybe constantly run scans for effects which look like someone using a power? Would it cost extinction level powers to scan the environment?
