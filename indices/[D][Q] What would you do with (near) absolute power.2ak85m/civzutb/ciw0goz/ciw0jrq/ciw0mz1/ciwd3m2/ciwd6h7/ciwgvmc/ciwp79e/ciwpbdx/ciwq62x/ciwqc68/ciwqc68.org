It's somewhat difficult to make a spell that doesn't exert any force on the environment in any noticeable circumstances. What if someone tries to shake your hand or throw a ball at you? If necessary we could have people around to test this out on people.

Using your powers, which will constitute an extinction level threat if used wrongly, frequently counts as evil by our book and so that is sufficient evidence for us to band together and annihilate you.
