  Follow them with several mages, work to disable your defensive powers so that the acceleration destroys you.

There are a few problems with this. First, humans can't keep up with these kind of absurd pseudo-accelerations. I'm talking, moving 500 meters in 3/1000 of a second. Human reaction time is 0.15 seconds, in which time a mage can go from standing right in front of you to 200 kilometers away, receding at 2000 km/s. If your quarry is moving randomly there is just no way for any human to get anywhere close. It doesn't matter how many people you have, one of these mages is simply uncatchable.

You /might/ be able to tail me if you set up your magic field to do so in advance, and I started out within your field... but maybe not, if there's light-speed delay between your magic noticing me moving and reaching back to move you. (And we'd run into all sorts of problems if there is no such delay.) Since I start accelerating first, my velocity is always higher, and I will gradually gain ground until I'm out of your range and your magic can't respond instantly to me. Lightspeed delay is sufficient. If I start 300 meters from you, I'll be moving 5 km/s in 1*10^{-6} second, and I'll escape entirely in ~2050 seconds, a little over half an hour. (At which point we will both be moving 2/3 the speed of light, and will have traveled the full diameter of Earth's orbit.) That would be an exciting half an hour, granted, but the hard part is even getting that much.

Second, this pseudo-acceleration is harmless. It's applied evenly to every quark and electron, so there's no differential force to smash or shear anything. The only problem is slamming into the air, but that's only a problem for the tiny fraction of a second, 1/50 or thereabouts, before I'm in space. Defending against the environment of space is honestly a rounding error. You'd have to be wasteful to even get up to a million joules, let alone the hundred trillion it'd need to be to even register as something to worry about. And all of that would be internal to me, untouchable.

I have no idea how you'd even get close enough to engage a fleeing user. I don't even know how you could /aim/ at one if they're turbo-accelerating randomly.

(Calculated with constant mass. The equation was annoying enough to integrate without factoring in a modified rocket equation. It doesn't matter /that/ much. You gain velocity by the inverse square root of the mass, so small mass differences don't do much at all. Also calculated using 1.05*10^{15} joules/second. I'm not sure what the actual optimum speed/utility ratio is, but 1:1 is reasonable enough. Different ratios don't change the end result much. All of these disclaimers mean that I am /understating/ these numbers.)
