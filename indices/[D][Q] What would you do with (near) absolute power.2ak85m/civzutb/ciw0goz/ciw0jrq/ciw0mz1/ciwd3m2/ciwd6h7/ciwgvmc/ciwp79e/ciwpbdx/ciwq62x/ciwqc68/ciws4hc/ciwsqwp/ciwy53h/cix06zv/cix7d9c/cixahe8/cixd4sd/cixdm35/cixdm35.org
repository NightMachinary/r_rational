  OP could say otherwise, but I don't think it makes sense with what we know so far.

OP said that there is some degree of tracking software in it, that lets you analyse things in your sphere. He said one plan of mine to detect power users by having a person fly around and detect anyone who changed the isotopic ratio of elements in range or element ratio was feasible.

  Tracking lasers are useless. Mages are too fast for light. Here's the plan: I run away.

Subject, hostile mage (defined earlier) accelerating. Use given equation to track predicted motion, use formula to pick the best angle of fire to hit target with laser. Open fire.

Subject melted. Good job. Another one who didn't realize the full potential of his powers.

  This is a good idea anyway, for natural disasters and the like, but it's not worth anything against an omnicidal maniac with a relativistic kill vehicle. If I spend hours or days or years feeding kinetic energy into an asteroid, then A) it'll be going so fast you'll only have seconds to realize you need to blow it up, and B) you need more man-hours to stop it than it took to start it, since you can't go for the kinetic energy directly and have to resort to lossier means.

We'd probably have telescopes intergrated with it, as you say. Would be relatively easy to set up satellites now. Then, the hundred go into space with a lot of material and fire a death ray at you till you die, then blast the asteroid with repeated kinetic projectiles.
