Heating up the air around them has the added benefit of making it shoot intense light out, so you'll be blasting them with lasers from all directions. It's generally a tricky thing to defend yourself from. An experienced person might be able to do it, though they'd likely have to experiment a bit first. You could regularly alter the death method to get around it. If they did survive you could quickly call dozens of companions, and unite to overwhelm any defenses with force of numbers.
