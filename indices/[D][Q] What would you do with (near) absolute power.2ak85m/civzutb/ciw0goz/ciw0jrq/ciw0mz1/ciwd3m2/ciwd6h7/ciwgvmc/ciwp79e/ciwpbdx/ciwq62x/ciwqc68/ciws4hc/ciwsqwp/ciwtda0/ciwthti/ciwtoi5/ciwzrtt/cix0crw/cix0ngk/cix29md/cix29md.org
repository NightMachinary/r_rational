The gem itself is indestructible, or as close to indestructible for our purposes. Even if you severed the arm it was embedded into the person would still have control over it. It would case a large amount of trauma however, and would likely leave a person permanently mentally scarred. Moreover area of control is also tied to the gem with it being the central point.

All in all you just make them more dangerous if you remove the gem from their body.
