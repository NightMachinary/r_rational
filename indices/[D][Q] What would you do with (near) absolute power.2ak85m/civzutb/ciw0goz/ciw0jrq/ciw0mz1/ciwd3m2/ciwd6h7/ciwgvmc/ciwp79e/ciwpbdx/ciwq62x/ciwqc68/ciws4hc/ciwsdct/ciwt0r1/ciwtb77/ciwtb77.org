Could several power users block the powers of a single person, if they knew they were using it? You could enact some sort of forced training program then.

  If someone were to say, turn their coffee beans into a cup of hot coffee how would you be able to tell if they transmuted the beans or just used a coffee maker?

Check the isotopic ratios in a room, or the number of atoms of an element. The isotopic ratios would be easier, you'd just need a small number of samples across the room. If they alter someone used a power (and they will alter if any elements are transmuted). Check the number of a certain type of chemical bond in an area. If they alter too quickly someone likely used a power. You could make some allowance for devices with an electrical or gas supply like cookers or coffee makers. Check for extreme types of kinetic motion, temperature.

All of these would produce simple numerical measures that could be used to detect someone. You could also feed these results to a super computer which would datamine the results to detect illegal power usage.
