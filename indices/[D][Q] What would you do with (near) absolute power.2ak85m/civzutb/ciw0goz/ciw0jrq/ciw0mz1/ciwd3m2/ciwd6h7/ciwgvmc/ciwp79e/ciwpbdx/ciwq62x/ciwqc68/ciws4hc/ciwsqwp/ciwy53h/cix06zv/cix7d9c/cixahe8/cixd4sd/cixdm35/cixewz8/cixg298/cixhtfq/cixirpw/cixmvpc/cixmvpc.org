  Your acceleration is going to be negligible on the timescale it takes for light from you to reach us. You accelerating randomly won't change the fact that we know exactly where you were some tiny fraction of a second ago and we have a preprepared laser firing, unless you are a large distance away.
#+end_quote

Where "large distance" means "3 kilometers, beyond which there is less than a 50% chance of hitting you, which distance you can attain within 0.01 second". If I'm not currently in someone's range, nothing is likely to touch me.

Even if I'm just 100 meters from a readied action laser, that's enough time to accelerate to 3000 m/s before I need to defend myself from it, then I can just coast. You can't really put all of your power into the laser - you still need to keep your own air from exploding, and keep your own sensors up, and protecting yourself from the explosion, and then your laser loses energy to the air it's exploding, and it's likely blooming a whole lot so less is actually hitting me... You'll probably realize we're fighting right around the time I'm more than 500 meters from the laser source. I'm quite sure that, under cover of nuclear fire, I can scrounge up the few hundred joules it would take me to get out of the line of fire in another 0.15 seconds, and then I'm gone.

I'm certainly not going to wait until all your friends also have me in their sights before leaving. One is quite enough to spook me. I likely wouldn't walk away from more than one.

  Most non aluminium things don't have a comparable p1 orbital, the p1 orbit shape (and energy, and therefore absorbance and reflectivity) is defined by the nucleus. If you excited two electrons to the 3s and one to the 3p orbitals they would be loosely associated electrons that wouldn't behave much like aluminium ones.

Granted, aluminium isn't workable on the fly. This, however, is quite patchable. I just snap my fingers and declare that the atom has more binding energy now. Manipulating energy is what I do. As I said: liberal cheating.

#+begin_quote
  What is the mechanism by which it stores this energy?
#+end_quote

And then I snap my fingers again and declare that this atom has a /preposterous/ amount of binding energy, then I excite everything in it well beyond sane limits, until it's basically quark degenerate matter more than anything.

  If you're in space people could probably eventually deplete your mass reserves. You'd need a reasonable sized team, but, you'd eventually burn out.
#+end_quote

This doesn't seem likely. There's a lot of mass to go around. I could live quite comfortably in the kuiper belt or the oort cloud forever; the energy of going from rock to rock is basically negligible. It wouldn't really cost me much to vacation in Jupiter for a while either. Of course, I don't really plan to ever be within a light-second of any enemies if I can help it, so it's questionable how anyone would deplete my reserves.
