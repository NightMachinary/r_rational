  There are a few problems with this. First, humans can't keep up with these kind of absurd pseudo-accelerations. I'm talking, moving 500 meters in 3/1000 of a second. Human reaction time is 0.15 seconds, in which time a mage can go from standing right in front of you to 200 kilometers away, receding at 2000 km/s. If your quarry is moving randomly there is just no way for any human to get anywhere close. It doesn't matter how many people you have, one of these mages is simply uncatchable.

I would assume, as you did, that the magic handled this. Otherwise you could have a tracking laser.

  Since I start accelerating first, my velocity is always higher, and I will gradually gain ground until I'm out of your range and your magic can't respond instantly to me.

A group of mages could handle this, by accelerating a companion or firing lasers in your path to limit certain pathways. If one pumps the full energy of their power into a laser then you will have serious issues handling it.

Maybe you could have a tower of super lasers? A hundred or a thousand mages gathered together, ready to blast any serious threat out of the sky.
