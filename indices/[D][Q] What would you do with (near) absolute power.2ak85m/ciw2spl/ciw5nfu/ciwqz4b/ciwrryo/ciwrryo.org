They are a paper clipper up until a point. With a radius of 500 meters and an inability to affect others with the power and their creations they can only do so much harm.

They would also be limited by the energy in their area. How much energy does it take to convert one type of mater to another? would the local heat energy be enough or would they start burning though their own supply soon after? Or would they soon die of asphyxiation and the spell would end prematurely, and if so how far would it reach in that time?

I don't know, and this is the point of asking the question. I hadn't even thought that someone would be stupid enough to I've now got far more worst case scenarios than I started with and a list of problems the main character needs to solve.
