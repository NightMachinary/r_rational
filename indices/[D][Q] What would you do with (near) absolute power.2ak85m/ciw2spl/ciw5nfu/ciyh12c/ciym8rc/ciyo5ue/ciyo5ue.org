That's one way to think of it. You could also say that I have so much kinetic energy that it can be measured in kilograms, if that's easier to visualize. They're equivalent, really. But yes, my mass is going to go off the charts and I'm going to collapse into a black hole with a tremendous event horizon that may or may not encompass the entire universe.

So, uh, don't play with kinetic energy directly without fixing it to an inertial frame. It's /Bad/.
