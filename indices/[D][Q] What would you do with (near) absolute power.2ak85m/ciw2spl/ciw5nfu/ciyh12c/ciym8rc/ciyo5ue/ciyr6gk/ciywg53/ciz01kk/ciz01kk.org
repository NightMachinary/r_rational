Ya, 0.02c is a rather rather fast and would definitely cause some problems if you collided with anything, but I don't think you'd survive the trip in general unless you set up some protection spells and an oxygen recycling spell. That does decrease the amount of energy you can pump in as raw kinetic energy, though it would be a rounding error's worth.

Oh wait, shit. I've been contradicting myself here. In nearly every other post I've stated that the amount of matter that your handling is also part of your limit. All of a sudden this is a lot less terrifying.
