The problem is that I've told my power to increase my kinetic energy, and no matter how much power it pumps in, I will never see any increase. From my rock example, you said that it will keep going until it looks right to /me/. I see myself use a little energy to accelerate a rock, and a really fast observer sees me use a lot of energy for the same effect. Same thing. I see myself use zero energy, and everyone else sees me use infinite energy.

The correct term is probably "inertial reference frame", and you'd have to put limits on how often I can change frames. If I'm allowed to stop and start every planck time, then bad things are still going to happen. If I can only get a new reference frame by calling a spell manually, that's probably fine. I can still get impressive speeds very quickly. but I won't swallow the universe. (Straight acceleration can get me to 0.02c in one second. Using the incantation "ah" ten times a second to accelerate until the next time I say "ah", which will also cast another instance of the spell, brings that up to 0.08c.)

I think that's okay... But my instinct is that this might permit time travel. Or it might not, I can't actually think of how to construct a time machine without using negative energy.
