Since you've got a bunch of comments I've going to only answer the questions I feel haven't been addressed elsewhere, otherwise this is just going to be a lot of "ya we went over this".

  Can I create working copies of myself? Or complex mechanisms such as a computer? Or even fictional things such as a time machine?
#+end_quote

I'm going to admit I'm laughing a bit at the wording of this, just a bit. It sounds like your saying that computers are more complex than humans, but I digress. Yes you could do the first two, as for fictional things, well, could you build H.G Wells time machine? You can't just say "Create a time machine", you have to understand what goes into what your creating to create it.

I could see you building models of some of the classical steampunk devices however, since the literature is so detailed. Whether or not they work as intended is another matter entirely.

  And, if I can clone myself, will those clones also have powers?
#+end_quote

Yes they could, but it would take a considerable energy investment on top of the investment needed to make another person from scratch.
