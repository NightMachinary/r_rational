How fine a control do I have over my powers? Can I create working copies of myself? Or complex mechanisms such as a computer? Or even fictional things such as a time machine? Do I need to know how something works to do that, or just know of the thing? And, if I can clone myself, will those clones also have powers? Because if so, I would create a clone army and see what me and clones collectively could come up with to do next, as copying myself so many times is bound to increase the number of good ideas I can come up with
