You could add in some measures to make people less dangerous.

Have the magic have an innate "Protect the user" power like in worm. It will make it hard or impossible for people to do anything that leads to their death, like nuking the area.

Make it so that a skilled group of mages can block the powers of another. Psycopaths can be stopped.

Those powers would make the universe a lot safer.
