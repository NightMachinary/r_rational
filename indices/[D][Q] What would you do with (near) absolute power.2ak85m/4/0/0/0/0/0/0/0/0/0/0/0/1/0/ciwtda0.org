Just a note this would be one of the most terrifying police states in fiction that I can think of. It would also make for yet another damn interesting spin off story.

To make this this short your going to run into trouble when you trying to define "symbols of a power". See my other post as to why. And second heating them would be the worst way to go about it. One of the first things I would do with this kind of power is create a bubble of temperate air around myself, and so you would slag the surrounding area... which in itself might be enough to kill the person. Unless they prepared for every goddamn eventuality and worked around the clock to make it energy efficient.

I could see a few people on this subreddit using this power to protect against every possible accidental and malicious life-ending scenario.
