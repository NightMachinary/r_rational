  In your sphere. Once I'm out of your sphere and moving randomly, you cannot react to me, you cannot predict me.

Someone moving at a significant percentage of the speed of light isn't going to be that hard to track. You can make a spell to track their light. Or hit them in the 500 m range, since you can react as fast as any spell can and lasers are faster than any acceleration.

  Won't do much good if my air-shield can refuse to re-transmit your laser. If it's possible at all, it will stop any laser that makes any consideration for collateral damage. If you're not chasing me, then I just need to juke earlier and more frequently. The speed of light delay will still let me get away in less than a second.

You have a power limit, if someone is firing 100% of their power at you then you can't deflect it without controlling as much power, and you're already expending a lot of power evading pursuit and whatever magical attacks.

  For example, I could make my air reflective, and keep it from getting vaporized by liberally cheating. Then there's whatever defenses I've set up on my skin...
#+end_quote

You can't make your air reflective, you can't make things that you don't know how to make. OP covered this, you have to know how to make stuff. Like complex organic molecules.

  My first thought for a weapon would be a single atom, pumped with an impossibly excessive amount of energy for one atom, shoved at my enemy's head with as much kinetic energy as I can spare.
#+end_quote

It would likely do negligible damage, like most cosmic rays, and get out of your range long before you could do anything. The speed would make it tricky to control too. The laser is an easier version of this.

#+begin_quote
  Either way, it will kill anyone who doesn't have defenses against that. And anyone with defenses will be busy enough suppressing it that they won't have enough power to spare when I shoot them.

My earlier suggestion was about a vigilante/police state group that forcefully recruits and brainwashes people and overwhelms individuals with numbers. Numerical advantages are assumed, they have more power than you.
