[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalamus]]

The switchboard of the brain, incredibly wide connections, the part that synthesizes signals from across the brain. Spend a few days with some 'volunteers' and you can find what parts you have to disable to prevent someone from being able to have an attention span, or disabling their ability to access certain concepts.

Or if you want a quick and dirty fix, cut most of this part away, to stop their ability to focus on things. It has a few side effects, but it's for the greater good.

That way, if anyone is bad you can lobotomize them.
