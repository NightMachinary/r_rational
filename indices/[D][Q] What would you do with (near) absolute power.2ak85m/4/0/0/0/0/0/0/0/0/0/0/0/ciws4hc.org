I would be possible to set a threshold into a spell "if an object is approaching my person at x speed and is 2 inches away, deflect it. End spell when phrase 'I've had enough' is spoken". It would be a constant drain on you however as the spell is constantly determining if objects and particles exceeds the threshold.
