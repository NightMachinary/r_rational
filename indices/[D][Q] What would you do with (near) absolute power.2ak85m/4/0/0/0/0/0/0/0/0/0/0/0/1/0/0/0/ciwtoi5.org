I like this. Its effective it would work, it won't work 100% as people are clever and you can't be everywhere at once, though I suspect my ignorance on the topic of isotopic signaling is blinding me to a few facts. More reading for me it would seem.

Its just too bad that I couldn't set something like this up in the story. What with the universe having been destroyed and everyone being shipped off to another one.
