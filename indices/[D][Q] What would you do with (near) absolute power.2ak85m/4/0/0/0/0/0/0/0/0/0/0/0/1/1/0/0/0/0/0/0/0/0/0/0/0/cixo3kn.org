  Where "large distance" means "3 kilometers, beyond which there is less than a 50% chance of hitting you, which distance you can attain within 0.01 second". If I'm not currently in someone's range, nothing is likely to touch me.
#+end_quote

Regardless of your distance, you can only detect attacks from 500ms away, if they are at the speed of light. If we can predict your motions we can hit you.

If you burn too much energy being evasive, incidentally, we can capture you, since we can fly in a straight line towards you and fly faster.

  Even if I'm just 100 meters from a readied action laser.
#+end_quote

Our sphere of influence would be a city, and so relatively noisy, and once we were within 500 meters we could summon a readied laser action in your face.

Our program in the magic would be something like...

"Spell to detect unauthorized use of power. Check data bank, is this an authorized usage of power? No, lobotomize/ melt the person's face. Are they escaping? Summon aid, prepare instant kill contingencies."

On you being 100 meters away, if I fire a laser at you from 100 meters away, your sensors will likely relay the signal to you at the same time as the laser hits you due to light speed limits. You'll have 0.0003 seconds to move, which means you'll be able to move one meter, which isn't enough to dodge the kill weapon. If you have a readied action to block it that will likely expend a lot of energy, leaving you open to attack.

This is a question for OP- is scanning magic superluminal?

#+begin_quote
  You can't really put all of your power into the laser - you still need to keep your own air from exploding, and keep your own sensors up, and protecting yourself from the explosion, and then your laser loses energy to the air it's exploding, and it's likely blooming a whole lot so less is actually hitting me
#+end_quote

I can summon the laser 500 meters away, much of that is unnecessary, scanning would be reduced to a reasonable power level and reprioritized upon threat detection.

Air doesn't absorb light that well, I doubt much energy would be lost over such a short distance.

#+begin_quote
  You'll probably realize we're fighting right around the time I'm more than 500 meters from the laser source.
#+end_quote

Per this being a police dictatorship, we're fighting as soon as I detect you using any power, and it's a fight to the death/ mental destruction instantly, with preprogrammed death spells firing.

#+begin_quote
  I'm certainly not going to wait until all your friends also have me in their sights before leaving. One is quite enough to spook me. I likely wouldn't walk away from more than one.
#+end_quote

If we had the numbers then, we could have two magic users floating around together in our city. Depends on how many want to join the police and what area they are policing. Of course, with brain rearrangement, many will be encouraged to join the police. And if we capture you, you can learn to love it too. We'd have to erase your concepts of most of the laws of physics of course, you seem pretty dangerous.

  Granted, aluminium isn't workable on the fly. This, however, is quite patchable. I just snap my fingers and declare that the atom has more binding energy now. Manipulating energy is what I do. As I said: liberal cheating.
#+end_quote

Binding energy isn't related to absorbance in atoms, it's more an aspect of electromagnetism, nor is any form of it really directly manipulable. Since you don't know the mechanism of how these things work (and physicists in general find it tricky) I'm not sure if you can modify them, and I am uncertain if these sort of things are accessible to our powers.

#+begin_quote
  And then I snap my fingers again and declare that this atom has a preposterous amount of binding energy, then I excite everything in it well beyond sane limits, until it's basically quark degenerate matter more than anything.
#+end_quote

That's not a mechanism, binding energy is an emergent property from gluons and color charges, not some independent property you can vary, and if you create gluons and try to make a super atom the author has no idea what would happen.

If whatever you are doing probably isn't possible within the laws of physics it's not a great suggestion. The author can't really predict what will happen or run any equations, and as such, it's not a useful power.

  This doesn't seem likely. There's a lot of mass to go around.
#+end_quote

If you stay close to a source of mass you are no longer mobile and are an easy target. Your plan of avoiding enemies is probably safer.
