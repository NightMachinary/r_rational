  Er, how do you figure? To my knowledge, that is the opposite of true. If you track my light, you will see at where I was. Since I'm accelerating randomly, that gives you very little information about where I will be by the time a laser gets to me. Hitting me in the 500 meter range means you're in my range too, and it's a battle of how prepared we are with set spells.
#+end_quote

Your acceleration is going to be negligible on the timescale it takes for light from you to reach us. You accelerating randomly won't change the fact that we know exactly where you were some tiny fraction of a second ago and we have a preprepared laser firing, unless you are a large distance away.

  Then they have just blown up whatever place I'm running away from.
#+end_quote

And you.

#+begin_quote
  The instant their laser gets more than 500 meters from them and touches the air outside their influence, the air is going to explode very violently.
#+end_quote

The air exploding isn't really a problem, it's not going to have a major impact on the laser.

#+begin_quote
  There will likely be a fair amount of fusion involved.
#+end_quote

That would be more power you have to dodge.

  I know exactly how to make my air reflective. Transmuting aluminium would be cheating, even if it would be easy since I wouldn't need very much to make a thin flat layer.
#+end_quote

That wouldn't really stop this much. Mirrors easily ablate to high powered lasers. They're not perfectly reflective, they absorb a lot of energy. Plus, very thin layers aren't very reflective. You also don't have a good way of predicting where the lasers are coming from. Also, you have 500 meters to react. From my calculations, that gives you time to reshape 0.03818g of material, max (500/light speed*23 grams of matter that you can reshape according to someone's post)

Anyway, if you want, we can just use xrays or gamma rays. They can go through thin metal sheets. We'd probably use those if you had an active defense, like some tungsten you kept orbiting you constantly to deflect attacks.

#+begin_quote
  Instead, I could rearrange the outer electron orbitals of some atoms to act like aluminium. Keep three electrons excited to the p1 orbital of any atom
#+end_quote

Most non aluminium things don't have a comparable p1 orbital, the p1 orbit shape (and energy, and therefore absorbance and reflectivity) is defined by the nucleus. If you excited two electrons to the 3s and one to the 3p orbitals they would be loosely associated electrons that wouldn't behave much like aluminium ones.

  When I said "impossibly excessive", I meant "lots of orders of magnitude above the point where the thing should be blown to its constituent quarks". I'm talking about a single atom weighing multiple grams, with exactly as much bang as antimatter of the same mass but even less stable outside of my control, all wrapped up in a package that is very good at being a very tiny needle. This isn't a cosmic ray, it's an invisible annihilation bomb, so energetic it's just itching to tunnel through anything until I set it off by releasing the dead man's switch.
#+end_quote

What is the mechanism by which it stores this energy?

#+begin_quote
  Indeed, that's a problem. Which is why I prefer avoidance to fighting. Given a choice, I'd never be in the same gravity well as them. And as long as I keep my distance, it is virtually impossible to catch me.
#+end_quote

If you're in space people could probably eventually deplete your mass reserves. You'd need a reasonable sized team, but, you'd eventually burn out.
