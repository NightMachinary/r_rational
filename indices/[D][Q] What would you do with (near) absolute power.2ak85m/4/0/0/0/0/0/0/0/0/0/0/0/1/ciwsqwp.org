What do you think of this idea?

You have a person flying around in a remotely controlled predator drone.

The person uses their powers to scan a 500m circle bubble, checking for any common known symbols of a power being used, and checks for any matter in between them. If a clear line of sight can be found, or a soon predicted line of sight can be found, a signal is sent to the computer detailing the location of the power user and they are melted by a laser. In the event that this fails the user increases the temperature of the air around the enemy of the state 2000C to melt them.

This way a territory can be quickly and efficiently policed by a small number of individuals without the need for any nuclear level powers.
