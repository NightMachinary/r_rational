  OP said that there is some degree of tracking software in it, that lets you analyse things in your sphere.

In your sphere. Once I'm out of your sphere and moving randomly, you cannot react to me, you cannot predict me.

#+begin_quote
  Subject, hostile mage (defined earlier) accelerating. Use given equation to track predicted motion, use formula to pick the best angle of fire to hit target with laser. Open fire.

Won't do much good if my air-shield can refuse to re-transmit your laser. If it's possible at all, it will stop any laser that makes any consideration for collateral damage. If you're not chasing me, then I just need to juke earlier and more frequently. The speed of light delay will still let me get away in less than a second.

If you are chasing me - which, again, requires a fair bit of set up - then we've got a mage duel with both of us in each other's space. I'm much more interested in avoiding that, since the most likely result is that we kill each other. A laser is still not the best weapon, since it is indirect enough to interact with my matter before it interacts with me, giving me the chance to mess with it. For example, I could make my air reflective, and keep it from getting vaporized by liberally cheating. Then there's whatever defenses I've set up on my skin...

My first thought for a weapon would be a single atom, pumped with an impossibly excessive amount of energy for one atom, shoved at my enemy's head with as much kinetic energy as I can spare. Depending on their defenses, they may or may not be able to stop it, since we can both put out the same amount of kinetic energy, it's just a matter of knowing that they need to. Either way, when it's touching them or inside their brain, I'll stop magically supporting the nuclear orbitals. I may not have a choice, if my enemy takes ownership of it once it's inside their body. Then it explodes in their brain with way more energy than a single atom has any business having. It may release more energy than they could possibly counter, or it may just be the most they could ever produce at a time, depending on whether or not I can prevent it from exploding with less energy than it stores.

Either way, it will kill anyone who doesn't have defenses against that. And anyone with defenses will be busy enough suppressing it that they won't have enough power to spare when I shoot them.
