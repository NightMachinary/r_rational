  Naturally I can stop any non-magical laser up to 2.1*1015 watts. Outright negate it, turn it into neutrinos, dump it into the air's elastic energy to turn the air into a pseudo-physical barrier, whatever.

I don't imagine the average random magic user would have innately made a defence against lasers which might help it be overcome.

  Can I have my air just refuse to re-emit overly energetic photons? This shouldn't take any energy on my part, I'm just holding energy that's already there.
#+end_quote

The author noted that you have to continually scan the area around you to do that which costs energy.

I have another plan then. Two power users. They work together to overcome any individual mages defences. You may tell the air around you to stop emitting power, they'll tell it to start.

  I have no idea how you'd catch a fleeing user.

Follow them with several mages, work to disable your defensive powers so that the acceleration destroys you.

  If I avoided splattering, I'd be past the moon in 20 seconds, going 0.1 c. And then, since you annoyed me, there would be relativistic kill vehicles in your future. I take it back, relativistic kill vehicles would still be an effective weapon.
#+end_quote

Given that your plan is to murder a reasonable percentage of the population with relativistic kill weapons the need to murder you is ever more pressing.

Ok, one mage works on stripping the air around you and your body of any defences, using their full power to do everything they can to negate yours, the other melts you, smashes you, and tries to forcefully tear your body apart.
