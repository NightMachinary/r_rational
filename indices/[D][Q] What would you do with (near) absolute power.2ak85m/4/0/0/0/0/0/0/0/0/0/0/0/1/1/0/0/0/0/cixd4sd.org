  I would assume, as you did, that the magic handled this. Otherwise you could have a tracking laser.

I assume that I can tell magic to dump a bunch of kinetic energy into my body, and to set up some automatic effect for anything that enters my range while at speed. There's no reason to think it would help me make decisions or react to events outside of my magical range. OP could say otherwise, but I don't think it makes sense with what we know so far.

Tracking lasers are useless. Mages are too fast for light. Here's the plan: I run away. 0.15 seconds later, your brain has processed the fact that I have run away, and you check your laser to see where I went. At the same time, I randomly change direction. 200,000/300,000,000 seconds later, the light arrives to show you me, 200,000 meters away - but by the time you see that, I could 1.5 km away from where you would predict. You /can't/ know where I am; the information does not exist in your light cone.

Having escaped your lasers, and your eyes, and everything touched by your magic, I can set up a perfect optical cloak and head off in a random direction. If I keep changing every 200,000/300,000,000 seconds, you can't even in principle pin me down except probabilistically in an ever increasing volume, but that's already overkill. There are too many possible pathways to possibly cut me off. It becomes unmanageable instantly. If I have even the barest fraction of a second of a headstart, it is simply impossible to catch me.

  A group of mages could handle this, by accelerating a companion or firing lasers in your path to limit certain pathways. If one pumps the full energy of their power into a laser then you will have serious issues handling it.

This is less useful than you'd think, since you'd be out of your companion's range in a fraction of a second, and if they're keeping pace, then they can't help. But it probably would help enough; If you've managed to get me and two of you all in each other's spheres, both of you set up to give chase instantly, then you've probably got me there. I don't think I could escape. But your friend won't stick around long enough to help with the offensive. If you want to make sure you'll win the fight, you'll have to get me and /three/ of you all each other's spheres, two chasers and one booster. Then I'd be thoroughly screwed.

Only if your automated defenses are set up, though. Otherwise you'll slam into my air-walls at mach bajillion when you fail to push them out of the way directly, before you even realize you're moving. But it's doable. I'd try to avoid ever getting into such a trap.

  Maybe you could have a tower of super lasers? A hundred or a thousand mages gathered together, ready to blast any serious threat out of the sky.

This is a good idea anyway, for natural disasters and the like, but it's not worth anything against an omnicidal maniac with a relativistic kill vehicle. If I spend hours or days or years feeding kinetic energy into an asteroid, then A) it'll be going so fast you'll only have seconds to realize you need to blow it up, and B) you need more man-hours to stop it than it took to start it, since you can't go for the kinetic energy directly and have to resort to lossier means. Most of which would just vaporize it, leaving you with a relativistic kill plasma cloud, and that's even harder to stop.

My advice? Invest in really good telescopes so you can see when asteroids start accelerating. Full-sky scans, everything larger than 10 meters. Uh. Good luck with that.
