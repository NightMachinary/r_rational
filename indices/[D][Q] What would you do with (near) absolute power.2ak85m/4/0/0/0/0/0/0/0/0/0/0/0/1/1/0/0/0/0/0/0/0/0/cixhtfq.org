  Someone moving at a significant percentage of the speed of light isn't going to be that hard to track.
#+end_quote

Er, how do you figure? To my knowledge, that is the opposite of true. If you track my light, you will see at where I /was/. Since I'm accelerating randomly, that gives you very little information about where I /will/ be by the time a laser gets to me. Hitting me in the 500 meter range means you're in my range too, and it's a battle of how prepared we are with set spells.

  You have a power limit, if someone is firing 100% of their power at you...
#+end_quote

Then they have just blown up whatever place I'm running away from. The instant their laser gets more than 500 meters from them and touches the air outside their influence, the air is going to explode very violently. There will likely be a fair amount of fusion involved. At the very least it's going to create a massive plasma channel. The power absorbed by the air is power I don't need to fight.

  You can't make your air reflective, you can't make things that you don't know how to make.
#+end_quote

I know /exactly/ how to make my air reflective. Transmuting aluminium would be cheating, even if it would be easy since I wouldn't need very much to make a thin flat layer. Instead, I could rearrange the outer electron orbitals of some atoms to /act/ like aluminium. Keep three electrons excited to the p^{1} orbital of any atom, line the atoms up perfectly flat, and presto, instant mirror.

  It would likely do negligible damage, like most cosmic rays, and get out of your range long before you could do anything.
#+end_quote

When I said "impossibly excessive", I meant "lots of orders of magnitude above the point where the thing should be blown to its constituent quarks". I'm talking about a single atom weighing multiple grams, with exactly as much bang as antimatter of the same mass but even /less/ stable outside of my control, all wrapped up in a package that is very good at being a very tiny needle. This isn't a cosmic ray, it's an invisible annihilation bomb, so energetic it's just itching to tunnel through anything until I set it off by releasing the dead man's switch.

  Numerical advantages are assumed, they have more power than you.
#+end_quote

Indeed, that's a problem. Which is why I prefer avoidance to fighting. Given a choice, I'd never be in the same gravity well as them. And as long as I keep my distance, it is virtually impossible to catch me.
