I'm not sure if lasers - or anything, really - could be effective weapons as long as users can have standing effects. Naturally I can stop any non-magical laser up to 2.1*10^{15} watts. Outright negate it, turn it into neutrinos, dump it into the air's elastic energy to turn the air into a pseudo-physical barrier, whatever.

Magic lasers are a bit trickier. The original laser was the other user's (is it still theirs after leaving their sphere?), but it's getting absorbed and re-emitted by /my/ air. (I am absolutely going to make sure to own my air, so nobody else can roast me or suffocate me or something.) Can I have my air just refuse to re-emit overly energetic photons? This shouldn't take any energy on my part, I'm just holding energy that's already there. This is physically equivalent to retransmitting the photon perfectly off-phase, if I can do that. Since any laser more powerful than a lightning strike would have large collateral damage, and lightning strikes are in the terawatt range, my 25% losses would cost me 2.5*10^{11} joules per second, or 0.003 grams of mass. I can handle that long enough to retaliate or escape /then/ retaliate.

I have no idea how you'd catch a fleeing user. If I use a full half of my power on defense and the rest on escaping, then a hundredth of a second is long enough to get to half a million meters per second, in any direction. Blasting air out of the way would cost basically nothing. About the only way to stop a fleeing user would be to try to cage them in matter other users own, but that would take extensive preparation. At top pseudo-acceleration, they'd have to rely on auto-defenses to handle obstacle avoidance, and they might not have a standard plan to /indirectly/ deflect obstacles. But if I'm expecting it, it's not hard to come up with such a plan. If you're lucky, I'll spend a few seconds carving an opening, perhaps with a fempto-blackhole. If you're not lucky, or I'm already going too fast, I'll just hit the obstacle with antimatter and deflect the blast around myself.

If I avoided splattering, I'd be past the moon in 20 seconds, going 0.1 c. And then, since you annoyed me, there would be relativistic kill vehicles in your future. I take it back, relativistic kill vehicles would still be an effective weapon.
