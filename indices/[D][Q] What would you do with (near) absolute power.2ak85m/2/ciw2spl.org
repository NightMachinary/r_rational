So I get 23 grams of matter per second, or half a megaton of TNT worth of bang. 30 Hiroshimas per second. With antimatter, I can double that to 60 Hiroshimas per second. Per person. For /5 billion people/. Oh that's not going to end well.

I don't understand the rules. Say I transmute 23 grams of nitrogen in the air into 23 grams of botulinum toxin. What exactly happens? Do I end up with 23 grams? Or 17 grams, after 25% vanishes? Since I'm "using" energy beyond what is "in my possession", do I lose 23 grams of fat? Or 31 grams of fat, 23 vanishing to fuel the transmutation and 25% of that 31 vanishing just because? Or do I lose just 6 grams of fat, 25% of the amount I'm transmuting? Do I get to choose between losing 6 grams of fat or 6 grams of nitrogen? Or do I lose an arm and a leg, 25% of my /total/ starting mass-energy? Does the resulting botulinum toxin count as "mine", able to be transmuted without further losses beyond the 75% efficiency limit?

What's my range? Can I transmute nitrogen on the other side of the planet? North Korea's nitrogen, say? Or Washington DC's? Or your lungs'?

If I dump 4.5*10^{12} joules of kinetic energy into a 1 kg rock, how fast is it going? If it started with 0 and I pushed it to 4.5*10^{12}, then it goes from rest to 0.01c. But from the reference frame where it started at 0.5c, it started with 1.4*10^{16} joules. My push is several significant digits down, and now it's going 0.50007c. That reference frame would say that its initial rest frame now sees it going 0.00009c, not 0.01c. Different reference frames disagree on changes in kinetic energy for the same difference in speed. Do I just always affect things in my own reference frame, or in theirs, and let relativistic observers see me violating the joule limit?
