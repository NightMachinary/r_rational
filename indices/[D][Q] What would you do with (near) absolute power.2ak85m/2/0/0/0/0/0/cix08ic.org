No I mean I personally didn't understand the depth of what kind of power I was giving these people. In all honesty I should have figured that at least one one person would think to themselves "What if I just replaced all of x with y? That would be good right". I underestimate humanity's... drive? Perpetuity for finding new and exciting ways of killing itself? Something like that.
