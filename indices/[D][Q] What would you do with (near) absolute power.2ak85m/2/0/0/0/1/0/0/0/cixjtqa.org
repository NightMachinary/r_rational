  Also, where does all the entropy go? The waste heat?

Its removed from the univese and is given to an all consuming self-replicating hive mind, which, if we were to continue to computer coding analogy, is the multiverse's equivalent of garbage collection. Except it glitched and it believes that it needs to de-allocate everything, not just universes in which entropy is increasing too fast.

As for how each command is phrased, there are a few fail-safes. The phrase "Turn all of this into gold" even combined with a pointing gesture is too vague to be executed. Is the user pointing at the ground? A leaf? The air particles below his fingers?

"Turn the ground beneath my feet into gold" is also too vague to work. How far below his feet? Just the immediate layer or all the way to bedrock? Does he mean the entire flat surface within his sphere of influence?

"Turn all matter within my radius that is denser than breathable air into gold" would be one to look out for. The user needs to give the power something they have a firm grasp on, in order for the spell to execute. The words are mostly a focus for the neural net of the brain, words like this and those and these are all very loosely defined in our brain and we wouldn't be able to define it. Or we would have to many vague little thoughts that would interfere with the casting.

Also the power is only able to work with an ounce of matter at a time. Even if your only making minor modifications, like say adding an electron to every atom, the spell can only work with one ounce of matter in a second. Hopefully someone would notice if, where ever someone went, there were golden patches popping up around them and take action.
