Even just a test case where the person said "Turn all of this into gold" while pointing at the ground, and failing to specify 'this' could end badly. And it would naturally come from a combination of greed and a failure to understand supply/demand economics.

Think about it like computer programming. Except a fatal fault or an infinite looped program could destroy the entire planet. And testing a program has a change to create a fatal fault.

A program designed to create a retrovirus to give humans superhuman powers for example could accidentally incorporates the genes for botulism, and there goes the entire species.

A program meant to allow the person to breathe underwater by converting water around him to air might not specify a distance parameter, and could destroy all of the oceans.

"Break apart this at the smallest scale" even could cause a thermonuclear explosion that wipes out a very large area, depending on what is defined as "this".

What is parsing these natural language commands into action? That's the big thing that might change a lot.

Also, where does all the entropy go? The waste heat?

The first person to figure out self duplication or intelligence boosting wins, as someone mentioned above.
