This isn't it.

What people are saying is that this is the equivalent to giving 100 monkeys matches and letting them swim in a lake made of gasoline. It only takes one idiot to figure out some combination of actions that kills everyone else, especially when experimenting with an unknown power and not thinking about having proper safeguards.

Which most of those 5 billion people would not.

It takes less than one line to say "Find an atom and convert it to carbon, go to start." and that's the end of the planet.

You have made everyone a paperclipper.
