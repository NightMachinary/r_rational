Well the question at that point then becomes how long can 2.1x 10^{15} joules sustain that kind of speed? Even if our arbitrary unit is a very low speed I would assume you would outstrip your need for energy to continue to push an ever increasing amount of mass long before you become a local black hole.

Though I think I might at the stipulation that your relative... position? depth? do we have a unit for relativity besides space and time? Anyway your spell would have to be fixed at the relative /point/ (eh that still feels off) that you started at.
