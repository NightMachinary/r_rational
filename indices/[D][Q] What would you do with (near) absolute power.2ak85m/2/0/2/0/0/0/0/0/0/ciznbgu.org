So if I try to apply 10,000 joules of thermal energy to 0.5 kg of soup, I'll fail. Even though I'm only trying to /move/ 10,000 joules, I'm trying to /affect/ more than my limit. Hmm.

In general, there are equal numbers of protons, neutrons, and electrons in an object. The proportion of my mass that is electrons will be about equal to the proportion of the combined mass of those three particles is the electron. Both protons and neutrons are about 1 atomic mass unit, and electrons are about 5.5*10^{-4}, then there's some energy on top of that, let's generously say that adds 1%. So, electrons account for 0.03% of the mass of the object. This means that, as long as you are less than 86 kg, the total mass of your electrons is less than 23 grams.

Now, electrons are what mediate interactions between atoms, mostly. They hold molecules together and the like. By altering the energy of electrons, you can get molecules to hold together even when they have no business doing so. For example, if you launched one atom at a huge speed, and manipulated its electrons so they didn't unbind from other atoms, the rest of the entire object will be dragged by that one atom. The object might be ridiculously stretched, since the force will propagate at the speed of sound, but as long as the electrons don't notice, it'll hold together. It'll even continue chemical reactions as normal.

Oh yes.

Scattering electrons is where most of the energy of any damaging situation will go. As long as you can match the power being applied to you, you can prevent damage. If the power being applied to you is too spread out, then you will just pull yourself together over the course of less than a second. And of course the energy of the attack is equal to the energy of the total defense across all electrons.

For example, if one atom is pulled away with 0.21*10^{15} joules of kinetic energy, then that is how much energy it will take to hold your 23 grams of electrons together, and thus to hold together the rest of you. Only a tiny number of them will be in the shock wave at a time anyway, so you don't need to spend a full second iterating over your whole body - and you can let some of them break as long as you go back and fix them. You've functionally increased your tensile strength. This will distribute that kinetic energy evenly.

I'm pretty far outside my field of expertise now, and several logical leaps from what I know for sure. But if there's a problem, I don't see it. There is still a limit on how fast you can accelerate based on how fast you can pull yourself together, but it should still be pretty astonishing. (Of course, by this point you may be better off using a more classical engine, if you can survive the few hundred thousand newtons you'll get with even a fraction of your power.)
