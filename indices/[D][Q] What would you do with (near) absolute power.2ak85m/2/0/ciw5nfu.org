I love that everyone assumes that people would imminently start trying to kill one another with this power. They sure as hell aren't wrong, and I can most defiantly see some well meaning idiot scientist wanting to see just what would happen if they transmute the limit into local heat radiation.

Now then as for the questions:

1. If you were to specify that you wanted to use only 23 grams of nitrogen to create 23 grams of botulinum toxic (an interesting choice in toxic as well) it would use some of your heat energy ( exact number is a bit difficult to calculate, the power tries not to kill you and will only take as much as you can spare) and body fat to create the rest of the 23 grams, so a little less than 6 grams of fat will be lost. And yes now that botulium toxin counts as yours and, unless you give up your possession of it, it can't be affected by another person with this power.

2. Your range is inside a +500 yard+ 500 meters sphere with you in the center. And yes the air in an average person's lungs is fair game, but not one who as the power.

3. The power is personal so it would be affect from your personal frame of reference. It would assume that you wanted to add 0.01c of speed from your frame of reference and it would continue to pull energy until, from your initial rest frame, you see it going .01c. If you weren't holding it still, however, the object would leave your sphere of influence before it was able to build up to to .01c. (Sorry I don't have a strong enough understanding in absolute relativistic frame works to be more accurate. You have given me quite the reading list though so I thank you for that.)

Edit: because the imperial system is what will get someone killed.
