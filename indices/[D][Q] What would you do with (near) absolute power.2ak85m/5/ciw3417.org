2.1*10^{15} joules per second * 5*10^{9} people * 2*10^{7} seconds (approx 7 months) = 2.1*10^{32} Joules, or the gravitational binding energy of the earth.

On second thought, organizing the complete destruction of the Earth, so thorough that not even gravity would reassemble, it is a bad idea, and probably overkill anyways. Dropping it into the Sun seems easier.
