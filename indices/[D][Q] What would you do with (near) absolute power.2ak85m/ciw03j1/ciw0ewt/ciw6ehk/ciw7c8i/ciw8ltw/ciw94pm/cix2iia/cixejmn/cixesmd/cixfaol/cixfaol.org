Only if your were moving them into another working, lets say heating something else up, and that would cost energy. I'm going to borrow a diagram here:

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Carnot_heat_engine_2.svg]]

If we assumed that you would remove heat energy from Tc and placed it back into Th that would only put 75% of the energy back into the system. Assuming that some of the energy from Qh gets turn into work energy (W in this model) then you are constantly losing energy from the system.

Unless I'm fundamentally misunderstanding something about this type of engine, which is more than possible. If so I think I'm going to need it spelled out for me.
