  Lets say that we did have Maxwell's two chambers and demon set up. You then proceed to pull out all the heat energy from the high entropy side but then the system as a whole has lost that energy. The demon could constantly switch out the molecules for ones that now, comparatively, have a higher amount of energy but at the end of the day you would eventually run out of raw energy in the entire system.

I'm not sure quite how you're differentiating between "heat" and "energy," one form of which is a heat gradient. If you use your power to turn an ounce of matter into a bose-einstein condensate, slowing down its molecular motion to almost zero, what would that "cost" you?

  Now lets say your in the system and use the entropy that you have created and sort out high and low energy. Your still losing a quarter of the energy irreversibly, it is fundamentally being removed from the system.
