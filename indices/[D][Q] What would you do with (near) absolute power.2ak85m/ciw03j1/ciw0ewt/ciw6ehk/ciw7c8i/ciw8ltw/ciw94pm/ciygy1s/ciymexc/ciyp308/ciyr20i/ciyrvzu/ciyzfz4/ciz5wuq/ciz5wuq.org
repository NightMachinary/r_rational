I am not sure whether you by particles mean the output display, or some materialized form of innards of the computer. I am asking whether my joules give me as much computational power as the most efficient silicon arrangement constructed from those joules that I can come up with, or if I can ask any question that an algorithm could answer whose answer can be expressed using those joules.
