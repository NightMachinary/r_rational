The idea behind the basic built in protection spell is that there is a framework set up so you just have to list what kind of traumas you wish to avoid and how much energy your willing to invest in avoiding them.

Setting up an CO2 to O2 spell would also be trivial, but you should probably augment it with some energy from local radiation, since we are in space, theres going to be a lot of that.
