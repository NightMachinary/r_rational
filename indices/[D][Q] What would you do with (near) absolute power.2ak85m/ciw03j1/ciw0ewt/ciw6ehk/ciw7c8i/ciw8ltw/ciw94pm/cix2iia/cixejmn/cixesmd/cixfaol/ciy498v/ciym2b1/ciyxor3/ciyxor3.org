  one that transmutes a system with maximum entropy into usable work energy.

To be overly technical with the terminology, you can't do that. A heat engine only works if you know where to find a heat gradient--and area of higher temperature, and an area of lower temperature. But that system is the one we're both talking about, so it's only a terminology quibble.

  Now lets say we pulled out entropy from Tc and added it to W, making W= 0.78125 due to the quarter of lost energy. Now since there is an imbalance between Th and Tc the engine starts up again and we go through the process once again.

Yup, this is it. Without magic, it takes work to create a heat gradient where none previously existed. If you can just magically stop molecules in their tracks, you get free energy.

Looking at it from the old "billiard ball model" of molecular interactions makes it more intuitively accessible than statistical thermodynamics, I think: Put a rigid divider in the middle of a pool table with fast-moving balls on one side, and slow-moving balls on the other side, and you'll be able to extract work from it until the speed of the balls is equalized.

If one side of the table is guaranteed to always have balls moving at /some/ finite speed (like it is, in our universe), and you're able to completely stop the balls on the other side, you'll always be able to extract work from the rigid divider.
