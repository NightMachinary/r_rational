Alright here is we are disagreeing. Lets instead say that instead of moving the energy from T^{c} into W we moved it back into T^{h} at the end of each cycle.

We would still produce 1.5 units of work energy. This is the same amount of energy that would be produced if you used the power to directly convert the entropy.

Now lets say we used that energy and it returned to an entropic state, useless for any other purpose. If it was all back in T^{h} then we have 1.5 units that would eventually produce 1.125 units of of work energy.

Your assuming that the cooling process is free but you have to use the entropic heat in a spell to move it, even if that spell is simply moving that energy form T^{c} to T^{h} . Meaning that you would eventually hit 0 in T^{c} , T^{h} , and W.

Even if you introduced more heat by dispersing matter into raw entropy, or use it in a spell and then process that again, but eventually
