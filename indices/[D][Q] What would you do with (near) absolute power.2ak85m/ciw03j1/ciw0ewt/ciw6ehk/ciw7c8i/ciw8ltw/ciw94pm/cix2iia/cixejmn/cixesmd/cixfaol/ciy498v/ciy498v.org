  If we assumed that you would remove heat energy from Tc and placed it back into Th that would only put 75% of the energy back into the system.

I do think you may be conflating some aspects of temperature with some aspects of energy; 'cause you can totally get free energy with this power.

Imagine you find yourself at the heat death of the universe--maximum entropy, no usable energy. The background temperature is like 5 Kelvins or something, I dunno. You make a 500 meter wide shell of heat engines, and stop nearly all molecular motion on the inside of that shell. As long as you keep the inside colder than the outside, the heat gradient will let the machines do work. So, free cooling==free energy.
