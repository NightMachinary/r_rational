All spells have to work with matter and energy. Lets say you wanted to build a spell to simulate a calculator. You could have the spell take a large number of particles and move them in such a that one side is the input the other is the output. The spell then performs your operations, moves the particles around, and tells you how many particles are on the output side.

You're still bound by light-speed, your upper energy limit, and your range, but you could make a pretty kick arse computational device literally out of a few twigs and a rock.
