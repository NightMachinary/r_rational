  If we were to reconvert, say, one unit of the work energy back into heat...

But this is called "doing work." Heat--useless molecular movement--is what energy--useful molecular movement--turns into when it's used to do work.

That's why the cooldown is an exploit: You take a .25 tax for creating energy using the power, but not for using things created by the power in a physics-abiding way. The only way you couldn't chain your way up to infinite energy is if you started with your entire environment at absolute zero; in which case you'd also be inconvenienced by being dead.
