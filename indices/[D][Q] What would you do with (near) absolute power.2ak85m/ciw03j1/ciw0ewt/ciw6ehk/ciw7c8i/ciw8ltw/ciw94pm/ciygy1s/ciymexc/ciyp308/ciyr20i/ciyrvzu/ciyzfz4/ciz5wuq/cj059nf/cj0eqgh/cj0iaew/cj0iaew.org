Okay, that was really bad wording on my part. Let me just build a framework here, and try not to get you more confused.

In order for a spell to determine an information based value it must be able to have a way to calculate by moving matter around.

Lets take your purposed question of determining if the number of primes between 1 and 10^{10^{10^{100}}} is even or odd. To determine if a number is prime or not you would have to set up a spell to move particles around to say if a number is prime or not.

So lets say it wants to calculate if seven is prime or not. I would move 7 particles into one specified area. Next it will remove particles in lots of 1 to 7. For example for 2 it would remove two particles at a time until it can't remove two particles at a time.

If for every number of lots the calculation area is not empty then it will add a particle to the group of particles that total the number of primes found.

Once done it will find if the number of remaining particles is even or odd, and move your stone in one direction or another.
