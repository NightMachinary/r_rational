In the first second, launch myself into space (keeping myself alive with my power as per 6.) to escape the future cone of EY's foom. Can I examine matter in my sphere of influence at the atomic level in order to copy it? If yes, copy myself. Does my copy have my power? If yes, we're identical. One of me discards arms and legs. Still powered? Remove body parts until some low-hanging minimum is reached, then replicate exponentially for a few minutes. Research less low-hanging minima, then replicate some more. Send a few trillion of me back to Earth to see if everyone has kept everyone else from fooming; if yes, immobilize everyone (assign two of me to instantly reversing all power use from each non-me) and sit down for a few years to work out that FAI thing. If no, this becomes an /interesting/ battle of titans that I, author of less than a decillion minds, cannot quite predict. (Although it's improbable that the logarithms of our power differ by less than 10.)
