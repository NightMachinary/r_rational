If your looking for ways to help people I could think of about a dozen ways to do so. colonize Mars, begin preparing for deep space travel, provide endless food. Hell going around and collecting entropy and pushing it back out in a form of usable energy would be great.

I don't recommend eaten Jupiter all at once of course. One I can think of a lot of men and women who would be rather upset if they didn't get a chance to study it. And two if you introduced that much energy into your system you would explode in short order.
