Self-modify. Eat Jupiter (Apparently I have to be very near stuff to use it - so clearly the solution is to spread myself out. This may also be good for self-perservation). Become a philanthropist.

Once I control the resources of a medium celestial body, how does philanthropy work? Well, we have a few leftover billion people who might need a hand - can I send out a tendril to give them some space habitats or something? Depending on how people are getting along, I can probably help with space habitats in general.

An alternate method for eating jupiter - rather than literally eating it or sending roots through it - one could compress a large portion into neutronium and just stand on it. Not getting squished by gravity is either impossible or a trivial application of superpowers, because resisting a force means 0 change in energy, and thus 0 energy actually expended.
