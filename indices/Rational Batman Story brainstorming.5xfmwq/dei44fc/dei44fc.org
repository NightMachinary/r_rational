I'd really like a "rational Batman" story that truly follows the Metropolitan Man formula - that is, feature a rational /Joker/ as the protagonist, facing a world that truly has gone batshit, trying to drive some sense into the bizarrely over-competent and over-equipped Batman in the only way he seems to understand - costumed violence.
