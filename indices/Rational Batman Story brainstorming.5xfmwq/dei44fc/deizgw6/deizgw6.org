I absolutely hated the way "rationalists" were portrayed as thinking of superman. Like Quirrel said in HPMOR, the moment a mythical hero arrives, common people tend to think of them as superpowered slaves, only fit to serve them and get criticised for not doing better. They have to be perfect, even though their masters are nowhere near perfect and very flaw of theirs is amplified while all good deeds are taken for granted.

TLDR - Lois Lane was a Bitch to superman in MM. And Luthor was a very well written Supervillian. But I still dont agree with the ending though.
