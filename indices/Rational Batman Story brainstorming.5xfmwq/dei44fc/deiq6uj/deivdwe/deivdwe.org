To get a rational, good Joker, you basically need a scenario where terrorism is the rational response to Batman. This needs a few ingredients, all of which seem totally reasonable to me.

(Before we start, though, I should note that Batman himself is already basically a terrorist. Dressing up as a bat doesn't help him arrest people; it makes other people afraid to fall afoul of him. Indeed, much of his schtick is designed to optimize making criminals feel afraid; making society contain less criminals is a more indirect goal. The Joker is not escalating by employing terrorism against Batman; he's merely holding up a mirror to Batman's own tactics.)

- First, Batman needs to be doing a lot more harm than good. This is the same as The Metropolitan Man's starting point in justifying Lex Luthor's antagonism towards Superman, and frankly it's not a hard argument to make against most canonical iterations of Batman. Batman is clearly not an effective use of Bruce Wayne's resources in an effective altruism sense, and there's a good reason that vigilantism is frowned upon in real life. If the no-kill rule is bent, this is an even easier argument to make; simply dispensing with it entirely wouldn't feel true to the character, but it would fit right in if he had a rule not to deliberately kill anyone but, as with many superheroes, was extremely cavalier about collateral damage.
- Second, Batman must be basically impossible to kill. Perhaps his effectively-tinker-tech has rendered him capable of standing up against even armies. This would require some comic-book-technobabble-bullshit, but that really comes with the territory here. In any case, if Batman's bad enough to justify the Joker, he's definitely bad enough to kill, so that has to simply not be a possibility.
- Third, Batman must be a stubborn asshole who proves to be highly resistant to logical persuasion, demanding the use of emotional persuasion instead. If you're a rational Joker, you're trying to do one of two things through terrorism - you're either trying to directly convince Batman that being Batman is a bad idea, or you're trying to convince the general public so that /they'll/ convince Batman that being Batman is a bad idea. Neither of these things are necessary if Batman will respond to direct rational communication. So you need to establish that Batman isn't responding to reason, so that you have to resort to terrorism to either shake or shame him out of being Batman.
