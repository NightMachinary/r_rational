Two problems with Lex's logic:

- Lex's attacks do more to push Superman toward becoming a threat than anything else ever managed. He totally discounts the risks of his actions.
- Superman can be a great force for good as well as for evil. The author has mentioned that he seriously considered ending the story with Zod arriving and no Superman to defend the Earth, but felt that would have been a little /too/ dark.

As I interpreted it - and this is just my personal impression - Clark talking about how his thought processes toward Calhoun were distorted was intended as a lampshade of Lex's similar mistakes, and his offer to Lex at the end to help him revolutionize the world was intended to hammer home the fact that Superman can /revolutionize the world/.

Certainly his actions were justified /from his perspective/, but Lex's perspective is warped. He's a supervillain, not a role model.
