  First, Batman needs to be doing a lot more harm than good. This is the same as The Metropolitan Man's starting point in justifying Lex Luthor's antagonism towards Superman, and frankly it's not a hard argument to make against most canonical iterations of Batman.

I thought it was fairly clear in Metropolitan Man that Lex's rampage /wasn't/ justified?
