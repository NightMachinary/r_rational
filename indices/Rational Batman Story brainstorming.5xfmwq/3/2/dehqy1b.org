This is exactly the reply that came into my mind, and what I was afraid of :(

I want a cool batman who swings from buildings and fights crime, but I want the story to show-not-tell intelligence.

As for your points they re all valid, but they are not a solution are they? I came in to write a Batman fanfic and finally I thought myself out of writing it :P net gain = 0.

Perhaps we could drive somewhere along the lines of Bruce Wayne not being Batman himself, but funding and maintaining Batmen incorporated, something like a highly trained and motivated special Vigilante Force, doing justice when law systems cannot?
