One way would be to simply make him not a superhero. I've seen a spiderman fac that went that route. But it was really short, and if you didn't make it short then it would be pointless to involve batman.

I feel like you at least need to make a few major changes. For one, he doesn't use a gun. Supposedly he's afraid of what he'll become if he uses one, but if he's willing to handicap himself that much he really should just leave the job to someone else. There's also the vast amount of money he has. There's no way it's cost-effective to use it to personally fight crime. He could fight crime without spending much of his money, but then he risks getting killed and being able to use his money in other ways. I think his best bet would be to use the money to fund other crimefighters, like [[http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Batman_Incorporated_(Prime_Earth)][Batman incorporated]], or just funding the police. And that's all assuming that spending money on crime-fighting is even a good way to use the money, as opposed to something like mosquito nets.

So, you'll need to give him a gun, and either ditch the fortune, or make him not fight crime personally. At this point I feel like you're better off abandoning him entirely and writing Rational Man with a Shotgun fanfiction.
