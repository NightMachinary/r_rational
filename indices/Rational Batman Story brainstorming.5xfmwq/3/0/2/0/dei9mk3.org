I think it's safe to say that he does only care about Gotham, unless you're talking about a more campy Justice League sort of Batman. And also this observation assumes that his interventions don't follow a curve representing diminishing returns. It's possible that there's low hanging fruit in the orphanage funding, police supporting, and bad-guy punching domains, but that each (or some) of these areas have rapidly diminishing returns.

Additionally, billionaires do have suprisingly massive resources, especially in relation to a single city. The budget of the entire New York Police Department is just under 5 billion yearly, but 92% of that is salary and pensions. If you imagine that Batman can donate 80 million or so to the Gotham Police department, that could easily double or triple the amount of money spent on equipment or training. If the GPD is leaving out training or not buying equipment that has been scientifically demonstrated to be especially effective (which is likely), that could lead to decent returns in terms of crime-fighting efficacy. Additionally, Batman could double up his use of this funding by getting some pull in the GPD, which would allow him to influence GPD policy.

I'd say a rational Batman should take advantage of social science to get the most out of his limited resources, i.e. be up on the latest "nudge" science to influence people not to do crime. He could be a sort of neuromarketer. He might also consider giving directly (as in the Give Directly movement) to reduce poverty in Gotham.
