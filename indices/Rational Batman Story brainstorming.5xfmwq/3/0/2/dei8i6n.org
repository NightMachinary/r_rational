That just makes it worse. As unlikely as it is, it's possible in principle that a billionaire fighting crime in person is the most effective way to combat it. What's not possible for that to be true, but to fund the police department is also the most cost-effective and proving jobs and funding orphanages and hospitals is as well. In no universe would doing all of those things be a good idea. Not unless his budget is high enough to significantly change all of those things, and unless he only cares about Gotham that's not likely. He should take whichever one of those works best, and do it everywhere.
