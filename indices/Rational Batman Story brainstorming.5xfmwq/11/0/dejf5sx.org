Eh. The joker should be dead regardless of the batman's stance on the subject - most versions of him are so crazy other /villains/ should have offed him long ago just for being bad for business. All business. It doesn't really matter what your plans are, the joker being in the same city as you is likely to be problematic - but he has plot armor, because the writers give him plot armor.

That said.. I have long had an idea for a rational /Gotham/. Not a rational batman, but a reason why gotham is how it is.

It's in the water: Wayne industries were founded on a particular steel surfacant - an anti-corrosion, anti-wear treatment that was a very neat black, and extremely durable. Popular in everything throughout the 20's, 30's, 40's. Still used in some applications to the present day. Only.. The manufacture of it leaked chemicals. Very interesting chemicals. That do odd things to human brains.

People who grow up in Gotham have shockingly low akrasia. They're not more intelligent, per say, but they are much, much harder working, which means they're often far better educated than anyone would expect, and since this has held from childhood on, the /effective/ average intelligence in Gotham is very high.

And everyone works hard. Really hard. Companies put up with the insane crime levels because the average working joe or jane gotham is worth several normal workers in terms of output.

Only.. This includes the criminals. People who in other cities would have grown up to be grifters and petty thieves embark on massively ambitious criminal enterprises. /nobody/ kites checks or deals a little weed. They're law-abiding citizens, or they're wannabe kingpins.

And then there's the overdose cases. Notice how a whole lot of gotham characters have nearly supernatural kinaesthesia, high intelligence and an overriding obsession with a theme, including a costume? It's a syndrome. The bat. Riddler. Catwoman. Ect, ect, ect. They all have the same screwed up wiring.
