Bruce Wayne is a hero. Batman is a mental illness.

Imagine Bruce Wayne as a Bill Gates style philanthropist, ruthlessly pursuing the most effective means to leverage mega-wealth for the common good. But unlike Gates, he's doing it in a world filled with magic and schizo-tech and all the other glorious oddities that litter the DC universe - much, much higher potential for positive outcomes, if only you can think far enough outside the box.

But he's a fundamentally broken man. His childhood trauma leads him to want to dress up as a bat and beat up muggers. In a world that literally contains the superman, is that the most effective use of his time? Obviously he's really really good at beating up muggers, but does that even matter? Does an hour spent patrolling the streets of Gotham save as many lives as an hour spent trying to, for instance, assemble the coalition of minds needed to mass produce Weather Wizard's weather control system to reverse the desertification of farm land in Africa?

On one hand, Bruce is smart enough to shut up and multiply. On the other, he's haunted by his past.
