Batman could be building his image around the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic][Availability Heuristic]].

People are bad at risk assessment. We massively over-focus on vivid threats. Especially threats that make us feel powerless.

Use JAWS as a baseline. Shark attacks are astonishingly rare. But water makes people feel helpless. Point this out in a popular movie, and you've got a huge, national phobia.

Batman could doing the same thing. With the right media coverage, he could be a huge perceived threat, even if he only stopped [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fatal,_unprovoked_shark_attacks_in_the_United_States][1 or 2 crimes a year]].

And, if Rationalist-Batman only needs a handful of masterfully-scripted interventions a year, his character starts to make sense.

--------------

From the outside, a typical Rationalist-Batman adventure probably looks like this:

I'm a mid-level thief. I hear that the Gotham Museum is putting up a rare jewel exhibit [[#s][]] in their east wing.

I go check out the venue before the exhibit takes place. I even bring a few friends to see what they think. [[#s][]]

We go back to my place, and, over a couple months, plan the robbery. Gotham is dangerous, so we get ourselves some guns [[#s][]]

A couple days before the robbery, a sign goes up saying that the jewel will be temporarily removed for restoration! This breaks our main plan. Fortunately, it looks like there's a back-way into the museum we can use.

We're halfway through the robbery, when this figure in black comes diving through the skylight! Glass [[#s][]] shatters everywhere.

I don't notice at the time, but at the trial, it happens there's a camera catching everything. Seems like we got unlucky and the museum upgraded their security just before my robbery.

So, I pull my gun and start shooting! But somehow, he dodges my bullets! How can anyone roll out of the way of bullets?

I'm shooting even as he rushes up to me. Point blank. I couldn't miss. But somehow the bullet passes right through him. The batman is a ghost!

He hits me. And everything goes black.
