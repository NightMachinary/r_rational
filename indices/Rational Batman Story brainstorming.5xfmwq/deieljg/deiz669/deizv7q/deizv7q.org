It's not an attempt to come up with a different version of Batman. It's a /rationalization/ of canon Batman.

It's to explain how and why Batman does what he does without assuming him to be holding an idiot ball. Rather it's to explain how an intelligent Bruce Wayne can turn out into the Batman we all know and love. Hence restating the entire comic timeline while showing the motivations behind Batman's behavior.
