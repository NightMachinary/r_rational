It may be best to embrace the craziness of the extended DC universe instead of ignoring it.

You may recall that in the DC multiverse there is a universe where after Jason Todd died Batman decided to abandon his no killing code. Soon after all the villains are dead and Earth is described as a Utopia.

Imagine if you will, instead of abandoning his code, or his mission, Batman takes Jason's death as a signal to evaluate his goals, specifically his end goals. For the first time he actually sits down and asks himself what his end game is, what does he really want the world to look like.

At this point he notices, really notices, how crazy his world is. Costumed lunatics everywhere, both helpful and destructive. Aliens, immortals, gods. Some beings that are all three. Superpowers, psychics, magic, xenotech, self-aware robots. Even death isn't the end. Souls seem to retain some memory and are often used as fuel for empowering demons. And the worst of the lot become demons themselves.

Clearly, this is not an optimal situation.

Once he figures out what he wants he has massive resources to enact a plan, both his own and his allies. But what should the future look like? Immortality? Resurrection? Super powers for all? Would he be willing to self-modify? He has been offered both a green lantern and yellow lantern ring.

What roadblocks would be encountered. Clearly some of his allies would have thoughts. Most of them are so blinded by the naturalistic fallacy that they are incapable of imagining a better world as anything other than the current world but with less crime. Just as he was.

Storywise it would probably be better to have an established, self-contained story to base this rational-fic on. Zoat's With this Ring does an entertaining job of this using Young Justice. The DC animated universe would be an obvious choice because as of the Justice league series there are ongoing storylines in which to situate your story. The DC animated movies could also be a good choice. There are several in the New 52 style continuity. Whatever is chosen, the comics are always available to help fill in the gaps when needed.

Stories about rationalist awakenings are rare, so I would love to read one if this is the direction you go.
