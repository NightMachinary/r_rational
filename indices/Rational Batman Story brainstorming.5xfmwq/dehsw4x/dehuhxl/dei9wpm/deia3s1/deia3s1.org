I was more reffering to the fact, that Batman's methods of catching supervillains are not rational and he does really lousy job at getting the most of his resources.

That's not to say Batman ratfic is impossible. I would be really like to see mind games between him and Joker or Riddler, though it would require quite a lot of changes in the universe itself.
