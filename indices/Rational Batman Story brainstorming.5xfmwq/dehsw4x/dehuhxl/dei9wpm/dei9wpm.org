This is pretty true. But if you were being charitable to canon, that explanation is probably supervillains. If crime is less an everyday occurrence and more a series of pockets of deep and intractable supervillainy, then having a Batman who is a specialist in getting rid of supervillians makes sense. In canon, the police are unable to catch supervillains ever, and so are 100% ineffective against supervillains.
