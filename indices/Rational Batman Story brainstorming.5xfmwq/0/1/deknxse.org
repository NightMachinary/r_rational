  And, if Rationalist-Batman only needs a handful of masterfully-scripted interventions a year, his character starts to make sense.

To be an effective ghost story, not to actually stop crime though.

Crime is pretty darn resilient. Gang members and mobsters must know that very determined and funded law enforcement groups are out there after them for a fact at least some of the time but they continue on.

At the end of the day a ghost story about a man that is also a bat won't change the nature of sociopathy, unskilled workers who mostly profit off crime, desire for drugs and other illegal activities.

Especially not in a rathole like Gotham.
