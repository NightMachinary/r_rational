If you want to do the campy 'Master Detective' aspect, I'd have Batman use [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_construction][parallel construction]].

He's actually be finding criminals using super-mundane (if privacy violating) methods. Once he's found them, he can invent some post-hoc chains of evidence.

Like, rather than, "I bugged their apartment" his note to the police could say, "The Bat-Computer noticed that the thieves had purchased a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja_rocks][spark plug]] for a 1983 Camero, and 2 regular screwdrivers. But a Camero uses Phillip's head screws! So, clearly, these were robbers tools."

The point would be to convey to the criminals that there's an omnipotent, near-omniscient foe hunting them, with infinite resources.

That would make anyone paranoid. And the resulting paranoia might legitimately help reduce crime on a national scale.

It would certainly impact more people than batman would be able to personally punch.
