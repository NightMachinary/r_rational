Possibility...

What Gotham needs isn't one more person on patrol, even an extremely capable one. What it needs is for the police department to start doing its job.

Said police department is as bad as it gets. Many cops are straight up working for organized crime. Others see the badge as a license to hurt people (but not to hurt criminals, because they might shoot back). Others just don't care: they'll sit at a desk for thirty years and then collect a pension. The courts are just as bad. And this has been going on for long enough that the public has given up on the system, actually preferring mafia justice because it offers some real protection.

Enter Bruce Wayne. Who has enough money and lawyers to not be easily pushed around, and enough ninjitsu to present a nasty surprise to anyone who decides to escalate. Who manipulates the system with no scruples but a technical respect for the law, bringing the corrupt cops before the honest judges, and manipulating people into doing their jobs by whatever means necessary.

At some point Alfred tells him a story about serving as batman to some British commander in WWII and his mission was not to defeat the enemy, but to get everything else out of the way so that his principal could defeat the enemy. Bruce decides he can be a batman to the law.

Eventually he adopts a bat motif. Alfred suggests he's missing the point, but Bruce thinks it fits perfectly.
