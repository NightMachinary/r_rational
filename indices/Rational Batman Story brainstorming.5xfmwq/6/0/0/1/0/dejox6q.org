If Batman is a problem to be solved, and stopping him physically is ruled out as a solution, this implies that a solution is needed that convinces Batman to stop. Once simple, honest, rational communication is also ruled out, all that's left is psychological warfare. If Batman does more harm than good and he won't accept this when it's flatly told to him, perhaps a real-life demonstration of the point will. How would Voldemort stop Harry from destroying the world if he could only do it by teaching him and not by killing him? Maybe by killing others in an attempt to give him maturity and rattle him out of childish delusions.

The Joker is essentially holding a mirror up to Batman. "This is what you get when you run around in a funny costume at night and try to 'improve society' by hurting people you don't like."
