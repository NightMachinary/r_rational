Could you elaborate? It's likely that I've missed, misinterpreted or forgotten something here. From what I recall, Superman /was/ a potential existential to humanity - difficult to be certain he wouldn't snap or 180 at some point, at which time it may be too late to be able to stop him. Later events in the work, as I recall them, seemed to justify this concern.
