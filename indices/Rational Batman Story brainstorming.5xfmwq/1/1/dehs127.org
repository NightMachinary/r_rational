That's a neat idea. and The one above with the smoke and mirrors is awesome as well. I think the main problem with batman is there simply isn't enough time for anyone in the world to know all the skills Batman knows, and know how to implement them at any situation plus have a large enough IQ to think of solutions where none of the above technique works. How about going the J.A.R.V.I.S way with Batman? Thomas Wayne was computer Engineer, founding WayneCorps as a Operating System and Business Management Software Solutions company. He Creates an ASI ( not super as in God-level but Super as-in IQ around the upper 800-1000 mark. Obviously this AI wasn't created with the recursive improvement method, otherwise the IQ spike wouldnt have stopped). As part of beta-testing and monitoring, he incorporates this AI into his robot butler, and also gives it control over WayneCorps and WayneManor Systems. The AI has a value system built in to give priority to Bruce Wayne and Gotham.

Fast Forward to young bruce returning from the Ra's al ghul academy and finding all the wayne finances perfectly managed and in order. A.L.F.R.E.D takes care of everything. Bruce decides to be Batman. Alfred's value system has priority of protecting bruce so he is always urging him to stop. but failing that, he does the next viable option, give bruce the best chance of survival. i.e Give him the technology, assist him in the skillsets, make suits suitable for street level survival, do a real time monitoring of the situation by keeping a small unit in the cowl which processes every crime scene where the batman is in real time and gives alternatives.

WOW. that doesnt sound like a Batman fic at all, does it? :P
