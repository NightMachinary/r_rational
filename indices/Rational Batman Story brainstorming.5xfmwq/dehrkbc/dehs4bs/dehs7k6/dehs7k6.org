The subreddit was becoming unbalanced by them and we were getting more "Hey wouldn't it be cool if..." threads that never went anywhere than actual stories (not to mention the number of threads where people were talking about stuff that wasn't related to fiction at all). There /was/ an exception for people who wrote stories (one brainstorming thread per chapter) but that isn't mentioned in the sidebar anymore so I'm not sure if it still holds.

We have Rationality Monday, Worldbuilding Wednesday, Off-Topic Friday, Munchkinry Saturday, and Writing Skills Sunday, however. This would probably fit best in Worldbuilding Wednesday, IMO, but you might be able to justify putting it in Writing Skills Sunday.
