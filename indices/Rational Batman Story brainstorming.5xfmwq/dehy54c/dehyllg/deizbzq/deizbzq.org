how does the suits tech scale though?

Last time I checked, The suit had a basic light bending cloaking technology a.la predator, and injected nanobots into the wearers body to overdrive his muscles. plus the suit contained muscle strands itself which amplified the strength, speed and durability of the wearer. Oh and It had the basic crypto stuff, hacking, omnitool, radar, 3D sense,etc.

I see no tech in the suit that can scaled to humanity improving levels, it's basically just a battle enhancement armor.
