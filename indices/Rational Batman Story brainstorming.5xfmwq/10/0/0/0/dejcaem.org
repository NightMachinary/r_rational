Nanobots that can improve/overdrive your muscles is a tiny step from life-extension disease-destroying injections, implantable growable cybernetic replacements, etc. You can argue that the tech ends up being super-specialized and thus not applicable, but the biggest obstacle to present-day adoption of such tech is construction and programming at the nanoscale, which the suit implies has been overcome.

Self-reinforcing and repairing materials? Spacecraft, buildings, clothing.
