I'm also a fan of Feldon of the Third Path's flavour text, but you need to have read (and should read, regardless of familiarty with MtG lore) /[[https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/arcana/lorans-smile-2014-10-27][Loran's Smile]]/, before it's particularly impactful, so it's not really flash fiction in that sense.
