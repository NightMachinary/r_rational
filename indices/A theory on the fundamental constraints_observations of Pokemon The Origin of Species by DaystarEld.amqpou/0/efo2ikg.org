The story lampshades the term evolution at one point. - Red points out that it's more of a metamorphosis really, but yadda yadda yadda (something social sciency)

Anyway, entry A might not be related to entry B. Its genome contains a lot of random information, that happens to include all the other genes found in Pokemon. All that means is most Pokemon have simple genomea and mew has a complex one, or maybe it travels a lot and stores the DNA of everything it eats within its body.

It being the ancestor of all Pokemon because of the ability to learn all the moves doesn't have to be related to that at all.
