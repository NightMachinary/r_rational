  The story lampshades the term evolution at one point. - Red points out that it's more of a metamorphosis really, but yadda yadda yadda (something social sciency)

I remember that, and actually it kind of bugged me because it felt like imposing scientific meanings from our own world onto the pokemon world. Like, sure, the creators of pokemon in our world were probably misusing the word "evolution", and I get that the author was lampshading that. But in-universe, evolution /means/ pokemon evolution. Even if Red is taking a prescriptivist-linguistic approach, where did that prescription even come from? People have observed pokemon evolution for thousands of years. The meaning of evolution as in pokemon evolution would have been the first.
