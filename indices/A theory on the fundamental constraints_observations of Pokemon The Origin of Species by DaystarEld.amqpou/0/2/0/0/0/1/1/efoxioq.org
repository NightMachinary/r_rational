Escaping computer optimized data structures, the genetic data would need to be encoded in a way that makes sense for DNA. This means we have a 4-nary or 6-nary digits. Each gene is a string of random length, including a header and footer string which Mark's the length, and must be recognized via fuzzy patterns because it gets mildly corrupted with each cell division. In addition they have no sorting. They are all individually encrypted and each time the cell receives input via chemical messenger, it will attempt to decrypt the data in parallel using the message as a key, and act upon those pieces which are decrypted successfully.

Now to include every possible Pokemon in Mew's genome, you have a huge number of individual genes that have to react predictably to a limited set of possible chemical messengers that then have to be passed in a sensible set of packages to its descendants. A Bayesian approach would lead to lots of goop (aka missingno?) even because most combinations will either fail to produce an organism, or will fail to produce one which can survive (a few seconds, but also long enough to make more of itself). There's also the question of how it's only reproducing part of its genome and why its body uses valuable RNA to make those extra unused genes in the first place.

Otoh if a mew transforms down to the chemical level, the new cells may not have the same complexity to recall its original genome. A simple microevolution that attempts to reduce the wasted RNA instead deletes the data of how to turn back, thus creating a mew that is no longer a mew after evolving, but a brand new Pokemon that never existed, which scientists eventually decided to call Charmander.

Regarding the note I think the confusion is that you thought my initial comment was a disagreement with your thesis rather than some aspects of the argument.
