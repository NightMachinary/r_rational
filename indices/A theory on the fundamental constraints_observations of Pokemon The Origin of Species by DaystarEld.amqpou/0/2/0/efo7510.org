No that doesn't follow. For example Ditto is also able to use all moves after using transform. Transform is one of the 11 moves mew learns naturally in gen 1, and if Mew is able to retain the data used for the transformation within its body somehow that explanation is sufficient for the premise, but contradicts the conclusion.

Edit: Wait does that mean Mew is the ancestor of all Pokemon, not because of traditional RL evolution mechanics but because all other Pokemon are actually Mew that got stuck that way? /R/im12andthisisdeep
