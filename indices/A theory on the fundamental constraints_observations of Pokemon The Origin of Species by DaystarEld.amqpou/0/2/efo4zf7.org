Consider this pov: "Moves" are technically some form of "Force manipulation".

If genes descriptions dictate which forces are manipulable by which set of genes (like the gene marker theory from HpMor), then gene descriptors should play a significant role in force manipulations.

So the ancestry reference, i.e. being the database of all gene descriptors of force manipulations must be related.
