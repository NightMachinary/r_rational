Mew uses transform. Mew is now Charmander. Charmander can't remember its original form. Charmander detransforms into Ditto.

Or Charmander learned Flame Thrower. Charmabder forgot how to use transform (except in certain situations and only into Charmeleon which can then chain into Charizard, but even then those are involuntary).

Of course if this is how Pokemon species happen there must be a ton of mew everywhere and the researchers just can't tell. Also normal evolution just became obsolete and most normal animal species are extinct from the rapid random environment changes they can't cope with.
