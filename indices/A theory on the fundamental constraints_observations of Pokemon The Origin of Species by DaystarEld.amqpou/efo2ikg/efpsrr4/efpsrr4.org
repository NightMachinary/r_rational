I have no idea what you're talking about. I'm not sure if I can even catalog all of my points of confusion, but I'll try. Beware: spaghetti post.

  A different way to look at what - a species of which has the entire genetic database stored - would be like is an AI.
#+end_quote

How? A dictionary has the entire lexical database stored. Is a dictionary an AI? Is a mouse with a dictionary an AI?

#+begin_quote
  One that has compiled abiogenesis.
#+end_quote

I know both of those words, but I don't know what you mean when you put them together like that. The least incoherent reading I can think of is that some external force simulated what the universe will look like, with all the organisms in it, then it went back and encoded that into Mew's genome. And I think that you are postulating that the researchers are postulating such a force, and calling it God or whatever?

#+begin_quote
  If [Mew uses its DNA to Transform], this would technically need the engineers finding a way to encode all of the genetic information biologically(I'm assuming Mewtwo instead of a silicon approach).
#+end_quote

Wait, what? Why are there engineers now? If Mew (as the researchers imagine it) can Transform into anything described by subsets of its genome, then... no, it clearly doesn't need a team of engineers to do so. It already encodes the genetic information biologically. Because it is a biological thing with genes. At what point in your thought process is the genetic information encoded any other way? Why are you even mentioning Mewtwo here? Are you trying to say that the Mewtwo project invented Mew by blending together every other Pokemon, and then they created Mewtwo in order to... encode the information that they encoded in order to make Mew? I can't follow your reasoning at all.

#+begin_quote
  Therefore, there was no Mew. It had to be a Myth that the older generation formulated.
#+end_quote

How does that follow? How did you conclude that it is impossible that there just really is a god that speciates by subtraction?

#+begin_quote
  And Giovanni set out to work it out.
#+end_quote

If there never was a Mew, then what is there to "work out"? It's a thing that never existed, described by people who don't understand genetics. What concrete steps does "work it out" entail, starting from that?

#+begin_quote
  If Mew did contain all of the genetic information, it wouldn't be "Evolution" that took place in Pokemon, but rather, "Computation".
#+end_quote

I have no idea what "computation" is supposed to mean here. Are you going back to the universe-simulating force from the other possibility, that I thought was separate? What makes you say that evolution is not the thing that is being computed? What distinction are you trying to make here?

#+begin_quote
  this could point to the "computation" being some form of "unrealized" technology, and could/could not be extended to a common species depending on their compatibility.
#+end_quote

"Computation"? "Unrealized"? "Technology"? "Extended"? "Compatibility"? I can't even parse this sentence.

#+begin_quote
  Which makes a good case for Atlantean Origins.
#+end_quote

I couldn't follow a single line of thought or piece of evidence that lead you to this conclusion.

Also, I hate it. Sometimes Flying particles are just things that exist in the universe. Bringing in some ancient magic superscience to explain why the story's world isn't identical to our world is the worst kind of unsatisfying non-explanation, on par with "Red is a kid in the real world imagining the whole thing."
