What comes to mind for me: Colonisation, or more probably semi-Terraforming.

​

Some species sends out Mews to potentially-habitable planets. Cramming all the DNA into one organism cuts costs and logistic difficulties of preparing an entire self-sustaining colony ship (either multigenerational, or through costly stasis/hibernation pods, some Pokemon maybe not able to be put into stasis/hibernation): you just get the Mew as a form that can dormantly be hurled through space until it survives landing on a planet, optionally being able to guide itself into the orbit of a planet (through gas expulsion, or solar-sail-like wings?).

​

The Mew lands on a planet, tries to colonise the planet, and the 'unpacked' Pokemon with no natural predators except for each other either are wiped out by native wildlife or quickly dominate native wildlife instead. Maybe some centuries/millennia later, either the Mew-sending species (if not encoded within the Mew too) arrives and finds all its familiar tasty and home-materials animals already everywhere, or (if encoded within the Mew too) makes contact with its own kind, which presumably have inherited ancestral memories of some sort. Or they just show up and say. "You, this particular sort of psychic pokemon. You've become the dominant species, right? You're a colony of us, so please start sending us your planet's resources."

​

Now, the main question: are humans native wildlife that thrived through intelligence, despite the extinction of pretty much all other non-Pokemon native wildlife? If so, did they through being even more intellectually capable than the Mew-encoded intelligent dominant species, or by the intelligent dominant species who sent the Mew not encoding themselves within it, planning to arrive later after the planet was comfortable for them? If humans aren't native wildlife, and are encoded within Mew too, then does that mean that a much-older human government who sent Mew are going to make contact at some point?

​

Of course, it could also be a dying planet sending out Mews, but then I imagine there would be a greater focus on preserved cultural information.

​

...Hmm, by the original Mew concept, I'm incidentally reminded of an absurd moment in the Utawarerumono anime. "Now, watchers, you've wondered all along about the identity of this magical being with godlike power. His true identity is... the missing link between dinosaurs and humans!" "What."
