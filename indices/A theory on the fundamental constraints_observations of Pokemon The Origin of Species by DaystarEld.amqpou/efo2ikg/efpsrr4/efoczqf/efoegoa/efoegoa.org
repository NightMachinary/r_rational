I haven't fully considered the biological side of it.

I'mactually a programmer. So I immediately switched to a database with some sort of trigger which passes one or more attributes to the final DNA trigger which lets the organism realize a particular/set of attributes.

Pluripotent stem cells could be this final step before attribute materialisation. Yes.

If you're thinking of a different picture in terms of pluripotent stem cells, what would that be?
