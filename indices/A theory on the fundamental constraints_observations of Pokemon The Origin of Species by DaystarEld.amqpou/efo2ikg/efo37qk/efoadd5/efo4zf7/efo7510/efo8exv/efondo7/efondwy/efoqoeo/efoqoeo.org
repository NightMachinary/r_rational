Consider a database of all individual species as a collection. This may be stored either as a sequential memory, or a hierarchical temporal memory structure (something like a Neural Network for argument's sake). Let's go with the HTM's. A particular species results in a set of very specific triggers:

Ancestry (A Bayesian weight), environmental triggers (can result in mutations, can result in varying degrees of prowess (Bell curves)), and genetic modifications (Technical Machines).

Every one (path) of which quantify a species.

A Charmander would therefore not randomly transform into a mew randomly.\\
Note: A possible hypothesis on where you might have misunderstood my claim could be that you're assuming every Charmander or Ditto to carry the entire database. The process of how every evolution carries on is completely different from the compilation evolution of Mew. Also, note that the process by which Ditto mimics other agents isn't necessarily a similar process of how Mew does it.

A mew could essentially forget to transform back to the original mew and keep roaming as a Charmander of a Ditto.
