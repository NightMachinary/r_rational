I think /evolution/ actually works fine to describe Pokémon metamorphosis/transmutation, both in its modern and in its historic sense. I guess there's some notion of it being a bit more gradual than the rapid (revolutionary) process by which Pokémon evolve canonically, though I've also read fanfics which show the process happening in a manner more like conventional growth and development, with stages just being periods of stasis.

I do recall the lampshading in this fic, though, but don't remember its exact context (on mobile so it's obnoxious to look for it). What's the status of “Darwinian” thought here? Is it believed applicable to humans, Pokémon, and other organisms? Is common descent among them all accepted? Is the breadth of fossil diversity limited to the dozen-ish Pokémon we see in the games, or if there are e.g. mundane birds around does that mean e.g. there are dinosaur fossils somewhere? Has the basis of heredity been worked out yet? Has the pokéquivalent of the modern synthesis occurred? etc. I think I remember DNA, Dawkins, and maybe some other 20th century stuff mentioned --- does that mean all prior “discoveries” have also been made?
