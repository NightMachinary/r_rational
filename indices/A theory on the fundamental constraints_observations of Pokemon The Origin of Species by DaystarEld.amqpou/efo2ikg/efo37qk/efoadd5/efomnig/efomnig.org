Modern and historical models of evolution still involve some level of iteration over multiple generations, regardless of what the selection mechanism may be. Pokemon metamorphosis involves neither of those.

As for the science exposition I don't know. The Pokemon world's infrastructure doesn't lend itself to proper experiments so I've just taken it as an edutainment moment rather than trying to fit it in with the existing continuity.
