On 13), the genders of each Meta^{n}-Genie alternate, so that GOD overall has no particular gender.

On 6): So what kind of world would the Weasel end up in? Maybe we're to believe he popped out of "Little Harmonic Labyrinth" entirely, and somewhere in the real world is a weasel who was once an extremely minor character in GEB introduced to make a joke. Maybe he's posting on [[/r/popping]] right now.

I wouldn't conclude in 12) that "one needs to go to an infinite level of meta-ness to answer anything". Any reasonable wish would be a normal wish or a meta-wish, with nothing infinite going on.

The djinni seem to be designed to prevent paradoxes by being type-safe -- requiring wishes about wishes to be at a separate level is a lot like how set theory has to use a different word than "set" to describe a set of all sets. They would have been safe from paradoxes if they hadn't let Achilles get an exemption to their type system and make a Typeless Wish.

On 5): I wouldn't be so quick to conclude that our /world/ has paradoxes in it that make it inconsistent. We don't know any way to formally describe the whole world, indeed. We can only describe small aspects of it with formal systems. When you encounter a paradox, it means that you applied a formal system in a way that it can't actually be applied. So I'm not sure it means anything for the world to be inconsistent, or to have paradoxes; it's our reasoning about it that may have paradoxes.

Kind of nice that we can come up with formal systems that have something to do with reality, though. Maybe the question is asking us to envision a world where logical reasoning is completely useless.
