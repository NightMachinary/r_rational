1. The song they are listening to ends with some resolution, but not the original resolution they wanted. The dialogue is similar; we have the resolution of Achilles and the Tortoise returning to the real world in the Tortoise's home. However, this only happened in the story they were reading. We have no resolution about the Tortoise being cooked in a stew, which was the original conflict.
