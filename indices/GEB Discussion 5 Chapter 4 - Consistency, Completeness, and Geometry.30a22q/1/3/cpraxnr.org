5.If we lived in an inconsistent world, some things would be true and false at the same time, and not just because of wording. Like, Schrodenger's Cat could actually be both dead and alive. Instead, quantum physics puts it in a probabilistic state, with likelihood of being alive between 0(definitely false) and 1(definitely true). It resolves itself when the state is revealed, and our world thus remains consistent! Or that's how I would put it, with what little I know. Paradoxes kind of work the same way, as I mentioned [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2z8zm5/geb_discussion_1_introduction_a_musicological/cppqfs1][here]]: probability between true or false, unless forced to decide.
