Neat! While my philosophical background knowledge is limited on these theories, my perspective presented above is that there is precisely one reality, and that our understanding of it is both the origin and the purpose of our systems and symbols. I think platonism introduces a second reality, so that's different. Intuitionism looks probable; I might have to explore it further sometime.
