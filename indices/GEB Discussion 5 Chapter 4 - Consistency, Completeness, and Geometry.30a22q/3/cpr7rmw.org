#+begin_quote
  The record player is explained as having two isomorphisms simultaneously on two levels, with an explicit and implicit meaning. Do all isomorphisms have an explicit and implicit meaning(s)?
#+end_quote

I want to say that isomorphisms are, by definition, connections between one system/level and another. If an object in one level has an implicit meaning, it means that that level is related to a higher level via isomorphism. The objects go by a name: 'symbols'. Words are symbols, statements are symbols, stories can be symbols (and when they are they're called parables or extended metaphors), and formal systems can be considered symbols as well.

While Hofstader seems to like to consider symbol and interpretation as independent, I think it's important to determine which comes first. I suggest that interpretation comes first, as the motive for the rest: the usual pattern is that symbols are invented by some intelligent person(s), in order to describe something they know of in reality. Euclid, when he invented/formalized geometry, was trying to describe the 3D spatial world as he knew it. The pq- system was invented to represent some basic math, and, of course, to be an analogy for other systems. Record players were invented before records were made for them. If the symbols/systems were random or out of thin air, they could be assumed to be meaningless. They would be like searching for meanings in alphabet soup: you could try, but you'd be hard pressed to see anything coherent.

Counterexamples?

EDIT: My main proposition here should be stated as *systems and their interpretations come together, chronologically*, rather than that one comes before the other. You don't invent a record player without also inventing the record, nor vice versa.
