It's in the next chapter, but the diagram on p. 129 is a nice visualization of the plot structure of the dialogue. You could perhaps call it a "plot plot". Jumps downward represent "pushing" a nested story onto the stack, and jumps upward represent "popping" into the surrounding reality.

For the sake of discussion, I sloppily drew some more plot plots of nested stories that range from moderately popular to famous. Do you agree with the diagrams?
