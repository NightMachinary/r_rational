Slightly relevant xkcd! [[https://xkcd.com/1086/]]

Let's suppose that Black Hat's wishes are being answered by the djinns. Which levels would he have to wish at?

- "That wishing on eyelashes worked": meta-wish
- "A pony": wish
- "Unlimited wishes": meta-wish
- "Revocation of rules prohibiting unlimited wishes": meta-meta-wish
- "A finite but arbitrarily large number of wishes": meta-wish
- "The power to dictate the rules governing wishes": apparently his meta-meta-wish didn't get answered, so maybe he's trying to make a meta-meta-meta wish here. Or a Typeless Wish if he wants to change the rules about wish types also.
- "Unlimited eyelashes": wish
- "That wish-granting entities be required to...": definitely a Typeless Wish
- ...
- "A universe which is a replica of this one sans rules against meta-wishes": now that's jumping out of the system. Typeless Wish because this universe would need a copy of all the djinns.
