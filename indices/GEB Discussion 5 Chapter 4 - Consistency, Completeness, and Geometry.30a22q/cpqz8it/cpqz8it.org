  Does the fact the fifth postulate can't be proven from the other four mean that the parallel postulate is a Gödelian statement? Actually the answer is no, because Gödelian statements are true statements which are unprovable from within the system. Since the postulate can be assumed to be true for Euclidean geometry and assumed to be false for spherical (also called elliptical) and hyperbolic geometry, it is not a Gödelian statement.

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_completeness_theorem][Gödel's Completeness theorem]] implies that for any statement that can't be proved or disproved within a system, there are models of the system satisfying and dissatisfying it. You're making a distinction between "unprovable within a system" and "being true or false depending on the model," when there is no difference between these.
