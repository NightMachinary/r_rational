I don't quite think it does, but the Isomorphism and causal modeling in probabilistic programming show that nontermination of a program/nonnormalization of a proof/inconsistency of logic, when viewed as a causal model, makes causality go in circles, which makes easy sense of why logical inconsistency corresponds to a lack of possible realities -- reality can't "make up its mind" on what to do in those situations.
