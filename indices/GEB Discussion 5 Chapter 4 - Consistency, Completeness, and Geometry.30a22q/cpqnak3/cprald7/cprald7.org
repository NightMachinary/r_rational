7.Blue represents calm or security, red, excitement or danger. The higher levels are so-called because they have the greatest consequences. The choice is yours, but to face your highest levels is to encounter the most real, and most rewarding, of your obstacles.

8.The tunnel of love represents what happens when someone begins exploring a system not of their own creation, such as math, geometry, or GOB. If the author can't speak to you, as he wrote the system and left you to read it alone, then you may be in a predicament. You must hop quickly from being a passive to an active participant, and not enter into 'blind love' of the system for its own sake, for then your hope relies upon the silent gondola-guide eventually leading you out of that 'tunnel of love' again, so you can see clearly enough to return to the real world. If you never escape, then not only are you stuck in the illusion, but you also never "taste the tonic, [and] feel [the] deep sense of satisfaction" of learning what the system was there to teach you in the first place.

I am probably in serious peril of this fate, myself, on a few different levels. I think I'm too trusting of 'gondola people', really, or too lazy to jump out and walk. And with all the man-made systems people can and do passively participate in, it's no wonder most people are still stuck in all kinds of false perceptions. We call them stereotypes, misunderstandings, false beliefs, addictions, etc. Sometimes we don't recognize we're in them. It's a big job, but important, to get ourselves and others out of them!

Other notes:

- The top-level Achilles and the Tortoise never have their story resolved back to the amusement park where they began, but rather are left in the clutches of the Tortoise-eater. This symbolizes a grim outlook on life, both that it's "not all fun and games", that you're gonna be eaten alive in somebody's pie-in-the-sky (someone fighting for their ideal at your expense?), particularly if you settle for a 'resolution in a subsidiary key' -- a happy ending but not the happiest. At least if the strange loop completes itself by an ending like in the Majotaur's Labyrinth, a 'bowl of popcorn' may appear! It's a rather whimsical metaphor, overall.
