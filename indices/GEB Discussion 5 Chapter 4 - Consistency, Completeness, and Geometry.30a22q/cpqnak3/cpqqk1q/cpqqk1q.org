Thanks [[/u/rspeer]] for continuing the work on the wikia and thanks [[/u/xamueljones]] for preparing the discussion. Don't worry about being a little late, after all this is done in your free time.

*Some thoughts:*

- The book remembered me of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-circular_evaluator][Meta-circular evaluators]] which fit the self-reference theme.

- On p. 96 at the end of the first paragraph, why is "a tortoise talking football an anomaly, of course"? This bugs me as above he talks about worlds with square circles, things that can be both green and not green etc. but dismisses this immediately.

- In the dialog, why is it a Majotaur? Mino*r* vs Majo*r* <-> Minotaur vs Majotaur? I am note sure what the pun is about.

--------------

Dialog questions, I agree with most of what you say, some additional points:

2) Like [[/u/rspeer]] this also starts to bug me. Why is it even Hexachlorophene? I looked up the chemical structure but besides the two 'OH' nothing struck me as solution.

3) [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinn][Wikipedia]] also says:

#+begin_quote
  They are mentioned frequently in the Quran (the 72nd sura is titled SÅ«rat al-Jinn) and other Islamic texts and inhabit an unseen world called Djinnestan, *another universe beyond the known universe*.
#+end_quote

Might be relevant as well.

4) Unfortunately I didn't read Alice in Wonderland, can you provide a little more context what you mean? It sounds interesting :)

5) I agree with you that paradoxes would not be possible (not theorems), because consistency requires that they come out *true* which is not possible as in "this sentence is false".

6) Weasels are always the clever/playful ones aren't they?

7) No idea, but there has to be some connection.

8) Unsolved mystery. With the gondola and the gondoljer I somehow thought of Venice, but I don't know if that makes sense in this context.

9) /ex-falso quodlibet/?

10) Can't think of more than you said, anyone else?

11) One possible reation with assembly programming: If you call a procedure, you typically *push* arguments onto the stack, the procedure *pops* them and does something. When finished it *pushes* the result on the stack and returns to the callee, which can then *pop* the result from the stack.

So Achilles calls the wish procedure by pushing it's argument (the wish) on the stack. The genie receives the wish and again pushes the wish on the stack and so on until finally GOD does something and pushes the result (answer) on the stack, which is popped from the meta^{n} genie until the result comes back to Achilles.

(It's been a while since doing anything in assembly so you might want to take this with a grain of salt)

12) I actually thought more about the relation between the different layers of stories. The current story told is the object-language and the outer layer above is the meta-layer for this one, which becomes explicit on p. 124 where the Tortoise speaks in the meta-language about the object-language (the current story).

13) I am confused about the gender because on p. 111 in starts with: "*He* /rubs the Meta-Lamp/" and below the Meta-Genie it goes like this: "... /this Meta-Genie removes the wispy folds of/ *her* /robe.../". So the gender changes.

14) I couldn't think of an explanation but your hint about infinite stuff in finite time and limits made it more clear, thanks!

17) I think the overview section in the wikia explains it:

#+begin_quote
  The frame story, instead of finishing as expected, is left open, so the reader is left dangling without resolution. One nested story concerns modulation in music---particularly an organ piece which ends in the wrong key, leaving the listener dangling without resolution.
#+end_quote

18) I believe there must be a little more to the connection...
