That's so sweet. :) I got a little misty reading that.

You may want to read [[http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/156784.Permutation_City][Permutation City]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5389450/1/The-Finale-of-the-Ultimate-Meta-Mega-Crossover][The Ultimate Finale of the Meta Mega Crossover]], and [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/264090/1/the-clarity-of-darkness/the-clarity-of-darkness][The Clarity of Darkness]] (cw: ponies). I don't think there's anything explicitly about quantum/Tegmark/anthropic immortality in them except for The Clarity of Darkness, however.
