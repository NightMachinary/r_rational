Ahh, are we talking about dreams?

This morning, I had a dream where I was at a magic school. I remember knowing that the magic was roughly elemental-based, but I don't think there was ever a really good explanation. I remember that the air/lightbender people were followed around by giant Strange-and-Norrell-style tunnels of turbulent light, stretching to the heavens, and someone joked about how this impeded their ability to sneak away from their parents. Anyway.

I was in the science classroom -- which just so happened to be my real-life biology classroom from high school -- and a guy brought in a magical object. Now, magical objects are Discovered, not Invented; while not Rare, they are Unusual and require Certain Masterie. Ahem. Specifically, it was a dark sphere, like a black crystal ball, and when you touched it, it shot out a beam of light opposite your fingertip.

"Shot out" is a bit of a strange word. It more ... refracted the light, in an odd sort of loose, scattered pattern, like ... well, a lot like light scattered through a window in my old childhood house.

Anyway, when you focused the light -- which was done by only touching the sphere with one fingertip (it came with a stand, although I was holding it, so it was a bit cumbersome) -- it deposited a button-sized diamond at where the light hit the wall. It would materialize and fall to the floor. I remember I was standing in the hall of my high-school while the dude was in the classroom spinning all this mumbo-jumbo about how he could hear the colors of the light, etc. And I gave the first few gems to the passers-by, because I recognized them as quite expensive, and I was in a charitable mood. But then I timed the orb and realized it deposited them at a rate of 1 jewel every 10 seconds, and we should stockpile the jewels so as to not flood the market.

So thanks, [[/r/rational]]. You've ruined my fantasy dreams with your rational economics. /stews in corner, looking for diamonds around bedroom/
