The gun was a figure of speech, but I partially agree. On the scale of the universe it /could/ be possible to orchestrate such a suicide event that would end successfully in /all/ universes, but you (your overself) would never know until you tried.

One could say that extreme overkills like building a spaceship and flying into a black hole's event horizon would definitely work. However, when we're dealing with an additional dimension that revolves solely around your survival \ anthropic principle, I can see even that not working in all universes.

You wouldn't even have to consider universes with laws dissimilar to ours. The point of failure would just move further back in time. That is, the moment your spaceship reached the point of no return --- when in any possible outcome you were still guaranteed to die --- that branch of timeline would simply die out from your perspective. Your selves would only experience universes in which your spaceship wasn't even able to leave the planet (for various reasons), and so on.
