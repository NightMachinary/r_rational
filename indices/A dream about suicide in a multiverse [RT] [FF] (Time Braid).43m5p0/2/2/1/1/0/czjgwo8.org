No, different versions of the “same” consciousness don't communicate with each other at all --- in what /I/ was describing, at least (the already mentioned /Transdimensional Brain Chip/ works differently, for example). The ones that die simply cease existing, and the ones that failed at suicide continue experiencing a universe where events of seemingly unbelievable odds keep happening.

edit: Imagine, for instance, a person who's trying to defuse a hollywood bomb. Cutting the wrong cord will kill him, the right one will neutralise the devise. So in universes where he cuts the wrong cord, there is no opportunity for him to experience anything further --- those universes stop existing for him. In those, however, where he chose correctly, the versions of his self continue experiencing the world. So from their perspective they never died at all, they just chose the right cord to cut.

In a similar manner, if a character was forced to guess 1 correct option out of 10^{n} to not die (offered guns, rigged mines or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube_%28film%29][/Cube/]]-style rooms --- whatever), only the “lucky” version of him would have the opportunity to continue experiencing the world post-choice.
