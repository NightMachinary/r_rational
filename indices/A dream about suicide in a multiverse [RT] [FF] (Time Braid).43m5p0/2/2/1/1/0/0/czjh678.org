The communication part was what prompted me to post those questions because any form where the consciousness goes back in time after death would require such. But if one is to follow the premise that subjective death is impossible because one always subjectively continues wherever one, well, still exists in the first place then the break-off point can't really be in a point in time that happens before one would permanently lose consciousness. Anything else would require that whoever manages to reach the hypothetical point of no return by constructing the perfect suicide machine would have to lose consciousness right then and there without actually firing said machine.
