I think we are talking having different things in mind.

In the model I'm describing the consciousness doesn't go back in time. In context of OP's story and its discussion, the viewer's perspective just shifts to other versions of the same conciousness who were in universes where their spaceship never left the earth (for example).

In case of OP it was a demon who got protected by the divine forces, in case of book readers it's protagonists who manage to survive and win against incredible odds (so we don't even hear the story of the version that succeeded in launching their ship into a black hole).

In case of someone who's trying to kill themselves and always failing it would be because the ones that didn't fail and died just had nothing to experience as a success.
