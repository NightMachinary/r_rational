  that branch of timeline would simply die out from your perspective. Your selves would only experience universes in which your spaceship wasn't even able to leave the planet (for various reasons), and so on.

Except that the whole point is that your flow of consciousness is preserved by the compatible points in the multiverse, no? What would happen to "you" in your scenario? Would it seem like you were transported back in time from the "suicide event horizon"? Would any sort of consciousness be lost the moment your death becomes assured, making the "you" that has achieved creating a device for perfect suicide automatically into a p-zombie? I find it more probable that you get transported into whatever parallel universe could prevent your death due to differing laws of physics.
