Weird question, but, IRL, are you female? If not, also note that it's interesting that you dreamed as a different gender than you identify as. I've had one dream like that once (dreamed I was a different gender); interestingly, in that dream, I was two people sharing one body. One of me could make us go up, the other could make us go down, and that way, we could fly.
