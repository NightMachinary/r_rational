No, it's fine. Like I said, it's fanfiction. You can use whatever ideas you want however you want to use them. I can't, shouldn't, and wouldn't restrict that. You should write whatever you want. And if it really is coincidence then you don't even have to credit me at all. You thought it up on your own. You don't owe me anything, and I wouldn't want you to demean your own creativity by giving up credit four an idea you produced yourself.

If you feel like doing a favor (again, zero obligations), if you do write something with these ideas, send me a link?
