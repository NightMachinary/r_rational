I think a interesting take on Batman would be if he is a time traveler from the future.

How does he know where crime takes place? He has future knowledge! (Plus future surveillance equipment)

How does he fight crime? Future gadgets!

How does he have a successful business? Easy, when you have future tech to reproduce.
