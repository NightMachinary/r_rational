Batman is solving the same problem as Lex Luthor

The obvious critique of Batman is that he's the World's Best long term planner. And so he spends a billion dollars on a really great car that let's him arrive in time to punch criminals in the face.

This gets sillier when you introduce the Justice Leage. At some point it should be better for everyone to just have some B-lister go deal with Scarecrow, if only to free up batman's time.

A potential answer is that Batman, like Luthor, realized that humanity must not be ruled by a class of flying gods. Luthors approach was to bring one God to earth. Batman wants to prove that humans can fly.

He considered philanthropy. And, somewhere in the bat cave there's the model of the gleaming Gotham that could have been.

Instead of saving that one city, he set up a decades long plot that starts with him dressing as a bat to establish himself as a low level superhero.

The plot ends with the Justice League, the organization that every flying God fights to join, in which Batman - an unaugmented human - is the clear first among equals.

Luthor dragged a God down to man's level. Batman won so hard that the gods willingly land to kneel in supplication before their better.
