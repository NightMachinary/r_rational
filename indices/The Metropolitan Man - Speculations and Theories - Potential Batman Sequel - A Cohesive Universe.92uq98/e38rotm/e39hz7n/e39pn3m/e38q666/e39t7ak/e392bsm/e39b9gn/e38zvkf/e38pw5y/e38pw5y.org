I'm not going to accuse you of stealing credit for the ideas, because it's remotely possible we just had very similar ideas, or that you'd read my comment and forgotten where the concepts came from. But I did post an extremely similar premise in a thread here:

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/31vyqj/are_there_any_fanfics_or_continuations_for_the/cq5wtep/]]

And if you did get the idea from me, intentionally or otherwise, I would appreciate not being cut out of the acknowledgement. You're of course free to write using whatever ideas you like. It's fanfiction. But give ideas that aren't yours their proper citations.
