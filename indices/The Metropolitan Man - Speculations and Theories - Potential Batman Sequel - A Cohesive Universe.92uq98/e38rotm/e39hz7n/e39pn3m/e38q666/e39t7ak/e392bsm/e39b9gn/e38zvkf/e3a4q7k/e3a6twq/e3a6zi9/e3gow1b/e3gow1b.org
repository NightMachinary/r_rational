Not really what I ment.

I must have read another ghoulish fic, where Lex renders Superman's body down to a kind of paste, then he keeps adding Kryptonite until for every 1 atom of Superman there's 2 atoms of Kryptonite.

Then he bury's the remains in a remote wasteland, labels it as a dump for radioactive waste.
