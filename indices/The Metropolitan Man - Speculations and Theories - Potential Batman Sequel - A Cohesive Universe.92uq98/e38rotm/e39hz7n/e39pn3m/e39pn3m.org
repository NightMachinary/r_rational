I don't think Bizarro is a good idea for a Metropolitan Man sequel.

Lex had every reason to suspect that Superman was a good guy, had every reason to believe that he'd never choose to destroy the world. His problem was never with who /held/ the power of Superman, it was that such power existed at all. Unless he could engineer exactly a zero percent chance (not just infinitesimal but /nonexistent/) that Bizarro would end up destroying the world, I can't see him doing it. And I can't see the odds of cataclysmic power being used /not/ getting higher after that power is created than they are when they power is nonexistent.

Now, Lex creating a new Superman or Bizarro /after/ Zod arrives, as a last-ditch resort to avoid annihilation, /that/ might be something he'd do. But to raise the risk of annihilation for the reason of improving mankind's lot? That's a line of reasoning he explicitly discarded in Metropolitan Man.
