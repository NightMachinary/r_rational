Haven't gotten that far. Is good to know. I always /did/ get irritated at it being "Rage" and not just "Anger". Anger nowadays seems to be portrayed as a bad thing, but like avarice, it can be a motivating force for good. Most of the initial 'nonstandard' Lanterns were introduced more as the caricatures of their emotions in the comics rather than the reasonable approach this fic is taking.
