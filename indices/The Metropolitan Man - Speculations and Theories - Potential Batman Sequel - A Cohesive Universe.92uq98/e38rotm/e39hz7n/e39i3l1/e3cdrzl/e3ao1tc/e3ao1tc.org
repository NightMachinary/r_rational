I can't upvote this thing enough.

I'm not very far along (I notice it starts by following one of the Young Justice animated series so far), but the way the main character keeps himself in line and somewhat humble (except when it comes to other Lanterns) is refreshing. The story is like a rational, good natured comic nerd doing his best to help the common people in a universe where everything is about the heroes.

It may be self-insert, but this is better in every way that the Metropolitan Man, and I'm loving it. Even the central conceit that "avarice" isn't by definition a bad thing, but something that can be harnessed for the greater good is both optimistic and rationally executed.
