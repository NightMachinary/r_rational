  I've been thinking about having my Batman sequel have Batman use a Green Lantern Corp power ring. Which would allow me to expand into the wider DC universe.

  [...]

  With my Batman Sequel I'd like to use it as a Segway into a larger cohesive universe that slowly becomes an alternate DC Universe.

This was alrealdy written. Kinda.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.25076/][With This Ring]] is a SI Young Justice fic, in which the MC, a reasonably rational character, wakes up orbiting DC's Earth 16 with a Orange Ring on his finger. He then proceeds to uplift the entire human race by mass producing more of all those one-ofs arcanotechnology and schizo tech gadgets randomly invented by superheroes and supervilains. The author has enciclopedic knowledge of obscure DC trivia and the SI retains all of it and uses for his advantage, all while linking to wiki pages so you can also learn about that B list Wonder Woman rogue from the 60s that popped up, or that weird one-shot floating tentacly face henchman that just appeared in canon twice in the 70s . It updates daily and has been going on since 2013. The guy is a machine.

The style is completely different and much more comedic than Metropolitan Man was, tho.
