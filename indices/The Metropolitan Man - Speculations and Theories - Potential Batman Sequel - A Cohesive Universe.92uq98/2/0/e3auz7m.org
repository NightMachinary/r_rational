  Now, Lex creating a new Superman or Bizarro after Zod arrives, as a last-ditch resort to avoid annihilation, that might be something he'd do. But to raise the risk of annihilation for the reason of improving mankind's lot? That's a line of reasoning he explicitly discarded in Metropolitan Man.

I always thought this kind of thing (what about when other supers show up?) was the most interesting direction for a /Metropolitan Man/ sequel. Assuming that only Superman exists loses you a lot of the best arguments for allowing the existence of superheroes.

If Superman is the only person with superpowers, it might be worth it to trade the .0001% risk he becomes evil for the loss of his value as a crimefighter (or whatever he might end up doing). But if there are other superheros or super villains out there (like Wonder Woman, or Green Lantern, or Brainiac, or Zod), the calculus changes. On the one hand, it's easier to stop a rogue Superman if you have access to Martian Manhunter or the Flash. On the other hand, the existence of Doomsday or Darkseid means that /not/ having access to all the human-aligned supers you can might be an existential threat itself.

Exploring those questions is interesting, particularly now that Luther has killed Superman. How does he respond to the appearance Zatanna or Cyborg? How does he convince them to work with him against a White Martian invasion when they find out he killed Superman?
