I think you could do a rational Batman if you played up the "World's Greatest Detective" angle (which the movies, so far, have sadly neglected).

In a city with a corrupt police force, one man puts on a mask to solve the crimes the police won't.

Showing how he'd deal with stuff like chain-of-custody and Constitutional rights so that the evidence actually stands up in court would be a bonus.

Of course, he couldn't actually beat anyone up (much), because, again, brutality by someone in the role of a state actor violates all kinds of rights, but, beyond that, I don't see why a rational, World's Greatest Detective Batman story wouldn't work.
