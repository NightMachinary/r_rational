I dont think you can really do a rational take on Batman without betraying the spirit of the character.

In some ways the premise of Batman is even more absurd and irrational then that of Superman. Some peak level human no matter how rich is not going to be a relevent threat to many of the top tier characters in the DCverse. Of course in many ways Batman and Lex Luthor are audience stand ins so they are made to be supernaturally competent in order to deal with the rest of the aliens/gods/wizards of the DCverse.
