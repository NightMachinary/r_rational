  Some peak level human no matter how rich is not going to be a relevent threat to many of the top tier characters in the DCverse.

Given what is possible through superpowers in the DCverse though, the same ought to be possible through science. So a sufficiently smart character (ok, we're already going into preternaturally smart since they become all-knowing gadgeteers, but) could probably have access to all manner of powerful weapons and defences.
