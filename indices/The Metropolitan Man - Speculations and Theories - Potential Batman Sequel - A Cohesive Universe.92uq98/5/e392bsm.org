I think "Batman" is up there with "Zombies", "AI box metaphor" and "Portal to a heroic fantasy world" in concepts that have already been explored to death, with every single twist and genre exploration and alternate interpretation having already been done.

Batman in space? In Japan? In a gritty realistic future? In a cyberpunk cartoon future? In Elizabethan England? Punching criminals because he's incapable of letting go of his grief? Or because of a wel thought-out plan to desincentivize violent crime? Every single one of these concepts has already been explored by amazingly popular writers.
