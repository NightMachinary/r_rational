Lol.

They forgot a rule or two.

Rule 11: Thou shall not continue the debate after there are no supporting arguments left to make that have not already been stated clearly. (don't waste others' time)

Rule 12: Thou shall clearly state your arguments as coherent, comprehensible, specific, testable hypotheses. (must be falsifiable to be debatable)

It seems unlikely that they'd be able to come up with ALL the rules of rational debate AND that they just happen to be the same number of rules as the bible's ten commandments? I think whoever wrote this might have stopped looking for possible rules of rational debate the moment they reached ten.
