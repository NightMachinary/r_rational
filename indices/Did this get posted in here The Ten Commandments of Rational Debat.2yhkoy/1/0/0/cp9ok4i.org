Yeah, I also just see the image... it's just annoying to me that it's an image and not just plain text. I couldn't copy-paste it, and everyone knows there's nothing more important than my brief moment of annoyance.

I don't think there's a way to change it, now that it's posted, but I'm not 100% sure.
