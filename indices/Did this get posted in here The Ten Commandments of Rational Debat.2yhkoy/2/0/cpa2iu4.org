Obviously, that is excluded from the fallacy of false dichotomy. But a discussion usually isn't about wether something is true or false. In those cases there may be 2 options or there may be more.

Rather than reduce the argument to 2 possibilities, I would say that you shouldn't state/think/defend a position must be accepted as true just because an incompatible one is accepted as false.
