Around 50%, but with a low certainty. It's been a few months since I saw that thread, and the thing that convinced me the most is that he's publicly called on other people to keep it a mystery, and not to confirm or deny being the author. It's the sort of thing that fits very neatly with a model of EY who wrote something anonymously and wants to keep it that way, but doesn't fit that well if he's not the author, imo. I could be wrong though.
