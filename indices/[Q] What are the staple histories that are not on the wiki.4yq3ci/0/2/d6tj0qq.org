Well, I usually reference vague suspicious posts by Eliezer every time the Waves Arisen topic comes up on [[/r/rational]], thus implying that I believe it to be him, and perhaps increasing the impression of community consensus on the the authorship. But of course I would never take an explicit stance on my true suspicions.

Of course it isn't impossible. This is Eliezer "Pet Rock" "Alicorn Princess" Yudkowsky we're talking about.
