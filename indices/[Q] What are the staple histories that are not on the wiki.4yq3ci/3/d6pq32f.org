I would highly recommend "Significant Digits" and "Draco and the Practice of Rationality". There's also EY's earlier fiction, "Three Worlds Collide".

Anything by alexanderwhales; "The Metropolitan Man", "Shadows of the Limelight", "Glimwarden" (currently being written).

Also commonly listed are Wildbow's "Worm" and "Twig" (and for some of us, "Pact").
