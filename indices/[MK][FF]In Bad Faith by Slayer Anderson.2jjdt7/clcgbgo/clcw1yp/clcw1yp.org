I would read a fic about a rational Anderson trying to figure out how the hell Alucard was beaten the first time.

The Nazis already seem like they might be rational, though we never got to see their planning phase that led up to their ultimate plan, so we can't know for sure.

Obviously Alucard doesn't need to be rational, hes the OP final boss already.
