I read this a while back. My primary criticisms:

- Too much of a Mary Sue MC with relatively little justification
- Plot advances fairly slowly (word count almost as long as Harry Potter and the PS, but very little has happened of any note or importance). Doesn't really feel like it gets anywhere.

Things I liked:

- Reasonably interesting/nuanced portrayal of Wizarding and Pureblood Wizarding World.
- Writing was mechanically OK.

Overall, not a great fic but certainly there are far worse out there. Given the glacially slow update rate since the initial flurry of posting on ff.net and spacebattles, and the lack of story progress so far, I feel it's gonna take a /very/ long time in realtime before it gets really going.
