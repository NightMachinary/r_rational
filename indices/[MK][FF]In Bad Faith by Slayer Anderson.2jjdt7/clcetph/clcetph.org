Have read through ~Ch 5 of the rewrite. I agree with the other commenters who have said that the plot advances slowly, and that the author seems interested in portraying pureblood society over plot. But I'm actually enjoying these elements--it's nice to see some (at least superficially) well-thought-out worldbuilding, and we all know roughly how the plot is going to go anyway. I'm sure I'll be annoyed when I get to the end of the story and not much has happened, but for now I'm enjoying it. Thanks for the link, rilianus!
