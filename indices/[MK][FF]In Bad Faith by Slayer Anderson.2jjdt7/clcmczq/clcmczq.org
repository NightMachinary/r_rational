So there've been several negative reviews of this so far. Definitely agree it progresses very slowly- despite 70k words so far, the protagonist hasn't reached Hogwarts. And the other big concern is that the main character is a Mary Sue. Personally, I enjoy the fairly detailed account of magical high society, so the former could just be a taste issue. As for being Marry Sue, when one takes into account that the character was a diligent grad student in another life, combined with a child's facility for languages and the sort of political-oriented education provided to a Malfoy... It's possible, but maybe a minor stretch. Personally I didn't think it broke suspension of disbelief.

So yeah, mainly just slow- does anyone know how regularly this gets updated?
