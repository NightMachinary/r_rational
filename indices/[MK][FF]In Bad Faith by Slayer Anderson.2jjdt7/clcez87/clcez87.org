The main problem I have with this fic is the Mary sue main character. For some reason she seems to amazingly talented in everything. From runework to fencing to social combat to learning old English etc. Its just too much.

I know this is suppose to be justified because the main character is a SI which means that she has the body of a child and the mind of an adult. But unless the character as an adult had the drive and raw talent to master several languages and become an expert in 5 different fields then that doesn't hold water.

There was this scene where the SI was shopping for books and ran into hermoine and her parents. The SI proceeds to lecture them about the wizarding world and how they should act etc. That scene was so ridiculous, it madee want to roll my eyes.

Sorry for making this so long but I think this could have a lot of potential. If the main character was toned down a lot and picked up the pace s bit it could be pretty good.
