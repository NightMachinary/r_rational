There are a lot of different things that come underneath a 'rational' umbrella. If you let us know more about what sort of books you like, it might be useful to get something more closely calibrated to your specific tastes.

That said...

[[http://unsongbook.com/][/Unsong/]] by Scott Alexander is a funny but also quite interesting book (with a few extremely dark sections). It's like Douglas Adams (/Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy/) in some respects, but also bears some resemblance to Robert Anton Wilson (/The Illuminatus! Trilogy/) in places.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/56ndwt/rtrepost_everything_by_ted_chiang/][Short Stories]] by Ted Chiang are fantastically written; each story is centered around a new idea and suggests a ton of interesting things. One of his stories became the science fiction film /Arrival/; all of them are worth reading.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/users/Benedict_SC/pseuds/Benedict_SC][Benedict]] has written a couple longer novels; CORDYCEPS is a horror-themed rationalist-adjacent story that is both wonderful and deeply horrifying while being fully original, while The World As It Appears To Be is a fanfic piece that uses Overwatch's characters and background as a starting point to go towards entirely new places.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/users/nostalgebraist/pseuds/nostalgebraist][Nostalgebraist]] wrote two different stories that are of particular interest; The Northern Caves is an original epistolary story of horror that is very weird and difficult to explain but very worthwhile, while Floornight has some thematic similarities to Neon Genesis Evangelion but is otherwise original and also extremely weird and good.
