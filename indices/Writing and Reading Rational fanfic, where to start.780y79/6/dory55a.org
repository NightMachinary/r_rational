Some things I've tried to keep in mind while (occasionally :v) writing my own ratfic are the tenets on the sidebar:

The plot should be driven by consequences, the characters by their motivations, and the world should be consistent. There isn't a lot more to it, really, but it's harder to pull off than it might seem.

A good example is what I call the "Captain Planet" principle - that nobody actually does evil just for its own sake, and those characters that do aren't usually very compelling. Nobody is going to make the planet radioactive just for the sheer heck of it. A level further is that while you CAN make a villain out of pure nihilism - i.e. "this world is beyond saving/has nothing of worth in it/WHY DIDN'T YOU LOVE ME JENOVA" - that's not much better than the 'for the hell of it" option. imo, a good villain should seek to change the world just like a good protagonist would - according to their values and ideals. Everyone is the hero of their own story - even in a story ;D

Sorry if this is a little (a lot) rambling, but I've been thinking about this sort of thing a lot lately.
