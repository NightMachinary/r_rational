It depends on what you like. If you like epic novel length masterpieces, my first recommendation would probably be Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, although the protagonist is a bit unlikable early in the story and he doesn't act like a normal eleven year old for spoilery reasons so YMMV. That one has an audio version though which is convenient.

Some other epic novel-length works that might be good to start out with:

Luminosity

Pokemon: the Origin of Species

Animorphs: the Reckoning

Strong Female Protagonist

Worm
