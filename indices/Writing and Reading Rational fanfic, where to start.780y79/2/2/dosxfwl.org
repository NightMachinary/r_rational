I tried hpmor and got about 30 chapters in

I couldn't suspend disbelief, not only was Harry thoroughly unlikable even at that point, it seemed too... Forced. Everything happening so conveniently

And the whole story wrapping up in such a short space of time rather than 7 years and on such an odd cliffhanger left a weird taste in my mouth. Very uncomfortable.

For people who are already into SciFi/scifa, I'd suggest mother of learning and worth the candle, absolutely fantastically written believable characters and actions.. just a bit Blueball being incomplete lol
