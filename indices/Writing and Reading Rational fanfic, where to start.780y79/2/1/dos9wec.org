Note that Origin of Species is a work in progress (updates about every month, I think), and very slow paced - but lots of people, myself included, find it enjoyable enough not to worry too much about plot speed, so YMMV.

It definitely leans toward the rationalist camp rather than mere rational, demonstrating and exploring techniques of planning, critical thinking, etc. A bit like HPMoR, except gentler, less of a "frustrated with the world" vibe.
