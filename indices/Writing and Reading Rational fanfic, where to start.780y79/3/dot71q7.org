/A Practical Guide to Evil/ is a fairly interesting piece because it deals, first of all, with medieval fantasy in a refreshingly well-researched manner, second because it deals /explicitly/ with narrativium, the dichotomy between Good/Evil and virtue/consequence ethics, and third because it is not about exploiting magic but rather exploiting /politics./

As for things to keep in mind: you should really, /really/ learn about realpolitik/power politics. A good way to familiarize yourself with it is to play the board game /Diplomacy./ Ask yourself (often about the villain) "How can this person obtain power? How can they hold power? How can they deny power to others?"
