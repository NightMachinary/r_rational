HPMoR is the usual recommendation. It's pretty good but don't expect much in the way of storytelling, it's mostly a vehicle for Yudkowsky to spread his ideas. Metropolitan Man and Worm are a lot less teaching oriented, and not as hard-rational, but they're some of my favorite works of fiction ever, and are pretty good reads.
