So you liked a story but didn't enjoy the story part of it? What part of it did you enjoy then?

Personally I think HPMOR has pretty great story telling and it's main flaws are 1. Lack of Dudley 2.0 to contrast to adult-intellect HJPEV leading to extreme reader confusion and uncanny valley sensation because they think Harry is supposed to be a genuine eleven year old, 2. the filler; things could be a lot more streamlined if the plot didn't take so many detours, and 3. While some of HJPEV's monologues fit into the story well (such as the one about Milgram's experiments), others feel tacked on (such as the one about family court systems). I think EY might have thought as long as he could tie it back into the story it would fit just fine, but unfortunately things don't work that way.

It should come up in the story naturally /first/ and then you find a way to turn it into a valuable lesson for the reader. If you start with a lesson and then try to work it into the story it doesn't feel as natural. Of course, all things considered I only really realized this because I read HPMOR, so I can hardly blame EY for not realizing it either.
