Yes, and if Pinkie Pie and Rarity are making money this way, then they should keep producing and searching out those marginal ponies until that stops becoming profitable.

It is the /marginal/ cost which should equal the /marginal/ revenue. The marginal unit being the unit you are making a choice about. The point is that if MR > MC, keep going, if MR < MC back up, and if MR = MC, then things are just right. This doesn't mean that you should charge a thousand bits for that first dress, /but/ if you /are/ going to make only one dress, then you had better be able to sell it for at least a thousand bits or it wasn't worth making....

This will all be gone over in more detail and consideration in future chapters. Indeed, maybe I will just steal these examples.
