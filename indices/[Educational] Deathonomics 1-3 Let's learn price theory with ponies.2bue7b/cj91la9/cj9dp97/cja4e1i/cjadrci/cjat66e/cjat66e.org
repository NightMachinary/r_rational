Look, I live on a sensible, spherical planet that turns because of angular momentum and has a moon (and an orbit around the sun, causing seasons) because of gravity, on which I live with an emotion of love that comes down to neurochemistry. Don't ask me how those nonsense-lands could possibly work.

But yes, they /literally/ raise and lower the sun and moon. As in, Nightmare Moon showing up /actually caused/ unending night. As in, Discord was actually capable of making the sun and moon bob up and down like a see-saw (but admittedly, the Q could probably at least make an illusion that this was happening in /any/ world, even a sensible one like ours). As in, when Twilight Sparkle was given all the alicorn magic one time (latest season), and she /accidentally failed to set her alarm clock/, she slept in /and the sun did not rise until she woke up and rectified her mistake/.

In their ancient history, before having alicorn princesses to play demi-god for them, the entire unicorn tribe actually had to band together to raise the sun every morning with /collective telekinesis/.

DON'T ASK ME HOW THOSE THINGS COULD EVEN POSSIBLY HAVE EVOLVED IN THE FIRST PLACE IF THERE WAS NO SUNLIGHT PRIOR TO THEIR SPECIES EXISTING. Honestly, the best explanation /is/ a straightforwardly /Hogfather/-ish one, that prior to ponies evolving to be the most sapient/intelligent species on the (flat) planet, the sun and moon moved on their own, but their belief in their own primitive mythology mixed with the strong background magical field to make the normal orbits /stop working/ without deliberate action.

This would explain why their sun and moon move across the sky /just fine/ all day and night, but then need to be "raised" or "lowered" at dawn and dusk.
