I would be interested in comments on how successful this story is from a pedagogical perspective, and also generally. I can tell a lot of economics-themed pony stories and indeed have planned quite a few, but there is little point if people can't take much of this. What interests and works for you about this story, what doesn't, how could it be better and more interesting, etc.?
