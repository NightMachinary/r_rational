All of the economics you've explained so far have been okay, but it would have been better, for me anyway, if you used more practical examples in explaining the theory, I have trouble understanding why marginal cost rises, when i assume that a factory would get proficient at making a product. I enjoy the short comedic parts and subtle references. 501st unit. Haha!
