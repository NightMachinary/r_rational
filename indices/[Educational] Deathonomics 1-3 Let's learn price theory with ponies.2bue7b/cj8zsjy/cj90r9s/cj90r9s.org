You're targeting a niche of a niche. So don't be surprised if your readership is low.

And I imagine that most of your target audience is generally busy. I'm only catching up with the tail end of Economic is Science now.

It's certainly expanded my vocabulary. Most of the economics lessons are already apparent. Not that I have any real specialized economics knowledge. Although I do dabble. Mostly it's because of generic lesswrong stuff.

I think you could do a lot with footnotes. "Have I ever told you about how pencils are made" demans a more thorough explanation.
