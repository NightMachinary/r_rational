Suppose I'm Rarity, and I have to pay 1000 bits for dressmaking equipment before making my first dress - the cost of my first dress is 1000 bits. But then the marginal cost of further dresses is very low, maybe 5 bits. If I sell dresses at 6 bits, sure I don't lose money per dress, but that doesn't make it profitable to be a dressmaker, since the cost of the first dress was so high - I'd rather just loan my 1000 bits to Rainbow Dash.

But if selling at below, say, 30 bits means it's not profitable to be a dressmaker, this means that if I, Rarity, charge 30 bits, ponies with 1000 bits lying around will not be willing to become dressmakers to try and undercut me at 29 bits. Therefore I can raise my prices to 30 bits without anypony undercutting me and causing me to lose business. And since I can, I should, so long as other ponies keep buying my dresses enough to make each increase in price profitable.

Or suppose I'm Pinkie Pie, and I know everypony in town. The marginal cost of a cupcake is 1.5 bits, so if a pony is poor or doesn't like cupcakes much I charge them 2 bits. But if they really like cupcakes or can afford it, I know they'll pay even if I ask them for 3 or 4 or sometimes even 5 bits! Everyone pays a price they're happy with and I make way more bits than if I just asked everyone for the same price.
