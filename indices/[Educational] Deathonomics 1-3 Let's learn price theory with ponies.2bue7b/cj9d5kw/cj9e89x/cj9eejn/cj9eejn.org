If we are analyzing the profit-maximizing firm, then we assume it is profit-maximized, which means it is /stopped/ (at this point in time) because it is already doing the best it can, which means MR = MC. If MR /=/ MC, then the firm would be wanting to do more or less of something /right now/. Understand this as an incredibly useful analytical tool rather than a literal description. The real world is not so smooth and divisible, but this helps us explain what firms have done and helps us predict what they might do next.
