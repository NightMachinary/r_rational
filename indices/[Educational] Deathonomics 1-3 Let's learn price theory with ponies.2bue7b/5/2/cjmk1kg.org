I found it a great review of stuff I had learned from my basic economics class. However, for some of the more esoteric stuff like NGDP, the /in media res/ approach worked great for the sake of the story but not so well when it came to explaining what it is and why it's such a big deal.

I also have a bit of trouble understanding what Rainbow Dash is supposed to represent.
