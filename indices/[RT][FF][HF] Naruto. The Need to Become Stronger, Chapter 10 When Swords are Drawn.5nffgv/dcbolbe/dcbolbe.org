Thanks for the chapter. This part of the series always seemed to me like the author hadn't quite decided in which direction to take his story, that he was still laying out the setting and presenting it to the audience. Zabuza in particular, just seemed so different from what his reputation and history suggested he should have been like, as described much further on. So all in all, it's not a part I particularly enjoyed, in the original story.

But you're doing a good job making it interesting. Keep it up!
