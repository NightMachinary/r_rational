Cheers! I agree that this was when canon was still in its infancy, but maybe that's also the reason why it has a special place in my heart. This arc was when the story really grew into its own, and the fact that everything was still novel and you didn't have giant jutsu spam everywhere made it all the better for it. The show never really recaptured the magic of the original IMO, except in a few good fights/scenes like the one between Kakashi and Obito, where it really felt like it was a battle between two humans and not just living weapons.
