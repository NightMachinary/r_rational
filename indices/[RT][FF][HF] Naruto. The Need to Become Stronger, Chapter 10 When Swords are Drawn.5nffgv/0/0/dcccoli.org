Velorian did a rational Zabuza/Haku in Lighting up the Dark, but it was resolved more or less peacefully if I remember correctly. This act was actually the very first one I wrote, because I was just stuck on "what would a rationalist fight between ninjas look like?", and this arc was what I came up with. Very curious to see what you guys will make of it.

All in all, I'm just really happy that the overal response to this arc so far is positive. I was really worried I hadn't made it original enough, because as Yudkowsky once said "If you write a Naruto fanfic, you should skip the wave arc unless you have something really original planned". But I guess I also know now what he meant when he said "experience has shown that I have no idea which chapters my audience will like and which they won't."
