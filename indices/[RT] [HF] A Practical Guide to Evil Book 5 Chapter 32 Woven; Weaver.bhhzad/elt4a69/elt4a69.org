[I have blatantly copy pasted this comment, but I wanted more people to read it]

Oh this chapter. This chapter. This was amazing. Just flat out amazing. But let me explain the highlights

First of all, kairos is a combo of traitorous and irritant reincarnated, mixed the spirit of goblin kind and just a /dash/ of kids show villainy, and then let loose on creation for belows eternal laughter

Second, looks like everyone was right, it is the dead king hijacking heirophant, personally I was expecting some sort of demon for now and then the dead king takes full control, but this is fine (insert dog in fire meme here)

Third, cat had that moment of satisfaction every great schemer has at one point or another. The satisfaction that your plan has come together even more perfectly than you expected

Fourth, I am /extremely/ curious as to what kairos planned to do with a hijacked half hell/half Arcadia shard, other than invade the hobbesian hellhole the dead king has cooked up, along with what the heirarch could do in the serenity, as frankly that many people learning the truth, plus his (most likely named) revolt aspect equals quite the interesting turn of events

Fifth And Finally, cat, the pilgrim, the rogue sorcerer, the saint, and kairos all in a heroic band will prove to be extremely interesting and fun to read. I expect betrayal, heroic charges, redemption, and of course typical antics that come with kairos being in the general area

Also the slight pause after the first story was perfect

Also also this killing a god thing is partially a reference to that old phrase "be they gods or kings or all the armies in creation" is it not?
