I'm still on the fence about that one. Neshama infecting Zeze with jsut the right ideas and mysteries through his own memories echoing in Arcadia would be quite the amazing time paradox, for one. Or maybe it was a very long-term dormant trap, laid in wait for the right circumstances, in which case the Woe's visit North triggered the deads' invasion ?

I still think Mazego is aware of at least some of this, and has a plan of his own.
