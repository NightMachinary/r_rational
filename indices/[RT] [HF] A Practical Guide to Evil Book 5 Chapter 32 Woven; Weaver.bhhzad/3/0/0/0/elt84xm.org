I very much doubt that anyones going to want to give the race of murderpriests an entire shard of arcadia to live in.

My bet is that Cat haggles Pilgrim/Hasenbach into giving them some Principalities bordering the Kingdom of the Dead (Maybe Hainut/Cleves but more likely Hannoven/Rhenia/Bremen+maybe Neustria)
