As of the prologue the border north of Hannoven had already fallen, and since Hasenbach decided to send what she had available to reinforce cleves/+hannoven+Hainut instead there are only garrisons stopping the march south on the western front.

Additionally, all 4 principalities on that front are Hasenbachs, so if the drow reclaim it in the war and say "this is our land now" there are going to be no other princes demanding their lands back, and very few soldiers/refugees to put on public pressure.
