The Bard appeared to Andronike & Komena when they deified into Sve Noc, implying she's Intercessor for both the Gods Above and Below. I think both Above & Below have the Bard create/deepen Narratives just based on different "types" of Narratives. I do think Cat is acting to break the stories, but not as the Bard Below
