It's more like heroes only win due to deus ex machina, not due to using their brains. Now that they're facing someone who's genre savvy enough to block direct meddling by the Good gods, they're starting to lose badly because they're not used to having to think. IOW, evil stopped being stupid, good did not, therefore good is losing ground (or would be if Cat & co were actually Evil).
