He might be correct. Cognitohazards are dangerous to sense, so they trigger either when you see, hear, feel, smell, or taste something. Infohazards are dangerous just to know about.

So the issue here is that we don't know if it's dangerous just to know all the information in the Kabbalis Book of Darkness (making it an infohazard), or if it specifically triggers when you read (see) it (making it a cognitohazard).
