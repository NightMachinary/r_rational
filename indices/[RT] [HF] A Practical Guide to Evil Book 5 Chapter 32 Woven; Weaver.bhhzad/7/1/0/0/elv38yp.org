There's a few problems with this interpretation. Firstly, the heroes are only "stupid" if you think Cat and Black are typical examples of villains, when in reality we know that they're UNPRECEDENTED, and they're success is in large part because they do not act like typical villains. It's unfair to say that the heroes are stupid because they aren't as good as two villains who completely changed the game.

If you want a more accurate idea of what a typical villain would be, you're better of looking at the various opening quotes of the chapters. The typical villain doesn't institute systemic military reforms or surrender their army to heroes in order to force a favorable truce, they throw people into pits of man-eating tapirs and try to steal the weather. They're people who are so crazy that they bend the world to fit their madness, and with this in mind not only do the heroes compare much more favorably, but their actions also make more sense. Of course they're going to have a hard time negotiating or compromising with Cat. She's a villain, and with those you don't typically have that option. Can you imagine any negotiation between a hero and, for example, Akua (pre-Second Liesse) that actually ends with the hero getting what they want? Best case scenario is it all amounts to nothing, worst case Akua lies and cheats the hero, taking advantage of their attempt to deal with her in good faith. They have little reason to see Cat as any different, and what signs they do have are outweighed by the risks if she does turn out the same as every other villain.

With regards to the whole "Above only wins because they give idiots a deus ex machina," I think this is a pretty fundamental misunderstanding of the balance between Above and Below. Good doesn't always win because they cheat. In fact, Good doesn't always win, period. How many dozens of heroes has Black killed? No, it's not that Good always wins, it's that Evil always loses in the end, which is VERY different. Heroes age, villains don't. Heroes usually have a very specific goal, a villain to defeat or a wrong to right, while villains typically don't really have a win condition. There's usually nothing a villain can do that would make them say "Well, glad that's taken care of, now I can finally retire from this whole 'Dread Emperor' thing." A villain's story only ends when they lose, and so by definition they always lose in the end.

That's not to say that heroes don't tend to be favored in the matchup, but again, that's the balance between Above and Below. Below puts their finger on the scales to get the ball rolling. They empower a madman and give him a throne, and Above lets them, because that is their due. But Above then crafts a hero to end that villain and gets to nudge things to help make that happen, because that is /their/ due. Above is allowed favorable odds on the hero killing the Dread Emperor, because Below is allowed a Dread Emperor worth killing.
