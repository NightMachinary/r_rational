Prediction:

Cat's role in this is not as a member of a heroic band - she's in the running as the Below's Intercessor. Think about it. The Bard acts to keep stories on the rails - aka, under the guidance of the Gods (Above) - and Cat acts to break those stories, aka, returning that guidance to mortals, as the Gods Below desire. Which is the entire fight between the gods in the first place.

Instead, the Black Night restored is the fifth member of the heroic band.
