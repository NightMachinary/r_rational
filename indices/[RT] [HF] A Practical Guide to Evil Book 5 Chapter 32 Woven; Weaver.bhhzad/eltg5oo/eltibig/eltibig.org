Can we stop with this "Good is stoopid" interpretation? At its worst, Above is roughly as destructive as Below /on average/. The Good Gods may have given the mortals the guidelines to follow, but those guidelines also keep them from self-destructing. In contrast, the ethics we've seen the villains employ so far are almost entirely oriented towards empowering themselves.

Case in point, Below's position wasn't that mortals should be independent - it's to "guide them towards greater things", whatever those may be (where Above's influence is more beneficial towards the humanity /as it naturally is/, since they want to rule it as it is). Bard isn't Above's agent - she keeps the game going on both sides, as seen in the creation of Everdark. Sometimes it feels like I'm the only one around who sees the word "Evil" in the title. How do you even miss the entire ending of the previous book?
