'the desperate trick of a fox chewing through its own foot for fear of the night': should that be 'trap', as in Dune's Humanity Test? ('An inhuman would chew off its own limb to escape a trap, whereas a human could reason, endure, and fake death in order to surprise and kill the trapper')

It's unclear how chewing through your foot could be relevant as a 'trick' when faced with night, compared with as a trick for escaping when you've been caught in a trap (such as the Dead King's).
