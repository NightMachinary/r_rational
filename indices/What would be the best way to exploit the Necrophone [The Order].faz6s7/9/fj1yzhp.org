Also, depending on how this device would really work, it could settle the 'what is really death' debate.

There is still a dispute on how we should exacly define death and when exacly it happens. We could experiment with it and try to 'call' with this device a person who is dying at the moment and see when exacly he becomes 'callable'

Do you know that in someone with a dead cerebrum but a living brainstem spontaneous breathing may continue unaided?

Would this device allow me to communicate with people in Persistent Vegetative State? Because you know, they are basically brain dead
