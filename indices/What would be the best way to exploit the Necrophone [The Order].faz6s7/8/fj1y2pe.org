Do I only need name to ask dead person questions?\\
Can I brute-force whole list of all dead people in my country and ask them if they had some kind of secrets, secret stashes, etc?\\
Some people used to hide valuables in the ground during the, for example, World War, and those goods are still missing and waiting to be found.

Can I find missing ships this way?\\
