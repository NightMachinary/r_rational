  If the connection is of a reasonable quality, the most humane use may be to hook it up to an automated computer terminal and treat the dead as blind paraplegics. Maybe with enough training you can get them to mentally decode a background signal as low-quality video/make noises that correspond to muscle movements.That way, they could regain some degree of autonomy.

Keep in mind that the device can only contact one dead person at a time. Wouldn't a more humane use be to contact dead geniuses and use them to improve life on earth for all humans, rather than restoring a pseudo-body to a single person?
