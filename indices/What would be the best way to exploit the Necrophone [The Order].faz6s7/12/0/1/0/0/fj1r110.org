Right, so the highest paid author right now is JK Rowling, which has a total net worth of ~$1 billion. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kissinger_Associates][Kissinger Associates]] probably has/had a revenue on the order of tens of millions per year.

Don't get me wrong, that's a lot. The next step is, can you produce something as valuable as Amazon (Bezos - 100 billion)? Can you create an intergalactic empire?

As a first pass, I think I'd probably just resurrect Nash or Fermi, that is, give them control over the phone and call them continuously unless otherwise indicated. I'd expect them to investigate the mechanism by which the phone works, but world-breaking physics research also works for me.
