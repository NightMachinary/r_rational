Thank you for taking the time to explain all this. I think I finally understand the concept now.

  This is all avoided if and only if we restrict trajectories of messages in general to travel at no less than 45 degrees to the x-axis (or, in other words, at light speed or slower). Then, no matter which reference frame we look at the world in, it stays coherent.

Here's what I'm still confused about though- if time dilation is occurring at velocities a fraction of C, then how is the time-travel effect not also happening at those velocities? In the gif you provided, nothing is moving faster than C, and yet the order of events A, B, and C changes depending on the reference frame. How can all info transfer <C be coherent if 0.5C can still reorder events as shown in the gif?
