Sure that makes sense when it comes to an outside observer, but from your own reference frame (which we obviously must remain in), it doesn't actually reverse cause and effect or allow time travel.

For instance, imagine that there is a star 3 light years away that is about to go supernova. You are magically alerted the moment it does and you broadcast a radio signal into space announcing the supernova.

To an observer situated 1 LY from you and 2 LY from the star, it will seem as though you predicted the supernova one year in advance. But from your perspective on earth, you merely know about an event that already occurred*, when that information hasn't reached the rest of us yet. Like a telegram breaking some east coast news to someone on the west coast, while the rest of the country waits for the pony express.

In no circumstances can you actually leverage that inside knowledge into literal time travel or reversing cause and effect, right?

*or did it? Is time itself limited by C somehow?
