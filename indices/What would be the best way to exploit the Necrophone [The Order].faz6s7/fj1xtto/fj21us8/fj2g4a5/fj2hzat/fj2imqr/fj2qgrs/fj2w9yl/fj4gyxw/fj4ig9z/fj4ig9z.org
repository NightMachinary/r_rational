Maybe the issue is that I'm envisioning one very large frame of reference that includes both earth and the star going nova. Like this:

[my frame of reference]

(local frames of reference)

[(Earth)<------------------3LY---------------(supernova)]

  So, if you have your prediction [from your 2020] that "in three years [your 2023, their 2020] [/we will see/] that star +will+ explode", why couldn't they [in their 2017] get the same information by talking to you three years ago [in your 2017]?

Because in your 2017, you haven't received the message yet. From the broader frame of reference, you don't know the star explodes until after it actually explodes. Without the FTL message, you are unaware of the explosion until 3 years after it happens.

Where in all of this is information being sent into the past?
