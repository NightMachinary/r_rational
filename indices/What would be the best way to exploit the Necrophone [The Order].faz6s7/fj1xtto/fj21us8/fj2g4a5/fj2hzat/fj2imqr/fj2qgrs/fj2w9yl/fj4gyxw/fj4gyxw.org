[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity][Relativity of simultaneity]] is a fundamental property of reality according to our understanding of special relativity. Allowing FTL communication makes it very difficult to describe reality in a way that is consistent among people observing events from different frames of reference.

It doesn't really make sense to say that events happened in a certain order until the light from those events is able to be observed. If you can get knowledge about something that happened before the light from it can reach you, then you are effectively predicting the future. So, if you have your prediction that "in three years that star will explode", why couldn't they get the same information by talking to you three years ago? What makes your frame of reference more valid than theirs?

If you're writing a sci-fi or something and your really need to justify the plot device you could go for a sort of solipsism/multiverse answer, where your frame of reference is the only one that really matters to your experience and every 'outside' observer's experience is consistent with yours because your perspective is what defines reality... but that comes with its own problems.
