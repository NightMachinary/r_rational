Since it says "person" and not "human", you could create and kill AI constructs that minimally fit the device's definition of personhood, and are optimized to transfer all sorts of information via the device.

So whenever you want to send info from star system A to star system B, you just instantiate an AI, load it up with said info, and immediately kill it. The receiver would then call up said AI and get the info. The receiver would need to know the name of the AI, but that can be easily solved by naming each AI something like `transmitterID` + `_` + `aiID`, with the latter starting at 0 and increasing by 1 with each new AI.

All of this could be automated. Each transmitter would continuously package up input information and create, fill and destroy AIs at an arbitrary rate. Each AI thus carries a small packet of information. Each receiver would just keep going through the list of names, decoding data out of each audio output.

If the system is optimized to minimize latency and provides sufficient bandwidth (which could be achieved by parallelizing transmission of large files with arrays of multiple transmitters/receivers), you could seamlessly integrate this system into the existing internet infrastructure, connecting assorted star systems with FTL connections!
