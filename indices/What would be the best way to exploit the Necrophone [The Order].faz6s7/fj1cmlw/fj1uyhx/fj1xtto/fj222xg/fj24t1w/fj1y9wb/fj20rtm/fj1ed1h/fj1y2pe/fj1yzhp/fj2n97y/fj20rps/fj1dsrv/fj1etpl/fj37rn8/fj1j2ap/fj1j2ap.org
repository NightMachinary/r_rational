You could also apply the problem recursively, i.e., get a more ruthless person of the past to propose potential uses for the microphone. Resurrecting the son of a griefing billionaire might be one of those solutions.

You could also resurrect someone you think could do valuable work. Or just ressurrect them because you want to. Aaron Schwarz or Hal Finney come to mind.

I'm having some difficulty going from there to total world hegemony, though.
