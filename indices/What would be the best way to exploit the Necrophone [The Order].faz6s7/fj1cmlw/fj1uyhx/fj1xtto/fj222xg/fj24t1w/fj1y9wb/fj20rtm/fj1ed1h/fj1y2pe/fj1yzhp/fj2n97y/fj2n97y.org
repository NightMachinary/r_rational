Before anyone else figures out this exists, I'm going to call historical figures associated with famous buried treasures. I'm also going to call anyone who notoriously died under circumstances suggesting they were killed for knowing the secrets of powerful people, put anything they tell me on a deadman switch to be published if I don't check in every day, and publish it all regardless as soon as anyone else knows the necrophone exists. In the interim I'll follow up on anything they can tell me about how to get evidence proving their claims, which goes in that cache too.

Recursively trace the origins of oral storytelling traditions.

Realtime battlefield intelligence. Repeatedly try to call front line troops. When someone answers, ask for a brief report on the situation just before they died. If we know the name of any soldiers on the other side (e.g., by looking at a dead one's tags and necrophone-interrogating him for the names of others, etc), repeatedly try to call them too.
