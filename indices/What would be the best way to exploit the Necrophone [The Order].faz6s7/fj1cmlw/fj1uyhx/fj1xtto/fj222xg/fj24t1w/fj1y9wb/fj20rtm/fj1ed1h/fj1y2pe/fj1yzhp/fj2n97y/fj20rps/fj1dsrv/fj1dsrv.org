Is it cheap? Can you leave this running in the background? Can you have more than one at a time? Can you have the undead communicate with each other? If so, you can build a computer.

Limitations could be overcome by summoning, say, E.T. Jaynes, Feynman, or another hard scientist of the past, have them produce a list of promising research directions. Pay some confederates $10/hour to conjure an arbitrary number of dead PhD students, and have them divide the research directions in smaller tasks, which you can then further divide in smaller tasks, until you can get to the point where you can get the question solved directly; like: what is the value of this integral, or, can you come up with examples of X? Put the little pieces back up together, and bam! If you have an audio recorder + transcription, you might be able to automate most of this.
