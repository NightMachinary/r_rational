It's funny, that reminds me of a question I asked in some AskX subreddits a while back. The question was 'How long have humans(or our ancestor species) been using names?'.

I was hoping that work like the reconstruction of proto-indoeuropean that linguists have managed might offer sufficient clues to guess at a timeline.

Nope.

We have no idea how long ago humans came up with the idea of adopting names for one another, and we'll almost certainly never know. It just predates writing and even what we can piece together of ancient spoken language by too much.
