  Smart idea, but sadly not how it works. If you wanted to have dead people communicate though, you could record a message from one person and play it for another. So if you wanted some older genius's analysis of a modern scientific question that would be totally doable.

Can the dead still learn? If the connection is of a reasonable quality, the most humane use may be to hook it up to an automated computer terminal and treat the dead as blind paraplegics. Maybe with enough training you can get them to mentally decode a background signal as low-quality video/make noises that correspond to muscle movements.That way, they could regain some degree of autonomy.

If you hooked up a superintelligence to a necrophone, I wonder if it could exfiltrate the brainstate of the deceased by asking questions.
