  Is it cheap?
#+end_quote

It costs nothing to operate.

#+begin_quote
  Can you leave this running in the background?
#+end_quote

I suppose. The call lasts until you hang up, even if you leave.

#+begin_quote
  Can you have more than one at a time?
#+end_quote

You only have the one device and you van only call one dead person at a time.

#+begin_quote
  Can you have the undead communicate with each other?
#+end_quote

No.

  Limitations could be overcome by summoning, say, E.T. Jaynes, Feynman, or another hard scientist of the past, have them produce a list of promising research directions. Pay some confederates $10/hour to conjure an arbitrary number of dead PhD students, and have them divide the research directions in smaller tasks, which you can then further divide in smaller tasks, until you can get to the point where you can get the question solved directly; like: what is the value of this integral, or, can you come up with examples of X? Put them back up together, and bam!

Smart idea, but sadly not how it works. If you wanted to have dead people communicate though, you could record a message from one person and play it for another. So if you wanted some older genius's analysis of a modern scientific question that would be totally doable.
