They're a huge national security issue. You can ask some recently dead high-ranking government official about anything. This is great if you're a government. Not so great if you want to sell the thing instead of just having it confiscated for national security reasons. I'm not sure how all that would work.

If you don't want to draw the attentions of every government, it means you have to keep the thing a secret, so that limits what you can do.

You could use it for insider trading. Look up whenever someone on the board of a publicly traded company dies, and ask them if there's anything you need to know.

You can also just ask people where treasure is buried. There's quite a bit that we know about and haven't found.
