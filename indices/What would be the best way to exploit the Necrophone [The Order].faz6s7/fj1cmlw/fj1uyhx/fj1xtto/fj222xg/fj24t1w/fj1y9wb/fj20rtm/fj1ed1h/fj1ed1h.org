It would be pretty useful for any sort of investigation of murder or missing people. It would let you find out if someone is dead, and obviously most people could tell you who killed them (and the information is guaranteed to be true).

You could prove/disprove the existence of an afterlife and what it is like. This would probably make a lot of people very upset.

Being able to get accurate accounts of history straight from primary sources would be nice to have. You could get even more names by asking famous ancient people who they knew. You could probably go pretty far back by asking "who was the oldest person you knew?".

With a superintellegent ai, you could "resurrect" every person who ever lived by mapping every response to every possible question. This would be greatly sped up by having the AI only understand an inhumanly fast and dense language.
