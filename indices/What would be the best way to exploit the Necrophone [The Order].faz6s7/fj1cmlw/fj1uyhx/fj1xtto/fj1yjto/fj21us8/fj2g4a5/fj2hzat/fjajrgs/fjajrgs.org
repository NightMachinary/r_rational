I've read most of the other replies, and I'd like to offer my 2 cents.

First, reference frames. A reference frame isn't a matter of position. Imagine 2 observers, A and B; they're moving with respect to one another. From A's point of view, A isn't moving, and B is, and vice versa. Or: In A's reference frame, A isn't moving and B is, and vice versa. A reference frame is an abstraction so we don't have to invent non-embodied observers for all these thought experiments.

Second, why you might doubt something's possibility. We can believe in a lot of things in physics, but one thing we basically reject by default is inconsistency. You see me moving, I see you moving, fine. We can transform data gathered in one reference frame to another and we're good. But what if you had some physics where it turned out that you could turn it into 'I see you moving at great speeds, you see me stationary with respect to you sitting right there.' What the hell does that even mean, physically? It's not two different points of view in one universe; it's two different universes. There's something pretty wrong with a model that lets that occur.

There are certain space-time diagrams that really help build intuition with the next part in practice, if not in justification for why it must occur. The basic principle is the relativity of simultaneity. Wikipedia's ok:

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity]]

Specifically this:

The x-axis is space, the y-axis is time; for any given observer, every point in time on the x-axis is simultaneous. You shift the 'angle' of the x-axis (and y-axis) by shifting your velocity relative to the reference frame we're measuring this all from (remember, there are no privileged reference frames).

The y-axis angling happens in galilean relativity (normal newtonian mechanics); If I'm angled so much, it mean's I'm traveling at this speed relative to whatever our comparison reference frame is. The x-axis changes angle because the speed of light has to be conserved for all observers/reference frames. (a fundamental principle of special relativity).

As the relative velocity between our base reference frame and the frame in question approaches c, the space and time axes angle closer and closer to each other. At c, they'd merge (this is why people say photons don't experience time).

The gist is that in special relativity, observers in different reference frames have see different orderings of events in the universe. This is after accounting for the speed of light delays, and there's no 'true' ordering.

So. Imagine you're in the same reference frame as earth and this star (they're stationary w.r.t each other). You send an instant signal from Earth (E) to the star (S).

#+begin_example
                             ^  time
                             |   
  E1 ----> S1         +---> space
#+end_example

This is in the nice, comfy reference frame enjoyed by Earth and Star and us. So E1 and S1 are simulatenous in time. But wait! Some dastard in a rocket is accelerating around, picking arbitrary reference frames, like in

We're allowed to move tilt the x-axis up to 90 degrees, so we can easily make that horizontal line go from above the x-axis to below when going from E to S, i.e. the event at S where they recieved the signal occured before the event at earth where it was sent.

And in a reference frame of opposite relative velocity, an 'instant' signal going from S to E would be going back in time.

This is very weird. Worse, this is incoherent. Depending on which direction you're moving in now shifts you into alternate histories (because S could operate on info from earth to send earth a conventional light signal to arrive before E sends the message to S, if they're suitably spaced, or a million other things.)

This is all avoided if and only if we restrict trajectories of messages in general to travel at no less than 45 degrees to the x-axis (or, in other words, at light speed or slower). Then, no matter which reference frame we look at the world in, it stays coherent.

TL;DR: If you allow FTL signalling along with the other postulates of special relativity, I can construct observers for whom the causal structure of the universe is different in irreconcilable, absurd ways- and the only difference between these guys is one is going 5 m/s left, and the other 5 m/s right. This is absurd (everything has to go to normality) and so we conclude that a coherent universe with the other rules of relativity has to be one where FTL signalling doesn't happen.
