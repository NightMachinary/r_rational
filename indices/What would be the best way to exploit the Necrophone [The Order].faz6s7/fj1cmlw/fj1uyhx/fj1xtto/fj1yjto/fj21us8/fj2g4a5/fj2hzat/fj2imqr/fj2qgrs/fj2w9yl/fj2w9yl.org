    You are magically alerted the moment it does and you broadcast a radio signal

  This is where you dodge the loophole. What's to stop you from "magically alerting" the people living near the star 3 light years away?

I'm not sure what you mean here, but sure, let's say it's 2 way. In my proposed scenario, you are alerted right when their star goes supernova. If you send an instantaneous message back to them, they would not be interested in it because they would be in the process of getting exploded by their star. How would that break causality? First, the star begins to go nova, then you are alerted a moment later, then you send a message back which they receive as they watch their sun fill the sky. Where's the break?
