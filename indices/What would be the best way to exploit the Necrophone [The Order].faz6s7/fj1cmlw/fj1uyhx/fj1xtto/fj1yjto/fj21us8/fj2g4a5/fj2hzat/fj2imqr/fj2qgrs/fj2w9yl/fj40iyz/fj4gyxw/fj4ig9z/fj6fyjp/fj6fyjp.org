this stems from something even more basic, so basic in fact that if it is violated the whole construct of our understanding of the universe breaks. this is the principle of causality and its natural consequence the speed of light.

the thing is that the speed of light has little to do with light. its name comes from that light was the first phenomenon that had a that speed, another better way of referring to the speed of light is the speed of causality. and here is the crux.

causality for us non physicists is that a cause cannot happen before the effect, but for physicists is causality is defined differently. causality is defined as that nothing can affect something else before its light reached it. in other words the speed of light is the maximum speed at which something can affect something else.

as far everyone can tell, and this is tied to many things beyond my understanding. causality cannot be broken. ever. and the universe will bend in seemingly crazy ways to make it so. that is the origin of time dilation for example.

imagine you are watching a spaceship flying very fast at a high percentage of the speed of light, from now on c, the spaceship is flashing a light forward, at what speed the does the light moves from the perspective of the spaceship? at what speed does the light moves from your perspective?

if this was normal humancompatible speeds you would say that the spaceship sees the light move at c, and you would see the light moving at c+the speed of the space ship, but this is not so, we have experimental data that no matter what light, causality, always moves at c.

so how does the universe joins this seemingly impossible conditions is time dilation and length contraction. for the spaceship time itself moves slower and the distances seems shorter so light ALWAYS moves at c.

now lets say you are using ftl communications to speak with someone 3ly away, im just in between, watching you. meaning that you are causing effects, ie. sound waves, beyond where the causality of your action has reached. that breaks causality and as far as we know causality cannot be broken. the only possible thing that could make this work is if you in fact did not sent the message now, but you *actually* sent the message 3 years ago and is just now reaching . that you sent the message into the past.
