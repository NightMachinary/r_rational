I think the claim is just a result of analysis shortcuts that gave a misleading result. The time travel claim has to do with the fact that the speed of light relative to you is the same, no matter how fast you are going.

Let's say Alice and Bob and a photon are all going to race. The photon takes off at 0.3 Gm/s. Alice and Bob follow and reach speeds of 0.2 Gm/s and 0.1 Gm/s respectively. Catherine is at the starting point and confirmed these speeds.

Alice watches the photon, and it is moving 0.3 Gm/s faster than her.

Bob watches the photon, and it is moving 0.3Gm/s faster than him.

This is not a paradox, the light is moving at the same speed compared to each individual because they are each experiencing different amounts of time dilation.

Now, Alice has Dave with her, and he's a total Mary Sue with the combined powers of God and anime on his side, so he makes Alice go twice as fast (from Catherine's view), raising her speed to 0.4Gm/s. He also skips the discontinuity at 0.3Gm/s because wtf does it mean to be going the same speed as the photon yet watching it move away from you.

Alice is still watching the photon, and it's /still/ moving away from her at 0.3Gm/s. Catherine and Bob are watching Alice catch up to the photon though. What's going on? Well, Alice's time dilation is so bad that she's experiencing time in reverse.

Thus, a rather lame form of time travel.

It also means she'll never catch up to the photon from her perspective.

Except, well, no. Alice measuring her speed relative to anything but the photon is just getting garbage numbers. Her speed is not 0.4Gm/s, it's a complex number, which is a real number plus an imaginary number. It's garbage because complex numbers only appear in the real world where we have oscillating motion, where the real number is the instantaneous speed and the imaginary number becomes a correction factor that describes how the change in speed will affect the average speed over a period of oscillation.

The real reason ftl travel is impossible I that when you take relativistic effects into account your speed is not a number that describes linear motion any longer
