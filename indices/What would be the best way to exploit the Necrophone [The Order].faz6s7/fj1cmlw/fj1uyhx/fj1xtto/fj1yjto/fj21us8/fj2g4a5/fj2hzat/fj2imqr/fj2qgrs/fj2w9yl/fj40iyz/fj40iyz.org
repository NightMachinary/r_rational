  First, the star begins to go nova, then you are alerted a moment later, then you send a message back which they receive as they watch their sun fill the sky.

No, actually if they immediately send a message to you as the star is exploding [from their reference frame], then you'll have received the message 3 years ago (due to skipping over the light-years involved) aka there's still 3 years before you'll see the light of the nova. Since according to *your* reference frame, there's 3 years before the nova will occur, you send the warning and then all of the sudden they have been warned of the star going nova three years before it actually happens.

The reason why you are getting so confused is because you are mentally thinking of everything in the universe happening according to some sort of absolute flow of time or an objective reference frame. But the flow of time is subjective and if you send faster than light messages to people, it allows you to pick and choose which reference frame to use (when usually we are stuck with the exact same frame of reference/sequence of events from birth to death).

By sending a FTL message to Earth and receiving the message 3 years before the light of the nova reached us, the message has technically been sent back in time by 3 years according to Earth's flow of time even if it looks like the star is exploding at the 'same time'. If the message is immediately delivered back from Earth to the star, the star will receive the message 3 years before the nova has occurred, because that would be the 'same point of time' that Earth has received the message. Earth receiving the message can be said to be both occurring as the star goes nova or 3 years before it does so (depending on if you are thinking of Earth's or the star's reference frame), therefore both points in the timeline of the star is available to receive the message.

It's the reason why FTL communication is considered time-travel because by changing reference frames, it allows information to move backwards in time. One way is only FTL communication, two way becomes time travel.
