You're welcome! I'm glad this degree has finally come in handy.

The notion of simultaneity changes with your velocity. Graphically, this happens by the x-axis rotating. Here's the thing- the x-axis rotation maxes out at 45 degrees from the horizontal. Something travelling at the speed of light, on this graph, is shown as a line at 45 degrees from the /vertical/- the closer to the vertical the slower. A vertical line is nonmoving in the base reference frame.

So- the horizontal axis can't rotate more than 45 degrees, worldlines can't be at more than 45 degrees from the y-axis. So even though the order of events can shift, no worldline can cross over with the line of simultaneity- at the physical limit, they merge. (Photons being buddies.)

In a more practical answer- if you look at the gif, the spatial distance between the physical locations of the events (as measured by the number of squares your have to pass through) also shifts for the moving observer, proportional to the change in when stuff happens. This is a physical thing- when you're going fast, the world is shrunk in the direction of your movement. Basically, all of spacetime- it's really one thing- is stretching at once, so it's fine, the changes only look like they have to compensate because we focus so much on splitting spatial and time axes so intuitively.

Basically: As long as the lines don't cross over, we're good.
