I notice that you said "person" rather than "human." So this is useful for:

1. Figuring out which animals are sentient
2. Disproving any religions with dead gods
3. Wild animal suffering research

Also notable for the fact that the only constraint is that you must say the person's name. So you can figure out when and where human language first evolved by speaking random names into the necrophone, talking with them until you figure out when and where they lived, and repeating a large number of times. Historical research would be doable in a similar way.

That's all I can think of right now.
