Since you say it allows FTL, then here is another idea.\\
How long will this device last?

*I think it could be used to establish the permanent FTL communication (at least one-way) with another point in universe.*

For example: let's make a space ship arc and send it out of our Galaxy, but give the crew the exact indexed list of names for their children. Every time the child is born, they will use the name from the list.\\
Also keep the list of the names on Earth.\\
This way, even after centauries, even after thousands of years, we will be able to 'call' the newly-dead children from the arc ship, because we will know how they were named.

/// btw, it wouldn't really require making a list, we could just ask the first crewman for the name of his children, write it down, then call his kids after 50 years, atc....
