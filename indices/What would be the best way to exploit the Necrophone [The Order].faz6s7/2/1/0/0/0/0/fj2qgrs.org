  You are magically alerted the moment it does and you broadcast a radio signal

This is where you dodge the loophole. What's to stop you from "magically alerting" the people living near the star 3 light years away? If you limit all communications from your own reference frame to following the rules of physics as we understand them then it's just a nifty trick that makes it look like you can make some very accurate predictions. If it's two-way communication, then it breaks causality.
