  No, actually if they immediately send a message to you as the star is exploding [from their reference frame], then you'll have received the message 3 years ago (due to skipping over the light-years involved) aka *there's still 3 years before you'll see the light of the nova. Since according to your reference frame, there's 3 years before the nova will occur*, you send the warning and then all of the sudden they have been warned of the star going nova three years before it actually happens.

This part confuses me. Yes, from my reference frame, I will get the message 3 years before I */see/* the star go nova, but since the star is 3 LY away, I don't see the explosion until 3 years after it happens. It seems like you're saying that from my reference frame, the supernova /actually happens/ when I see the light from it, not when the light started traveling away from the explosion itself.

That seems wrong to me. Are you saying that if in the year 2020 we point a telescope at the sky and see a star 1,000 light years away go supernova, that the star /actually/ went supernova in 2020, not 1020?

It seems like you're saying that viewing the light from a past event in a telescope is /actually/ looking into the past. In my understanding, the past event occurs, and the photons from that event travel through space for years until they hit your telescope. Since it takes a long time for the photons to reach you, you don't become aware of the past event until they do, but it still did happen in the past.

  By sending a FTL message to Earth and receiving the message 3 years before the light of the nova reached us, the message has technically been sent back in time by 3 years according to Earth's flow of time even if it looks like the star is exploding at the 'same time'.

Why would it look like the star is exploding at the same time if we got the message 3 years before we saw the explosion?

#+begin_quote
  If the message is immediately delivered back from Earth to the star, the star will receive the message 3 years before the nova has occurred, because that would be the 'same point of time' that Earth has received the message.

This is the part that I need explained to me more. If they send an instant communication to earth the moment the star explodes, and earth instantly responds, why are you saying they would actually receive the response 3 years in the past? Sure, earth is 3 LY away, but since the communication is instant, why does that distance matter? I get the impression there's some theory like, "time itself is limited by the speed of light" underlying your explanation that you haven't articulated yet.

  Earth receiving the message can be said to be both occurring as the star goes nova or 3 years before it does so (depending on if you are thinking of Earth's or the star's reference frame), therefore both points in the timeline of the star is available to receive the message.

Why is this so different from my earlier metaphor about the east coast news traveling slowly to the west coast while a telegram communicates it instantly? Can you restate this point using that metaphor?

If a super powerful telescope 100 LY away were pointed at earth right now, it would see earth as it was 100 years ago. If it sent a FTL IM to earth today, we would receive it right now, and it could report to us what earth looked like 100 years in the past. And if we sent a FTL IM back, it would appear to the telescope that it was receiving a message 100 years into the future of the earth it could /see/, but it would also know that it was just viewing the earth as it existed 100 years ago, and that the earth it got the message from was the present earth. So I get how it could be used to send a message to the future, but both the telescope and we are in the year 2020. How could it send a message back into the past?

If what you're saying is true, why do astronomers say stuff like, if the sun suddenly blew up, we wouldn't know about it for 8 minutes, or "this star that we just saw go supernova actually blew up when King Tut still ruled Egypt, it just took that long for the light to reach us? Aren't you saying that these events actually happen only when their light reaches us? That the sun didn't explode 8 minutes ago, it exploded when the explosion reached us? That the star didn't go nova during Tut's reign, it went nova today? Why ignore the travel time like that?

Sorry for the giant book I wrote you, I'm just trying to understand this confusing concept.
