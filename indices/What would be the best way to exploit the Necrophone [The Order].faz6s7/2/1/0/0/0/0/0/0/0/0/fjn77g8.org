I think for your intuition its best to imagine that "simultaneous" doesn't exist. That there is only cause and effect, one event affecting another.

imagine a 2d grid where each point is an event in real life. Every point that is strictly above and to the right of that point is "affected" by this event, and every strictly below and to the right of the point is "a cause of" the event. Now think of all the points in the other two quadrants. They are neither in the past or the future compared to our starting point, no real link between them exists. So you can say any of these events are happening "simultaneously" to ours.

Unless you're studying the specifics of the math, I think you don't need to know why we say specific events are "simultaneous under this reference frame".
