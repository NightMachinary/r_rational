  I notice that you said "person" rather than "human." So this is useful for:

This gave me another idea.

Universe is very large, maybe somewhere else was some kind of living being that could count as 'person'?

Maybe we could, well, somehow brute-force all possible vocals and try to summon the dead from another planet? This would be useful for SETI projects.

Is this Necrophone limited to humans from Earth? Or would it also work for human-like beings from other planets, which are just similiar to humans just by mere chance? You know, given enough time and space there is a chance that there was already a specie similiar to humanity evolved sometime ago.
