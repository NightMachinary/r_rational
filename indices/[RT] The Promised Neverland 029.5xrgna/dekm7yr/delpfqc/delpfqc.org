I vaguely remember someone analyzing it in a different thread before.

If I remember correctly the numbers correspond to what farm you're from and then individually IDs you from there. Someone guessed that Sister Krone and Mama Isabel are from the same farm based off those numbers.

But I didn't actually check into it myself and I don't have a link. So, you know... grain of salt.
