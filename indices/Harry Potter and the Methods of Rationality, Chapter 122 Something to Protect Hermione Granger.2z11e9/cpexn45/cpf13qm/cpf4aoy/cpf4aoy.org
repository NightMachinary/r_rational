Ye, I am aware of these marvellous compositions. But with the Harry Potter & Lord Voldemort story complete, there's now a sandbox world of a rational universe that can be explored in any way desired. One could have humanist, rational but non-rationalist rebels fighting against a utilitarian dictator Hermione, the political career of the Girl Who Revived could be a story, or one could spin a tale of a super-powered unicorn Heroine wandering the earth, doing moral deeds and scratching lethifolds. It's like we finished the main campaign in Skyrim, and we can now do whatever we want.
