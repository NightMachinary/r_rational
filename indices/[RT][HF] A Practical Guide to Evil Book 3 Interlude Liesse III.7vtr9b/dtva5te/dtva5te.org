Seems like Cat's crew is doing some real work while the old legions are getting spanked. With the explanation of the legion structure at the beginning, I think it's more likely that Black is behind the assassinations.

If Warlock manages to plug the Greater Breach the Fifteenth could bail out the other legions and earn their legitimacy. Having said that, it's curious that the two goblins were left alive... goblin conspiracy is a go? Either that or maybe Black didn't assassinate the generals needed for the victory.

Hope we get back to Cat next chapter.
