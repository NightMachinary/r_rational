I have no interest in the source material and love your story to pieces, if that helps to reinforce in your mind the idea that people can separate the source from the fanfic. I enjoy reading this story quite a lot. I believe the sequel's â€˜growing pains' in terms of readership would not have been so apparent if Scar continued to be the protagonist throughout but then we'd miss this reveal that he's been working behind the scenes the entire time. Thank you for the time and effort you put into this story.
