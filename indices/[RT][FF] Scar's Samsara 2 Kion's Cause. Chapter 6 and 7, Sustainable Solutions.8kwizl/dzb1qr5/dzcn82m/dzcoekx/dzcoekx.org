Thanks! Yeah, it's probably a mix of factors, with sequels always being less popular etc. as well as Scar lending a different mood to the story than this one, which is ultimately based on a children's cartoon after all. But in general, I'm guessing it's mostly a case of there not being a 'hook' to pull the reader into the story and really care about the characters. The original had Scar's villain appeal and The Lion King nostalgia: This one has neither.

I'm also wondering how many of the downvotes this story is getting is just from people who want me to write NTBS instead, as opposed to people who just don't care for it. :P
