This is not because we intrinsically value their individual lives, but because we might need them as a species in the future. In this light, keeping a few around in order to breed them if they turn out to be unexpectedly useful makes sense.

Additionally, there are diminishing returns on any eradication efforts, because killing off all of a species is much harder than killing off most of them in the same way that getting a car completely clean is harder than just getting it mostly clean.

There's also possible knock-on effects like an unforeseen keystone species that feeds on that animal and gets driven to extinction as well, devastating the entire ecosystem for that area.
