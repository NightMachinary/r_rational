As a species we'll happily kill animals for food, for research, for sport, to prevent population explosions, to end a threat, to make room for new properties, etc., but for some reason we attach particular weight to the extermination of a species.

Killing millions upon millions of animals each year is fine, but eradicating one species crosses the line. We're like a serial killer who always spares one member of a family before moving onto the next. Somehow we imagine that this is better, that the scale of death is meaningless because it's never quite total.

We're a very annoying species, I must say.
