  /I don't think the situation with the Grey Pilgrim is very analogous./

It's possible to mess with Gates and with Scrying by Named power (see: Procer's use of scrying), which in this story means it's an outright eventuality especially given how reliant the Army of Callow is on those two things.

  /The issue here is that Cat expects a solution./

Her solution to that was clearly "don't gate into Procer without a backup plan, especially if it means risking the destruction of Callow". Saving Grem One-Eye and remnants of Black's army is strategically important, but not as important as losing most of the Army of Callow, who they needed to help fend off the Dead King. In the context of mundane alternatives to Gating and Scrying itself, I don't think Cat needs to be the one who thinks them up. She has people for that, like Juniper, Akua, Masego etc.
