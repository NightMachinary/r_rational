  Just because they haven't before doesn't mean they won't.

This doesn't seem like a helpful way to assess risk. Yes, everything has to happen for the first time once, but if something has never happened before it is often a good indicator that, at the least, it's very unlikely to happen. You can't plan around even a fraction of all the possible things that have never happened before but aren't theoretically impossible. You have to look at the evidence and do your best to surmise the likely probability and as far as i can see the probability, based on what we know, seems really low that gates would be rendered useless over a vast geographic area.

  "What could go wrong?" is a question often asked but one must also be cautious of "How bad could it be?"

Certainly, but this still requires an alternative plan that's less risky yet still effective, which was not provided by Cat.
