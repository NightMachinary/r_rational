  And I already mentioned the last time a Gate was messed with by a Named in the plot, so it's not improbable it'll fail to work again in a critical moment either.

I don't think the situation with the Grey Pilgrim is very analogous. I suspect Juniper was confident her plan could survive a Named in the immediate vicinity being able to temporarily disable a gate. I wouldn't infer from that, if i were her, that Named could permanently disable gates over a huge area even when they're not physically nearby the gating point. I would update the likelihood of catastrophic gate failure, but only very slightly.

  Cat may not have a solution either, but that doesn't mean Juniper didn't blunder by gambling on them not failing
#+end_quote

The issue here is that Cat /expects/ a solution. She acknowledges that the Legions should have been saved, so given that, she needs to provide a better solution otherwise she is just admonishing Juniper for coming up with the best possible solution to something that she expected to be done.

  the one thing they relied on
#+end_quote

In my estimation it was the failing of /both/ scrying and gating that resulted in their predicament. It is this expected planning for the simultaneous failing of both that makes Cat seem especially unreasonable to me.
