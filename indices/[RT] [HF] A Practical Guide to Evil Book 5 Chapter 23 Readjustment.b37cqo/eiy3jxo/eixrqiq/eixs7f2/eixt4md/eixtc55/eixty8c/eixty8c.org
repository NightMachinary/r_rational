That's how risk management works. They prepare for even slim possibilities, especially those measures that would be fatal if failed in the worst case scenario. And I already mentioned the last time a Gate was messed with by a Named in the plot, so it's not improbable it'll fail to work again in a critical moment either.

Sure, time is limited and you can't plan for everything, but the whole Fae Gates thing is reliant on Cat's enduring relationship with the Fairy Courts and the Observatory needs Masego and Fae Magic to fix it if anything goes wrong, right? Neither of those are set in stone.

Cat may not have a solution either, but that doesn't mean Juniper didn't blunder by gambling on them not failing in a story where overconfident Villains/Heroes are constantly betrayed by the one thing they relied on (see: Cat on Magic Swords).
