We're reading a story in which narrative tropes like overconfident Villains having their magic whatever fail them at the last moment resulting at their downfall at the hands of Heroes is a common thing that happens. Cat throwing away the angel feather sword after being revived by angels shows us that this is something common enough that people plan around.

I thought their failure to gate and scry now is a combination of the Tyrant's machinations and/or Hierarch being nearby? Also there's Cat losing her direct fae powerup to the Drow and Masego turning into a walking magic nuke after his dads blew themselves up, which might have resulted in some unexpected magic backlash to the Observatory.

Look, the campaign being reliant on two extremely critical points of failure with no backup plan that can reduce the severity of the risks is clearly an error. If it worked out then it's fine in the short run, but Cat being hypocritical or not in pointing out Juniper's faults here doesn't mean Juniper's not at fault.

Going back to Risk Management, failure to scry and failure to gate are catastrophic risks that are somewhat unlikely to happen both at once. Severity x Likelihood = Risk, extremely high severity combined with uncommon likelihood means risks should still be heavily managed with plenty of backup plans before they plan jumping into Procer.

Again, her solution was "not go to Procer", which is valid. Cat didn't say Grem's leftover army is worth the entire Army of Callow, and in fact she has implied it's not worth the trade before. Choosing to not save Grem isn't impossible, although it would look really bad to those at home. I'm basing this starting from her conversation with Adjutant in Chapter 19 btw:
