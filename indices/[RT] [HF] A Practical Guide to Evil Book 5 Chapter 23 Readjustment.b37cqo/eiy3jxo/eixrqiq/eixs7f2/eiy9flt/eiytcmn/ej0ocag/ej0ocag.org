They've used gates in battle before, yeah, like when Procer invaded. If I remember correctly though, they were very careful to make sure that their plans wouldn't fall to pieces if a gate suddenly fails. They used the gates, sure, but made sure to never rely on them in crucial/plot-heavy moments. Juniper made a bold move that absolutely required the gates to work, so of course they failed. Scrying going down too was just adding insult to injury.
