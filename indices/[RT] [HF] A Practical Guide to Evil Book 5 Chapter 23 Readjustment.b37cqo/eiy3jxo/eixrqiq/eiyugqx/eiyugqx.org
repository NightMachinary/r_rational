One segment I think deserves more attention:

#+begin_quote
  “When the situation in Iserre is resolved,” I continued, “a tribunal of senior officers will be convened to assess whether or not the decisions you took in this campaign warrant charges of incompetence or reckless use of authority. Their verdict will decide whether or not you are demoted back to general.”

  “Understood,” the Marshal of Callow rasped.

  “Good,” I said. “I'll be perfectly clear: I have no intention of being involved with this tribunal beyond ordering it convened. This is not personal, Juniper. This isn't happening because I am angry with an old friend, or appalled by what your decisions almost led to. But if the Army of Callow is ever to be more than just my personal warband, then its members need to be accountable for what they do.”

another hint that she's tihnking more long term about Callow as a stae with institutions seperate from her own personal power. Similar to her thoughts about Abigail.

Good public policy, but narratively any succession planning makes you automatically at risk of death (doomed mentor style)
