  Juniper's mistakes
#+end_quote

I felt Cat was too results orientated here. It seems as if Junipers decisions were all regarded as correct except for the inability to account for /both/ the gates failing to work and scrying to fail. Any military action to rescue the Legions was going to contain some degree of risk, the question being how likely was it that /both/ scrying and gating would simultaneously fail and were there other possible courses of action that were less costly?

I understand that Juniper was heading into an area with Named and that magic can simply fail on you for story reasons but just what odds would you expect somebody to put on scrying and gating both failing in this situation? We've seen gates used many times before, including in conflicts and with Named, have we seen them fail in this manner or similar? Have we seen a simple facet of magic be excluded before over such a vast territory?
