There's always an issue with calculating risk with the possibility of Black Swans ^{pun not intended}. One reason they should maybe have been more wary is that they know so little about the underlying mechanics that they don't have any way to predict how likely these things are. (Vs more well understood legion magic). Its equivalent to someone relying on a car for transportation but not knowing how cars work, so being stranded when it runs out of fuel.
