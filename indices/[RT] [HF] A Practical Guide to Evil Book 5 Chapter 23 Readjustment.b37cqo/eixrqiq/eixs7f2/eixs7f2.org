  /We've seen gates used many times before, including in conflicts and with Named, have we seen them fail in this manner or similar?/

Just because they haven't before doesn't mean they won't. It's a critical point of failure because of how important it was to the campaign. "What could go wrong?" is a question often asked but one must also be cautious of "How bad could it be?"

Also the Grey Pilgrim once messed with a Gate back when Cat dropped a lake, which took Cat and Masego out of commission for much of the battle.

With gates and scrying the Army of Callow would've been mostly successful with its objectives, and not on the brink of destruction before Cat came in to save the day.
