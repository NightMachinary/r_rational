  It's possible to mess with Gates and with Scrying by Named power
#+end_quote

I don't think it's sensible to dismiss all the reasons why the two situations are not analogous and assume exponential scaling of any ability. We're looking at

- permanent v temporary disabling

- limited to a specific gate being targeted v any gate in an entire province

- requires a Named in the immediate vicinity v no Named needed nearby

Regarding Cat's thoughts on the necessity of rescue:

#+begin_quote
  “It was necessary to evacuate the Legions of Terror,” Juniper said.

  I nodded in acknowledgement.

  “They fought at the Vales,” I said. “A debt was owed..."
#+end_quote

Now obviously this doesn't mean Cat thinks the Legions come before her army but it becomes a matter of /how much risk Cat is willing to assume/ to rescue the Legions and whether Juniper's plan assumed too much risk. As we disagree on how much risk there was we can't probably can't get much more out of this point.

#+begin_quote
  I don't think Cat needs to be the one who thinks them up. She has people for that
#+end_quote

Sure, but she has to be aware that /there is in fact a better solution/. As Cat is not yet aware of any better solutions then she can't be sure that one does in fact exist. If Cat was saying "Juniper, if this is the best solution that existed then you should have left the Legions to fend for themselves" then that's one thing but AFAICT that's not the sentiment she is expressing in this chapter.
