That's the thing though, it was arguably /two/ points of failure, because with scrying my understanding is that this situation would not have been near as messy, and Juniper was not engaging in combat with Named, she was gating into a location that she suspected (correctly) to be without Named in the immediate vicinity. Yes, there were Named within a few hours march or such but that's very different to a situation where Named are there right in front of you to exude their narrativium in such a direct manner.

The other big difference being that while you might plan for a Named to impose some sort of temporary exclusionary effect in their vicinity, that is very different to a huge, permanent, area wide exclusionary effect. I suspect that Juniper could have worked around the former.
