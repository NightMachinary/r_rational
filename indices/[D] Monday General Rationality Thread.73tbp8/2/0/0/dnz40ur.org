I'm in the study room at the moment and I see you are too (or at least someone pretending to be you!). Not sure if you're actually around as nobody else seems to be using the chat :(

EDIT: Just realised the time - I gotta get to class! So I'm not there anymore.

(I get really upset - as I finish my work day and go into leisure time, all the Americans are logging in. Hopefully my GMT+8 timezone won't be an island of loneliness in this study room...)

I'm liking the paid features, but with me being miserly and paying in AUD, I'm not sure how I feel about the $120 USD price tag being value for money. Then again yadda yadda yadda I spend $X on coffee and $Y on haircuts...
