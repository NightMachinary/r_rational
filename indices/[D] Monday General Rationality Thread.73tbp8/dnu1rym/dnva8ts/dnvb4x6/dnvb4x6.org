  (provided you don't believe in something crazy like the supernatural)

Anyone who believes in the possibility of superintelligence by definition believes in the supernatural.

  Another interesting (if terrifying) idea, is that GAI's that end up becoming the only conscious mind in existence (whether through killing off their creators or having their creators eventually merge with them) are the norm. So were that the case, a GAI could have only one if not a handful of separate "observers" as it were so most minds that ever existed would actually be among the precursor biological civilization and thus we shouldn't be surprised to be in the majority of minds to ever exist.
