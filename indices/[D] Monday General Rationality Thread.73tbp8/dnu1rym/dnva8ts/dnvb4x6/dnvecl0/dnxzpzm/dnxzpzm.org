  You should be careful not to conflate "a consistent naturalistic worldview must allow superintelligence" with "worldviews that don't include superintelligence as a possibility must be supernaturally based". You're forgetting that most people do not have internally consistent worldviews.

Of course, people should also be careful not to conflate "much more capable of optimizing its environment than the most effective known groups of humans" with "god's-eye-view optimal knowledge of literally everything, including metaphysical constructs such as alternate universes."

The former is almost definitely possible. The latter is either supernatural or requires a rather bizarre metaphysics.
