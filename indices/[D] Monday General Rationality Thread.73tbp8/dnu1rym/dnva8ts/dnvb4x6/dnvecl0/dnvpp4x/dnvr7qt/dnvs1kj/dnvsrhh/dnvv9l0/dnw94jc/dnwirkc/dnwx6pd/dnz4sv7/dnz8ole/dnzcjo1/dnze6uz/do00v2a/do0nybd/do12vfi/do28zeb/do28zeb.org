  The way arbitrary amounts of computation can be extracted from such a system depends upon stretching out the duration of the process. By stretching out the simulation over ever longer periods of time, you ensure that it will be disrupted before completion.

See the duration also doesn't matter here, because even if the longer it takes the less likely it is to occur randomly, well as long as the probability isn't /exactly/ 0 then given an infinite period of heat death it's bound to occur arbitrarily many times.

  I would expect that the amount of energy available (from random fluctuations) shrinks faster than the computation can be performed.

My point about reversible computing is that it could in theory use no energy, plus the deal with boltzmann brains is that showing something is arbitrarily unlikely doesn't help you. You need to actually be able to come up with a reason the likelihood of it happening (within our current models of reality at least) is exactly 0.

Also looking at the section in the wikipedia article you linked I read the section about Szilard's engine. This is effectively what I was saying before in terms of a alteration of the maxwell's demon scenario and it is a demonstration of how information equals energy. Importantly though it would be trivially easy to make the pistons operate randomly and thus it seems like there being a non-zero chance of being able to violate conservation of energy that way seems unavoidable.\\
Importantly this seems like it must also allow quantum fluctuations to have a miniscule chance of violating conservation laws as well. After all while the setup imagined isn't at the quantum scale, whatever it would do to get that free energy would need to occur at the quantum scale if you looked closely enough. As in if you zoomed in enough somewhere on the quantum level you would need to see particles or energy arising from nowhere in some part of the system, thus there needs to be some sort of extremely unlikely type of quantum interactions which can occur that violate conservation. That one could theoretically get those results at the quantum level involving only a single photon (since at heat death all you have is photons separated by the cosmic horizon from each other) and some interaction with the quantum foam seems like a considerable possibility.

  Of course, this ignores the fact that real things in this universe (like a brain) are not deterministic, and so not reversible. A reversible simulator (some kind of quantum computer) would have to retain all the probability functions throughout the simulation. I suspect this would be equivalent not to simulation, but to a description of a proposed simulation.

That actually may not be a problem in many worlds. Since from any given universe's perspective it may look random, however there will be some tiny fraction of everett branches where by sheer coincidence quantum events happen to play out as though they were deterministic. More importantly my point is that if there's some chance quantum events may play out in a way that looks deterministic for a long enough timescale for the boltzmann brain, then since it would be indistinguishable from an actually deterministic system it ought to be the same from an observer's perspective.\\
This is similar to my previous point about how if two systems can be matched 1 to 1 in terms of appearing to hold information (with processes just being made up of many individual frames as it were of arrangements of "stuff") then it doesn't make sense to treat them differently. So a bunch of randomly bouncing rocks form patterns over time which match up to what would be formed in that XKCD comic, it ought to also simulate a universe the same way.

Also even without many worlds by sheer chance you could get the same thing where for a given slice of time and space the quantum foam just acted like it was deterministic for a short while. In regards to brains not being deterministic that's not really relevant unless you think minds couldn't exist in deterministic universes/multiverses.
