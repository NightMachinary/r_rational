Yeah I can see what you mean about the probability never occurring if at any given point it's decreasing exponentially. However you also said

#+begin_quote
  I would expect that the amount of energy available (from random fluctuations) shrinks faster than the computation can be performed.
#+end_quote

Which is just an argument from your own intuitions, so at best you've demonstrated that this /could/ be true and solve the problem. Also this passage from the landauer limit wikipedia page is relevant:

#+begin_quote
  In 2011 the principle was generalized to show that while information erasure requires an increase in entropy, that increase could theoretically occur at no energy cost[6] (instead, the cost can be taken in another conserved quantity like angular momentum).
#+end_quote

As for the claims of me literally spouting gibberish with no semantic meaning and not knowing it due to my own ignorance well don't blame me if I don't exactly trust your assessment because I've encountered more than a few people online who've said the same thing who were unquestionably wrong (for instance someone who claimed to be a psych grad student yet claimed anyone could get a 160 IQ just by studying physics or other similarly intellectual fields).

In this case if you want to play the "you're not an expert in this field game" then I would recommend you read the papers linked to on the wikipedia article on boltzmann brains, because there's writing by /actual particle physicists/ about under which conditions and models of physics boltzmann brains are an issue. And if actual experts think it's a plausible issue then I can basically say with near certainty that you're wrong because the objections they bring up are not at all the same one's you've brought up.\\
However hopefully you can see that that style of meta argument is not exactly the most useful as it has no real chance of either party really learning anything and is definitely guaranteed to lack any conceivable entertainment value.

As for the bit you've tried to call technobabble more than once, I'll just have to try to go into it bit by bit. Firstly you do get the bit about szilard engines right? They are in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_in_thermodynamics_and_information_theory#Szilard.27s_engine][this]] wikipedia article which I couldn've sworn you linked to but looking back at your links I can only see the false vacuum and landaure limit one's so I'm not exactly sure how I ended stumbling upon that one.\\
Anyway do you get how instead of using information to decrease entropy it's possible for pistons/gates operating randomly to accomplish the same thing? Because once you can accomplish something like that in a large system like those examples it seems like there must be something more fundamental happening on the quantum scale, but before considering that you have to get how it works in the simplest scenarios.
