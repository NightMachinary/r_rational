  No, you couldn't. How would you know when to do so? With... some kind of a d√¶mon process? If find this surprising, since you specifically invoked Maxwell's Demon. I assumed you would know the flaws in the thought experiment.

The point of maxwell's demon is that you can extract free energy using a method like that if you disregard the energy that needs to be spent to gain the information that the demon possesses.\\
However the demon just selectively opens a gate to let in particles of a particular temperature, you could also just have that gate operate randomly or was always open. In those cases there would be a non-zero chance that by sheer coincidence only the particles of a given temperature would go through the hole/open gate and you would end up with a temperature differential that could run a heat engine.\\
Similarly a great deal of a particles properties can be probabilistic such that there's a non zero-chance that through its component ingredients quantum tunneling a brain appears on your desk at any given moment.

  Hence the dangers of pop-science. I recommend reading about Feynman diagrams, where virtual particles arise. But it's really the use of quantum foam that gives the game away.

I'm pretty sure my use of quantum foam was consistent with how sources like say fermilab [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYDokJ2A_vU][describe it]].

As for the last part of you comment, well that is one of the classic responses to the boltzmann brain paradox. However, you should note that it still doesn't actually argue against boltzmann brains post-heat death identical to oneself being more common than iterations of oneself before heat death. Saying that the consequences of it being true would make reasoning itself likely impossible doesn't actually solve the problem. After all nobody really seems to propose the boltzmann brain paradox as being true, just that we don't currently have a good basis on which to say why it's wrong.
