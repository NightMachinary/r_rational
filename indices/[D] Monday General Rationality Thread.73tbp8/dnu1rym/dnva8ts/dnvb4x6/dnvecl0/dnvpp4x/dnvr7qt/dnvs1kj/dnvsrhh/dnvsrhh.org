I mean being beyond the laws of nature is very definitely what I was talking about, plus there's typically a understanding that beyond scientific understanding means beyond what it is /possible/ for science to understand.

Thus why you never hear people calling nearly everything in sci-fi supernatural just because it involves tech that we don't currently understand. Also by your definition whether something is supernatural is not an innate quality of an object but a feature of our knowledge about it which is pretty obviously divergent from what people generally consider the term to mean.

Most importantly though it means superintelligence isn't actually supernatural by your definition if it exists anywhere in the universe or in another universe, since that would imply there is somewhere where it /is/ well within scientific understanding.

  You appear to be invoking some kind of quantum magic that does not exist within physics as currently understood.

While it sounds sort of weird if you haven't heard that implication of thermodynamics and quantum physics it's not exactly controversial, in fact it would be basically impossible to deny it as not being trivially true.\\
First off it's worth talking about the fact thermodynamics is statistical, meaning there's a non-zero chance of getting free energy from nowhere even if you never expect to see those sorts of chance occurrences to any significant degree over non-absurd timescales. Quantum phenomenon are similarly probabilistic such that when taking into account virtual particles in the quantum foam there is a non-zero chance of any configuration of matter coming into existence from nothing (which shouldn't be surprising since thermodynamics already allows for that, given the right random configuration of matter could allow that with classical physics).
