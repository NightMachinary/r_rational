  the definition which involves violating any natural laws that has been the one i've heard at literally every other time in my life

If your experience is limited to stories about vampire and werewolves... sure. My dictionary gives me this definition: "attributed to some force beyond scientific understanding or the laws of nature". Since there is absolutely no scientific understanding of superintelligence, I think it's safe to say it would be supernatural by today's reckoning. A quick street survey should verify this.

You appear to be invoking some kind of quantum magic that does not exist within physics as currently understood.
