When it comes to normal matter randomly arranging in various ways that's not really necessary here. Because it occurs to me that you could get a ming or other process at random for a moment just from entropy reversals without requiring increases in total energy.\\
After all you've probably seen [[https://xkcd.com/505/][this xkcd comic before]] the only necessary thing here is that something /anything/ happen in an orderly way. So just random oscillations in quantum foam (as in what's talked about in that fermilab video) will /eventually/ occur in a way that is ordered in the right way as to be a mind for a single instant.

That's sort of the thing about boltzmann brains, so long as time continues and things are occurring you ought to get them inevitably and things on the quantum level even in a vacuum aren't what it seems like you could call nothing happening. Though I suppose this is likely going to vary somewhat on the model of quantum mechanics and in what sense the wavefunction is actually "real" (though if it acts in a consistent way I'm not even sure it needs to be real in any other sense for boltzmann brains to be an issue).

Also you never said any reason why the totally random maxwell's demon scenario presented wouldn't work, so if you can set up arrangements of matter which have a nonzero chance of generating free energy. Then it seems far more likely that there's /some/ random quantum events which can do the same in lieu of any matter given infinite time to work with.
