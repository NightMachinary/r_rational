  Similarly a great deal of a particles properties can be probabilistic such that there's a non zero-chance that through its component ingredients quantum tunneling a brain appears on your desk at any given moment.

While the odds of this may be non-zero at any given time, your mistake here is thinking that the sum of the probabilities over all of space and time is infinite. This is not true.

If the energy density of the universe (post heat-death) were constant, you might expect to find an arbitrarily large concentration of energy at some point if you waited long enough. But the universe is also expanding, meaning that the energy density is continually decreasing. The lower the energy density, the lower the chances of there being a given level of energy concentration. If the rate of expansion were constant, the density would follow an inverse square law over time. Cosmology suggests the rate of expansion is in fact increasing, and will continue doing so forever, making the situation even worse. Integrating the probability over space and time will yield a finite number, so the chances of energy ever randomly concentrating to the level needed for a boltzmann brain is negligible.

Furthermore, the probability of this happening eventually drops from vanishingly small to zero. The amount of energy in the observable universe is finite. Furthermore, it is decreasing (due to expansion) and will continue to decrease forever. Given time, the amount of energy in the observable universe (from a given point) will fall below any given threshold. Once that happens, there will be no probability whatsoever of the necessary energy randomly coalescing.
