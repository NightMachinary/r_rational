While an interesting framing I don't think it fundamentally changes the problem. I prefer to view the Fermi paradox through the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter][The Great Filter]] and for reasons that mostly reduce my personal feeling of existential dread, I take it to be around the development of single cell life. To me this means that humanity has already passed the biggest hurdle and can go on to continue with eventually colonizing the stars.

From there I make the assumption that that sentient life is extremely rare on the order of about ~1 planet developing sentient species per galaxy. As the distance between galaxies is extremely large I except sub-light speed travel between galaxies to be extremely difficult and it would explain why this galaxy hasn't been colonized already.

Thus the reason the galaxy isn't just paperclips is the same reason we don't see aliens, it's just too rare.
