Anyone want some accountability and pomodoro buddies? I just found this link to a lesswrong study hall via facebook: [[https://complice.co/room/lesswrong]] (lesswrong for those who don't know is a rationalist hub type place)

I've been hanging around on it the past couple of days (probably won't be there today), and it's been very useful for motivating me to meet my personal productivity goals as a "commitment device". Admittedly I've only been using it two days but they've been extremely productive days.

The "complice" website itself seems pretty good too (but expensive! 120 USD/year - I'm on a 2 week trial at the moment), but the study room is free at least.

Would be great to see some of you folks around. Over the next few weeks I'm hopefully going to put some 'doros on my day-to-day job (traffic engineer), my writing project (supernatural romance), and my new degree (nutrition).
