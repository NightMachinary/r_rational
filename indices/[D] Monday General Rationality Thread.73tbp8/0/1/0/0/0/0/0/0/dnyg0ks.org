Well I mean the superintelligence an AI is not actually the relevant factor that makes those type of bizzare philosophical things come into play. You could well have many of the same difficulties when dealings with ems. In fact it should probably be obvious that technology that can affect/create minds in ways never previously possible would massively expand the realm of things to consider in possibility space from the perspective of entities that happen to be minds.\\
SI is only relevant in that it will be most likely to produce much of the tech that makes these scenarios relevant.

As for acausal type reasoning i'm not sure it really counts as not affecting the universe in any way since in most scenarios that involve it, it does affect the universe at some point. After all newcomb's problem is obviously framed in a scenario where acausal reasoning does affect the real world (or rather world of the scenario).
