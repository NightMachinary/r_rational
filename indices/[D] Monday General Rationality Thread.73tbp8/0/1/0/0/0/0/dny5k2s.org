  Of course, people should also be careful not to conflate "much more capable of optimizing its environment than the most effective known groups of humans" with "god's-eye-view optimal knowledge of literally everything, including metaphysical constructs such as alternate universes."

I mean whether it's able to deduce knowledge of things that do not interact with our reality in any way is sort of irrelevant when considering it's capabilities, because unless it has certain particular human quirks (which even FAI have no reason to have) it won't care about those things.\\
Of course when it comes to things that are a part of our universe it will need some way to obtain the information, but that may require massively less observation to build it's models than seems remotely sensible to humans. Einstein saying if the experiments didn't demonstrate relativity then the experimenters must have made a mistake and all that.
