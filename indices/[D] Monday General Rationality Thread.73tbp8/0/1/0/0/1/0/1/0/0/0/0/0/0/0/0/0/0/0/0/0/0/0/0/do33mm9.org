  Then it would be useful for your to actually explain why/link to something explaining what you mean here, since anything else has next to no value online. After all it's not exactly clear how if a probability never reaches zero it isn't bound to happen multiplied over infinite time and an exponentially expanding space for it to occur in.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus][Calculus]] still says you are [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improper_integral][wrong]]. If you did not already know this, then nothing you "know" about physics is trustworthy. What you "know" about probability and statistics is also highly suspect. You have literally been putting words together in ways that do not make sense, because you do not comprehend your own ignorance. And I strongly suspect that you have never studied (with a textbook, not a "science" video) quantum mechanics, relativity, statistical mechanics, or any of the other fields you're trying to talk about.
