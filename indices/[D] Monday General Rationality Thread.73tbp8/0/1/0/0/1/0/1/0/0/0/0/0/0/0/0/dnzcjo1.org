  Also you never said any reason why the totally random maxwell's demon scenario presented wouldn't work, so if you can set up arrangements of matter which have a nonzero chance of generating free energy. Then it seems far more likely that there's some random quantum events which can do the same in lieu of any matter given infinite time to work with.

It doesn't work because you can't attach an engine to extract the energy. If the engine were already there, it would prevent the buildup from happening in the first place. If it wasn't, there's no way to know when to attach it without using energy in the observation process.

  it occurs to me that you could get a ming or other process at random for a moment just from entropy reversals without requiring increases in total energy.

A description of a system is not the system itself. A description is not subject to the passage of time. A simulation isn't happening either, because computation requires energy expenditure.

But like I said, no one knows the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_vacuum][eventual fate of the universe]].
