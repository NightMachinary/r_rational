  First off it's worth talking about the fact thermodynamics is statistical, meaning there's a non-zero chance of getting free energy from nowhere even if you never expect to see those sorts of chance occurrences to any significant degree over non-absurd timescales. Quantum phenomenon are similarly probabilistic such that when taking into account virtual particles in the quantum foam there is a non-zero chance of any configuration of matter coming into existence from nothing (which shouldn't be surprising since thermodynamics already allows for that, given the right random configuration of matter could allow that with classical physics).

This is technobabble. It reads like a bunch of pop-science references, but does not correlate to any known physical laws.

Explicitly false. At the very least, global conservation rules must be satisfied. I don't know your educational level, but I recommend learning more physics.

There's no reason to believe such timescales are even possible. Cosmologically speaking, no one knows what the underlying structure of the universe will do once the protons decay and the galactic blackholes evaporate.
