  You could then simply run a heat engine between the two sides.

No, you couldn't. How would you know when to do so? With... some kind of a d√¶mon process? If find this surprising, since you specifically invoked Maxwell's Demon. I assumed you would know the flaws in the thought experiment.

  Virtual particles, quantum foam and every other term used has a well established scientific definition which as far as I can tell I'm using correctly.

Hence the dangers of pop-science. I recommend reading about [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman_diagram][Feynman diagrams]], where virtual particles arise. But it's really the use of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_foam][quantum foam]] that gives the game away.

But back to the issue at hand, since I have devised a far more compelling counter argument.

Suppose that an entity does spontaneously [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02a2HSB58M][pop into existence]], complete with knowledge of quantum physics, thermodynamics, cosmology, anthropy, etc. Is it more or less likely to come into existence with beliefs that are correct concerning the universe it is now a part of, or incorrect?

That is to say, if you were to postulate that you just now began to exist, you would also have to postulate that your beliefs about how the universe works are almost certainly wrong. So, as long as we further postulate that our beliefs are correct, we must also suppose that they are incomplete in some manner that makes the Boltzmann postulate unlikely.
