Oh right I thought you meant thinking superintelligence /couldn't/ exist required believing in the supernatural, but yeah I didn't think you were actually saying that yourself since it would seem so outside the overton window around these parts.

But yeah upon explanation I can't really disagree with you, on the grounds that your definition of supernatural is sort of trivial and bears no resemblance to the definition which involves violating any natural laws that has been the one i've heard at literally every other time in my life.

Still I think it's amusing that you say you don't mean paranormal, since you could use a definition of "paranormal" similar to how you defined supernatural that would still be equally linguistically correct (in terms of the meaning of the prefixes) and mean the exact same thing as how you're using supernatural. After all "para" can just mean abnormal.\\
However, in both cases it would seem clear that using the words that way, even if correct by some linguistic definitions is clearly wrong on the standard of how words are actually used (which is the only way any language derives meaning anyway) as well as nearly gaurenteed to confuse almost everyone you talk to unless you constantly spend time clarifying that "supernatural"=/=/supernatural/

  It sounds like what you're not saying is that we're most likely already a part of a massive galaxy-spanning superintelligence. The implications...

Oh no I was referring to boltzmann brains, basically if time continues forward forever, then eventually vastly more conscious brains created by pure random quantum events will have existed for some period of time than minds from before the heat death of the universe ever did.\\
Thus if there will only be a set number of minds like your own before the heat death, but an arbitrarily large amount of boltzmann brain versions after heat death then the odds are ~100% that you are a brain just created out of nothing in an empty universe deluded by a whole set of false memories of events before the heat death. Meaning that you ought to predict with great confidence that you will almost immediately stop experiencing the hallucination of your current existence and begin dying due to lack of sustenance in the next few moments.\\
So if you accept the fairly solid seeming premises then it seems as though one must conclude that you were only created at this very moment and will in a mere instant from now cease to exist or begin dying.
