  quantum foam
#+end_quote

Please, please, please try to understand. This is not a thing. There are no physical models in which "quantum foam" arises and that also correspond to reality. This is a pop-science term with no relation to reality.

  as long as the probability isn't exactly 0 then given an infinite period of heat death it's bound to occur arbitrarily many times.
#+end_quote

Again, that ignorance. Calculus, my friend. It says you are wrong.

  My point about reversible computing is that it could in theory use no energy
#+end_quote

Arbitrarily small is not the same as none.

#+begin_quote
  You need to actually be able to come up with a reason the likelihood of it happening (within our current models of reality at least) is exactly 0.
#+end_quote

Calculus disagrees.

  Importantly this seems like it must also allow quantum fluctuations to have a miniscule chance of violating conservation laws as well. After all while the setup imagined isn't at the quantum scale, whatever it would do to get that free energy would need to occur at the quantum scale if you looked closely enough. As in if you zoomed in enough somewhere on the quantum level you would need to see particles or energy arising from nowhere in some part of the system, thus there needs to be some sort of extremely unlikely type of quantum interactions which can occur that violate conservation. That one could theoretically get those results at the quantum level involving only a single photon (since at heat death all you have is photons separated by the cosmic horizon from each other) and some interaction with the quantum foam seems like a considerable possibility.

No. All of it. No. This is technobabble, again.

  So a bunch of randomly bouncing rocks form patterns over time which match up to what would be formed in that XKCD comic, it ought to also simulate a universe the same way.
#+end_quote

A recording of an event, no matter how detailed, is not the event itself. The simulation must actually be performed. This requires actually computations, not a random output being created.
