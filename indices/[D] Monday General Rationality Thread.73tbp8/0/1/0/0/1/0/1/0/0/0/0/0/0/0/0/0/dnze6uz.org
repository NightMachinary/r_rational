  It doesn't work because you can't attach an engine to extract the energy. If the engine were already there, it would prevent the buildup from happening in the first place. If it wasn't, there's no way to know when to attach it without using energy in the observation process.

Just stick any number of heat engines in it they aren't the issue here. Again the whole point of this scenario is that you can get around having to spend energy on observation through extreme coincidence. After all the observation the demon's doing is only really serving as a probability pump in this scenario, thus my point about how sheer chance could accomplish the same thing at a nonzero chance. If the heat engine is in the middle with gates around it then there's a nonzero chance the gas sorts itself into hot and cold sides and continually powers the engine in doing so.

  A description of a system is not the system itself. A description is not subject to the passage of time. A simulation isn't happening either, because computation requires energy expenditure.

It's not /just/ a description, it corresponds to real behavior plus it kind of is subject to the passage of time, after all what would it even mean to call them quantum fluctuations without time?\\
As for computation requiring energy that doesn't really work here since. Computing in theory doesn't need to cost energy if it's reversible and whether this really counts as "computing" is highly questionable. After all while you need energy to do computation normally this seems pretty heavily an entropic process which is statistical. If you have a probability pump of unlimited power (which is sort of what this is) then you can use the monkies on a typewriter method to get whatever information you want without anything resembling computation happening.\\
That's my point that random fluctuations in /anything/ could replicate the actions of computational process even if no real computation is taking place (but it would /look/ the same which is what matters for this). It's like a version of the xkcd comic where the rocks bounce around randomly, given enough time any pattern that occurred in the original deliberate system would be replicated purely by chance.
