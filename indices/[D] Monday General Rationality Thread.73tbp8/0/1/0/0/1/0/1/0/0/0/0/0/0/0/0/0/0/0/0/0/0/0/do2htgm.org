  Again, that ignorance. Calculus, my friend. It says you are wrong.

Then it would be useful for your to actually explain why/link to something explaining what you mean here, since anything else has next to no value online. After all it's not exactly clear how if a probability never reaches zero it isn't bound to happen multiplied over infinite time and an exponentially expanding space for it to occur in.

  Please, please, please try to understand. This is not a thing. There are no physical models in which "quantum foam" arises and that also correspond to reality. This is a pop-science term with no relation to reality.
#+end_quote

In many worlds the wavefunction is actually "real", it's just copenhagen where the wavefunction isn't treated as real. Also I feel like I /already/ covered how quantum foam is a term used in the actual science, I already linked a fermilab video I mean I could link the wikipedia article as well but you have google as well.

  A recording of an event, no matter how detailed, is not the event itself. The simulation must actually be performed. This requires actually computations, not a random output being created.
#+end_quote

See it seems like it fundamentally can't be possible for a system which is indistinguishable from a simulation to not also be a simulation. Sure you can come up with descriptions that aren't simulations but none of those are one to one matching patterns over time. For two arrangements of matter over time which are indistinguishable to /not/ both be simulations or not would seem to require that that property of the system not actually be purely a result of its physical state or behavior. Which strikes me as impossible if literally all anything can ever be is it's physical states and behavior.

  No. All of it. No. This is technobabble, again.
#+end_quote

Look I already covered how specifically I'm using quantum foam here before. Secondly I've brought up the fact szilard engine type systems seem to let you get free energy if entropy is violated (entropy being unquestionably a statistical phenomenon) before and you still haven't addressed it which is getting annoying since it's quite relevant here.\\
As for the rest of the passage you called technobabble I simply stated that if you can get overunity in a large non-quantum system, then it makes it seem plausible that there's some sort of quantum interaction a photon could have which might leverage that. Though I encourage you to actually say what you think I was unclear about rather than claiming it all must be gibberish.
