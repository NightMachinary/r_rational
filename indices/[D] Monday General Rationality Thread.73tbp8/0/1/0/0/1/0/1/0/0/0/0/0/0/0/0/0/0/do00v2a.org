  It's not just a description, it corresponds to real behavior plus it kind of is subject to the passage of time, after all what would it even mean to call them quantum fluctuations without time?

A picture of a thing is not the thing itself. While the picture is subject to the passage of time, the subject of the picture is not.

Again, a picture of a thing is not equivalent to the thing itself. A simulation of it might be considered to be the thing, but a picture of a simulation is neither the simulation nor the thing.
