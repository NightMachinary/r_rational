You know what let's just demonstrate thermodynamics is statistical in a special case first. It should be trivially easy to just imagine the standard maxwell's demon scenario (that demonstrates information requires thermodynamic work to obtain). Then if you just play that scenario out long enough then it is /eventually/ inevitable you will end up with a disparity in heat between the two chambers. You could then simply run a heat engine between the two sides.

As for my post being technobabble it demonstrably isn't. Virtual particles, quantum foam and every other term used has a well established scientific definition which as far as I can tell I'm using correctly.
