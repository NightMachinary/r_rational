That reasoning doesn't hold up under inspection.

Consider: Andromeda is about 2.5 million light years away, with twice the number of stars as the Milky Way. That distance is decreasing to zero. So, the chance of sentient life developing in Andromeda is twice that of it developing in our own galaxy, and the journey between galaxies, while long, should not be particularly difficult. For a patient entity with a maximization function, jumping to the Milky Way should be an obvious step.
