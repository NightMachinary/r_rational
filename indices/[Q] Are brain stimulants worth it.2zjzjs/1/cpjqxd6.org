[[/r/rational]] is "*A subreddit dedicated to the discussion of works of rational and rationalist fiction.*"

That might be correlated with interest in this kind of question, but it's not what we're about. This would be a better fit on [[/r/transhuman]], [[/r/lifehacks]], or /r/notactuallyrationalistadvice.

Imagine a work of rationalist fiction. The setting: a world twenty minutes into the future. The character: a student watching his peers turn to drugs to keep an edge. The question: does the student do drugs? What are the (long term?) effects? How does rational thought come into it?

Protip: just as dark is not always evil (but usually /is/), illegal drugs tend to be a /very very very/ bad idea. That story isn't going to end well.

So let's stay safe, and stay on topic.
