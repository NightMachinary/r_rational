Alcoholism is a sign of genetic addiction tendencies, from what I've read, but it's not a clear sign. Nicotine addiction isn't a sign at all. It's one of the most addictive drugs known to man, and about the only thing genetic you might be able to say about it is that if your family has a tendency to be able to drop smoking as a habit, easily, your family may not have enhanced tendencies toward addiction. However, as with anything genetic that doesn't clearly express itself in a measureable way, whether or not you inherited addictive tendencies is a guess until you know yourself, which is something few college-age young people are capable of.

I know I have addictive tendencies after 43 years of experience knowing myself. I now watch myself for patterns all the time and do my best to avoid exposure to harmful addictions. I avoid prescription pain medicines like the plague, and won't go anywhere that people smoke if I can avoid it. I smoked for twenty-two years and even now, nearly five years after quitting, every single time I get into my truck to drive anywhere, I want a cigarette.

Using addictive drugs in order to improve the quality of your education is a severe risk. I'll tentatively say that nobody here is going to say it's a good idea, because that would be a risk to US either in reality as an accomplice of some sort, or figuratively if we later discover you became a life-failure because of advice given here and mentally beat ourselves up for it.

I could have just said 'Not here. Go ask somewhere else.' but figured I'd give you a little food for thought first.

Now, I'll say it.

Please, not here. Go ask somewhere else.
