I'm not sure. That's why I need information.

I suppose when addiction becomes a factor, it's already too late to be objective, right?

Are there tells that one might be particularly bad/good at this? My family contains quite some alcoholics and smokers, how important is that? What are warning signs that you become addicted? How bad is addiction of these drugs, (Erd≈ës seemed to be okay)? Are they all equally addictive or are they different? Is there a way to use, like one would use coffee? Where there is an addiction, but it is not really harmful?
