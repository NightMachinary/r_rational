This is partially true, but it does ignore the fact that sometimes massive societal changes pivot on the action or inaction of singular powerful individuals.For example, if the Nazi party had a significantly less charismatic leader, there is an argument to be made that they may not have been able to win the initial popular election.

Both are true, societies have momentum that can bulldoze over millions of individuals, but individuals can sometimes be elevated to extreme heights of influence and completely alter the course of a nation and the world.

I'm reminded of an excellent book "Time and Time Again" by Ben Elton which shows the truth of both of these Killing Hitler stops world war 2 as it happened, but often leads to far worse outcomes. Most of the time Hitler isn't even responsible for WW2, its other people.
