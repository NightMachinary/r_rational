While I agree with you that a bottom up worldbuilding approach would lead to significally difference characters I think that for many people such a time travel story would be less appealing because it makes non-time traveling characters insignificant to the reader since they'd be erased once the character jumped back again.

I recall a time traveling story with romantic elements and I kept wondering if they were going to follow the relationship elevator and get a child just for the child to disappear once they jumped back.

On a related note I think it's very reasonable to consider time travel to be genocide(and gods below I wish more stories explored those implications). The newest chapters of WtC have had me thinking about what they call 'Supremacy of Existance' as a term for the position that existing and then not existing reigns supreme over not existing in the first place. I know that isn't what the term refers to in the WtC universe but it seems apt and I am wondering why I haven't encountered that position in fictional works.
