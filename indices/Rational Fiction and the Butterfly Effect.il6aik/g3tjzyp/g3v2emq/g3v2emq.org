It would be interesting to see what sort of experimental evidence you could get in such a universe. Perhaps the following:

1. Measure the number of radioactive decay events from a source. Let is be n_1
2. Send the number back in time
3. Measure the decay events again over the same time interval. Let the second measurement be n_2
4. Result: n_1 and n_2 are more correlated than they have any right to be

I wonder if this would have interesting implications.
