When it comes to time travel, yes, fiction that doesn't take into account butterfly effects is vastly unrealistic. When it comes to changing the backstory of fiction, as an author operation rather than as a postulated Peggy Sue or other in-story time-travel or change relative to a previous in-story timeline, this is not necessarily an operation on a timeline that obeys strict physics. It happens on a literary level; it's not something that's supposed to be inside any kind of physics, realistically chaotic or otherwise. You might as well castigate the author for failing to correctly simulate their entire universe on a quantum level. In a Watsonian sense the original Harry Potter universe doesn't exist inside the HPMOR-metaverse, so there's no in-story unrealism about James and Lily "still falling in love" because in-story there's no other universe for them to be "still falling in love" relative to. Asking for an in-story time-travel effect to obey Butterfly is scientific; asking for an out-of-story changed postulate to obey Butterfly is scientism - asking for something to imitate a sciency phenomenon that there is no reason for it to actually imitate.
