For single worldline time travel, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy already has it covered: You can't change anything with time travel, because you've already done everything you're going to do with it and the effects have already been made manifest. For softer fiction that doesn't abide by this obvious ironclad rule, well, you can't go back in time if you unmake yourself so the universe has to contort itself into a timeline where you exist.

For fiction with multiple worldlines, well, they're more akin to sliders with a significant divergence limiter imposed on their travel. Just tourists, effectively.

So for something like Back to the Future, its rules are just a little immersion breaking if you think about them seriously. For something like Bill and Ted, well, we wouldn't even think to hold them to this standard.

Edit: Some of this is applicable to the dimension you exist in right now. Hydrogen is obviously Harry Potter magic nonsense. That it would form stars that build heavier elements is almost as nonsensical. That they would die and the heavier elements would form planets, totally coo-coo. That abiogenesis would form life, which after billions of years result in multicellular organisms, completely wacky. That the specific lineage of jellyfish had sex with the right kinds of jellyfish over hundreds of millions of years to produce you... to say this is statistically improbable is more than a stretch.

Multiverse theory sounds feasible.
