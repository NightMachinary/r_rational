yes and no. There are plenty of crucial decisions that are made by an individual, not by society.

Take your Hitler example. If you killed Hitler long before he came to power, then most like NSDAP would not rise to power without their charismatic spokesman. The main parties back then in Germany were Nationalists, Imperialists, and Communists, NOT National Socialists. WIthout Hitler, the most likely scenario is either that Imperialists merge with Nationalists, and bring the Kaiser to power, OR Communists gain the upper hand and Germany joins the Soviet Block.

Imperialist option means far less violent WW2 and no Holocaust, Communist option means no WW2 at all, but rather a slow Soviet conquest.
