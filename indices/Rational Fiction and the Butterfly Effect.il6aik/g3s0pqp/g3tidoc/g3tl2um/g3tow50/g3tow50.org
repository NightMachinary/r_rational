I picked Hitler example here precisely because NSDAP was doing rather poorly without him, and were very unlikely to win without his influence. They did not gain suppoert by a landslide, it was a slow creep of popularity based for the most part on his charisma, and it was his ideas that formed the crux of Nazi ideology. Without him, National-Socialist would be exactly what it says on the tin, with him, they became anti-socialist race supremacists.
