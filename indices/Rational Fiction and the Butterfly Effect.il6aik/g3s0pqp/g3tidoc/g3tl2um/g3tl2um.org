That's where I disagree actually.

To keep the Hitler example, his party did not rise solely thanks to him. For every speech, every action, he had his party behind him, and he was as influenced by it as he influenced it (he probably became the leader because he held the same view as his party too). Remove Hitler and the party pushes the next most charismatic person it has, but the context is still the same and prone to having a Nazi party and WW2 coming, and most big decisions would still be the sames because the same people would push for them.

Of course, some things would change. The party would probably have been a bit less efficient, and this could have been enough to tip the scale in another direction. Though I believe you would need to remove way more than one person to have significant changes.

For each historical character that rose to power, there is another person that could have fit the same position but was not pushed by his peers because the other option seemed better
