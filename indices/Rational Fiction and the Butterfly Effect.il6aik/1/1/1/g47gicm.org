It's somewhat of a balancing act; continuing your example of Harriet Potter, presumably both the audience and the writer want a story that examines how a genderbent Harry Potter would work. If Harriet is too different a character than Harry, then while the world building and knock in effects might have been handled well, the author has failed in their task.
