True, and I agree we generally accept that. But also, the /enjoyment/ derived from the story lies in the deviations. If I copy-pasted the Harry Potter novels, Ctrl+R'ing all occurrences of "Harry" with "Harriette", and called that a what if genderbent fanfiction where Harry is a lesbian girl I would... get a copyright strike, I guess, but also make something that's really boring for a reader of the originals. The fun is in seeing consequences, not as unexpected as to see random, but neither as expected as to feel too predictable. It's a balance. But this is certainly about just making a good story of a certain genre, not about being accurate to the temporal mechanics of parallel timelines of fictional worlds.
