For more on the difference between non-deterministic and unpredictable, see [[https://www.scottaaronson.com/democritus/lec18.html]]

Some of your cases (conception) seem reasonable, others not so much (firefight), and overall I take issue with your reasoning that "logically, X should happen", as we're dealing with probabilities not arithmetic.\\
Consider the firefight. Model it as, say, 10 rolls of a d10, looking for a 10. Timeline modifications, IMO, might change the outcome of any given die roll, but that might just mean the third shot hits instead of the sixth, or vice versa. Ditto for cancer and relationships; any situation where something repeated is occurring and it only has to "succeed" once.

Notably, and AFAIK, this includes all chemical reactions - two molecules have to encounter each other with the right orientation, etc, and then the magic happens.
