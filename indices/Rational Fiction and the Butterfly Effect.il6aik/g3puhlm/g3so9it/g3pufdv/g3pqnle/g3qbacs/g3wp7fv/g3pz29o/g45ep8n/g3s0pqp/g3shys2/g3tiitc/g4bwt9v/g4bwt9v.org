European Jews were /supposed/ to be expulsed initially. Hell, at some point there were even plans to settle them all im Madagascar, of all places. But no country was willing to take them or even facilitate their transportation. And that, compounded by ever growing anti-semitic propaganda and hatred, lead to this eventual "final solution". So it might well be that the holocaust would have not quite happened, but the Jewish population had been scapegoated in Europe for centuries, so I can't imagine any rising German nationalists of the time to have treated them well.
