Granted, but a "what if" scenario that truly accounted for complexity to that degree soon would turn just into its own story. I dislike what ifs that stick /too/ faithfully to canon too - they make no sense, in my opinion (one example, though I overall didn't hate the story: "The Arithmancer" and sequel, where the plot sticks REMARKABLY close to the original Harry Potter books even years down the line for being a completely new timeline where Hermione Granger is the heroine). However, deviate too much and the story and world become unrecognizable.

In the end the very concept of a counterfactual is a purely speculative one, so I'm willing to cut some slack. I won't complain if the firefight started in the same circumstances just /happens/ to go in the same way. But sure, if someone leaves by car three hours later than they ought to and STILL has the same exact accident, I call bullshit. Conception is problematic because effectively almost ANY baby conceived after the divergence event should be affected, which would often erase a lot of our familiar cast. Not really feasible.
