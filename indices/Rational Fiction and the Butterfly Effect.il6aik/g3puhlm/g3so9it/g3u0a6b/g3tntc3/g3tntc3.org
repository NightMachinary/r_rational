  asking for an out-of-story changed postulate to obey Butterfly is scientism - asking for something to imitate a sciency phenomenon that there is no reason for it to actually imitate.

I mean, the obvious reason for that is to tingle the figgin of nerdy people, who would otherwise nit-pick the incongruence. But even if we ignore the sciency angle of the Butterly effect, there should still be a serious consideration to the social, human2human effect.

Example: What if HP was born a girl, Harriet Potter? Most fanfics would only consider the narrow romantic/erotic angle, ignoring the fact that it would have a pretty big impact on the entire story, and each and every character throughout. To do otherwise, would be to either consider gender to be socially irrelevant in HP verse (thus introducing an even bigger issue to solve), or make everybody act as if Harriet was Harry, as if they were reading from the wrong script.

This applies to much all of the other forms of backstory manipulation. Either the author has to do the work and adjust all these little butterly changes, or risk our suspension of disbelief to...well maybe not be broken but lift its eyebrows and do some double takes. If a backstory change does not result in a pretty complex Butterfly, and the plot stays largely the same, it requires us to believe in a very big pile of coincidences, or fate (also known as writer's laziness;) ).
