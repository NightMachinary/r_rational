  Most fanfics would only consider the narrow romantic/erotic angle, ignoring the fact that it would have a pretty big impact on the entire story, and each and every character throughout.

Sure, that's what I call "a lack of imagination", because exploring all of that would actually make the story MORE interesting and fun. But "Harry Potter was born a girl, Harriet, therefore every character born after July 31st, 1980 (such as Luna Lovegood and Ginny Weasley) does not exist any more and was replaced by someone else" may be taking it a bit too far.
