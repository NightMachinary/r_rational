This makes no sense; the creator of an original work simply POSITS, as a postulate, that things went like this and that. We have no information or details on the sexual life of the Potters, and there is no reason to believe it unbelievable that their gametes would combine to conceive Harry (a boy that we're repeatedly told looks a lot like his father, but has his mother's eyes; pretty believable). The problem only arises when you decide to make a derivative work that can be summed up as "original work but instead of X, Y". Because the logic of such works is /exactly/ to extrapolate in which ways precisely that single change snowballs into more consequences down the line.
