I disagree with you because if read like that, even the original work doesn't account for "butterfly effects". Like, why was Rowling's original Harry Potter a boy instead of a girl? Did Rowling make sure that James and Lily had sex in the right moment? Did she toss a coin before starting to write the series? Did she do so for every character?

And what about broader history? Why did the USA form pretty much like IRL in a world that is so massively different?

Honestly, taking it to this extent makes any and all works of fiction, derivative or otherwise, unworkable until the day where quantum computers can simulate worlds passably.
