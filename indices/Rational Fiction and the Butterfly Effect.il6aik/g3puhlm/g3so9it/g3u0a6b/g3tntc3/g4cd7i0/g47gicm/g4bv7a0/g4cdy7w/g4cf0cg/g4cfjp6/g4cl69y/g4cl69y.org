The point is that changing something in the original to make a fanfic with some things but not everything changed is nothing like time travel. You don't stick your hand into a parallel universe where Harry Potter is real and change him into a girl (or whatever other AU change you want to make) and then have to account for all the physical dominoes as you speculate on what changes your intervention caused. You are writing a new story, building a new universe to your specifications that happens to bare certain stricking similarities to the universe of another story while also having certain differences that are significant to the story you want to create. As long as there is no in-universe time travel involved the author is under no obligation to act as if his story is subject to the Butterfly Effect, even if he wants to keep things rational and consistent. Just like an author that edits some thing in the first chapter of his original work doesn't have to roll dice on every subsequent scene to preserve continuity.
