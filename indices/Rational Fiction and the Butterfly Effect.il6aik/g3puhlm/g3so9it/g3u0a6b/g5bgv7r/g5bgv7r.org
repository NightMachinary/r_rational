Not Eliezer, but I read HPMOR-universe as the story as published, and HPMOR-metaverse as the story as a concept: the story as it's currently published, the earlier revisions as it was being published and revised, every comment that's Word Of God from EY expanding or contracting the canonicity of certain points, and all the omakes, sequels, sidequels and prequels by other writers.
