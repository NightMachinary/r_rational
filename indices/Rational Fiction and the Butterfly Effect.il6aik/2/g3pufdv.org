Conception is a huge one. Changing the time of conception by seconds (or even milliseconds) will completely change the sperm that arrive at the egg, and the child will get completely different paternal genes.

Doc Brown: "Sorry, Marty, Even if you get your parents back together, they're going to have completely different kids. On the plus side, that "erased from time" schtick doesn't make any sense either, now I think of it. I guess your photo just got wet or something... you'll still exist when you get back to the future, you'll just be a homeless orphan."

Limiting time travel to the recent past, or splitting the timestream when you go back, are pretty much the only ways to stay "hard" without confronting the time traveler with being a mass murderer of everyone they knew before the trip.

Or you can invoke the Novikov self-consistency principle and every time you go back to the past you're unable to change the resulting timeline. If you do interfere with the past your interference turns out to have already happened in the "original" timeline. That stranger who pulled your mother out of the car accident where your elder brother died as an infant? that was you arriving too late to stop the car accident.
