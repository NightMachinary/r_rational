I agree with you that that's how things would work in real life.

However, fiction is generally less about hyperrealism and more about telling a particular story that the author wants to tell. And that's true even when applied to rational fiction.

Unless you want to make your story /about/ the changes that would happen as a result of the butterfly effect (which a fair number of science fiction stories have done), then you'd have to spend a chapter explaining all of the differences between this timeline and the previous one, every time you jumped back to the present, and that just sounds tedious both to write and to read.

This is one of those instances, like FTL, where I really don't mind things being scientifically inaccurate, as long as it's in service towards telling a more compelling story.

After all, a lot of rational fiction is fanfiction with a point of departure well into the past, and if you take your premise to its logical conclusion, then most rational fanfiction would be a bunch of OCs doing stuff that doesn't really resemble the original plot all that much, in which case, what's the point of writing it as fanfiction in the first place, rather than as something original?
