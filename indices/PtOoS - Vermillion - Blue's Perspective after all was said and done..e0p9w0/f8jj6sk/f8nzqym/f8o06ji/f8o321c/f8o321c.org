  Maybe he thinks that he doesn't need saving because he's made the decision to risk his life - it's a waste of effort.

By that logic, he should not blame Red for failing to save Aiko. From what I could see, Blue wasn't really upset about Red failing to rescue the people who originally got stuck in the building; he was upset because Aiko went and Red, as her friend, did not. But Aiko freely chose to put herself in harm's way like that, so if that means that she doesn't need saving, then Red did the right thing.
