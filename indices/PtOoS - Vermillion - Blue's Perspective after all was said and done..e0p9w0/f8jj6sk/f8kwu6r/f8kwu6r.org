Blue has a fantasy of getting himself hurt to protect others. Not a fantasy he daydreams about, but he has decided long ago that he is a hero; his ego couldn't handle it if he didn't see himself as a hero. And if he has to put his life on the line to protect someone else, well, that's what heroes do.

But he can't handle it when others (especially people he loves) put their life on the line to protect him. Even though he sees his grandpa as a hero!
