I think Blue was more upset that Red isn't bothered that Red thinks the way he does more than anything. IE if Red felt bad about not going in after Aiko Blue would've immediately forgiven him, but Red argues he made the right decision and felt no trepidation about his decision whatsoever. Blue also seems to think Red can't actually be heroic until he's actually thought the situation through, as if human life is mathematically quantifiable like that, which is an affront to blue. Imo Red /is/ right, but his almost remorseless defense of his own actions in conjunction with the death of a close friend rattled Blue just a bit too much, and neither one wants to understand where the other is coming from.
