Oh, I thought I addressed that in the OP.

Blue doesn't see a double standard in his behaviour. Blue doesn't see it as necessary for Professor Oak to protect Blue, because Blue wasn't ever in active threat of death. Professor Oak going into the storm actively puts Professor Oak into danger (dying of Pressure), even though Blue doesn't need saving.

Blue sees Red's behaviour in the storm as wrong, because Blue would have gotten himself killed alongside Aiko. Blue tried politely to convince Red, over the months they were together, but has decided now that it's impossible.

Professor Oak sees both of these problems as one: Blue will get himself killed if Professor Oak isn't there to distract/protect him. Blue doesn't see it that way. Ironically, he sees Professor Oak's sacrifice much the same way Red analyzes whether people are worth saving.
