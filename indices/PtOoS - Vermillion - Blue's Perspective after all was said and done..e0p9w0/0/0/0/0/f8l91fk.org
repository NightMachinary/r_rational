Red plans for what goals he'd like to reach, but he doesn't really take his own happiness into account when making those plans (other than that achieving the goals makes him happy). He knows on a surface level that he desires companionship, but he never includes that in his plans until he's about to make the decision to cut a possible companionship.

I think he wants Blue back, but he also wants to change Blue to be slightly less morally-opposed to his decision making process. He wants Blue to see the value in logic, so that Blue can succeed.
