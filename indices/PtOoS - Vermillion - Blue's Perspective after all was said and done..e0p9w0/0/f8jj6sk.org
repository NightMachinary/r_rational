Since Aikos death that story is much less enjoyable for me, because I find it hard to relate to each protagonist. Red is moping and copes by convoluted social overthinking. That is consistent but strenuous to read. Blue copes by being an self-righteous hypocritical asshole. He tells his grandpa, he can't work if sayed grandpa isn't safely stashed in a panic room. But he wishes his childhood bbf with unresolved childhood trauma to have died by being stupidly heroic. F that.
