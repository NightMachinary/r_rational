I was about to say that Blue has seen people die because of a lack of heroes charging in to save them at the risk of their own lives, but he has yet to see the heroes die because they shouldn't have charged in. Maybe that would help restore his balance.

And then I realised, I'm wrong. He's seen his grandpa knocked down (though not entirely out) by charging to the rescue when perhaps it wasn't essential. And although that did indeed impact his thinking, it didn't make him more sympathetic to the general idea that heroics can sometimes be reckless and stupid; instead, it's created a dissonance in his thinking, where he objects to his grandfather charging to the rescue, but he still expects Red to do it. Sooner or later, that inconsistency has to be resolved. He can't keep saying that Professor Oak and Red were /both/ wrong.
