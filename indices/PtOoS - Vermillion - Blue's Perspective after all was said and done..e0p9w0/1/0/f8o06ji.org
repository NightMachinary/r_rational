Good interpretation. Working out the inconsistency would be satisfying to read.

Maybe he thinks that he doesn't need saving because he's made the decision to risk his life - it's a waste of effort. If a hero has already decided to get themselves killed, then trying to save them is not only undermining them. It is also ensuring that the hero's sacrifice (whether they die or not) does not accomplish the 'protect everyone' goal (because the saver is putting themselves in danger too).

It's a skewed perspective, but I can see it based on Blue's actions.
