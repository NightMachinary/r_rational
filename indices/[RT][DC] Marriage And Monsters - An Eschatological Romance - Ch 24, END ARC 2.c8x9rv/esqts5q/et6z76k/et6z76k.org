Both one of the most consistent and highest-quality works on this sub. Thanks for your writing! I'm frankly amazed that you have so much more planned--this arc was climactic enough that I could imagine it as the story's end, given an epilogue--but clearly we have a long way to go.

Are the story-things supposed to be borrowed from Worm's Entities, or is that just convergent evolution of immortal cosmic entities?
