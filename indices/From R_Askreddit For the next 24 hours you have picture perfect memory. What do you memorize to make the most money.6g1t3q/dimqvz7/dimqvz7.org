I think it really depends on what picture perfect memory is. If I just need a glance I would immediately crowdsource to some friends to retrieve as much important information as possible, and task someone to do a rush job and write a program for a bunch of computers to rapidly display various documents.

If it is only what I can read instead of glance at, maybe some of the more popular scientific journals and things that are notoriously difficult to memorize?

Languages? Chemistry and Engineering tables?
