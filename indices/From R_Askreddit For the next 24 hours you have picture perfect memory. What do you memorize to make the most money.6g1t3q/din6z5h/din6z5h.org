If I'm able to to retain the information, chem and engineering tables and text books. Then I would move to programming and CAD and Photoshop. You don't actually have to read the textbook. Then do math proofs and thesis papers. With those, it would be childs play to test out of the programs you need for a degree in the field you choose, land a well paying job and use your knowledge to bootstrap to CEO. A few books in psychology and social behavior, as well as management textbook or two and you'd probably be set.
