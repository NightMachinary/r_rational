Good point, I was thinking of the memories as being retained. It would be much harder to munchkin this if it vanished after 24 hours, but I bet it could still be done. Especially in the version where you just have to glance at the information to remember it.

The key in the 24 hour version might be finding an area with massive volumes of information where you can make money by picking out a bunch of small details that are otherwise unnoticed.
