If you could quickly thumb through a random ~500 page book in 5 minutes and then read randomly chosen lines off of randomly chosen pages, that would be pretty convincing evidence. You can even do this in languages you don't know or with unfamiliar calligraphy (katakana, arabic, whatever). You can do this with other visual media like pictures or high speed video. You can demonstrate this from an auditory standpoint as well. Smell and touch would be a bit hard to demonstrate.

I highly doubt any real world memory geniuses can actually memorize something /perfectly/, on one try, in only the time it takes to take the barest glance at a page of the written material. That level of photographic memory is science fiction, if someone were to have perfect visual recall at that level, I would guess they would develop some serious neurological problems as their brain strains to store all that information.

You would need to store the equivalent of an HD resolution video that is about as long as 2/3rds of that person's lifetime (accounting for sleep). 100 hours of HD vid at a decent framerate needs about 1TB worth of storage. Thats just a little over a week of someone's life. The brain is a marvelously efficient piece of machinery, but it isn't enough. You'd have to be a /god/.

Edit: Of course, the issue of whether you can verify this after the 24 hours is up (he may call bullshit on you after that time to prevent you from getting a cool million) comes into play. But this still has a decent chance of earning a relativley high amount of money in a 24-hour timeframe using this power, in a /legal/ fashion. As I said previously, I cannot think of a good way to game this ability if the recall /only lasts the 24 hour period/, without doing something illegal and easily traceable that isn't even guaranteed to provide a decent amount of money as a return.
