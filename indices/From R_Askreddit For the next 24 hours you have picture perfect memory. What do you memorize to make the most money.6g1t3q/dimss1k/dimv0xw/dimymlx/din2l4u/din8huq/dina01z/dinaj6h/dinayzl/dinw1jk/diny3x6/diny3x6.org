Hold on. You clearly aren't thinking of all the all the incredible benefits you're walking away from here:

Amaze and impress your friends at parties with your superhuman ability to attach collapsible handles to otherwise useful objects! Become the world's foremost authority on 18th century asbestos carriage brakes! Generate an endless stream of new designs for nonfunctional perpetual motion machines built from common household appliances with a single glance and never ever forget them!

Truly, who could pass up a chance at such incredible power? Someone needs to patent the method for doing this immediately!
