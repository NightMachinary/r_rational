Those are all good points. I guess the reason it wouldn't have been done before is that very few people have the time and willingness to read through that many patents. I am a patent attorney and occasionally look through a patent class during searches. In my experience patents are not organized in a way that makes for easy reading at all. They are dense and don't stay on topic and are more concerned with covering every possible legal hedge on what the idea is for a hypothetical court case. Some are 80 years out of date. Some aren't classified correctly. Some are just wrong. The only way to go through enough to make it viable would be something like this where you had an unusual way to pull the useful information out of them quickly. In a particular area/class you could probably look at all of them, but there are way too many for anyone to do this for the entire database.

I agree that most ideas would not be viable, and it isn't as simple as snapping your fingers and coming up with idea. The idea is a small fraction of what you need to make money. I have seen plenty of hilariously awful patents and business plans that flopped at the starting gate, but I bet there are at least a handful of objectively good ideas with a low startup cost buried somewhere in there for a crazy superhuman with an eidetic memory to pull out. Of course there might be no good way to verify the ideas during that short a time period, but it seems worth a shot.

There are a probably handful of other similar information graveyards to scrounge through to hedge bets, though it would be hard to identify them before you ran out of time.
