I guess the difference is I am assuming comprehension of the ideas at a level a computer wouldn't have. (Lets say about what I would have from reading through it normally.) If this is just memorization and I can only recite it with no understanding of what I read it wouldn't work and I agree.

I can think of a couple of aggregated areas of knowledge this trick could work on. I'll give an example. The patent database has millions of patents. Most of them are abandoned. There are even more in other countries assuming I can learn languages super fast first. Some of them are abandoned because someone couldn't get funded or their business collapsed, or for some other non-idea quality related reason. Lets say I got someone to rush a program to display a bunch of information and played through a massive rolling list of all patent applications ever.

I bet there is at least one patent is abandoned but actually useful and plausible to make money. Since it is abandoned I can monetize it. Some information may also be incorrect or exaggerated. However, I just need to identify a few hundred of the most promising inventions and write them down before my memory gets fried.
