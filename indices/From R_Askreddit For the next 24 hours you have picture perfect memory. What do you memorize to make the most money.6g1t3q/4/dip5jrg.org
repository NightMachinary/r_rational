I'd do a couple of things. First off:

1. Reread the important parts of my Electrical Engineering manuals.
2. Study Assembly languages - If you can memorize even smaller, older Assembly Languages, you're basically set for programming as every language builds off them. Additionally, this is a 24 hour period and even with the buff my attention would be focused on more interesting stuff. --That would also give me an excuse to pore over old video game architectures.

The rest of the info I'd study would be dumb stats and things for League of Legends, probably.
