I think your most surefire gamble to maximize payout would be to try for the Rhandi prize (and hope he accepts some ridiculous short notice scheduling).

Clearly there is no one aggregated pile of information where knowledge of specific details would benefit you in 24 hours worth of time (computers would be able to parse this in that same timeframe). Thus, the only way to make money off of the 24 hour version would be either off the fact you have a demonstrably supernatural ability, or via some ingenius way of exploiting it on an individual basis (say, memorizing credit card info or bank accounts or something).

I can think of no way to exploit the /ambiguous financial theft/ option that doesn't result in me having to flee my home country or getting arrested due to the trail. Maybe convert the money to bitcoin or something and do some small proxy trades via huge botnet?
