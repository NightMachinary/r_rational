Point: I am probably being far too pessimistic in my assumptions that "someone would have done something of that sort already, if it was viable."

In all fairness though, just having a patent for a good idea isn't enough. You also need the channels and ability to market the idea to someone who will pay for it, or some way to pay for any start up costs such an invention/venture would cost. Cold calling CEO's isn't going to get you very far, and I imagine high profile people like Elon Musk (or rather, his answering machine/secretary)get about a dozen of those a week.

If it was a specific example of some code for say, a friendly AI, then you may likely find someone on here that would know a guy who knows a guy who could work something out with (big name tech industry guy), but: (1) everyone in that chain would probably demand a cut, (2) You may not luck out in that fashion, and the avenue of approach as far as any middlemen (who are accessible to you, yet possess the contact info and connection to someone that can make the patent happen, all at a reasonable percentage of course) are concerned is much less obvious.

(And admittedly, that may be quite a dumb example contextually speaking (you could probably build such an AI yourself if you have the code and hardware specifications on hand), but lets assume that for some reason it costs a few million for the relevant hardware, or somesuch. You get the gist of where I'm coming from.)
