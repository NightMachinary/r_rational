I personally don't need to learn programming, I know how to program. It would be useful to spend about 6-12 hours and learn two dozen programming languages worth of syntax and other related things unique to each language. I personally would go through SQL, C, C++,Haskell, Javascript, Python, etc. All those well known languages that see some use. Combine that with a few data structures/algorithm books and Cracking the Coding Interview, and you can easily ace most of anything they'd ask you in a job interview. Theres your 80k+ starting salary right there, provided you have a college degree in a related field. Instead of spending years getting to the point where you can code reliably in all these languages, you did it in an afternoon. That's a pretty good return, in my opinion.

Memorizing mathematical theorems would not help you. Anyone in math should be able to mention big name theorems and understand (more or less) how the proof goes. Its the pages upon pages of definitions, one-off lemmas , examples and counterexamples, and the actual proofs of all of these that will be beneficial. If I spent 6-12 hours just flipping through graduate texts so that I have all that in my head, ready at a moments notice, then this would be a great boon. Of course, one should go back and learn all these things the normal way, but it would be much easier to internalize the material if you've already merely memorized it.

You would be surprised at how many things boil down to (some dumb problem, theorem, or exercise you solved years ago but forgot)
