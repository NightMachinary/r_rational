This power is relatively useless unless one can access the memories after the 24 hours.

If you can, this is a veritable Pandora's Box of munchkinable content. If this is the case I would probably go through a and speedread a few dozen programming language books and guides, as well as a few dozen math textbooks.

If not, I'm having trouble concocting a profitable scheme with a 24-hour maximum time limit that wouldn't also involve a massive amount of illegal stuff that one would probably be caught after the fact via papertrail.
