The mirror would've been enough. I'd have put a piece of paper on the wall behind me and then stood entirely in front of the mirror and seen if it was reflected. Then changed the angle to make sure it wasn't reflecting off something else, first. Then tried the same with a painstakingly polished flat object to make sure that it's actually a mirror...
