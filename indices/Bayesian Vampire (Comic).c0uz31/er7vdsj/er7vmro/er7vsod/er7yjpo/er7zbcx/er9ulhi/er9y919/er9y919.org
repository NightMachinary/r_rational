  What about a feeling that hospitals will kill you too?

I remember not feeling that way, and I don't see anything that would've changed my belief. So, I would reluctantly go there if I had no option.

However, I would phone 999 first, and explain everything to them, and ask them what to do. Because I trust them not to take me to a hospital if it's dangerous, and that's what I'd tell myself until I got to a suitable source of distraction, like Minecraft, and then from the distraction to the ambulance if they were sending an ambulance.
