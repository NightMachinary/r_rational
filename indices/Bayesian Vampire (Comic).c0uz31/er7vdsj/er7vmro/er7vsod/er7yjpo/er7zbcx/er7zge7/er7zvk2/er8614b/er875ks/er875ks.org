We can discard "it's all a dream", because in that situation nothing we do has any effect on the real world; it'll all be gone when we wake up, so it doesn't matter what actions we take, and the process which we use to make decisions in reality should not be hindered by this hypothetical.

I would start off by assuming that any cognitive impairment I have is limited in scope, and do stuff like taking a photograph of the mirror, of me in front of the mirror, etc. and send them to trusted friends to ask their opinion.

If none of the photographs contained images of me, then it's possible I'm deluded in thinking I'm taking a photograph of myself. In such a situation, I would cover the entire camera photo hole with my hand, and take a photo, and see whether it was a black photo. Then, regardless of the result, I would despair and call the trusted friend to inform them that I was having a breakdown, and to ask for help. If they didn't concur with my observations, I would assume that I was delusional and seek treatment. If they did, I would probably call an ambulance, saying that I was either completely imagining the presence of my trusted friend, or had some kind of infectious delusion.

And then I'd probably cry for a bit.

But back to the point. Possibility number 2 is basically "there is some sort of magic system in the world", in which case it needs studying.
