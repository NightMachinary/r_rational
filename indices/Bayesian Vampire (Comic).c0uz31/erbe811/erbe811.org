The "am I actually a monster or just crazy" angle though applied to someone who is using statistical reasoning to assess the answer could be positively gripping. It'd still be a weird, dry movie, something like "Primer" with very little mainstream appeal, but it'd make for one hell of an intimate, claustrophobic psychological thriller/horror.
