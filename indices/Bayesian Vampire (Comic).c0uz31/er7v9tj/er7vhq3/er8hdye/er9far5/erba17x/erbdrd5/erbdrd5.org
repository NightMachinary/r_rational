That's a fair conclusion, but at that point I think any test independent or not becomes pointless because if you can't trust your immediate perception of what you are doing to not cheat at the test, then I don't think you can rightly trust yourself that you'll properly hear the conclusion of whoever you brought in, or that you even brought anyone at all and aren't drooling on the ground.
