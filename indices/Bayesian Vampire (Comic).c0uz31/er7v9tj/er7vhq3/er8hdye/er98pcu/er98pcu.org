If I have a delusion that's so complete that it even consistently defines “winning” and “losing” in the sense that Lesswrong uses the terms - so complete that I can't even detect knock-on effects of being wrong - that's the world I'm living in now. It's as real as anything.

In any other case I believe I can test the truth out of the delusion, or at least realize that there's no consistent hypothesis other than being deluded, and it'll have strong support instead of just being some sort of waterline below which any weirder belief is less likely than it.

Having dealt with some issues of perception myself, it doesn't leave you sure. It leaves you panicked and confused, lashing out. There's a whole lot of evidence beyond “this isn't what I used to believe, but so hard that I mUsT bE cRaZy”

If you calmly and methodically prove something “impossible”, you're probably not crazy. There's something else going on. That's just not how mental illness works.

I think EY's insistance that you should question your own sanity even when you're not deeply confused comes from a lack of familiarity with real mental illness.

His Dark Lords of the Matrix that can give you fully immersive, consistent delusions where you can prove something that's actually wrong, experience consistent knock-on effects all the way down the chain, and be fully unconfused about it?

They're less likely to be real than vampires.

Your brain coincidentally acting like that without it being painstakingly and intentionally set up, just by random chance, when there's no precedent for that sort of mental illness? Every neuron independently being exactly setup wrong to create a fully realized and consistent world of perception that isn't real and suggests exactly everything you expect from reality, plus vampires, without leaving you with the confusion and panic that comes with getting the conflicting and confusing perceptual input of schizophrenia?

Probably also less likely than vampires.
