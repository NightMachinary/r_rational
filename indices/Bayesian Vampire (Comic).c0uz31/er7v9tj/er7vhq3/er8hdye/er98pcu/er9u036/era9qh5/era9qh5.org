The thing is, the people who believe they're vampires and act like it aren't exactly investigating their situation with rigor.

I suspect if they genuinely, with well-practiced rational techniques, attempted to investigate the nature of their situation, there would be clues that they're wrong that even they could pick up on.

Their delusion prevents them from doing that. It prevents them from feeling the need to do that.

What it doesn't do is give them a consistently wrong, convincing and unconfusing world when they try. It plays off easy biases and uncertainty and tendency to conveniently ignore contradicting perceptions.
