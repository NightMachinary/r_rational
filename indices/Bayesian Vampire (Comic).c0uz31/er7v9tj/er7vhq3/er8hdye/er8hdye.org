I feel like being absent in a mirror would be huge enough to at least make me want to take steps before committing myself to a facility like that. If I'm actually a vampire, being imprisoned somewhere they might, yknow, make me go for a walk in the sun with the therapy group... might be pretty bad.

There are a few people to whom I'd feel safe looking in a mirror with and asking what they notice. If other people start agreeing I don't have a reflection, that's a big dent in the 'caused by mental illness' theory (since it'd mean I'd have to be hallucinating all their reactions?)

Do religious symbols burn me? If so, can check -- wood cross, wood block, metal cross, metal tool. This can also be independently observed -- does the burning follow the shape, and not the material?

I can see not being able to tell if you keep it to yourself, but like being open to a couple other people and getting corroborations could be at least enough to tell, "whatever the issue is, it's not something which would be solved by any conventional means like a mental hospital"... and probably just continue behaving like the best mix of my existing ethics and my new cravings. I'd *hope* I could subsist on blood not harvested from killing real humans...
