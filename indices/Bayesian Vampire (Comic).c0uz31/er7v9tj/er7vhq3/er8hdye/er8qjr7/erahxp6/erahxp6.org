But that's why you get a bunch of similarly sized holy symbols and non-holy symbols that are made of the same material, jumble them up, and then feel them out blindly. If you could successfully separate out crosses from other shapes by simply touching them (let's say with one finger to avoid actually being able to feel out the whole shape) then that's pretty significant evidence.
