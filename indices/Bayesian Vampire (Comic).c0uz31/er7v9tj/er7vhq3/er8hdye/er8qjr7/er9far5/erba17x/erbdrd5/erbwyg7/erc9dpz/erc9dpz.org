I'm pondering now, as a general case -- if there is some possible world such that your prior for that world is lower than your prior for the world of, like:

"i have suddenly developed such developed and far-reaching and /consistent/ hallucinations as to be completely indistinguishable from reality to any test i can do with my agency and senses, including simulating other people's reactions to the tests"

what /should/ you do? like, you basically can't trust anything you experience, unless you just give in and decide to 'play the game', at which point you can more-or-less trust stuff to follow how 'the game' would follow. i guess "play the game, but be on the constant lookout for ways to escape the delusion" might be one path
