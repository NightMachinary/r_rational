I get the "feeling" thing, but that's why I'm saying I'd include other people too. They can *see* burns. They can apply a cross-or-other-shape to a part of my skin where I'm not even looking, and I have few enough nerve endings that I can't feel what shape it is. They could observe whether it burns my skin or not.

I don't doubt it's remotely conceivable that I could suddenly develop a high degree of some hallucination-causing disorder, but if I can't trust my senses' interpretation of the trustworthy people close to me giving me feedback about what they're seeing about me, why would I trust my senses' interpretation of the people at a mental hospital?

How about this, me and a loved one schedule a consultation meeting at some third-party institution that would be objective in a way equivalent to how a mental institution would be, and we include *them* in the tests, and gauge *their* responses. This is risky because if I'm a vampire it outs me, but at least it should satisfy the notion of... "simulation, if it is that, is sufficiently detailed that a mental hospital would likely not break it either".

(Or at least, "simulation, if it is that, is sufficiently intent on me believing it, including fabricating entire situations with other people, that it would likely not _let_ me go to a mental hospital to break myself of it, i.e. if i try, it would just keep working in there, or it would direct me to a hallucination of a mental hospital")
