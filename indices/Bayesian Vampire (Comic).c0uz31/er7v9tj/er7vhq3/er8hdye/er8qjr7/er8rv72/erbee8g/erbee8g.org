  Presumably whatever schizophrenia you've got can simulate all those things. If you expect to be burned then you'll feel like you're burning

Ultimately all we are is brains that receive external input, and really, if we start having reason to doubt those inputs, we have nothing to hang onto. Pretty much any physics-defying observed outcome will have a lower prior probability in our mind than simply "I'm in a coma and dreaming all of this". The funny thing is, of course, our prior that the world /ought/ to obey physics is rooted in our /previous/ experience, and it's not like we have a 100% sure way to know that was real and not the actual illusion... see the Matrix proposed scene in HPMOR. "There is no such thing as a real physics book. The world doesn't run on math."
