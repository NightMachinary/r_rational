  I'd have put a piece of paper on the wall behind me and then stood entirely in front of the mirror and seen if it was reflected.

If that sort of thing actually worked, then as a new vampire, I would have ordered or made sunglasses with small pieces of a mirror attached to the bottom half of the lens on the side facing my eyes. That way, when walking around I can see directly behind myself at all times.

The death rates of vampires are particularly high within the first century you know!
