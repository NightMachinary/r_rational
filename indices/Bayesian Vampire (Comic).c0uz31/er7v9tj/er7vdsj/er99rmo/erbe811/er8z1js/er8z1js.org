This kinda reminds me of when that guy came on the subreddit (I think in one of the Worth the Candle comment threads) and talked about cognitohazards (or something along the lines of that word; I can never remember which is which). They talked about how one existed that actually hurt, and was PMing it to people who asked. (An example of a mildly annoying one is that you're now consciously breathing, blinking, and aware of where your tongue is in your mouth.)

Someone said something like rationalists would kill themselves over a real anomalous cognitohazard because they'd all try to see its effects, like touching a stove to see if it's hot.
