I've gone back and forth on this one. Having any psychotic break that gives you clear symptoms you can and are able to test isn't how any mental disorder I know of works, so I'm guessing it's basically impossible. You could try to add in drugs and PTSD from the neck bite but I don't think that helps. So is it more impossible you've developed an extreme novel mental disorder or that some nutjob biting you has turned you into a supernatural creature?

We have plenty of examples of people 100% disconnected from reality by mental disorders and absolutely nothing supporting vampires so insanity is more likely. The most probable cause to me is that you're in a coma from the bite/attack and that influenced you to dream about being a vampire. The most dangerous case is that you're awake with this all consuming mental disorder, and if you let yourself act on any of it you're going to eventually be drinking blood.
