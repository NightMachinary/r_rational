I think you'd be able to tell if you're a vampire with extremely high confidence without anyone finding out by exploiting the mirror thing. Either that, or be confident that you are delusional on a fundamental level and probably can't even trust yourself to call for help.

Basically, all you need to do is find a random number generator online that you can use on your phone, then look into a mirror with the phone placed behind your head so you can see it through your head. Use the RNG (preferably at least 10 digits long) and write it down, then take a screenshot of the site and a photo of your result. Now all you need to do is find someone to ask if they're the same number.
