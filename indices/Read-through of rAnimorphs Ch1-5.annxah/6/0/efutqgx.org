Do you think we should have a thread about the things that don't make sense if you haven't read the original? I'm thinking things like - thermos flasks, Rachel being Jake's cousin, anything that comes up that needs clarification; we could possibly assemble in one place along with the simplest possible fix/explanation, and then maybe the author can just insert them in somewhere if they want to.
