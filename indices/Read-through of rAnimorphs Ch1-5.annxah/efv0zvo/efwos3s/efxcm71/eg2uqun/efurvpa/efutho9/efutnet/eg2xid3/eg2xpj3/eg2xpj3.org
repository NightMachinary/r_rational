[[/u/Not_Sophie][u/Not_Sophie]] said "we tried acquiring from a morph, and it works" (quoting from Ch 3)

This raises the question of whther you can acquire a copy of your own body as a morph. Say:

1. Cassie and Jake acquire each other's bodies as morphs
2. Cassie acquires her own body as a morph from Jake, morphed as Cassie
3. Cassie can morph her own body whenever required, say to heal an injury while maintaing her appearance as Cassie

A bit late, but this would have helped when paralysed in the car
