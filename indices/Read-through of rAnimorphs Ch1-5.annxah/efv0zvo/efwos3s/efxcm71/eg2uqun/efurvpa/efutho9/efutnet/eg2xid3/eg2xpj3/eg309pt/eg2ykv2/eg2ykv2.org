It seems that the thought-speak power can be used to make suggestions to people in their own internal voice. If this is correct, this is pretty damn powerful - especially for controlling the minds of other humans who have no possible way of conceiving the existence of such a power. Although it might send people crazy if used too much.

And how does the thought-speak power interact with a human controlled by a yeerk? Could Cassie have used it to support her mom when her mom was fighting the yeerk for control of her own mind?
