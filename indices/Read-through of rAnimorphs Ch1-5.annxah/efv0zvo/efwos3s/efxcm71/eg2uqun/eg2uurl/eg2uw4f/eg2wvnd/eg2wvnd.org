  I focused on Melissa and her parents, mentally excluding the Yeerks they were carrying. The alien slugs would hear it anyway---they'd have to. But if my guess was right, they'd be unable to tell it apart from any other thought. It would sound just like Melissa, just like Mr. and Mrs. Chapman, my message translated into their own internal voices, just as Elfangor's voice had been translated into mine.

But I feel that being confident about that is probably not something that she can be, with so little experience.

  About halfway through the conversation, I'd started to feel that pressure again, the itch of inactivity that made me want to get up and pace, made my fingers twitch and cut my patience in half. It had grown worse and worse as the others bickered and dithered, until finally I'd had to step outside to get some fresh air.
