You're correct. In the OG books you couldn't be in morph if you wanted to acquire something, and it's the same in The Reckoning. Remember that when the kids morph in the fanfic, their original body essentially goes up into a pocket dimension in Z-space and is held in stasis. That body is where the DNA patterns for morphs are stored, so /it/ has to make contact with the target in order to absorb its DNA pattern.
