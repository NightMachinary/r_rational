Without answering the question (nor saying if I even can answer), I've been thinking about the best way to address this - surely from their perspective they don't know those sorts of costs... like, I'd go out to the max, and acquire everything and every person I could. But then I don't know if I'd ever run into limits or break the machinery.

Is there a good way to think about this? It's like the problem of if you ever woke up with a superpower, how would you go about using it without knowing it's limits or if it would ever break.

In this case though, they really should just find another Andalite to talk to.
