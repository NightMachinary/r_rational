When the yeerk was crawling up Cassie's neck into her ear, could she have acquired it as a morph? This would have been a total game-changer. Not sure of all the implications. Though one interesting question is what would happen if one of the kids in yeerk form invaded another human being controlled by a yeerk. Would that kid acquire all the thoughts and knowledge of the yeerk, as well as the human host?
