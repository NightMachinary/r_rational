I've been aware of this happening a few times. It's nontrivially present in very few chapters (I'd guess fewer than four, in total) and most often in situations where there are user interface differences between the two sites. The AMA chapter, for instance, was just much easier and better to work with on AO3, and I believe its final form is different on AO3 than on FF.net.

In each /deliberate/ case, it was something like, "this would more than 3x exceed, in time and attention costs /right here right now,/ than the difference I expect it to make for readers." For instance, making a small update to e.g. a single line of text take two clicks on AO3 ("edit" and "submit") whereas making the same update on FF.net takes like eight or nine ("Publish," "Doc Manager," "edit," "save changes," "manage stories," "r!Animorphs," "update/replace chapter," "submit"). Sometimes, if I've made four small tweaks in the last fifteen minutes, one after the other, I eventually sigh and just stop working with the FF UI, and in those cases I sometimes manage to come back later with a batch of changes and I sometimes don't.

It's worth noting that even AO3 receives "the same treatment" when it comes to various edits to the absolute official edition on my computer and in the cloud---my intention is to release a final PDF/epub when the whole thing is finished, and that will contain many little edits and changes that I've made throughout. Like, if someone pings me, today, with a suggestion for Chapter 12, I'll often just go ahead and make the change on my master version and not bother to update /either/ AO3 /or/ FF.net.

I am not sure how guilty I should feel about this. But it's all ultimately in service of conserving my own spoons so that a Best Final Version will, in fact, one day exist.

I reiterate that the delta between FF and AO3, and the delta between AO3 and my master, is probably well under a tenth of a percent both in terms of word count and in terms of expected impact on the reader.
