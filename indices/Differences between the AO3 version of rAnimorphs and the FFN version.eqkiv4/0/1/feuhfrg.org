The AMA chapter I knew about - there was an A/N about that on FFN, right? - but I figured that was just formatting. I might go back and read that one again, just in case it extended to content.

Anyway, the rest of the logic makes sense - I've played around on FFN myself, and publishing anything is like pulling teeth. It's good to hear that the differences are relatively minor from a Word of God perspective, I'm just... obsessive? a purist? ...when it comes to, like, a "definitive" version of my media. More about the principle of it than the actual value of the definitive content.

In any case, I'll stick to AO3 from now on. And hey, this just cements the fact that I'll be rereading the "golden" edition when it's all done and published :)

Loving the new chapters, by the way. This fic is like crack.
