FF.net UI is absolute garbage, especially in comparison to AO3. Editing a chapter, especially a chapter that's been up for a long time, takes so much tedious effort and wrestling with the editor that I've pretty much consigned myself to never editing anything on FF.net, as it's a terrible use of time.
