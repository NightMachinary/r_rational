As far as munchkinning systems go, stuff such as HP and Discworld I'd say are examples of ones you shouldn't attempt to munchkin. Both systems with a lot of hidden stuff and the potential to screw things up horribly. I mean, there's the potential to do nearly everything, and also far more ways to screw up. HP in particular, with a system that makes everything vary on emotion and regularly follows fairy tale logic, what you do may work, but stick to trying to come up with creative uses for what is already there, and before you do your fantastic new use nobody ever did before ask yourself why nobody did it before, it's most likely that stupidity is not the answer.

On an unrelated note, the ending date on the challenge is wrong, it says the challenge ends on the 16th, I presume timezones account for the difference but it is already evening on the 17th here.

As far as this challenge goes, may give it a shot, always liked worldbuilding. Although the start is tricky, so according to a [[http://www.desiquintans.com/articles/noungenerator.php][random noun generator]] I should try and make a magic system involving creme brulee and cancer. Well, this might be possible, already got a couple of ideas. Actually scratch that, I looked away for five minutes and I've already started, lets see if I do enough before running out of steam to matter.
