There /are/ no mirrored inanimate objects. Only self-aware beings can pass through mirrors in the first place. Everything except for self-aware beings exists simultaneously in the mirrored and nonmirrored realm. Self-aware beings only exist in one of them, and effect inanimate objects in both of them (because they're effecting the inanimate object in their own realm, and the object exists simultaneously in both).
