People become mirrored by passing through mirrors (and become unmirrored by passing through mirrors again). Only self-aware beings can pass through mirrors; no inanimate objects or simpler animals. Mirrored people are invisible and incorporeal to unmirrored people, and vice versa. Mirrored people can't eat most food, because of chirality.
