Perhaps adding sentences like, "Scholars now know that glass is actally sand, and by creating glass from sand we may... [etc.]" and "King Hayden hypothesized that..." would shift the focus from what King Hayden meant to the Haydenites, to what King Hayden's discoveries meant to the expansion of the knowledge and resources of the Haydenites. The story would change from, "This is the exemplary tale of a great man to whom we all owe our way of life," to, "This is the exemplary tale of the great discoveries of our people's founder: he who us into Haydenites."

Maybe that helps. I enjoyed it. Fun system (even though I don't fully understand it)!
