Welp, just wrote and submitted my story. My main fears are twofold - first, that I fell into the illusion of transparency and it's not clear what my magic system actually is; second, that my magic system isn't central enough to my story, calling into question whether it fits the prompt well. Still happy with it on some level, and curious to see what others think of it. The main kernel that drove me to actually write it was that I fell in love with the idea of writing a portal fantasy story in a pseudo-Biblical style.

The visual concept behind it, which I've loved for ages even though it makes no real sense given how actual mirrors in reality work, is that of a person with no reflection, like a vampire, being able to step into a mirror to effectively become invisible. So, in this fantasy world, mirrors are basically portals to a world that perfectly matches up with the unmirrored world, except for humans and other self-aware creatures (creatures able to pass... the mirror test :P), which only "exist" on one side of the mirrored world/unmirrored world divide. So, for example, a nude mirrored assassin could sneak into your home and try to kill you, and he'd essentially be invisible to you unless you spotted him in a mirror of your own. You'd also be invisible to him, but unless you were trying to be stealthy, he'd almost certainly be able to track you - by watching your clothes float around, if nothing else - and he'd catch you off-guard and stab you with a knife.
