The assassin /doesn't/ need to stick their hand into a mirror to kill. A knife is an inanimate object; it's neither incorporeal to the mirrored assassin nor to his unmirrored victim.

Electricity is just electricity. Nothing magic about it. :P

Steamed mirrors summon things from other worlds. Not advisable because the things that come through tend to be dangerous. Mostly exists to justify the portal fantasy plot, honestly.

Humans pass through glass, but inanimate objects don't - this includes dirt, which gives glass an application in cleansing.

Warped glass - including, say, lenses - warps things that go through it. This can be intelligently applied to grow things.
