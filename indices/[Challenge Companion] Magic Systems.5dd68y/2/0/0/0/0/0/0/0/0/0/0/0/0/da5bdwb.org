Well, the armor-wearer and their sharpened armor (covered in pig-bones, perhaps?) exist in only one of the two planes, while the pile of clothes, presumably, exists in both of them. Hence, they /do/ interact.

Essentially, for any physical interaction between two objects, ask yourself if they're on the same plane or not. If yes, they interact. If no, they can't see or feel each other. Almost everything exists on both planes; non-interaction rarely comes into play. You can't stab someone in the other plane with a pig-bone knife, because it only exists on the plane you're in. You can, on the other hand, stab them with a metal knife, because it exists on both planes.

This all started, incidentally, with the deliberately wrong explanation that the reason you can't walk through a mirror in real life is because you're bumping into mirror-you.
