Didn't know that about pigs.

Wigs, too.

Are there kobolds or gremlins? They have skin.

Can leather be sharpened? Someone could run at a pile of clothes very fast with sharpened leather armor. Would the armor-wearer feel resistance in the mirror realm? Would they run through the pile of clothes? The interaction of mutual incorporeality and worn inanimate objects fascinates and confuses me.
