Understand everything but the mirror travel, now.

So to someone in the mirrored world, they'd see all non-mirrored inanimate objects, including the clothes in which people walk about, but the opposite isn't true? A person in the non-mirrored realm can't see anyone in the mirrored realm, but objects in the mirrored realm can interact with all space in the non-mirrored realm? I don't understand what rule would make a system like that. Also sounds like people might bump into the uniforms of invisible mirrored police and through their bodies sometimes, if mirrored inanimate objects are invisible yet tangible.
