Great points! I've read the Singularity trilogy by Charles Strauss, and am a big fan of his solid extrapolation into the future. Not a big fan of TFotUMMC, to be honest, it felt a little too silly to me. Three Worlds Collide was far better. I haven't read Vernor Vinge, but I've been meaning to, so here we go!

I love the responses here!
