All right having [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/36fjfy/q_any_books_like_the_martian/crdx3ld][said]] what I did about Watts, let's add some more:

- I enjoyed "Halting State" and "Rule 34" by Charles Stross. Believable near-future SciFi and explicitly exploring social media, augmented reality, 3D printing, distributed consensus algorithms, dark nets and similar concepts in a geopolitically informed way. What I like about Stross is that the near-future world he paints is full of concepts which you never thought of but seem stunningly plausible "in hindsight". Stuff like "you hail a bus by bidding a certain amount of money on your mobile app to get to your destination. How fast you'll get to your destination is then based on how much the other passengers bid and from the route the algorithm derives from that." Tickles my nerd bone to no end. Aside from that, his earlier work "Accelerando", while already slightly dated is still an excellent read. Over a thousand pages, starts in the near-future and moves through the technological singularity and out the other side. Many consider this to be Stross' seminal work.

- Anathem by Neal Stephenson. One of my favorite SciFi books ever, period. It's not for everyone, it's quite deep on philosophical concepts and it's in the dialogues between the protagonists where most of the "action" happens, at least in the first half of the book. Highly intellectual, salted with some classic coming-of-age concepts and set in a world where the scientific method and rules for rational thought have had centuries to mature. Science is practiced mostly in secluded "monasteries " by people living in ascetic monk/nun-like lifestyles, segregated from a cyberpunk-esque outside world. Speaking of cyberpunk, if you haven't read "Snow Crash" by Stephenson yet, do so /now/. It is a really short book and absolutely essential literature background as any self-respecting nerd. The plot is insane, amazing action scenes interspersed with some really interesting intellectual concepts, plot twists and totally crazy yet somehow plausible world building. Oh and the book singlehandedly inspired the later creators of "Google Earth" and those of "Second Life" and it anticipated both those things back in 1992 where most other SciFi authors hadn't even heard of the Internet yet or thought it just a fad.

- [[http://sifter.org/%7Esimon/AfterLife/][After Life]] by "Simon Funk" (an alias). Highly intelligent, self-published (but freely available online) writing by an A.I. researcher. Starts with mind-uploading and moves from there. Got a lot of praise in a lot of futurist blogs when it first made the rounds a few years back. I actually bought a hard-copy somewhere and I am glad I did.

- You might /really/ enjoy [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5389450/1/The-Finale-of-the-Ultimate-Meta-Mega-Crossover][The Finale of the Ultimate Mega Meta Crossover]] by Eliezer Yudkowsky. I quote from the link: "This work contains humongous spoilers for /A Fire Upon The Deep/ by Vernor Vinge and /Permutation City/ by Greg Egan. If you're ever planning to read those books, then you should stop /now/ and read them /first/. Especially /Permutation City./[...] *MEMETIC HAZARD WARNINGS*: Concepts contained in this story may cause SAN Checking in any mind not inherently stable at the third level of stress. Story may cause extreme existential confusion. Story is insane. The author recommends that anyone reading this story sign up with Alcor or the Cryonics Institute to have their brain preserved after death for later revival under controlled conditions. Readers not already familiar with this author should be warned that he is not bluffing." Classic Eliezer. If you haven't read Vernor Vinge yet, I second the notion that you should read the following first:

- "A fire upon the deep" and "A deepness in the sky" by Vernor Vinge. Insane world-building, especially where Exobiology (and by extension Alien life forms) are concerned. Mostly concerned with big sociopolitical topics and less with technical shenanigans. Still very much worth a read.
