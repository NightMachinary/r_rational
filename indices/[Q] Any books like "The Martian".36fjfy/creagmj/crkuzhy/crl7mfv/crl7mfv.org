  I'd describe it as "Neuromancer, but way, way more entertaining."

Oh, so much this!

/Neuromancer/ was IMHO also hampered by "edgy technobabble" which was little removed from handwavey /magic/ better known from classical Fantasy. Sure, it was a trailblazer for the genre but in comparison, /Snow Crash/ is actually /hard/ SciFi.
