"Rendezvous with Rama" is about a massive, possibly abandoned alien ship entering the solar system, and the astronauts who explored it. Hard Sci-Fi, bordering on "Very Hard". I didn't actually love it all that much, mostly because it's written in the 1970s and I'm usually a a "90s and up" guy, but it's hard sci-fi in our solar system. The astronauts use the gear they have on hand, but it's not really "MacGyvering".
