I really hope you get an answer on this.

Hm. Actually...who would be willing to pay to read another Weir book like "The Martian"? If I reached out to Andy and said "you should run a Kickstarter to fund another book, and I've already got $1,000 lined up" the chances of us getting another one are pretty good.

I'd throw $50 at it. Anyone else?
