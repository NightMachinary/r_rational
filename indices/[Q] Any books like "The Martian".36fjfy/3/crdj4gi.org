There's the Mars Trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson (/Red, Green,/ and /Blue Mars/), the appendix anthology of short stories /The Martians/, and the not-sequel-but-set-in-a-similar-universe-and-much-later /2312/.

You may also be interested in /Tau Zero/ and /The Boat of a Million Years/ by Poul Anderson, but those are hardly modern.
