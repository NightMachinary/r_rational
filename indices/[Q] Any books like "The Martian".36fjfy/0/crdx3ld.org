Let me strongly second the recommendations for Peter Watts.

Both Blindsight (since released as creative commons [[http://www.rifters.com/real/Blindsight.htm][here]]) and Echopraxia are IMHO up there with the best SciFi books in recent years. Watts does his research thoroughly (after all, he holds a PhD in Marine Biology) and usually his major plot points are firmly rooted in science-fact. He even goes so far as to include detailed bibliographies in the appendices of his books where he also explains his reasoning behind less obvious conjectures. As a writer, he is a rare beast. He does not appear to /want/ to pander to the masses, instead preferring his readers to do their own thinking.

Especially Echopraxia left my small mind blown and terrified on a /philosophical/ level. It is cutting edge SciFi, as hard as it gets without shying away from extrapolating beyond the strictly "known" facts about reality. Highly recommended and high up on the "rationalist" shelf IMHO.
