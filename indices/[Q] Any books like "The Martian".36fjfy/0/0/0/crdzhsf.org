  [...] Watts' work is absolutely nothing like The Martian and it's easily possible to like one and hate another.

Yes sure. I hoped to make this clear already in my post. Watts is way less light-hearted and reading him requires intellectual engagement. This is /not/ a bad thing. But since OP said, he enjoyed Greg Egan, I can at least say that Watts has already been compared to the former on numerous occasions in book reviews.

EDIT: I just stumbled upon one blurb which puts it pretty succinctly:

#+begin_quote
  “[Watts'] famously dismal brilliance ... stuns you with its barrage of smart ideas and cutting-edge research, then disarms you with its grim determinism and unsympathetic, semi-posthuman characters, and ends up, pretty much, by just making you want to crawl under a rock. This is not a novel that wants to invite anyone in for tea.”

That's a fair warning. Normally this would put me off. I tried and failed to read through 1984 by Orwell on multiple occasions. Because I knew how it was going to end. I have re-read Echopraxia once already and the thought of doing it again at some point excites me. FWIW. YMMV.
