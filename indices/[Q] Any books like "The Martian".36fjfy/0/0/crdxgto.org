I am a fan of Watts and the Firefall series in particular, so I could second (third?) the recommendation with a caveat that Watts' work is absolutely nothing like The Martian and it's easily possible to like one and hate another.

Martian is a quick read, pretty lighthearted with plenty of humor, language is plain, colloquial. Watts' books are gloomy, dense, feature some occasional bleak humor but not much, might require several readings, language is... imagine a university science text book written by Oscar Wilde. Oh, and if you thought GRRM liked killing characters, wait until you read Watts. None of it is necessarily a minus, but worth keeping in mind though.
