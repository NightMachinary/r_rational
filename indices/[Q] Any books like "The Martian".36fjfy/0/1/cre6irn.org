Yes indeed. Note that I added the Peter Watts books on my own before anyone recommended them. I read them quite a while back, possibly thanks to [[/r/rational][r/rational]]. Echopraxia is indeed terrifying. Blindsight almost convinced me that sapience isn't worth the extra energy use.

I've bought "Being No One" by Metzinger, as Watts recommends. Trying to read it. It's quite dense.
