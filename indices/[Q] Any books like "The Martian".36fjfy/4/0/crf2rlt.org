Good one! This probably comes closest to OP's desire to get some insane hackery, along with his other work:

- [[http://www.shigabooks.com/index.php?page=001][Demon]] arguably isn't fully /hard/ SciFi but all the important MacGuyvering is. Without spoilering: There is a single "magical" thing going on and the protagonist then finds ways to deal with that in a rational (heck, at times even /rationalistic/) manner. Highly recommended.

(Eneasz, I also really enjoyed your very own /Red Legacy/! Very nice idiological angles and twists. I'd put this one more in the "classic SciFi" camp but it is short and fun, so I'll plug it anyway. (Note for all others: You can listen to the dramatized story in form of two freely downloadable audio episodes [[http://www.hpmorpodcast.com/?p=1429][here]] and [[http://www.hpmorpodcast.com/?p=1442][here]]. The raw text isn't available, since it's actually [[http://www.deathisbadblog.com/i-am-published/][published]] but [[/u/embrodsky]] wisely kept the audio rights for his work))
