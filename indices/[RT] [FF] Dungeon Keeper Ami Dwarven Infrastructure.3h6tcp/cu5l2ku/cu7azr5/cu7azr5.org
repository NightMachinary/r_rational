Any time a character behaves seemingly irrationally in predictable ways and doesn't seem put out by it, I try out the hypothesis "she /is/ efficiently optimizing her own utility function; her utility function is just /weird/." In this case, Ami's gets utilons from being nice-to-a-fault and trying-to-be-nice-even-when-trying-doesn't-achieve-anything. I'm not sure whether that's /rational/, but it's not /incoherent/.
