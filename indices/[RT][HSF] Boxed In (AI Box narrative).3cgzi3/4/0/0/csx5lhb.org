Gotcha. Just tweaked the ending a bit again.

Depending on how extensive the facility is though, it might be doable. If you're heavily vetting the applicants anyway, the point would be that each one is incredibly devoted and knows how important what they're doing is.

Kind of like finding the perfect people to send to Mars: they're all fully aware that it's probably going to be a one-way trip. The logistics of it change a bit obviously if they're expected to live to old age rather than probably die within a few years or a decade, but the acceptance of death if things go wrong is just part of what makes it the most dangerous, but potentially important and honorable, job in the world.
