Depends on the implementation. I would imagine that completely locking people away in a bunker would be detrimental to keeping them sane, and would just be bad management in general. /Personally/, I think you'd probably use a randomly rotating crew, heavy surveillance, and lots of psychologists working behind the scenes. There wouldn't be any way unbox the AI; no ignorant janitors, no network connections, no complicated electronics allowed within the compound, etc.

Every time I've tried to talk about building a proper box to keep an AI contained while still doing useful work, people have called me stupid, even when I add in a bunch of disclaimers and posit it as a thought exercise. So no one has really been willing to discuss or even really entertain the idea of "best practices" for keeping an AI contained, and I've never really felt the incentive to try writing it.
