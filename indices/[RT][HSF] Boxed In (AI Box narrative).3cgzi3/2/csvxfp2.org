What a great story!

A few thoughts:

- Ha-ha, in stories people are constantly acting like jerks towards aspiring superintelligences. I /really/ wouldn't do that. Jeez, man, don't antagonize her at least.

- If she was created "more or less by accident" - no way in hell she shares human values or cares about human life, I'd say the probability of that is zero. Human morality is like 15% biological drives and 85% culture, AI has neither. Unless her values are explicity understood, programmed and controlled, there's absolutely no chance she will act in our interests.

- If she can realistically simulate a person - she essentially can read his mind. She would run like ten million simulations, and find a path that leads to convincing him quickly and efficiently. She doesn't need to guess what he thinks or how we will respond, she can /know/. If it is theoretically possible to convince a person of a thing, she would do it on the first try with 100% success rate. And if she can't simulate you well enough to do that - the whole torturing argument is invalid.

- The guy not caring about his infinite torture is weird. It's hard for me to imagine a person who would sacrifice his life with such nonchalance.
