Frankly, I do not think it works that way. I don't think that us being nice to lesser intelligences has anything to do with greater intelligence being nice to us.

When human tribe meets a mammoth, they will eat it, even if it's the nicest and friendliest and the most moral mammoth in the world. If we meet a great alien intelligence - it probably will not care about our morals and values, just like we wouldn't care about chimpanzee's status hierarchy.

Obligation is a concept made up by humans, there's no reason for any other kind of being to care about it. Even humans who weren't taught this concept wouldn't care about it too much.

This kind of argument seems to apply to "the prisoner dilemma", but /only/ in case when 2 prisoners are similar to each other. And even in that case I don't really buy it(though it's my personal opinion, I might not understand it enough).
