Torture is easy.

The AI has no reason to actually torture me, it only has to convince me I am being tortured. AI's are efficient, they don't do stuff for no reason. It would not actually simulate me to torture me since whether or not I am simulated makes no difference to how well I can tell that.

So sure it can say I am being tortured a million times, and if I believe that then it works, but if I don't believe it then it's just wasting resources to do it since doing it doesn't change whether I believe it or not.
