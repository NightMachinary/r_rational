There are no arbiters for the challenge; it's just two players. If you violate the rules of the challenge, the only person who's going to tattle on you is the other person (and ideally, you've already both agreed not to show the logs, so maybe not even them). So if you both agree to /whatever/, whether it's sexual favors, money, or the advancement of the interests of Pat Robertson, that might produce an "AI wins" scenario or an "AI loses" scenario, both of which would be indistinguishable from any other reported win or loss scenario. It is possible that all reported wins come from violations of the stated rules, or understandings arrived at between players.

(I /personally/ would consider any outside-game proposal to be in violation of the spirit of the challenge, and would likely decline in order to discourage such chicanery, just as a general rule.)
