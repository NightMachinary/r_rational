Well, with the original game they didn't want to reveal logs because the point was to keep the discussion on an abstract level (i.e. if logs were revealed, people would read them and decide "oh that wouldn't convince me", without realising that something else probably would; the discussion would move to the object level of actual arguments made in the logs, rather than meta level of "people can be convinced to let AI out of the box").

Keeping logs secret would be more difficult with more people around.

But I guess for subsequent games you could decide on having a number of arbiters.
