My own guess is that "the hard way" means:\\
- Figure out what motivates the other person in general. Why are they here, why are they doing this challenge in the first place.\\
- Figure out what would motivate them to 'open the box' specifically, and their motivations of not opening it.\\
- Make it so that they're so motivated to open it, and not motivated to not open it.

People keep trying to think that there's an 'easy way', one technique that would work on everyone or something. So I'm guessing the 'hard way' is figuring out which technique would work on the specific individual.
