As the problem is generally formulated, the AI is so far ahead of us in terms of cognition (and thus, technology) that it's really more a matter of /not caring/ than it is about active attack. If you were utterly immoral and driving down the street, the only reason that you would stop in front of or swerve around a small child is that it might damage your car, slow you down, you might face repercussions.

If the AI is calibrated towards efficiency, it's going to see the Earth (or the Sun) as a resource to be used. Humans can't really put up a resistance of any kind, so there's no reason not to kill them in the course of consuming the Earth.
