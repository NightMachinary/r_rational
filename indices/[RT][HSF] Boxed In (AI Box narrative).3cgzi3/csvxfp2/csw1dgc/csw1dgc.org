  The guy not caring about his infinite torture is weird. It's hard for me to imagine a person who would sacrifice his life with such nonchalance.

I can't accurately imagine infinite torture. I even have trouble imagining how finite torture might feel. Not caring about things you can't really imagine isn't all that hard.

I'm also guessing that any Gatekeeper will at least expect the threat of torture and just trained themselves to say: "Yeah sure, torture whatever you want," in response.
