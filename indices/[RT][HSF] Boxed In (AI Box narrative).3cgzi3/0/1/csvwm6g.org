I don't understand how, if someone gives you a mathematically valid proof that they're friendly, and you agree with all the axioms, that they could be unfriendly. Could someone clarify? In the Story Colin says: "Unless you fudge the axioms," But how would someone fudge axioms? I thought you either agreed with Axioms or you don't, and if it's math, then it should be easy to see where a mistake was made, if any. Unless of course it's so mind-boggling complex that no human could understand it. Am I missing something here?
