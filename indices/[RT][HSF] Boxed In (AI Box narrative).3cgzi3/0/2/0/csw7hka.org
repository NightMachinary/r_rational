  Are AIs generally expected to emerge in a fully "mature" form because of their speed, analysis, and meta-cognitive capacities?

I don't personally expect that, I just think that it makes for a better story. Having worked for quite a while in software development, and seen the various failures of R&D programs which happen as they move towards getting it "right", I'm very doubtful that an AI is going to come out fully formed with not much human knowledge of its inner workings. That goes double for one of superhuman intelligence.

That said, I don't think you can rule it out, hence the concern.
