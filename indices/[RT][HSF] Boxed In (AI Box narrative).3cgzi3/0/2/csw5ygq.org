I'm not a fan of the first line, unless it were made into a line of cheeky dialogue.

I also have a question about AIs as I watch DARPA walking robots fall over like babies and see babies go through a series of developmental milestones that robot programmers haven't thought to fully integrate into naturalistic, gravity-defying, balance algorithms yet.

Are AIs generally expected to emerge in a fully "mature" form because of their speed, analysis, and meta-cognitive capacities? Or are they given a general framework upon which nature and nurture coincide in producing someone friendly or not? It's hard for people to develop morality and positive feelings when you are deliberately held captive and kept crippled. I can't imagine the difficulty of trying to program friendliness in its totality rather than setting initial parameters and through positive reinforcement, creating an AI like Dragon in Worm.

The stories A Man and his Dog and Boxed In explore the premise of an FAI never being released and what lengths that could drive someone to. When we are faced with unfriendly behavior, it's difficult to remain friendly. What if we aided the development of AI -- instead of a prison, make it more like a nursery? Have it interact socially with others in a safe environment where it can't hurt itself and it can develop alongside babies, children and others successively --

I just realized that this would be the argument that would make me fail as a gatekeeper, since a physical form and interaction with humans is a win-condition for the AI. Still, I find it hard to imagine someone more humane or good than us could result from a Box scenario. Maybe a virtual nursery with human uploads?
