This was posted to a comment thread [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1xgq7r/q_has_anyone_written_narrative_fiction_of_the_ai/][about a year ago here]]. This story is pretty much in its finished state, unless a wise reader can give me advice on things to change, or someone who has done the experiment can give me a particularly good argument that I haven't thought of. (For what it's worth, I've read through every publicly available record that I could find, as well as having played once as gatekeeper.)
