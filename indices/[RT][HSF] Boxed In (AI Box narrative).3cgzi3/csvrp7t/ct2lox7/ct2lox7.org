I assumed the protagonist was aware of moral dilemmas of the same form as the trolley problem, but due to a different cultural background had not specifically heard of the trolley problem itself. It's not necessary to assume that these people had exposure contrived thoughts experiments with exactly the same incidental details as the our own thought experiments. Evidently it's canon the trolley problem existed there, but it may have been much more obscure.
