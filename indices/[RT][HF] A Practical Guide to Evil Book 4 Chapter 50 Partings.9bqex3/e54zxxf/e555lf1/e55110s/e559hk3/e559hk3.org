  Hakram, that gossipy bitch.

Scott Pilgrim reference? Even if it isn't, it made me laugh!

Judging by the comments I keep reading, I feel like I'm one of the few not shipping Cat with Vivienne (or gunning for some odd threesome or foursome among the girls). Wasn't it established that she's straight? I honestly would like Cat best with Hakram... They already love each other, Cat is bisexual, Hakram's amorous, and physiological differences between species aren't really a problem when your body is a concept. Hell, Cat could probably glamour up some tusks to get Hakram's motor running if her flat cow teeth turn him off too much!

Anyway, good chapter, nice cliff, and a plus that EE dispelled the confusion about "dark elves." I wonder why the term stuck if drow aren't elves and don't really look like them?
