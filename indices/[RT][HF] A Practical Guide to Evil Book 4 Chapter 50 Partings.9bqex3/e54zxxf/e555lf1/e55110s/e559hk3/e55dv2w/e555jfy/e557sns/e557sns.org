It's especially validating to see other characters (e.g. Cat and Archer) acknowledging it as Masego's intrinsic orientation, rather than treating it as an obstacle to be overcome.

'Course, I'll be happiest when I start seeing more ace characters with varied personality types--including warm, socially adept, emotionally expressive aces--rather than hyper-focused ultranerd research dudes every time. But ace Masego is worlds better than no ace, and Masego is a really fun character regardless.
