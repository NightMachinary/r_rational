I guess I sort of wish it didn't follow from his character as much--I don't want to feel like he's ace /because/ he's not very social and prioritizes his research above human contact and physical urges, since of course in reality any personality type can coincide with an ace orientation, and he'd still be ace if he abandoned magic tomorrow. That said, I don't have any inherent problem with ace characters who are like Masego, I'm just looking forward to a future where that's only one of a wide variety of ace personalities represented in fiction.
