Akua in a single sentence. Doing a ton of shit she didn't care about just to keep up with social expectations. I would bet that even her fling with Fasili was merely a way to keep him happy at the moment he was most useful. No wonder she wanted to end the world and watch it burn.

Also, Indrani didn't repeat herself once when calling her names. That's some GSGT Hartman shit right there.

Edit: rather ugly typo
