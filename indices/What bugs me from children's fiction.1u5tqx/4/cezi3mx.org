It has been a while since I read /A Series of Unfortunate Events/, but if I recall correctly, a big part of what made the Baudelaire orphans interesting as characters was that they were very clever and resourceful. Violet was an inventor and Klaus was well read (Sunny was an infant, and thus, somewhat less of interest, to me at least). The money mostly served primarily as a lure for the villians of the stories.

I think the kids would have turned out pretty interesting even if they weren't wealthy and terribly unlucky.
