I'm reminded of Eric Flint's [[http://www.baenebooks.com/chapters/074347175X/074347175X___1.htm][essay on why he opened the 163x universe:]]

  I wanted to produce this kind of anthology early in the series because I wanted, as much as possible, to capture something which is usually missing in alternate history series:

  History is complicated. It is not the story of a few people, it is the story of an immense number of people---each of them full individuals in their own right, each of them having their own greater or lesser impact on developments.

  In the nature of things, fictional series---like biographies---tend to give the illusion that history marches more-or-less in lockstep with the actions of the main characters of the story. That's almost inevitable, given the very nature of narrative. But it is an illusion, and I wanted to avoid it as much as possible in the unfolding 1632 series.

  Yes, Mike Stearns and Rebecca Abrabanel and Jeff Higgins and Gretchen Richter and the other major characters I created in 1632 will continue to be major characters in the series. But they are not Greek gods and goddesses. They are simply people---and what happens to them will, in the end, be deeply affected by the actions of a Jewish jeweler in Prague trying desperately to prevent one of the worst pogroms in history, a small town Catholic priest undergoing a crisis of conscience, and a woman in late middle age who simply decides to found a school.

It's actually really hard to tell a story in which an entire civilization is the hero.
