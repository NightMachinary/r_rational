Allow me to leap to the defence of the Artemis Fowl series. Yes, he was born to a rich family. However, Artemis' defining characteristic in my opinion is his technological genius and unrivalled planning abilities. This is due to a combination of his father teaching him well from a young age, investigating through his own curiosity, and having the resources to successfully do so. These factors, all of them either inherited or merited, serve to breed the most versatile character possible. In addition, he does not simply exploit his money for the purpose of such, he later meets people who are better at planning than him, and we're able to outsmart him. Though he is humbled from time to time, Artemis always adapts to his fallacies in order to overcome adversaries. He learns more about sustainability as well, and the books present ecological problems in a rational face that appeals to Artemis' own conservative mind. This way, yes, Artemis was born in an advantageous position, though nothing as pretentious as being "the chosen one", but this is the starting point for years of interesting character development and constantly improving rationality.
