Oh, definitely. Riordan's series are horrible; I think it didn't help that he started with "dyslexia and ADD (or ADHD, or whatever they call it now) are symptoms of awesomeness" and went on from there. A protagonist with dyslexia and awesomeness might be reasonable... But not a protagonist with dyslexia /because/ awesomeness.
