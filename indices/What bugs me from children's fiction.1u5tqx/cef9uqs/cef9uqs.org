Well yes, you could argue that the stories are something out of their control based on their birth, but that's such a narrow definition. Every story has that plot. If the plot involved something within their control, they would end it without any drama. Everyone is given their "interestingness" by something out of their control, because they were born with certain genetic predispositions and brought up in a society that wanted to raise them a certain way.

In /The Hunger Games/, there is a lot that is special about the main characters. They had to be born in a specific situation where they would participate in the hunger games, and they had to be determined enough to win. They had to be the right people in the right time, just like rich people or wizards. Sure, the determinism about it is less blatant, but it's just as true.
