it was the prophecy that attracted attention to him, though his survival was attributable to his mother.

I didn't think his survival was much of a thing though. The world thought he was special because he had lived, but the author didn't - it was just backstory.

Now, the fact that he had a prophecy about him (or only one other person) made him previously special, but that is separate from the wizard making him special.\\
I'm not arguing that there were not external factors, just that his wizardhood didn't matter any more than the fact that I'm a human is special (though it too gives me superpowers over most creatures I might meet).
