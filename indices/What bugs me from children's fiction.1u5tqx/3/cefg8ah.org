Well, there's two things to say here.

1) Duuude, you should totally read Diane Duane's /Young Wizards/ series. No chosen ones there!

2) Unfortunately, a realistic portrayal of a lower-proletarian lifestyle doesn't really allow for "and then the kid had a brilliant opportunity to get his hands on Applied Phlebotinum, become a magical knight, and save the world from dragons." Usually even the pettiest Applied Phlebotinum is kind of confined to the middle classes. In fact, the life of a truly impoverished person is so difficult that they'd Miss the Call because they're too busy struggling to eat or pay rent. It's /hard/ to tell stories about kids that poor.
