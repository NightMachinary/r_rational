I haven't seen it in years, but I think Sunshine ([[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0448134/]]) at least attempts to be a rational story. There are lots and lots of movies where characters have some sort of a mission that will decide the fate of humanity, but this is the only one I know where the characters actually seem to understand what it means, the gravity of the situation, and try to act with a kind of pragmatic ruthlessness, as you would.

I can't guarantee that this is a 100% successful rationalist movie. I am sure that if I re-watched it, I'd notice lots of stupid stuff, too. But at least the movie had its brain in the right place and tried.
