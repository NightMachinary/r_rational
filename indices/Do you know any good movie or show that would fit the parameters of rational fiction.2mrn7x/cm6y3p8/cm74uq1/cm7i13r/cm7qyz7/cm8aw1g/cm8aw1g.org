Oddly, since the book is mostly specific to the medium of television (and not all vapid enterprise), there is little irony. On some level, if your prior estimate on the probability of television being unfixably deficient is so low you /do/ need the entire book to convince you, it is likely a testament to the spectacular power of television to hide or attempt to eliminate all complexity of those potential issues (you'd be surprised how many people say "well, it's just a medium, message is what matters" as if this is a mega-powerful knockdown argument that had not at all been considered by someone who worked in the field and did enough research to fill a book -- attempting to explain that it isn't that simple has led people to just keep repeating themselves at me... it's somewhat alarming).
