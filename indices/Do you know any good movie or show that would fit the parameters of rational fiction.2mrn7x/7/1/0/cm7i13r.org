Gerry Mander's Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television is perhaps more comprehensive than anyone needs, but I think it's not getting dumber, and you are not becoming a cranky old coot shouting at youngsters. It's very likely that it just takes time to get familiar enough with something so it moves from superstimulus to I-can-see-how-this-is-a-flawed-mechanism to this-is-annoying to how-could-I-possibly-have-time-for-anything-delivered-via-this-clearly-poor-mechanism.
