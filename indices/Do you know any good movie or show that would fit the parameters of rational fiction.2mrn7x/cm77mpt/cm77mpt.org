Elementary.

Now, this isn't a rational detective show, those are from my prespective pretty much impossible to do with presenting, investigating and solving a murder in an one hour runtime, and much of the criticisms that might apply to the classic Sherlock Homes and its derivatives apply here too. Yes, even to the spectacular "Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century" which gaves us the Hound of the Baskervilles on the Moon.

And although I do enjoy how the writers do try to use real concepts in plausible cenarios, even I will admit that they do take quite a bit of shortcuts and usual tricks which do not reflect reality in service of drama. And that's fine really.

Because the truth, is that Elementary is a rational sociological show.

Its interest comes from how the people work and live in belieavable ways, how they give themselves goals and work towards them, how they react in realistic ways and how they change and adapt their goals based on what happens. Contrary to the inferior example of BBC Sherlock in my opinion, here a grumpy or insulting Holmes is called out on his actions and words repeatedly, both when he's only trying to disguise his social bias with pseudo-science words and when his actions are in fact counter-productive to his objectives because he's human and his errors are human as well.

It also has one of the best portrayals of addiction and its dificulties I've ever seen on a show.

And now here's a series of spoilerrific examples from the first two seasons and the beginning of this new third one:

[[#s][Holmes]]

[[#s][Moriarty]]

It's really a wonderful show, which might not use the common 'rational' elements that fit all the checkboxes, but on the aspects that it wants to improve and stand out as such, it does so beautifully.

Also, it has [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-aB2hU3axc][this trailer]].
