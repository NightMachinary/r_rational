I meant more the raw strength of the prose. koizumi isn't "slightly stressed", it's "frazzled, like a rag that had been used to mop up one spilled tea after another." it feels too potent a line for a slightly tired individual, or a subtly exhausted individual. This might be personal biases, though.
