- "The Tinker's Daughter" - If the work focuses more on Jess
- "The Murder of Worlds"
- "Thinking Machine" - If the work focuses more on Rob
- "The Tinker's Legacy"
- "Erudition" - If the book ends/results in FOOM.

"The Tinker's Daughter" is my favorite of these. Fits fantasy naming schema in my head, and makes you want to read the blurb.
