He's actually made of metal, I'm afraid. 'magesteel' (basically, enchanted steel) to be precise. I like the term 'clayshaper', though. I might build a specialist wizard character around the term...maybe an terramancer who got caught in a rogue mana surge while he was earthwalking; he became a sapient clay statue, retaining all his magical powers but now bearing the form of clay. His body is protean as long as he keeps himself from drying out.
