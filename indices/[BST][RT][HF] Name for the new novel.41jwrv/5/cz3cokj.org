I have a strong preference for unique single word titles in the style of wildbow's naming scheme with /Worm/, /Pact/, and /Twig/. But thinking of a single good word to summarize your book which hasn't already been used before is hard.

- Golem
- Tinker (Wen Spencer already used this one)
- Clayshaper, Claytinker, Clayworker, Clayautomata or some other material+builder word for the title

But there are a few phrase-style titles I can come up with.

- Clay Machine
- Clay Fighter
- Clay and Magic
- Daughter of Clay, Friend of Clay, and Fighter of Clay
- Learning from Clay
- My Father the Clayshaper
- My Friend is Made of Clay
- The Clayshaper's Daughter
- Golem with Feet of Clay (references [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feet_of_clay][feet of clay]] and while it doesn't work with your summary, I was wondering if it fits any particular characterization of Jess or Rob)

Most of my title ideas basically can be summed up as combining the material of the golem (guessed to be clay) with some interaction between Jess and Rob.

If you liked "The Clayshaper's Daughter" and go with it, credit and the free book should go to JackStargazer since I was just trying to improve on "The Tinker's Daughter".
