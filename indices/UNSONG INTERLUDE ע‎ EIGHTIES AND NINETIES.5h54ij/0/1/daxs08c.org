  Welcome to the desert of the real.
#+end_quote

The line became the title of a Marxist book, and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welcome_to_the_Desert_of_the_Real][the Wikipedia page for the book]] says that it refers to a quote from /Simulacra and Simulation/:

#+begin_quote
  If once we were able to view the Borges fable in which the cartographers of the Empire draw up a map so detailed that it ends up covering the territory exactly [...] this fable has now come full circle for us, and possesses nothing but the discrete charm of second-order simulacrum [...] It is the real, and not the map, whose vestiges persist here and there in the deserts that are no longer those of the Empire, but ours. The desert of the real itself.

Which is indeed ominous.
