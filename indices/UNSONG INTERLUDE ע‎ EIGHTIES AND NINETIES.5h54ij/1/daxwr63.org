There are surprisingly few eighties and nineties in this chapter.

I see a 538 (BC, in the epigraph), a 19 (th century, with Phineas Gage), a 3 (days that the mud is available for viewing), 50 (countries in UNSONG), 100's (of dollars for a Name), 250 (pages in The Temple and the Marketplace), 5 and 11 (chapter and verse in Job), 3 (recounts), 20 (electoral votes), 100,000,000,000 (chance of coincidence (ignoring TINACBNIEAC)), and 40 and 4 (Chapter and verse in Isiah).

In fact the /only/ numbers in the chapter between 80 and 99 (inclusive) are the years that the events are taking place in. This is not a coincidence because nothing is ever a coincidence.
