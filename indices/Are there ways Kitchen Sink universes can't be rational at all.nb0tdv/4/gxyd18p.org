My take is that the only way to rationalise a Kitchen Sink world is to give all these powers a common origin, but one so distant in time and causality that it appears as if the powers were unrelated.

Bare bones version:

Once upon a time, not long after the Big Bang, there was a race of beings. These beings achieved Technological Singularity, then merged with their femto-technology and became "gods" vastly posthuman intelligences permeating space-time.

These *Gods* then decided to use their godtech to influence the creation and evolution of countless species, both Aliens and human. Among humans, they gave us a set of engineered genes that allows us to tap into the femto-technological network that permeates the Universe. But they left the expression of this Power Gene to be very open ended.

The *Power Gene* started mutating and evolving. At first, it responded to epigenetic and environmental cues, giving humans simple crude powers, or merging us with animals. This is the Origin of various supernatural creatures (from immortal elves to shapeshifting werewolves, and from vampires to plant-folk).\\
As humans evolved higher intelligence, our Power Gene allowed us to subconsciously, and then consciously tap into the Godtech.

Most of us who managed to consciously connect to it only had a weak connection and poor understanding of it, and had to amplify the effect with potions, herbs, meditation, drugs etc. This is the origin of *Witchcraft.*

Others managed to tap into the Godtech rationally, write down whole manuals, and a simplified "programming language" that allows one to control the Godtech somewhat. These is the origin of *Magic*, and it was independently discovered by various cultures and races throughout the universe, creatign countless different "schools" of Magic.

Soon a rough "types" of magic users formed:

- Mages: who had both powerfully expressed Power Gene, and great skills at using the Godtech (Powerful AND Skilled)

- Wizards: who had a weak expression of the Power Gene, but great skills at using the Godtech, and lots of theoretical knowledge of it ("wisdom" - hence Wizards) (Weak but Skilled)

- Sorcerers: weak Power Gene expression, and varied skills, but substituted by making deals with more powerful supernatural beings and using artefacts of Power.

Now, all that accounts for people who had a CONSCIOUS CONNECTION to the Godtech via their Power Gene.

But all the time there would be people born who had subconscious, almost animalistic connection to it, without being actually able to perceive the Godtech. Rather than able to "see the keyboard of the Universe" they only can forcefully smash a button or two. Most of them would go mad and kill themselves with their Power. But some would survive, and become Heroes, "gods", Seers etc, and even start their own supernatural bloodline, and form new supernatural species.

After the start of the Scientific Revolution, we started to notice these people, and study them. Turns out that the subconscious use of the Power Gene is caused when it undergoes a random mutation not suitable to produce a Mage or a Witch. We started calling these people *Mutants*.

As human race became more numerous, more and more Mutants would be born and survive to adulthood. Some would have children, and some of these children would inherit their Mutation, or have their own unique one.

Finally, There would be numerous attempts to graft Power Gene on people who either do not have it, or have it weakly expressed. The rare successful cases are called *Mutates.* Usually, Mutates have a simpler but more refined version of a Power that the Mutant donor had.

In general, Magic and Mutant Powers cannot coexist in one individual. Magic requires a conscious connection and hands-on control of the Power, while Mutant Powers require a subconscious, instinctual "tapping into" the Godtech. Not only would that require the Power Gene to activate /twice in one individual/, but said individual would have to be extremely good at compartmentalising their mind. Perhaps less than one in a million Powered people has the potential to be both a Mage and a Mutant, and almost always they just default to Mutant.

So, there you go. One simple system that accounts for Gods, "gods", supernatural races, Mages, Witches, Mutants and Mutates; both human and Alien alike.
