It's just a matter of how much effort you want to put into it. Most people don't want to put in the base level of effort for a single system, not when so much of it is probably not going to be central to the story.

And yes, if you compare the costs involved in building worlds, doing two systems that are each confined to their own separate world seems like it would be less complicated than having both systems in the same world ... at least to a point.

It's kind of a matter of personal preference, but I've always had a problem with X-men's integration with the rest of Marvel superhero stuff, which is that logically speaking, everything should either get put in a 'weird shit' bucket, or else lumped into an /inaccurate/ bucket. Spider-Man isn't a mutant, but it's not like anyone is checking him for an X-gene (and I think in some continuities, he /is/ a mutant). So if all this stuff starts happening at once, then maybe the government, media, or society would just say "hey, here's some weird stuff" and it would all be handled by the same organizations with the same kinds of conversations around them. This, in turn, would reduce the worldbuilding overhead needed, since the common folk might not know or care that e.g. The Flash was created through a freak accident that taps into the Speed Force rather than being born with an incredible 'gift'. A government agency responsible for "weird shit" might have detailed knowledge of the five or six ur-sources of that weird shit, but a lot of their protocols are the same. Again, that's a reduction in worldbuilding overhead. To give a small example, imagine that there are two power sets: one is a group of aliens who can shapeshift to blend in with normal society, while the other is a group from a parallel Earth that have been kidnapping and replacing important people. There's a lot of overlap there, and so the worldbuilding effort needed to realistically think about institutional and societal responses is actually somewhat lower. In a lot of cases, it's more about the effects than the systems which create those effects.

(Side note: I would love a novel focusing on a bureaucrat tasked with building up a government agency that has to deal with an ever-increasing number of paranormal, parascience, etc. developments. Yes, aliens exist and have been visiting Earth, but also there are parallel timelines, and occasional freak accidents that make superheroes, and mutations, and magic, and there have been five different societies living behind mutually-exclusive Masquerades, etc.)
