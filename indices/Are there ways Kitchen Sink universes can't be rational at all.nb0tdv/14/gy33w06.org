So I might sorta kinda have tried writing a kitchen sink world, though far, far less expansive than Marvel / DC (I am but one author, at most). Marvel and DC (and crossover fanfiction) kinda set the standard that these things could coexist without issue, so I ignored puting my Medieval fantasy and turn-of-the-millennium superhero stuff in the same universe as a problem for quite some time.

But, like, I think I have it sort of worked out into something that fits together coherently?

The key thing was working out the origins of all the magics (and I include superpowers and Clarktech as magic, for these purposes). By some fantastic bout of luck, my early concepts made it possible to tie everything to a small number of thaumogeneses. All the varieties evolve from these common origins, and if I really, really wanted to, I could probably get much deeper into the weeds (but then I'd inevitably have to nerf some of the more overpowered stuff, which I might do for a fanfictiony adaptation, but it's wormed its way too deep to excise all of the worst offenders).

But how does this affect civilization? Comics have the problem of trying to remain status quo, but also stay current, but also include the likes of Reed Richards and Lex Luthor and frequent alien invasions. So, yeah, either pull a /Worm/ to restrain those things (and watch the status quo go up in blood and ash anyway), or turn it into speculative fiction, or tone down the super. I mostly lean into the third option. Medieval mages should have broken history, so they have to have some gaping personality / tactical / geopolitical weaknesses that force them to collapse. My unifying model of Qi demands certain impacts, so those impacts must be felt, or the qi must be restrained ... or both, as a driving force of the overarching conflict in one front is powerful entities discovering how insanely useful qitech could be, and villains continuously intervening to delay the revolution long enough for the plot to happen. Do other planets have demons, since Earth does? Yes, but distribution of demons is effected by distribution of magics, so a random low-magic planet is unlikely to secretly harbor an abyss of evil. Aliens visit Earth? Obviously the space colonization industry goes from fringe to relevant overnight, so the timeline must be handled with care. Etc, etc.

The biggestproblem, I think, is that, after reading HPMoR and doubling my rationalization efforts, I've been writing much less. I don't think those are related, though. Besides, it probably would be terrible, anyway, regardless of rationality.

(Aliens capable of visiting Earth have access to some form of magic, axiomatically. FTL that doesn't break the universe is basically magic, after all. Still struggling to have that cake and eat it, without time-travel paradoxes, but Relativity's a B.)

The one thing that comics do that I've avoided, though, is gods. Mostly. There is a multiverse, containing at least one high fantasy world with a pantheon, but that's the exception; everything surrounding Earth-realm refuses to say anything particular about any god(s) in particular. Even the demons I mentioned earlier are contextualized less as biblical demons, and more as magic constructs, modeled after the intelligences who interact with them (hence the bouncing between anthropomorphic and eldrich). I sometimes just call these "superdemons" to contrast them with the spiritual concept. I did have a couple of these claim to be Grecoroman gods at one point, but I'm probably cutting that (and it was not treated as necessarily true when I first made that note over 15 years ago).

But all this "villains raid your department of thaumology lab to delay the revolution" excuses feel increasingly forced, the more detailed I get, though. Especially when the biggest player in this regard is not actually antiprogress, and is smart enough to eventually realize what they're holding back... long before they should actually stop. And if HPMoR gets written in a world where aliens made a mess in 2005, this character would read it, and be all like "Oh. Oopse."
