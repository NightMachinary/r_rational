Maybe the perception of Batman being a normal person is what drives his power. Worm deconstructed Batman with Victor, so imagine a skill vampire, but instead of touch he drains physical and mental skills of those who admire him ANDâ€Œ train to become more like him around the world. (Not much point in training if you know you'll never reach a superhuman level, but a "regular human" level easy)
