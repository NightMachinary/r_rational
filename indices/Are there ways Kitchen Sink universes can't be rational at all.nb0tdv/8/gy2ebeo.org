So, the way I see the Mutants vs Mages thing is kind of like this.

Let's say you want to move a block. It's not a heavy block. One character might have the Mutant power of /arms/; that is to say, a jointed limb that ends in a hand which can be used to pick up and move the block. Another might go to the effort of building a headset that reads his brainwaves and uses them as control signals to control a robotic cart with a small crane; all of which he has built himself. This would be analogous to the Magic user.

Now, both of them can use the blocks. The Magic user has had to put a lot more up-front effort into the whole business - he had to make the headset, the crane, the cart, while the Mutant just had to get born - but it's not like he doesn't have advantages. Let's say that the block is near the maximum weight that the Mutant can lift; even is he uses /all/ his Arm power. Now, what happens if they need to move a block ten times the weight? The Magic user can get a more powerful crane fairly easily. The Mutant? The best he can do is a lengthly program of training and exercise.

Now what if we need a block moved that's a hundred times the weight?

So, the Magic user has a lot more in the way of /initial/ costs. But once he's paid those initial costs, he also has a lot more /range/ of ability. There's a whole raft of other differences as well - the Mutant's powers are self-repairing on the small scale, while the Magic user has to do his own basic maintenance; the Mutant cannot rebuild from nothing if his powers are completely removed while the Magic user can.
