I don't think I can agree that a kitchen sink setting necessarily precludes rationality. You've listed ways in which a setting with multiple power sources is more complex but the real world has plenty of complexity and if reality doesn't count as rational we're all in big trouble.

I agree that existing settings like the Marvel and DC universes aren't particularly rational but that is a product of how they were stitched together from many independent properties, not an inherent rule of kitchen sinks.
