#+begin_quote
  Monks that should have Chi
#+end_quote

I'm going kinda off track but I'm reminded of a world where different factions of monks used either ki or chi, with different associated powers and effects. I always thought it strange why they learn and incorporate each other's techniques.

From a meta perspective the reference was to the different ways a reader might say the pinyin word Qi (translates to blood or HP+MP+SP), depending on whether they were familiar enough with pinyin to realize Q=soft ch.

From a world perspective it made no sense though.
