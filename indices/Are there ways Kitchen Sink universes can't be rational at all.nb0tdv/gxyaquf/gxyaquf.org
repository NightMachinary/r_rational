Our reality is a Kitchen Sink World and we exhibit some very wacky and characteristically irrational behavior.

Here's how I true to fathom it.

Our Kitchen Sink World is a reality where all ends meet because all time happens all the time.

Now everything isn't happening literally at once, but literally moments from the past and future are happening while you read this sentence.

How does that work?

Multiple states of matter can coexist and we have our quantum mechanics to prove instantaneous causation through entanglement.

To me, that means we are ALL happening at once.

There are other realities happening within and without our own reality, but not apart from it, is my belief.

Our world does not have obvious superheroes, but we have preternatural phenomena and strangeness all over.

How does Big Foot, Reptilians, and Grey aliens all exist?

My belief is that our realities are all overlapped, not that much unlike a dream where we can leave one place and arrive somewhere inexplicably.

So how do constants fit into a world of chaos?

Order, natural and impersonal or employed and guided, is the system we have yet to unanimously agree on.

We know we need air, blood, water, and more, but we are slow in agreeing that the systems governing larger reality have needs as well.

My head canon is that concepts like “money” “sex” and “power” never go away, they just change and hopefully evolve for the better.

In our Kitchen Sink World the emergence of UAP and other fascinating anomalies really only offer us one clear line of action: demand increased transparency.

Now do we need the 6th Sense and suddenly have all the living people see all the ghostly people around us?

Maybe, idk, I'm in control.

But I suspect we could gain a lot by simply agreeing that as a whole Earth we both know and don't know a lot more than we have been willingly to acknowledge.

If there is a need to hide the truth, we need to find better ways of understanding why. Because right now our reality looks like a kitchen with two adjacent sinks. One is clean, but careful with a black light. And the other is full of shit, piss, and vinegar. With a lot of added goodies.

Kitchen Sink Worlds do not make sense because our own world does not make sense.

Marvel, DC, and other Kitchen Sink worlds fail to reflect whole reality because WE FAIL to know whole reality.

So, whether that reality is a “truth is stranger than my own worst dreams” kind of nightmare, what we can see with our own senses is that billions of people suffer next to those who do not and will not reveal why they see no need for radical change.

Our Kitchen Sink would have to understand so much in a proper context to really feel the mingling of our millions.

And better, because time keeps collapsing and expanding culture, science, art, and religion, we can hardly keep up with the amount of time we're allotted from work.

Someday we will have a story that feels like our 21st lives are finally understood, but that may not be until we see how bizarrely divided our own reality has become.
