I think you'll need to clarify what you mean with a world being rational. Rational is usually a property ascribed to stories rather than worlds, and depends a lot on where the focus of the story is. If you mean internally self-consistent then no, marvel/DC is not. However. there could be any number of reasons for why a world would look like the marvel/DC world including alien brain parasites or divine micromanagement.

In a world with many path of gaining superhuman powers, I'd expect there to be regular screening in schools for aptitude in each of the path and counsilors specialized in helping superhumans to use their powers in the work force. I find it more likely that people will care about the power level someone can get than that the method of acquiring it.
