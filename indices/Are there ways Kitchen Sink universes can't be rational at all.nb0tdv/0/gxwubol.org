"A story is finite in length. To have anything in it, an infinite number of things must be excluded."

The sort of story that tries to include everything typically fails to be internally consistent, to say nothing of rational. Authors often fail to coherently present a single system with a single set of rules. Adding an additional system working on divergent principles makes this much harder, as not only must both systems be worked out properly, but the interactions between the systems must be defined. Adding a third system means two more sets of interactions. Adding dozens of conflicting systems passes from the realm of madness into the realm of Sparta. Needless to say, rationality is left behind far before the kitchen sink is full.
