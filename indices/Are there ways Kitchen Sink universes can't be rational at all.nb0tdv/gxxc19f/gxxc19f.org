It's definitely much harder to write a reasonable world with both mutants and mages than one with one but not both, and I think it's probably true that the additional difficulty from adding mages to a mutant world or mutants to a mage world is bigger than from adding either of them to a muggle world. Adding Charles Atlas Superpowers - let's call them Monks if we need a word for them - is probably another, larger jump in difficulty. But it can be done.

W. Dow Rieder writes Doc Future's world, and manages it by providing a unified mechanism which underlies both mutant and mages, and then adding some extra things for the Monks. (Cognitive augmentation for the main couple, and having restraint for what other Monk powers exist, e.g. Jetgirl and +Iron+ Neodymium Man clearly have built really impressive flying machines and have access to much better tech than us, but aren't otherwise implausible.) He's written about the underlying logic in [[https://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/87548056861/behind-the-future-part-1-creating-a-superhero][Behind The Future]].

The Whateley Universe is, well, it's completely batshit insane, but derivative works have built on it and made it come out basically reasonable (there's a bunch of [[https://glowfic.com/posts/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&board_id=&character_id=&setting_id=1059&subject=&commit=Search][glowfic]]). And it /started/ with the power classification system where Mage is actually just one of your subratings on your Mutant powers denoting "large natural gift for magic"; anyone else /can/ learn magic, but it's much, much harder so few muggles ever pull it off and therefore most people didn't believe in magic until mutants started cropping up (which was some time in the 20th Century).
