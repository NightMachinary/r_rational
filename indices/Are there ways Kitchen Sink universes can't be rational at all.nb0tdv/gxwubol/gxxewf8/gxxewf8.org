There are several different layers of problems you are pointing out and several different solutions.

On one level there is the narrative conceit that the Fantasy Kitchen World is like ours unless otherwise noted. Worm used a recent point of divergence to make this work and the contrast between Aleph and Bet as a narrative device to note to the reader where the real world and Worm diverged. In a world with an early divergence (ancient aliens, ancient magic traditions, etc.) a more complex is needed for why the world looks the same as ours (Earth is a isolated backwater that the aliens ignore, the mages have vowed non-interference and secrecy with regard to non-magical phenomena etc.). At some point, the reader just has to suspend disbelief and accept it on some level.

For aspects of the real world that exist in the fictional world that should interact with the supernatural stuff (Wiccans trying magic, Monks that should have Chi)... I would say let it, just keep the power levels low. The monks, and even top athletes in a world with Chi outperform ours in a way that would be recognized as mildly superhuman if scientists could compare them with our world, but since they can't, scientists don't recognize Chi... or maybe it is a fringe controversial subject where a few scientists have proposed it and have weak evidence based on body heat and metabolic rates and anecdotes of super human feats that seem to beat physics but nothing firm. Likewise for Wiccans.. a lot of religious people already think their prayers work in-spite of studies otherwise, so they would think the same in a world with magic... and it would be a controversial field of science trying to quantify what prayers and religions and rituals are most efficacious.

As to another issue... there is the issue of world building consistency. Worm has shown you can have a single underlying phenomena result in a variety of powers perceived as magic and demons and mutations by people. Now imagine another pair of entires decided on a slower more secretive cycle that would last three times longer and allow the hosts a more consistent power set from host to host but with more ways to use those powers (including ways to pass powers on). These powers might be even more perceived as magic and if the canon pair of entities show up you would end up with two very different general categories of power interacting with each other. In general, given non reductionist mind-interacting phenomena I think you could naturally get mutants and magic and gods and trained seemingly mundane humans, and super science enhanced humans all using the same underlying phenomena but because of different historical origins and means of accessing the phenomena are perceived very differently.
