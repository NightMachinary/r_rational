Sure. Worm...kind of does that. But that's also an insanely long book.

You need some kind of fairly general explanation, and the more disparate things you need to explain, the greater the challenge. I think you could take a rational approach to all sorts of things, but trying to do literally everything in a single book is setting a huge challenge for yourself, and most stories don't strictly need that.
