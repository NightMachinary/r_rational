If you want self-consistent deep worldbuilding with many different genres, I recommend [[https://neorice.com/hoh_1][Hero Oh Hero]], a pixel-art serial webcomic that has released 3+ pages a week for eight years. It follows three separate protagonists, who experience a wide variety of genres within the same world.

There is a main magic system, that most people think of as the only magic, but there seem to be other magic systems that may or may not come from the same power source, and so far haven't had any intersection with the main system (e.g. magic suppression and detection don't work on these alternate systems).

So far, everything has been self consistent, and the author has a huge amount of private world-building that hasn't been shown on screen. This story has complicated political and governance systems, even though they aren't important to the plot.
