Witcher universe is kinda like that. There are mutants and biotechnology (using magic), knights, kings, wizards and parallel worlds with advanced technology (humans arrrived on the Witcher world in "metal ships").

But it's pretty well thought-out. Magic outcompeted science among the exiles from scientifically advanced worlds because it had quicker payoffs and didn't required backing of industrialized civillization.

The source of magic, mutations and monsters is ultimately the same and it also is the creation myth of this world. Magic is a little like nukes - every kingdom needs it and magical guild is a powerful political force deciding wars and guiding kings from behind the curtain. And the politicians that want to win against them start hate campaigns to make commoners riot against "the witches".

And then there's Witchers who are result of magical genetic experiments and are universally hated by commoners, politicians and wizards who created them.
