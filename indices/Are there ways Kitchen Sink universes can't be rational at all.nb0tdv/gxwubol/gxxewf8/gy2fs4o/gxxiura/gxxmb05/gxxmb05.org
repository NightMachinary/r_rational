They aren't necessarily “just” mutants. Perhaps a long time ago a mutant/magic user experimented with contagious and inheritable “curses” that also had beneficial effects and thus created werewolves/vampires/witches. Fast forward several hundred or thousand years, repeat for a variety of magic users and you have entire magical species that exist and have no obvious connection/origin relative to the other fantasy kitchen sink stuff.

For learning the power... if the first MCU sorcerer supreme uses his (or her) infinity stone to experiment with tapping into alternate dimensions she could expand beyond just time manipulation. By save scumming timelines she could perform really risky and unstable dimensional manipulations, brute forcing solutions and techniques. In some cases, she stumbles across dimensions that respond to her mind and intentions and she develops foundational techniques leveraging them to perform more complex things. She also bootstraps a way of allowing people without the infinity stone to learn to access these other dimensions. Continue for several thousand years and she has “magic” that can be passed on and leveraged.

Or for a simpler example... a Psionic mutant directs their TK proprioception and telepathy at understanding the neural basis of their powers... and develops a way to pass them on to apprentices, who in turn can pass them on further. The end result: telepathy that can be taught by other telepaths.

Repeat for various traditions of bootstrapped contagious/inheritable/teachable powers and you end up with a fantasy kitchen sink. Add in a secret balance of power to them and you can at least maintain enough reader disbelief about how they existed to the modern day with only recently becoming impactful and public knowledge.

As for Batman... when a smart and obsessively motivated multimillionaire spends his fortune tracking down every bit of magic and supernaturally enhanced training usable by someone with no initial magical talent they are going to end up pretty ridiculously powerful. Of course Batman is clever and good at using deception: everyone knows it's totally mundane discipline and training that lets him see through illusions, not a risky and painful magical ritual to gain permanent true sight; it's extreme focus that lets him push through a literal broken back, not a bit of stolen Lazarus Pit incorporated into his suit (or body); it's extreme skill that lets him dodge an Omega Beam, not a modified from short term dose of Garrick Formula. The ridiculous thing isn't what Batman pulls off, it's that people buy that it is all just hard training.
