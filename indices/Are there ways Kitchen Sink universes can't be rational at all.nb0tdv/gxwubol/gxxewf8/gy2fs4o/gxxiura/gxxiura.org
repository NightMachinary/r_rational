"In general, given nonreductionist mind-interacting phenomena I think you could naturally get mutants and magic and gods and trained seemingly mundane humans, and super-science enhanced humans all using the same underlying phenomena but because of different historical origins and means of accessing the phenomena are perceived very differently."

Hmmm ðŸ¤”. So all those Vampires, Werewolves, and Salem Witches were just mutants this whole time. Is because of a lack of understanding. People in those days label mutants as magic. While fast forward to 2021 those witches are just metahumans with their gene activated

Ok, your comment is giving me the sci-fi and supernatural are the same vibes. Lol. It's the any advanced technology is indistinguishable from Magic concept.

Like Gods are really Aliens. Because Aliens were very godlike. I.E. Mutants are very magic-like.

We taught electricity was magic one day tell a smart person explained what is. We used to think supernatural sea creatures roam the earth. Turns out it was just Whales and maybe some creepy look deep-sea creatures.

I don't if this what you getting at. But you are giving me this vibe. It's a great concept.

But still doesn't explain the normal Humans like Batman or learning the power aspect. But then again I guessed you can remove the learning aspect. And nothing will change.
