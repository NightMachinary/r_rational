  The main problem with rationality/realism in fiction is that reality is boring. When your enemy has that many different advantages and uses them rationally... you lose. Case closed, end of discussion.

I agree with this SO SO MUCH! My only issue with HPMOR was Final Exam battle. For one, sufficiently smart Quirrell would recognize total Obliviation as being as bad as death and modify his Deathly Hallows accordingly (since they originally can store independent backups).

That's why in a Rational Story there should be similar level of power for both sides.
