(Consider this post spoilers for all HPMOR)

It's certainly correct that individual protagonists wielding a large amount of plot power are not very realistic, but that's not to say works of fiction based around these characters isn't rational. HPMOR wasn't intended to be a hyperrealistic portrayal of a rational world; it was a portrayal of a fictional world that was intended to teach rationality. While it tried to have some level of consistency, there are definitely several handwavey aspects to the worldbuilding that make it almost whimsical. This isn't necessarily a bad thing.

I also agree that rationalist fiction doesn't explore the realistic outcomes of realistic conflicts very well. Mostly I think this is because so much of it is derivative work, and usually from fantastical source material. I think rationalist fiction about an organization, rather than a person in particular, would be a good fit to depict this sort of realistic conflict, because an organization will outlive any of its individual members. I'm sort of surprised I haven't seen a James Bond series along this line, but other works certainly have the capability to explore it if they don't mind deviating very seriously from the source material -- so many rationalist fanfics are based on young adult fantasy that puts the protagonist in ridiculously out of their depth situations early on, just to shock readers, that not many of their protagonists would live very long.

I also think that

  But there are few, if any, rationalist narratives where the protagonist is forced to accept a true compromise of their values, or change their outlook because of any truly intractable problems or incompatibility between their beliefs and reality.

this is not really justified. Malfoy was supposed to be the characterization of the rationalist ability to change your mind. Harry never really has to change his mind because he's never wrong (except about Quirrell).

HPMOR also does tackle problems of sacrifice and the cost of victory, as well, just in Harry's internal monologues and not in the reality of the conflict. Most of the characterization of this is in the revealed history of the previous war, but these threads often come through into the primary narrative. Most notably, I think, Dumbledore sacrifices the child that Harry could have been, implied to be the happy, athletic, loving, brave, noble, jocky and sort of dumb version that is canon Harry. Instead, Harry is a cold, rationalist killing machine, prophesied to be capable of making mistakes as vast as destroying the light cone, perpetually tormented by this knowledge and the knowledge that he has lost at least Dumbledore and, for a while, Hermione. One way that HPMOR softens this blow is that it always does leave a way out -- Hermione's cryopreserved corpse turned into Riddle's imprisoned semantic and procedural memory, Dumbledore is frozen in time but maybe not out of reach forever. But this is because HPMOR is meant to be enthusiastic, optimistic propaganda for a techno-utopian rationalist future. Thankfully not all rationalist fiction is hobbled by that.
