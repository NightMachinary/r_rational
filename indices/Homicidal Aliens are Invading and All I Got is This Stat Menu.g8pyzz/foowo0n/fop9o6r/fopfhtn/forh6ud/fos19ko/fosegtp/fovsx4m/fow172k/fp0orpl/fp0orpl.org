Hello! I'm JayAck aka the guy who writes/wrote "Homicidal Aliens." I know my user name here is different. I can provide proff somehow if somebody needs it.

Anyway! Dunno if anybody was looking for a response but I figured I'd try anyway.

*First:* if you've read my story, thank you. 2019-2020 was a bit of a rough year for me for a number of unrelated reasons, and even though my story didn't take off as much as I'd hoped, it still did a lot better than some of my more pessimistic expectations, and I've got people like you to thank for the success I did get. Even though I've hit the brakes on the story, it's been very important to me that at the very least, my readers are aware that I am hugely grateful to them.

*Second*: The decision to stop the story wasn't a knee-jerk reaction. I started in April of 2019 between jobs but with a part-time job lined up that would allow me more time to write and maybe try my hand at this Patreon thing. But, if I didn't hit some goals over the course of 6-12 months, I'd pack it in, at least for the time being.

This decision wasn't made to be "petulant," or because of other authors, or whatever. It was made because I made a contract with myself and wasn't able to justify the time/energy the story required (more on this later). I didn't see other authors as competition and I've supported many of them this past year by either joining their Patreon, giving them money through PayPal/ Ko-Fi, or buying stuff they have online. Success isn't a limited commodity and I'm a firm believer that--especially in smaller genres like LitRPG--one person's success is good for everybody in the long run. I've never once felt another author did not deserve their success.

*Third*: I am regretting not calling this an "indefinite hiatus," as that would be more appropriate, especially given some things that have happened since I made the initial announcement. A publisher has contacted me about buying publishing rights for my story, and I've received quite a few messages lamenting the loss of future chapters so...

I dunno. I had what I felt were modest and realistic expectations for my story, and failing to meet any of them was a bit of a downer, and my timeframe for devoting myself in the way I'd like has passed.

On the other hand, "Homicidal Aliens," is several times larger than anything else I've written and has also gotten more traction than anything else I've done and it does seem a shame, given the feedback, to stop here.

So I might post an announcement or something clarifying and leaving the door open instead of closed.

Regardless, it really does mean a lot that folks I've never met showed interest and investment (whether that took the form of donating or just reading new chapters and enjoying them), and as always, I listen to my audience and take their thoughts, feelings, and criticisms to heart.

Thanks so much, and please stay safe and take care of yourselves,

~JayAck
