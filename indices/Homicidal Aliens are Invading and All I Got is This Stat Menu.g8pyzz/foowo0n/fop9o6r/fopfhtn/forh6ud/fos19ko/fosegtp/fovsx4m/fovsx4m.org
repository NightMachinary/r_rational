I think the story is a pretty good read, but the +petulant+ frustrated author's note also killed my interest in reading the last few chapters.

The wordcount is currently ~334,000 which is roughly 1/4 of the length of Worm. Seems a bit premature to call it a failure, but then again the Royal Road ecosystem does move pretty quickly.
