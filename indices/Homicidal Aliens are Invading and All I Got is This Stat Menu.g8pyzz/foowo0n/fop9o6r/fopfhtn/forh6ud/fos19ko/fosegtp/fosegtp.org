I enjoyed the first part and that's a pretty complete story which I considered worth reading. I do find it bizarre that he actually had another month (?) of chapters written and provided them to people on Patreon but decided that it'll never be posted publicly.

Sounds to me like he was unhappy that a lot of stories with obvious shortcomings are doing better on Royalroad and the Patreon never took off. I'm a real believer that the best thing to do is persevere and wait for one or two "big breaks" where the story starts to gain a critical mass of readers, but hey. He gave it a good shot for a while.
