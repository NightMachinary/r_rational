First off, I find this story very engaging and I suspect others here will as well, which is why I'm recommending it.

As to the question of its rationality, it's got some interesting contrasts. The characters behave in very believable ways, but not optimal ways -- they pick powers quickly and without spending hours on it, because they want to play with the fun toys. Anya (the MC) thinks to ask smart questions of her AI but does not phrase them as carefully as she should. The powers she chooses are sensible for her immediate future and for the kind of person she is, but they aren't the most optimal thing overall. She comes up with good battle tactics (I'm specifically thinking about the Hawaii fight) and even thinks ahead to questions of collateral damage and civilian casualties.

One of the problems of rational fiction is that it's too easy for it to fall into competence porn, where the MC never makes a single mistake. Authors have incentives for that -- every time your characters don't do the globally optimal thing, some readers will write in to say "Your characters are stupid and this isn't Rational Fiction and I'm dropping the story!!1!!" This story does a good job examining how people would probably actually behave in these circumstances, with all the rushed decisions and cached thoughts that real people exhibit, followed by making the most that they can out of their powers. There is some exploration of how governments would respond to these situations, and the characters feel very real.

It's definitely not rational/ist/ fiction, I'm sure some people will say that it's not rational fiction, but I think it belongs on this sub as an example of how to do people properly instead of perfectly.
