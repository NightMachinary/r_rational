I'm with you... kind of sounds like he expected to write decent fiction for a year and be pulling in serious money. There's a lot of luck and/or self-promotion involved in the authors who are successful, it's not just a matter of throwing chapters out there for a year and expecting to have it be a big hit. If he just thought the premise/characters weren't going to be a winner it would've been smarter to try to wrap up book two and pivot his readers directly to a new story.

On the other hand, I can understand being demoralized that there's a lot of pretty terrible writing doing better on Royalroad and maybe there's some pandemic-related depression in there too.
