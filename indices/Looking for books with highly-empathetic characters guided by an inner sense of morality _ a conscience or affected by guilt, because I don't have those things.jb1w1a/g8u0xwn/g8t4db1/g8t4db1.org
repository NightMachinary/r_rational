This was a very interesting post, and I enjoyed getting a glimpse into the way you view the world and how it's affected you and your writing. It didn't come across as a "mass shooter manifesto", at least not to me.

To start with, the first thing I'd recommend is that you talk to a therapist if you haven't already. Not because I think you're dangerous, but because they would be able to confirm your diagnosis, provide a lot of helpful information on how neurotypical people experience empathy, and give you some suggestions if you're worried about being targeted due to your condition.

As far as novels that might help you understand how to write empathetic characters, here are a few I was thinking of:

- Basically anything by Stephen King. I personally find his writing to be slow and boring, but he does a very good job at describing a character's inner thoughts and motivations.

- The Stormlight Archives by Brandon Sanderson feature a variety of morally "right" characters that experience ethical dilemmas. The caveat for this one is that the series is unfinished and each book is /incredibly/ long.

- Poison Study by Maria V. Snyder is a YA fantasy novel featuring non-sociopathic characters who nonetheless do a lot of scheming and manipulation. Might be good to check out depending on the target audience for your stories.

- Atonement by Ian Mcewan is a historical fiction novel about a character who does something terrible and has to live with the guilt.

- The Artemis Fowl novels might be useful because they feature a protagonist who is the villain of the story but is still relatable and 'good' enough to be a sympathetic character. The Dexter novels do the same thing. This might help with getting your audience to connect to your more sociopathic characters.

- Joe Abercrombie is a fantasy author who does some really interesting things with his characters. The ones that I tend to like in the beginning of the story become less likeable and more morally 'bad' as the story goes on, and vice versa. I feel like this might be a good example for how to make your audience feel a certain way about your characters, rather than just describing their own inner emotions/moral conflict.
