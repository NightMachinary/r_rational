I have a friend who probably has anti-social who is intelligent and high functioning. I think you're approaching this the right way, which is to use metacognition and to engage your slow brain on these problems in ways that might compensate for your lack of instincts. I think people with personalities similar to yours tend to do well with interpersonal tactics but to lose the war due to failures of strategy. Normies are strong in developing deep relationships and communities over time that sustain them. This comes in the form of practical resources, but also a sense of meaning that improves cognition, energy, and emotional stability. I don't think anti-social or autistic spectrum gives a pass on these basic cognitive needs, which is touch if you're not built for interconnection

Not an expert, but I feel a useful stand-in for you, and possibly for your fiction, would be to focus on principles and virtues. Principles are abstract, as opposed to ad hoc, ethical standards, such as protect the weak or share knowledge. If you pick one or two to focus on, you can use them as a lens to alter behavior, and you may find you're surprised with results, as I do feel that many, and especially the highest functioning individuals, can sense integrity in the form of a consistent application of principles. Even getting one such person on your side can be life changing. Virtues are individual qualities that can be cultivated, such as forbearance, resolution, tranquility, temperance, industry, frugality, or silence. These can also be conveved of abstractly but can lead to more efficacy and pro-social behavior over time. An interesting hack might be to write characters who each have two virtues, a vice, and a principle...I bet normies won't notice that they're not reading normies when you focus on these helpful abstractions.
