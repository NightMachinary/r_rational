I kind of get what you mean. But I hope you don't model your characters' morality based on neurotypicals. That's a hallmark of irrational fiction, IMO. Perhaps take a look through the effective altruism forum? Art can be as much about what is not expressed; A monochrome picture can be more striking than a colored one. Just my thoughts. Good luck!
