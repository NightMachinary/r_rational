/The Summer Tree/ by Guy Gavriel Kay has a rather heartwrenching account of the effects of guilt on one of the characters. I would highly recommend it on its own merits also, a somewhat emotionally intense fantasy novel. The series it is in is called /The Fionavar Tapestry/- I mention this because you might find only the omnibus version in bookstores.

Otherwise, I guess /Ender's Game/ is an account of deep and intrinsic feelings of shame at the necessities Ender is forced/feels he needs to take, though Ender is hardly ordinary.
