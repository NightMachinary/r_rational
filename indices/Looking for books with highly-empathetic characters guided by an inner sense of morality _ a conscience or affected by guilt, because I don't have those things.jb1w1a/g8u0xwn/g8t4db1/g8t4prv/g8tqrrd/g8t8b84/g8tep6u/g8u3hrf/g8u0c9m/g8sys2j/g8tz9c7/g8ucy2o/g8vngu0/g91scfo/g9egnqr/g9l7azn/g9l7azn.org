Not OP but:

1) Litter*ing* implies a pattern of behaviour, and I wouldn't feel guilt about a pattern of behaviour I chose to engage in unless I didn't chose it willingly. Assuming you meant "I happened to litter on their property", my answer would be it depends on the intent of the neighbour and what steps I've undertaken myself. If they are being malicious about the trash dumping, then I would not care, except in the sense that I don't really want to stoop to their level and would rather forcibly prevent their dumping then engage in my own.

However, if they are dumping out of ignorance or due to some other problem of like dementia or mental illness etc, then I would feel bad.

The point of being a higher empathy or more "moral" person sometimes comes down to how reflexively you are able to put yourself in the other person's shoes and thoughts and life experiences that led them to their current point. If you understand or want to understand WHY the neighbor is dumping trash on your yard, then that informs how you react to it.

2) A can of coke costs a store $0.25 cents. One can I wouldn't care. I would not make it a continual/pattern thing though.

3) I'd feel terrible in the moment. The amount of guilt I feel would be moderated mainly by how "at fault" I was in the accident however, if I was speeding or not paying attention then I would feel tremendous guilt after the fact. If the dog ran onto the highway I would not feel any guilt.

The barking thing: See #1 about relating to the situation faced by the dog. I'm not the type of person who would passive aggressively endure 5 years of being kept up at night without any confrontation so I can't relate however.

4) Same as #3. Ending a person's life is much more serious than ending a dog's life however, so scale up guilt appropriately.

5) The risk reward calculus is rarely worth it for stealing so brazenly as that, unless you somehow legally scammed the owner out of their money. Legal risk/reward calculations aside, assuming it was equivilent to "doing something to put the owner out of business", I would feel less guilty the shittier of a human being the person was

6) same as 5.
