I'm guessing it took a lot of courage to come out about this, if I were a psychopath I'd probably be too terrified to talk about it with anyone. I used to be autistic my whole life until very recently, I was the most socially oblivious person I know and now I'm probably the 3rd or 4th most socially sensitive person I know. My whole world's opened up and I'm much happier and more hopeful for the future now. It's been amazing.

Communities and even civilization itself are made of relationships. Relationships are fluid implicit ecosystems of series of mutual exchanges which depend on trust to be sustainable. Your trust in others can be built by exposing your vulnerabilities or weaknesses to others who then choose not to take advantage of your weakness (taking advantage = using your weakness to hurt you for their own gain).

When you trust someone else enough, you can delegate to them far more easily, you can rely on them to cover for your weakness with their strength, you can willingly trust them with part of the steering wheel because you know they won't try to hurt you with it. This will save you a LOT of time and effort in your life.

But they won't want to do that stuff totally for free unless they're your parents. You'll need to prove yourself worthy of other people's trust too. This will make it so you don't need to waste time and effort bullying people into helping you because they'll often /want/ to help you of their own free will.

And other people will always have the right to say no to you, they personally dont have to help you. Which is okay because there are always more people out there you can turn to for help.

If you get good enough at this (and if the necessary communal infrastructure to incentivize it is readily available) you may eventually get to the point where you can get anything you want or need most of the time without ever needing to hurt anyone, so long as you are patient and willing to give other people what they want or need in return.

Also, the fundamental type of skill used for empathy and relating to other people is made of imagination and intuition.

(Psychologists dont understand human nature as well as they think they do.)

Hope that helps! :)

P.S. My main altruistic motives for trying to help you with this post (altruistic = what I want to give) is that I see a bit of myself in you and want to help, I like helping people and I feel like it will make the world a safer place, both because people won't need to fear you anymore and also because then you could help others in turn the same way I'm trying to help you. My main non-altruistic motives (what I want to receive in return) are that it makes me feel more useful and valuable to contribute to the lives of others like this, and that the more people who learn to engage in healthy mutually beneficial relationships the easier it will be to sustain the modular social infrastructure I need to survive long-term and safely make it to the stars.

The values of human beings who aren't antisocial can be kinda meta and fractal like that. Also our values ultimately are made out of processes that are not values in and of themselves.
