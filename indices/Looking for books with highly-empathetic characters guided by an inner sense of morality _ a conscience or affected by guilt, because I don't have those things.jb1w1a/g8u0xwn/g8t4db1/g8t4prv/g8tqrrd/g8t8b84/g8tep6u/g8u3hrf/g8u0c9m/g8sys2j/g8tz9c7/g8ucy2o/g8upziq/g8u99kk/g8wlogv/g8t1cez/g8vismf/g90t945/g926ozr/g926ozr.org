I'm loving the 2 section answers today, apparently. First one is the mental health stuff that I hope is helpful but you might be sick of hearing. Second is a pointer on how to simulate the emotions your characters might feel.

--------------

Have you actually seen a doctor about this? Self-diagnosis is considered incredibly unreliable by anyone who's studied psychology for any significant amount of time and there are a number of disorders that can lead to a feeling that one lacks a conscience. Anything that causes dissociative symptoms for example, can lead to a person thinking that about themselves, as can those disorders which interfere with connecting with others such as ASD or heck, even ADHD. Your conclusions and beliefs about yourself are valid and I dont want to take away from that, but, well, I'd like to point out your interactions with people definitely seem more (asd+social anxiety) or (ocd+social anxiety) than aspd. The first clue is that you seem to consider your behavior as bad behavior, and the second is that you haven't escalated to serious crimes afaict. ^{The clue for social anxiety is that you posted about your concerns online rather than talking to a trusted person face to face.} ðŸ™ƒ

As for giving characters a more nonrobotic feel, maybe try out giving them complex goals or needs and wants, then scale the events they experience based on how those needs and wants are affected, and assign an emotion based on the scale and the character's personality. For example a big setback for a character who is prone to acting without thinking might lead to anger, while a more introspective character might get sad and self-blame. The level of setback Ã— the level of importance to the character might be a scale for how upset they get. If this framework seems reasonable to you, give the more "moral" characters more community focused perceived needs and wants, or a larger perceived community, and the more "amoral" characters a more selfish outlook. And if you get the analysis wrong sometimes, well that's just more realistic.
