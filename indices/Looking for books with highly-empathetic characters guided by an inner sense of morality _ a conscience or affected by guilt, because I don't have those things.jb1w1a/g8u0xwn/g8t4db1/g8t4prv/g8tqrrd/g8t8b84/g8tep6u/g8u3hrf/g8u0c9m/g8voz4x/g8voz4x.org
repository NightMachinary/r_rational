Oh wow, this makes me feel really warm and glowy, thank you. I kind of agree, my future direction for writing is just going to be minimal planning and editing, maximum output. I've more or less come to the same conclusion with the niche/specialisation idea. But the issue with UIAOP is more of a big-picture structural one. Too ambitious, too many moving parts, evolved from something that didn't look anything like it without shedding its vestigial organs. If I wrote a linear continuation, I'd just be constrained by the existing flaws. The reboot (The Universe Could Be More Sensibly Organised) will be pretty different, but it'll be the same two fundamentals concepts (deconstructing and reconstructing HPMOR's setting, and picking up the various plot threads HPMOR didn't explore properly), with the same atmosphere of huge historical differences and looming apocalypse. So I'm fairly confident if you liked UIAOP you won't be too disappointed.
