You're welcome! I'm glad you found it interesting. Now I'm wondering if the difference between psychopaths and sociopaths might have something to do with the fundamental types of motivations. Maybe a sociopath wants to exploit other people, receiving the most benefit for the least effort spent. In other words, /decreasing scope of influence/. And maybe a psychopath wants to control other people, ensuring that they always are in a dominant and therefore safe and well-off position. In other words, /increasing scope of influence/. Meaning that given the choice, a sociopath would be more likely to prefer the path of least resistance while a psychopath would prefer the opposite.

Not to say that you don't ever do hard work or take on any big responsibilities, but I suspect from what you said that when you do take on such things that it is often for the purpose of making it so you have less hard work or responsibility to deal with later. Does that sound right?

Also I suspect that you might find the following fanfiction series /very/ relatable and funny, it's about a version of Harry Potter who gets sorted into Hufflepuff even though he hates hard work, and he goes out of his way doing hard work in order to save himself a lot more time and effort later: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6466185/1/Harry-the-Hufflepuff]]
