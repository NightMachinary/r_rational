If you want some more recommendations coming from a different place than the typical "rationalist" demographic (read: young males who like fantasy/scifi), here's a few things I recommend that come from different places:

- Jane the Virgin (TV show, on netflix) - this is my #1 recommendation. It centers around three generations of Venezuelan-American women living in California, and about family relationships and romance. I consider it "rational" in how it handles interpersonal conflict/etc, and would recommend it to anyone who wants a different point of view. EDIT: I didn't mention its main selling point: it is an absolutely hilarious comedy in the style of a telenovella. The premise is that a woman who is saving herself for marriage is accidentally artificially inseminated.

- Tamora Pierce, specifically The Song Of The Lioness, but also The Protector of The Small (each is a series of 4 YA books). This is a sword and sorcery world with lots of sympathetic characters with realistic motivations/etc though the magic is of course Magic. EDIT: main selling point, since this is fantasy: it's written for girls and is about girls

- Luminosity, a twilight fanfic. It's a bit more Logical than I'd normally recommend, but it's focusing on manipulating people, her own happiness/moral compass, and Doing Good, so it's probably in there

- For something more philosophical, maybe try reading Peter Singer or other "Effective Altruism"-adjacent philosopher? The Life You Can Save or one of his animal liberation books might give you a good/different perspective. EDIT: these are non-fiction in case that wasn't clear

- I'm going to do a self-plug here: I'm writing a rational vampire romance novel that I've been posting to the sub on my other "author" username, it's called Vampire Flower Language and it's /all/ about this sort of thing. There's also a character who appears towards the end who is effectively a sociopath but with an unusual value function. You might find it interesting.
