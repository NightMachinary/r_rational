Part 2 (again, sorry)

#+begin_quote
  being responsible indirectly for a close friend's suicide
#+end_quote

Pretty fucking terrible. Absolutely awful. I would probably experience depression bordering on suicidal thoughts. I imagine the same goes for most people, it would be a scar on their life which influences their whole outlook from that point onward.

#+begin_quote
  How would your experience of guilt be affected if, say, (1) you were littering on the lawn of a neighbour who repeatedly dumps their trash onto your property,
#+end_quote

If it was intentional? Perfectly justified. Zero guilt. Even if I liked the neighbour, in fact (though them dumping their trash in my property would put a serious strain on that). Although I would rather confront them and stop them from dumping refuse on my garden.

#+begin_quote
  (2) you'd worked at that small business and known the owner to be incredibly abusive and condescending and/or was a neo-Nazi
#+end_quote

(Incredibly abusive and condescending reads like "murder and jaywalking").

Zero percent guilty. I'd be a little disappointed in myself for being petty, if the theft was elicited by my dislike, and for being underhanded rather than finding an excuse for punching the bastard in the face.

I wouldn't steal a drink just because I wanted a drink and didn't like the owner, because it wouldn't help in letting them know they are a bastard (oh yes, that's important, there's always a component of retribution in antipathy, it's not just them not mattering in the moral maths).

/But/, I can easily picture other people doing it and feeling light as a feather.

#+begin_quote
  (3) the dog has been keeping you up at night for the last five years and has bitten you
#+end_quote

Not enough to offset the disutility of the death. I'd feel less guilty, but still guilty. Dogs can't be held responsible like humans, therefore the antipathy doesn't have the same hold. For despising someone you must dislike not /what/ they are, but /how/ they are. Tell me if this needs further clarification.

#+begin_quote
  (4) you later find out from a police report that the stranger was a serial domestic abuser who left his wife with a permanent debilitating injury and regularly beat his children
#+end_quote

Guilt gone. In fact, for me personally (but I suspect not most others) this turn of events would be so convenient that I'd be wary of the bias it gallops on. I'd still feel bad about being the kind of person who runs over a stranger and bolts away, though.

#+begin_quote
  (5) same as 2
#+end_quote

This is a bit difficult. I still wouldn't, but it's way easier to imagine stealing from a neo-Nazi, even stealing enough to bankrupt them. if they had no family. I imagine I would feel no guilt. If it sent them under a bridge, then I would, and would try to use the stolen money to at least ensure they lived in reasonable accommodations.

If the owner was "incredibly [emotionally?] abusive"... I would again have trouble imagining stealing so much from them. I have no trouble picturing myself breaking their shop windows every other month, though.

#+begin_quote
  (6) it wasn't a close friend, but instead someone known in the community as a pedophile and an animal-torturer.
#+end_quote

I don't think you understand how difficult of a question this is. I will refrain from answering because this comment is already long as it is, but the keyword here is "suicide". If they can commit suicide for the crimes they're guilty of, we're back to the difference between what they are and how they are, and things get complicated.

The thing worth pointing out is, not liking or even hating a person doesn't just transform them from a moral entity into an instrumental mean. There is utility in bringing comeuppance to hateful people, but they're still taken into account in moral considerations.

So if instead it's just unwittingly causing an accident that kills them, then somewhat guilty for the animal torturer, maybe even enough to live in emotional distress for weeks, and basically no guilt for the paedophile, particularly if they were recidivist and unrepentant.

Now, for QUESTIONS:

- Do you drive like a madwoman?
- What are your tastes in fiction, art, and music, if you want to share? How are they influenced, it at all, by your ASPD, to the best of your ability yo discern?
- This is a bit silly, but is there anything at all, like maybe an ideal, for which you would spontaneously decide to give your life in order to protect/uphold?
- It's interesting to me that you can manage to guilt-trip someone without an explicit understanding of guilt. How does that work from your perspective?
- Are you trying to correct for your narcissistic tendencies, now that you have a better understanding of what your deal is? Are you trying to develop a more unbiased picture of yourself?

That's it.

Last thing I'll write, it's a bummer about your mother, but people /can/ and often do change their mind, in time.
