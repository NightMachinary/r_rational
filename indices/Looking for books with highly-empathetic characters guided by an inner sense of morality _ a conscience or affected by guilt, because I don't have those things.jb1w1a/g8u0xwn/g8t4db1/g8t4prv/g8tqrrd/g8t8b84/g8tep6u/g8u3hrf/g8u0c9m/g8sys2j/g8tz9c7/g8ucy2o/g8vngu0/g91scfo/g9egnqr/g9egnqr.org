  It's so hard learning about antisocials, first because they understandably don't tend to advertise their status, if they're even aware of it, and second because when you meed them in person they are trying to filter the information in a way that makes you be more on their side (which I'm hoping will be less of a concern now, as there's a whole internet in between us, and giving a clear picture would probably be the most valuable strategy).

Sure.

#+begin_quote
  So, can you tell me what, if anything, makes you sad?
#+end_quote

I'm not affected by sadness as much as most people, I think. I don't grieve or mourn. When bad things happen to me, I deal with them, and when bad things happen to other people, I help them but I don't really share their misfortune on an affective level. It's infrequent, usually very short, and not especially intense. These are the only examples I can think of over the past year:

1. Finding out it's difficult for people with ASPD to keep to long-term plans, goals, and maintain fulfilling relationships, seeing it in my past. That made me feel sad, empty, and hopeless. That lasted around five to ten minutes.

2. Finding out my depression was treatment-resistant. I should note that I've never been suicidal or self-hating, it's mostly the lethargic type of depression and I don't seem to have the usual thought-distortions. The idea that I might be constantly moving from one medication to another, watching them wear off slowly, never being able to live a normal and independent life - made me feel pretty much the same way. Lasted about fifteen to twenty minutes.

3. I have pretty severe executive dysfunction from ADHD which my psychologist attempted to treat with ritalin and adderall. Both gave me severe panic attacks. The latter I still have a prescription for so I can accumulate a supply in case I need cash. When I don't achieve what I set out to achieve at the end of the day, same as 1 & 2.

4. I came out as a lesbian to my parents last year. My dad is accepting, my mum not so much. Sometimes when I interact with her, it's a punch to the stomach knowing I'll never have her acceptance. Very intense sadness, mixed with a lot of anger and frustration because every time I think I've made progress with her she seems to backslide. Happened around 4-5 times over the last year, usually lasts 20 minutes or until I try the "articulate how you're feeling, thoughts pass like a train, self-as-context" thing from ACT.

There were a lot of times where sadness would have been normal, but instead I only felt coldly furious.

  And do you enjoy your friends? Meaning, if you pressed the "immanentize my perfect world" button, would they still be interacting with you? Be themselves?
#+end_quote

Definitely. I don't like high-maintenance friendships, though. Constantly texting back and forth throughout the day wears me out. I just prefer to spend an hour, three tops, nothing super deep, just catching up and aimlessly walking and talking, joking around, etc.

Okay, my turn. I have a few questions about guilt and apologies. Some specific, some vague.

- I see in movies there's the cliche of the guilty character avoiding the problem by throwing themselves into work, acting out, behaving erratically - is that true? When I've apparently wronged someone, I just figure out what they want and make it up to them with a gift, wait until they forget, try and reverse the situation by guilt-tripping them, etc. etc. What's the normal thing to do in that situation? Ideally the lowest-cost least-inconvenient thing.

- Do apologies make you feel subservient in any way?

How guilty would you feel in these scenarios, and how do you think you would respond both internally on a psychological level and externally on a behavioural level. Sorry if any of these are triggering, you can skip any or all of them if you don't want to do them.

1. casually littering

2. stealing a can of coke from a small business

3. hitting someone's dog, killing it, with your car and driving away

4. same as above but with a stranger

5. stealing enough money from a small business that it causes the owner to go bankrupt

6. being responsible indirectly for a close friend's suicide

What you said about empathy and antipathy was interesting. How would your experience of guilt be affected if, say, (1) you were littering on the lawn of a neighbour who repeatedly dumps their trash onto your property, (2) you'd worked at that small business and known the owner to be incredibly abusive and condescending and/or was a neo-Nazi (3) the dog has been keeping you up at night for the last five years and has bitten you (4) you later find out from a police report that the stranger was a serial domestic abuser who left his wife with a permanent debilitating injury and regularly beat his children (5) same as 2 (6) it wasn't a close friend, but instead someone known in the community as a pedophile and an animal-torturer.

Thanks!
