  When I think outside of school, in clubs, and in my personal life, there's a lot of stuff I should feel bad about but... don't. And apparently, didn't, given that I never attempted to do whatever you're supposed to do when you feel bad about something. The absence of remorse and guilt is kind of the thing I'm the most certain about. When I think back to them, mainly I remember how funny or thrilling they were, or the great reputation it gave me. Or that other people were over-reacting, felt like their status was threatened, etc.

When you say you "should" feel bad but don't, what led you to believe that you should feel bad? Other people telling you or other people's reactions?

You should try understand their perspective of WHY they think you should feel bad or why they feel bad themselves, i.e. what life experiences and thought process led to that conclusion. If you get that, then you can write about it or make characters who think that way to. If you don't, then why don't you just ask them?

Most people by nature are happy to be helpful to their friends and acquaintances when they are being approach for advice or for their thoughts. If you are having trouble understanding these social things, just phrase the question like "remember when XYZ happened and you were horrified? You know I'm not the most socially intelligent person right, I never actually got why everyone was horrified. Can you explain why you thought that was so bad?".
