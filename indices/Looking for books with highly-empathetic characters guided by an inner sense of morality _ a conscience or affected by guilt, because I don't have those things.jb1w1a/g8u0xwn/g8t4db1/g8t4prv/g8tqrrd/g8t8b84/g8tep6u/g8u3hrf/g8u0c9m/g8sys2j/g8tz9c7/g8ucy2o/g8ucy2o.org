To try and give an explanation for how empathy feels, it's like you're experiencing the pain of someone else, but with a padding of cotton in the middle. Like if you see someone cut their finger, it feels like the memory of a similar pain for you (whether you want it or not), but not like actual, physical pain, and certainly not as localised.

Emotional empathy is a bit more direct, instead of seeing someone feel an emotion and feeling like a memory of that emotion, it's more like the feeling you get from a memory of something that gave you that emotion. Let me explain it better: You see Bob being sad, you don't feel like you're remembering the sadness of something that made you sad, but like the sadness you feel in remembering that event.

There's an important caveat that empathy (especially the emotional kind) is directly proportional to how much you like that person.

Like, if it's someone you really like (say, a spouse that you're still very much in love with (love feels like you might feel for a project that you put years and sweat and blood in, only it can grow to be more important that your own self)), them you might feel an intensity of emotion as high as 95% of theirs, while for a stranger on the street it might be 5 to 25% (depending on how empathetic you are as a baseline).

Four someone you really hate, empathy might be reversed (antipathy), but there's a strange ratio between dislike and intensity of bad emotion. If a person you just kinda don't like too much is experiencing a low negativity of feeling, you might feel glad (and not admit it to yourself or others, but that's how the monkey-brain is wired), but if they're experiencing a highly negative feeling, you will feel somewhat bad for them. But if it's someone you truly, gutwretchingly hate, the more pain for them the better (up to a certain limit, because sustained hate requires brain chemicals that aren't in endless supply).

I'm sure I could write it down as an equation, but I don't feel like it right now.

Anyway, in my view of morality, entities worthy of moral consideration are modelled as having an array of values that correspond to various features of reality that they want to minmax, each with its own weight associated to it. Examples are avoiding pain, increasing pleasure, experiencing stories, leaving a lasting mark in the world, expressing you identity, fairness, discovery, truth, etc. Some are not very important, some are extremely important, some are convergent (useful because they help in increasing all other values, like money, time or intelligence). Also, some entities have just a few of them, like insects, some a lot, like intelligent humans.

I say this because I think morality is basically the process of decision-making that results in the greatest increase/smallest decrease in the fulfilment of said values for the greatest number of entities. Which means that sometimes, reality being the disappointingly imperfect medium that it is, you'll have to reduce the value for some in order to increase it more for more entities, like we do when we put criminals in jail (and you, filthy scum). Oh, and one of the rules is that you can't deliberately lower the values for someone in order to increase them for someone else, including and particularly yourself, you can only lower someone else's values to avoid them being lowered even more.

But why am I explaining -what I think to be a good description of- morality to you when you asked about empathy? A couple of reasons.

One, people will like moral people more, and perceive the it's alright to fuck immoral people over even if they belong to the same team.

Two, because decreasing someone's values is -what I believe to be- the definition of /harm/. I say this in relation to manipulation, because I think manipulating someone amounts to lowering their value of truth (which is also a convergent value), and it can be moral if in doing so you're increasing some other value for them or achieving a net neutral. Like if you deceive someone on an event that took place but you do so to tell a funny story.

Regarding ASPD if fiction, I think the best representation of a (criminal) psychopath is Quirrell in HPMoR, and the best (criminal) sociopath is Homelander from The Boys. I fear non-criminal examples are hard to come by, because they're not that useful as characters in stories. EDIT: actually, the best that can easily come to mind are probably from your stories.

The best neurotypical character that I can suggest is probably Juniper from Worth the Candle, for how he sufferers when he's hurt someone, and for how those feelings are explicitly analysed. Although he's less empathetic than average, the explicit analysis would probably be most helpful to you.
