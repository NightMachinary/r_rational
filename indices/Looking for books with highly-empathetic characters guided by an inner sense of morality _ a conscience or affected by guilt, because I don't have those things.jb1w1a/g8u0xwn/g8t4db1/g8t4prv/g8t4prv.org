I'd suggest considering a different take on this. A common Writing Advice you see everywhere is 'write what you know'. you actually got lucky in that regard: while missing out on something most people take for granted, you are experiencing a very rare human condition.

Writing about your own experience - all the ways you describe being ASPD in society are fascinating - might actually make for good plots (maybe mostly from that one POV). Your post was a great read. Why not try writing about the experience of being surrounded with cooperators & feeling the defector? Feeling like an Alien in Human Skin, or The One Sane Person? Many rationality fics play on these tropes.

If you insist on writing neurotypical characters, rather then trying to 'Adopt' their thought process, I'd suggest asking neurotypical Beta readers and friends for their opinion and suggestions in a 'what would you have felt/done if...?' Kind of way. Otherwise, your might just be Mirror Imaging, and still come off as not convincing.

Ps, You mentioned you write Worm fanfics - did you read Ward?
