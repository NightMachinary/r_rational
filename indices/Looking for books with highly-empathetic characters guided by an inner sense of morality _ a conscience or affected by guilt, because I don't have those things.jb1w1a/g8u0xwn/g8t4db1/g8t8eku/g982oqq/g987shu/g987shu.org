I sincerely doubt it's the same case for APSD. Technically speaking, no one should ever be reported simply for having a diagnosis. The reason that pedophiles get reported (in theory) is because they've actually committed - or have said that their going to commit - child abuse.

But what exactly would you report a person with ASPD for? Being mean? I do think you make a good point that therapists are human, and you shouldn't just settle on the first one that you find, but that doesn't mean that OP shouldn't try.

(Also, [[https://www.vocativ.com/315929/pedophiles-seeking-help-put-therapists-in-ethical-catch-22/index.html][here's]] an interesting article I found online where a bunch of therapists complain about having to report their patient's for CP because it hinders their therapy - so I don't think the pedophile-reporting issue is as big a deal as we might assume).
