Alright, lots of stuff there, all very interesting. WARNING: wall of text ahead.

  I have a few questions about guilt and apologies. Some specific, some vague.
#+end_quote

Ok so as a premise I should probably try to give you some insight into guilt.

Guilt happens when you did something that hurt someone who you empathise with. This is a completely automatic brain process, so it can sometimes go tits up.

Example, people may feel guilty for having killed someone who was trying to kill someone else. You'd think the justification of having done what had to be done, and the fact that the dead party was literally a murderer, would assuage any sense of moral responsibility, but the brain doesn't agree. One possible reason for why that is is that the defender has failed in defusing the situation non-mortally, but I personally think it's a matter of evolution not putting enough work into the edge-cases.

Anyway, guilt /feels/ physically like your lungs have gotten heavier and your muscles tense up -hence why shedding guilt is described as "a weight off your shoulders"-, and emotionally like a frequent mental replay of the harm you caused, with the relative empathetic feedback. Obviously, guilt is more intense the more harm you caused.

People may address guilt by making amends with those they hurt, or by punishing themselves. You may think the second one is madness, and from a certain point of view you'd be right. But keep in mind that guilt is a function of /your/ fault, of the self-perceived failure to keep up with your own standards. By self-punishing, people "right the wrong" that they committed. It's basically self-administered justice.

At the same time, people often tend to rationalise guilt by talking themselves into thinking that their fault was less than it actually was, or that whoever was inconvenienced or harmed somehow deserved it.

On to your questions.

  I see in movies there's the cliche of the guilty character avoiding the problem by throwing themselves into work, acting out, behaving erratically - is that true?
#+end_quote

Yes. I doubt sociopaths are immune to procrastination, so I'm assuming you know the feeling. Well, this is a form of procrastination, which is the instinct to avoid the unpleasant feeling associated with a task by doing something else and diverting your attention. Guilt can be a rather strong negative emotion, so is it at all surprising that people would avoid confronting the associated task?

#+begin_quote
  try and reverse the situation by guilt-tripping them
#+end_quote

I know that people seldom appreciate unsolicited advice (and please tell me if it annoys you, I'll avoid it), but may I suggest that this is a poor policy? If you do this often, a friend/partner will associate you with the negative feeling, and over time that will anchor the idea of you with discomfort, especially if they perceive, either consciously or subconsciously, that it was unwarranted.

Seeing as I'm already intruding in your business:

#+begin_quote
  I just figure out what they want and make it up to them with a gift
#+end_quote

I'm not exactly surprised this works, but I have my doubts that it works as well as you may want. The optimal thing to do when you wrong someone is to explain that you understand what you did wrong (if you agree that you were wrong from a moral/interpersonal perspective), that you agree not to repeat the mistake in future, and then if you want to go the extra mile you offer a gift as a tangible token of your apology.

A gift alone may sedate their anger, but also make them feel like you're trying to buy your way out of their distress, which in turn implies that it is an invalid feeling. I don't know if you've ever experienced this other outcome. </advice>

  Do apologies make you feel subservient in any way?
#+end_quote

Depends. In this context we can say that there are two kinds of apologies, call them sincere and insincere. An insincere apology is when you just say the words and go through the motions to smooth things over, but you feel that your actions and choices were justified. You'll notice people sometimes offer apologies for the way they worded things instead of the content of what they said. An apology like that would not make me feel subservient, and I doubt it does for most people.

Sincere apologies are when you know that you did something wrong, according to your own parameters (and of course in the context of morality/reciprocity/competent action). When I had to offer this kind of apology in the past, I did feel uncomfortably subservient (obvious, as it basically amounts to admitting you've been inferior to how you yourself recognise you should have been), but it's also kind of unavoidable. You make mistakes -> you lose some status.

#+begin_quote
  Sorry if any of these are triggering, you can skip any or all of them if you don't want to do them.
#+end_quote

Far from even making a scratch on my psyche. I was raised by the internet.

#+begin_quote
  casually littering
#+end_quote

Internally, I would feel guilty, because I'm contributing to a shared disutility to something which I care about. I would also feel like I'm being lesser than my ideal self. As an external behaviour, I'd ignore it if the trouble to fix it was worse than the guilt I'd get out of it + my own desire to be my best self, and fix it if not, e.g. by recovering my litter or delittering a commensurate amount.

  stealing a can of coke from a small business
#+end_quote

It's difficult to imagine that I would, but to be honest, not much guilt at all, because the harm to them is fairly minor. Some other people may feel bad for having stolen at all, but I personally don't feel too strongly about petty theft.

#+begin_quote
  hitting someone's dog, killing it, with your car and driving away
#+end_quote

I rather doubt that I'd drive away, unless I was under some heavy drugs or the owner came out with a rifle to avenge the dog. In the first case, I would feel /very/ guilty, because the connection with a dog is a very intense emotional bond, and also because I like dogs and think the world is better with each pet dog in it, and running over a dog has no upsides to balance that loss. In the second case, I'd feel bad for the decrease in dogginess, but fuck the owner, he's a lunatic and I don't care.

As for behaviour, I'd offer sincere, deep apologies in the first case, combined with some measure of penance.

#+begin_quote
  same as above but with a stranger
#+end_quote

Much more guilty. Dogs are amazing, but a person is a person. I'd feel like I deleted something irreplaceable, not to mention all the suffering it would cause to their relations. Again, I know it must appear crazy to you (and to be honest, to a lot of other people too), but I'd consider going to jail fair and just retribution. Then again, I don't live in the States...

  stealing enough money from a small business that it causes the owner to go bankrupt
#+end_quote

I had trouble picturing a scenario in which I would do that which didn't involve some dire need. I eventually came to imagine that I stole a lot from someone I thought was super rich, only to find out I had false information, and they actually went bankrupt. But then, I would consider it more an accident than a lapse of my goodness. And yes, I would have caused them harm, but not by falling short of my morals.

I would feel bad for their misfortune through empathy, and consider myself responsible of their condition and deem a reparation in order, but I wouldn't feel /guilt/. I think. I don't know, I've never been in that kind of situation.

I actually have to split this in two because it's too long, sorry.
