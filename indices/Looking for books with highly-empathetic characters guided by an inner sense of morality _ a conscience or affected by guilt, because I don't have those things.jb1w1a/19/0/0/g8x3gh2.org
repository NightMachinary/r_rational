You're welcome, and I'm glad it helped! I've set up an e-mail reminder so I'll be notified if you DM me for more practice and shortcuts.

You did a really good job working your way through the sensations of the thought experiment. If you can, imagine staying in each stage of sensation you felt ten times longer. The hopelessness, the hot burbling, the loss and unfillable void. Some people are capable of feeling all of those at once for days at a time. This is what informs how others make their decisions at times.

Love is the most irrational and emotional of human interactions, so I think it's an excellent lens through which to help focus your practice.
