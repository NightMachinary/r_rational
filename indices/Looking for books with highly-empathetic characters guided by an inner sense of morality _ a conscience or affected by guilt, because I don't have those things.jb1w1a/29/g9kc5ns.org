So, you're saying that if you performed an action or actions which led to the serious injury or death of another person, you would NOT experience strong physical reactions of panic and sickness; a temporary mental sensation of a sort of shattering of your built up conceptions, goals, self worth, and decision making machinery; and suicidal impulses?

That's... disturbing.

As far as your request for books, I would have to recommend the sequels to Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card. One could justifiably say that all those books are is characters thinking and arguing about morality, and while generally I find that kind of thing rather annoying and boring, Card actually pulls it off. I noticed him using a technique where the climax of the book is not the violent dangerous actions which upend the status quo, but sections where the point of view characters attempt to prevent action by or encourage the individual with the authority or power to take such actions via moral arguments.

I'd be curious how you would feel about the character Sameen Shaw in the TV show Person of Interest, which is the only strongly positive portrayal of someone with ASPD I've encountered. Your description of muted but still partially present empathy reminded me of her character.
