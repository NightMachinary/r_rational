First of all, thank you! I'll try and bullet-point my responses to avoid going off-track.

  Have you actually seen a doctor about this? Self-diagnosis is considered incredibly unreliable by anyone who's studied psychology for any significant amount of time and there are a number of disorders that can lead to a feeling that one lacks a conscience. Anything that causes dissociative symptoms for example, can lead to a person thinking that about themselves, as can those disorders which interfere with connecting with others such as ASD or heck, even ADHD. Your conclusions and beliefs about yourself are valid and I dont want to take away from that, but, well, I'd like to point out your interactions with people definitely seem more (asd+social anxiety) or (ocd+social anxiety) than aspd. The first clue is that you seem to consider your behavior as bad behavior, and the second is that you haven't escalated to serious crimes afaict. The clue for social anxiety is that you posted about your concerns online rather than talking to a trusted person face to face. ðŸ™ƒ

- A lot of this occurred to me too, so it's good to have a second opinion from someone who (I'm guessing) has studied psychology seriously. Yeah, there's a lot of potential symptomatic overlap with ASD in terms of affective and empathetic deficits, ADHD with impulsivity and lack of concern for safety, and obviously BPD too with unstable relationships and dissociation. I've been diagnosed with the first two, BPD doesn't seem to fit.

- I'm not really sure whether I care much about a formal diagnosis. So far I've found that researching ASPD has clarified some parts of my behaviour I was very confused about before, made a lot about my past snap into focus, and has had a great deal of predictive power in modelling how I'll respond to new situations (where my weaknesses lie, etc.). If there's a symptomatic overlap, it's apparently enough to be a useful label. That's basically it.

- I have a deep distrust for how I narrate my internal experience and in thinking about ASPD I mainly look towards behaviour not how I subjectively perceive things. I think I have a pretty good insight into my subsecond-level thought processes but again, I don't like to rely on it since it's easy to impose a top-down interpretation. I'm not sure what would count as a serious crime, but I have a very long history of delinquency and conduct disorder going back to around age 6-7. Some examples of that include "hacking" (guessing the password) the head girl's school account to embarrass her on her personal page, publicly vandalising and encouraging other people to vandalise the entire campus, sending in a request to change another student's name to a typo, and breaking into several glass displays to replace school posters with edited versions. There are ten to fifteen other examples that were similarly severe occurring every single year from primary to the end of high school, and sixty to a hundred more instances where I wasn't caught (e.g stealing nearly half the school's calculators, wiping the contents of a teacher's computer, a shit ton of cyberbullying, cheating on tests and exams whenever I could, plagiarising by using non-English sources and google-translating them for most of the essays I wrote, rigging student council votes, regularly stealing cash during business competitions and when I worked the tuck shop register etc.). Plus the usual stuff like wagging class to go play poker or get fish and chips. I'm avoiding mentioning the stuff that I'm guessing would just sound vile and cruel to you. I'm frankly baffled that I managed to avoid being expelled or getting the police involved, and I attribute that to my middle-class parents reaching for ASD as an easy explanation, along with my impeccable politeness, charming over teachers, and superb grades. There's a mismatch. It was enough that even I overlooked it until this year.

- When I think outside of school, in clubs, and in my personal life, there's a lot of stuff I should feel bad about but... don't. And apparently, didn't, given that I never attempted to do whatever you're supposed to do when you feel bad about something. The absence of remorse and guilt is kind of the thing I'm the most certain about. When I think back to them, mainly I remember how funny or thrilling they were, or the great reputation it gave me. Or that other people were over-reacting, felt like their status was threatened, etc. If I had a chance to go back, I'd probably do all of them again but maybe more cleverly, managing the aftermath better. ASPD for me kind of clarifies why I repeatedly got into trouble and never seemed to "learn" or really care whether what I was doing was "right". The only thing I ever seem to regret is not manipulating the situation well enough.

- You're warm with social anxiety. It's now more social avoidance than anxiety in the sense that I try to avoid social situations but feel fine when I'm in the middle of them. I think if someone were to look at me between year 10 (13-14) and now, the thought that I might have social anxiety wouldn't occur to them. I kind of realised there was this persona I could tap into which regularly blew everyone else out of the water in drama, inter-school debates, and speech competitions. I lead several clubs (mostly into ruin). Class clown, I guess. I surrounded myself with friends, although come to think of it, I never allowed myself to be below anyone else and I was mostly surrounded by lackeys who did whatever I convinced them to. I just love the theatre involved in playing out different roles, tricking and messing with people. Now, I mainly keep to five-ish close friends and I have a pretty equal standing with them, I think. I'm not gregarious, but I have zero issue with strangers and I can handle myself well.

- The main reason why I'm posting here is because I frankly do not trust anyone not to fuck me over eventually and the cons usually outweigh the pros since mentioning ASPD or sociopathy will tint my relationships with people. There's one friend I'm going to tell, once I've figured out the best strategy and what parts of ASPD I want to present & in what ways. My reading is he can't and won't leverage it against me, I'm not planning to pump money or anything else from him, and it'll be less mentally-taxing to just let down the facade. Here, on the other hand? Very few downsides, 30-40 people just giving me free, useful, non-judgemental advice.

- Regarding what I've noticed about my thoughts, I think it would be difficult to chalk the conscience aspect to dissociation. If I have a conscience, I don't really notice it. I catch myself thinking of lies when talking to people, the "this is factually untrue" thing only seems to come after the initial idea, and I don't really distinguish between "good" or "bad" actions beyond calculating how it might appear to someone else and how I might spin it. On a conscious level I had this edgy attitude that morality was just kind of stupid and not something I should bother emulating. Dunno. The only objective good or bad is to what extent I benefit. No idea how else I should see it.

- Some practical reasons why I don't want to get a diagnosis at the moment. (1) ASPD diagnoses have been used as justification to extend prison-terms, as aggravating factors in crimes, and to deny parole/early release. I'm mindful my streak of luck might run out and I'll find myself interacting with the criminal justice system. In that case, it would be a very bad idea since apparently psychologists, counsellors, and psychotherapists are compelled to testify in those scenarios. (2) Costs money. (3) Not sure what value I'd get from it. A 'yes' or a 'no', wouldn't change much.

  As for giving characters a more nonrobotic feel, maybe try out giving them complex goals or needs and wants, then scale the events they experience based on how those needs and wants are affected, and assign an emotion based on the scale and the character's personality. For example a big setback for a character who is prone to acting without thinking might lead to anger, while a more introspective character might get sad and self-blame. The level of setback Ã— the level of importance to the character might be a scale for how upset they get. If this framework seems reasonable to you, give the more "moral" characters more community focused perceived needs and wants, or a larger perceived community, and the more "amoral" characters a more selfish outlook. And if you get the analysis wrong sometimes, well that's just more realistic.

Okay, this seems doable. What you mentioned with different emotional responses to setbacks is actually something I never considered before explicitly. I can see that developing a wide range of characters without falling back on my own thought-habits is going to be tricky. I didn't think of the community/self continuum either, seems clear now but I think I'll make this one part of the standard template.
