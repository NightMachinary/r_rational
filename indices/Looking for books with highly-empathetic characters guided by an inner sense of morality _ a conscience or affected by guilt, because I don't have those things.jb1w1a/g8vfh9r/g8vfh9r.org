What happens when you lean into that sense of intuitive empathy, or try to keep it on all the time?

Also curious how you feel in relation to familial love, best friendship, and romantic love. What would you feel in this scenario?

- Stranded together on a deserted island with your entire family, best friend, and your lover of the past 3+ years who have all suffered from a spontaneous lobotomising disease to which you are immune, over the course of seven days you witness their rapid deterioration into mindless husks despite your best efforts to cure them. If you spend multiple minutes diving as emotionally deep into this hypothetical as possible -- imagining your futile struggle to cure them, feelings as you watch them slowly lose their sense of self before your eyes, all with the (let's say not totally vain) hope that maybe you can fix this -- what sensations does your body feel, if any?

There's the theory that ASPD may come from a long lack of practice rather than a complete inability to engage with emotions on a deep level. It may be worthwhile to try to embrace and sink into whatever emotional senses you have, and observe whether they grow stronger over a consistent yearlong period. You may also be able to take a few shortcuts, which I won't discuss here. Feel free to PM me if you're curious.
