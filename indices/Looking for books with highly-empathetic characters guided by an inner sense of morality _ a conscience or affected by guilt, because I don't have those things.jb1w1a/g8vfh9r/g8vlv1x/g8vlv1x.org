Well, I turn it on pretty much only when I'm reading or watching television. Usually when something good is about to happen to one of the characters, or whenever I feel like I need a good emotional kick to loosen up my brain. I'm still new to articulating a lot of this. So for one thing? Not really sure how to do it manually. For another, it just doesn't ever register as off. It's the default, I don't notice it - so it never occurs to me that I should turn it on in the first place. Dunno, kind of like being instructed to wiggle your ears all the time.

But I think I'll give it a try the next time I'm talking to someone, that seems like a sensible suggestion.

Desert island scenario. Oh damn, that would suck. Kinda outside of my reference frame in terms of traumatic experiences. Closest thing I've had was an uncle I don't really know that well dying. The only thing I remember from that was making a resolution to destroy death. Didn't really grieve at all, just thought it was a senseless and stupid way to die.

So really? I guess it would be a good opportunity to get to know as much about their lives as possible. I imagine I would throw myself into the task of systematically identifying a cure, not really much point being dragged down with other stuff. It would definitely be super uncomfortable and creepy, and I would be left with a feeling of loss. An unfillable void in the universe, possibilities that never came to fruition. I would feel hopeless throughout the process? I'm not sure. Oh, anxiety. Hot burbling feeling in my tummy/chest. I'm definitely getting that now, that would be stressful as hell. I'm noticing I'm not experiencing as strong of an emotional reaction as I expected. My mind is kind of drifting to where I'd go after that and how to rebuild my support network. I love them and appreciate them, I feel much more empathetic towards them than I do by default, but I'm guessing something is off here. I get the feeling I'm filling in some kind of affectual gap and I don't entirely trust how I map body sensations to emotional labels, especially in this scenario.

If it's an issue of practice - perfect. Familiar territory. But I'm curious about those shortcuts, too. Anyway, this was a really nice thought-experiment, really clarified a lot of my thoughts. Thank you.
