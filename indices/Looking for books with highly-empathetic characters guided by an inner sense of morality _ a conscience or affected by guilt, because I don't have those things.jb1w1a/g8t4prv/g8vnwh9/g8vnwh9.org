Even though I agree with you mostly, I think it's inevitable that a writer needs to portray characters with decisions modeled after conventional social ethics. So even if OP specializes in their particular niche, there is need for research to be able to bring forth a wider cast.

That being said, I can suggest to look into the romanticist period, especially the French romanticism deals a lot in honour and morality (Dumas, Balzac, ZÃ©vaco, etc).
