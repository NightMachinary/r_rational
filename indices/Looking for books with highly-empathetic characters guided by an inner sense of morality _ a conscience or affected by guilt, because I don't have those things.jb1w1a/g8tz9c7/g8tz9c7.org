I have an aspie-friendly framework for understanding empathy, if that's something you'd find interesting.

Cells enforce cooperation via the use of connexins, as explained in [[https://aeon.co/essays/how-to-understand-cells-tissues-and-organisms-as-agents-with-agendas][a recent essay]] by Daniel Dennett and Michael Levin:

  When two cells connect their innards, this ensures that nutrients, information signals, poisons, etc are rapidly and equally shared. Crucially, this merging implements a kind of immediate ‘karma': whatever happens to one side of the compound agent, good or bad, rapidly affects the other side. Under these conditions, one side can't fool the other or ignore its messages, and it's absolutely maladaptive for one side to do anything bad to the other because they now share the slings and fortunes of life. Perfect cooperation is ensured by the impossibility of cheating and erasure of boundaries between the agents. The key here is that cooperation doesn't require any decrease of selfishness. The agents are just as 100 per cent selfish as before; agents always look out for Number One, but the boundaries of Number One, the self that they defend at all costs, have radically expanded -- perhaps to an entire tissue or organ scale.

Oxytocin seems to "fuse" individuals together in an analogous fashion, like some sort of moral connexin. You can think of it as the same kind of interindividual homeostasis as with cells merged via connexins: you become a part of a greater whole. Which means that alleviating the suffering of others feels just like alleviating your /own/ suffering.

This process builds resilience; by investing effort in meeting the needs of others you are creating a buffer that will protect you in the future. It's simply a robust strategy.

The emotional aspect of all this is best understood (in my humblest of opinions) via the theoretical construct of [[https://www.routledge.com/Kama-Muta-Discovering-the-Connecting-Emotion/Fiske/p/book/9780367220945][kama muta]]. The kama muta lab [[http://kamamutalab.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/kama_muta_in_culture_website.pdf][has defined it thusly]]:

  The thesis of this article is that the sudden intensification of [Communal Sharing Relationships (CSRs)] triggers an adaptive psychological disposition to devote and commit to them. A CSR is one of social equivalence, when people feel in some respect one with others, whether in love, solidarity, fusion, union, patriotism, or identity. People experience this abrupt communal sharing (CS) intensification as an emotion that we call kama muta (Sanskrit, ‘moved by love'). We posit that the psychological disposition to kama muta is responsible for the prevalence, stability, and cultural salience of many culturally evolved practices, institutions, roles, narratives, and artifacts that evoke kama muta.

They have also published a paper on how the evocation of kama muta seems to be [[http://kamamutalab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bestlovedstory.pdf][one of the key elements of good storytelling]], which you may find interesting.

[[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/09/14/how-my-mother-and-i-became-chinese-propaganda][This is an essay rather than a story, but it truly evokes kama muta in me]] (I cried at the end of it). You might benefit from reading it. [[https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/1-the_gift_of_the_magi_0.pdf][The Gift of the Magi]] is also a good example. And if you're looking for a longer, but more enlightening, read, look no further than The Brothers Karamazov. Freud and Einstein both said it was the greatest novel ever written, and I agree. Without spoiling anything, the book explores reason, passion, and love as personified by three brothers. It's well worth the investment of your effort.
