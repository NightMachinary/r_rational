How safe is therapy though? ASPD is pretty stigmatised and therapists are also only human. I know that in the US some like to push the "threat to others" excuse to its limits. And then there's laws like the one where they have to directly report anyone who is suffering from pedophilia. I don't know if other anti-social diagnoses are treated similarly.
