  Though, I think there are a lot of strongly culturally-relative aspects to it.

It's more than that, I think. Every single person has different values, so in that sense morality is subjective. But in the sense that perfect morality consists in balancing weighted values for different individuals, it can be said to be objective.

Only, perfect morality is of course practically unachievable, seeing as you can't have a perfect picture of every person's values and weights (and people themselves aren't aware of their own), not to mention that moral decisions are at times time-constrained and you can't be expected to perform the necessary calculation in decision-time.

But, if you assume that a stranger will tend to have their culture's baseline values and weights, which I think is the most reasonable assumption to make, then that would be the best practical morality that is achievable with available means.

  If only other people were as consistent as you are with utilitarian value-fulfilment.

"Never take a compliment from a sociopath," grandma used to say, "that's just /Antisocials 101/". I like to think I have a consistent framework, but who knows.

  Guess that'll be my niche. Positive sociopathy representation.

Don't know about sociopathy, but a relevant number of top notch surgeons and lawyers are psychopaths, and not having them shunned from society is a good thing. A whole lot of politicians are too, though, which is unfortunate.

Anyway, being all pals is nice and good, but you're antisocial, so you work on /quid pro quo/, which means I'd like to trade my (alleged) helpfulness for some understanding.

It's so hard learning about antisocials, first because they understandably don't tend to advertise their status, if they're even aware of it, and second because when you meed them in person they are trying to filter the information in a way that makes you be more on their side (which I'm hoping will be less of a concern now, as there's a whole internet in between us, and giving a clear picture would probably be the most valuable strategy).

So, can you tell me what, if anything, makes you sad? And do you enjoy your friends? Meaning, if you pressed the "immanentize my perfect world" button, would they still be interacting with you? Be themselves?
