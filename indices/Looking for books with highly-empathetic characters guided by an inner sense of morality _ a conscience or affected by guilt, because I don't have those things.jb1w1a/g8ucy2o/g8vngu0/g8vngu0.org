Ah, gotcha. Nicely illustrated. I love how you went to the effort of building it up from scratch, avoiding assuming any experiential universals (the spouse -> heavily-invested project thing, for instance). Okay, so I think I definitely have this, in the equation you outlined. But from what I understand, it's just usually off or dulled except when I want to feel the same emotion someone else is - so that's one area of divergence. I definitely turn it on when I know I'm going to get a positive hit.

Your framework for morality, values, and where manipulation fits in that schema more or less resembles mine. Though, I think there are a lot of strongly culturally-relative aspects to it. If only other people were as consistent as you are with utilitarian value-fulfilment. I guess the difference is, my relationship to morality is more or less the same as my relationship to my model of how the Dewey Decimal system works. I consult it in specific contexts but otherwise it doesn't really intrude too much on my thinking.

Hmm, I kinda figured there wouldn't be all that many non-criminal psychopathy/borderline sociopaths in media but I'll keep in mind those suggestions in case they reveal any insights. Been meaning to read WtC and watch The Boys for a while now, actually. Guess that'll be my niche. Positive sociopathy representation. Hard enough it might be interesting. Anyway, thank you for this detailed write-up.
