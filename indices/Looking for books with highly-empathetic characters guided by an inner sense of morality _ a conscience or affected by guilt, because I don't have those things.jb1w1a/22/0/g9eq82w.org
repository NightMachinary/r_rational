  I did not read the post completely, but I think amoral fiction can be enjoyable for some of us. (Most morally motivated characters are just virtue signallers anyway. Effective moral characters who aren't also super OP are rare.) Since you have a competitive advantage there, why bother changing your style?

Oh, I don't want to change my style. I'm focused on my own growth and development as a writer. Learning that all my characters are just carbon copies of me with the details filed off? Ouch. Morality is apparently a really fundamental and adds a lot of colour and complexity to characterisation. It's kind of like a painter learning she's colour-blind. If I can really get how neurotypicals tick, an experiential spectrum opens up. I care a lot about being faithful to canon. If something is off, that sucks. I get what you mean. It'd be easier to keep writing the way I do now. I just want to do that and more.
