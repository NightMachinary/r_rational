You will have contact only with people that are just like you, and in some cases are like that, only more. There will be someone more cluster B than you, and against them you will lose. There is no cure for your condition, and you will never get over it. Life is hard, unfair, and short. Accept that, no matter how fearsome that may be. Read Wikipedia articles on propaganda techniques. The thing stultifying people is their anger, other than that, people are intelligent enough that you need to beware that everyone else may have read those articles as well. Courts act on things that they are persuaded are facts. This is how journals are persuasive. Keep a secret journal. Don't let anybody know about the journal until it's locked up in your lawyer's office. Become a corporate psychopath. Instead of acting only to make sure someone else loses, act only to win. Live a badass life.
