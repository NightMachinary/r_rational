Ender's Shadow (and its sequels) are books that probably get the [[/r/rational]] stamp of approval (it seems like everyone loves Ender's Game as a story where the main character beats everyone by being clever) and also might provide what you're looking for.

Ender's Shadow is interesting in particular because it has a portion of the story that is written from the POV of the antagonist, and it's interesting to see the contrast in his internal narration (and how he thinks of his own motivations) as contrasted with that of our main character (who has more of a moral compass). There are also other "good" characters who have different moral frameworks that are contrasted against the main character. (For example, the main character is an atheist, and the people he works with come from a wide variety of religious backgrounds.)

You might also relate to the way that the main character sometimes feels the need to engage in performative displays of emotion. (e.g. "I guess this is the part where I'm supposed to hug her. I don't really feel any inclination toward hugging, but I know that she'll be hurt if I leave without some gesture of affection, and I don't want her feelings to be hurt, so here we go, time to hug.") I realize that you're specifically looking for stories about characters that you might /not/ relate to in this way, but the fact that the main character behaves this way sort of highlights the "naturally empathetic" traits in all of the other characters by contrast. It also gives him an interesting character arc as he matures emotionally throughout the series.

The later books in the series also features several chapters from the POV of someone who is much more "ruthless" in the pursuit of his goals than the main character, and this is immediately evident in the way that his internal thoughts are narrated. It's an especially interesting contrast, because there are many senses in which the more "compassionate" character is the one who is more reflective and logical, while the more "selfish" character is more driven by his emotions and fears.

Orson Scott Card also tends to write characters that are self-reflective, and will sometimes go as far as self-diagnosing their own behavior. "Why am I acting this way? Oh, it's probably because I grew up feeling inadequate, and I got mired in my own feelings of inadequacy for years and years, and failed to notice the fact that the people around me actually appreciate me. I guess I should update my behavior based on the observation I've just made that people are actually willing to respect me now." His characters will also often internally narrate the unspoken parts of the conversation, and they will have actual moments of thinking to themselves, "This is how I actually feel right now...but I can't say that out loud right now, because it's socially unacceptable." Or "The person who is leading us right now is dangerous...and I need to figure out how to communicate that to the people around me without seeming insubordinate or defiant."
