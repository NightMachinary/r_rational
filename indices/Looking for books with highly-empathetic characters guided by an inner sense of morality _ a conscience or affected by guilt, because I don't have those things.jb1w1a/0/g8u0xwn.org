Do different forms of disutility really feel that different? I take it it you feel bad about the thought of losing of money or status. The thought of doing evil feels approximately the same, I'd say. It's just another term in the native utility function.

What may be tricky for you to grok is that it is not a boundary condition, or a constraint. It is genuinely part of the utility function. The character would feel that a world where they haven't lied is better than one where they have, just like you might prefer a world where you have a submarine to one where you don't.

Makes me wonder about characters that have terms in their utility functions that no human has. Aliens in fiction at best have a very different weighing of terms, or miss some. Or have different ethics, but that is a conscious level utility function. I suppose a paperclip optimizer counts.
