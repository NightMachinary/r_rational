Huh. That's such an interesting way of reframing it. I'll try and rephrase it so I can be sure I understood it - morality as not an external feature of the environment that needs to be factored in, or a step at the end of the decision-making process, but something deeply encoded into the character's preferences about the world? Okay, I'm now thinking writing moral characters isn't such an intractable problem after all. I figure out a strong ethical code for them, but I skip the actual thought-process in text, so it looks like it's implicit in their thoughts and actions. Alien encounter / cultural shock narratives like Three Worlds Collide always appealed to me because the issue was always one side assuming a universal and then omitting mentioning it explicitly, and the confusion resulting from that. The 'losing money or status' thing I'm going to ruminate on. That puts it in a context I understand, I think. Thank you!
