  I'm looking for the characters I found incredibly annoying, the ones that usually made me drop a book entirely. The kind of ones who deliberate for several pages on a decision because it rends their being in half. People who viscerally experience the feeling of, well, I'm not sure. Wrongness? In an intuitive way. Or rightness? In a way separate from, or indistinguishable from philosophy or ideological end-outcomes. Squeamishness? Conscience? Pre-guilt? And of course, people who deal with the aftermaths of their decisions and feel guilty about them. I think.

It's not something you can read, but The Good Place (the TV series) has its protagonists learning how to be and think morally. One of the main characters, Chidi, is a moral philosopher whose main issue is his immense squeamishness/conscience/(pre-)guilt, about which he deliberates a lot. Maybe you'd find it interesting to analyze his perspective.
