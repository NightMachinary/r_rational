  As a fan The Universe Is An Optimisation Problem, I just wish to say you have nothing to be concerned about. Your writing style is fresh, different, and most importantly unique. HPMOR didn't become popular by following the path of every other piece of writing. It did something different. And in the process developed people who both loved it and hated it. That is what you should try to do. Go after a niche and attack it hard. Don't write a book for everyone. Write a book for a few people, and do it well. So take your world style and thought process and crank it to a 100. The world doesn't care if you can do a million things okay. It only cares if you can do a few things really well. So I would recommend not wasting your time on something that isn't in your skill set. Don't try to write emotional (insert word here) characters and do a meh job. Instead write what you know best, and knock it out of the park. As someone who notices that you've rewritten UIAOP at least 5 times, and it being 2 years since you've updated, I feel as if you need to be told the opposite advice of most. Don't edit every little thing, don't sweat the details as much. You already are highly talented. Most of your readers wouldn't even notice the small things. Most would prefer you to simply continue updating and writing, then another edit through. Just by having legible english, you stand head and shoulders above most fanfics. Don't sweat the small stuff.

  I eagerly await,

  A fan
