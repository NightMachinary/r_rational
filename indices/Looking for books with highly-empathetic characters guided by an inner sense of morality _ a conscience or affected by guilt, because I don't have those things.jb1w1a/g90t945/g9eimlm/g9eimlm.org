Interesting take. I've read over it a couple of times over the last few days and I'm just going to quickly capture some of my responses. I'll update later if I think of anything else.

- There are a lot of behavioural differences between psychopaths and sociopaths, but it's fuzzy. I still feel warmth towards my friends and family, I have a tendency to lash out vindictively and pettily where a psychopath would calmly accept the situation and take the arena to the longer-term, and there are a few times where I've felt some kind of guilt even if it's a 'once every 4-5 years' thing. So my mind isn't as alien as you might be assuming and I'm going to continue the more-or-less prosocial trajectory I've been going down.

- I understand what you've written about relationships, community, and mutual trust. The issue is that it's very easy to have a skewed quid pro quo where one side is getting a lot more out than they're putting in. I have a lot of those relationships, and they either don't notice or don't seem to mind all that much. Sometimes it leaves them feeling better off, some people get a kick out of being nice to charity cases or feeling superior/unindebted. Trust is the same. It's very easy to give someone false or minor vulnerabilities and get much more in return. I rarely threaten, bully or intimidate. The role I'm playing is kind, polite, empathetic, and helpful. If you were to examine how I interact with other people, you probably wouldn't find anything more manipulative or objectionable than a political campaign email or a brochure arguing against evolution written by a Creationist. I'm saying that mainly because I'm reading a lot of concern and worry from you and I just want to assure you.

- Thanks for outlining your motives! I'm not really fazed by malign intentions but it helped me understand where you're coming from and why you wrote the post.
