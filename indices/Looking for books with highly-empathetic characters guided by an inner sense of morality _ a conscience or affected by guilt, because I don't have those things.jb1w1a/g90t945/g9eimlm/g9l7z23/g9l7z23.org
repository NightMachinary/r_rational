  The issue is that it's very easy to have a skewed quid pro quo where one side is getting a lot more out than they're putting in. I have a lot of those relationships, and they either don't notice or don't seem to mind all that much.

Are you sure you're accurately assessing the cost/benefit to both parties of keeping up the relationship? What you're writing about trust makes me think your view of relationships has way too much of a short term bias. The value of long-term relationship with deep mutual trust is something it seems like you're missing.
