Malicia loves him in her way and is devastated with rumours of his death, Ranger loved him and would support regicide (against Malicia) if he wanted, Scribe will sacrifice herself just to see him achieve his "full potential". Only Black can calm Sabah in monster form, although that's more devotion and not romantic love.

Even Catherine treats him like her father figure, and dropped pretty much everything to save him.
