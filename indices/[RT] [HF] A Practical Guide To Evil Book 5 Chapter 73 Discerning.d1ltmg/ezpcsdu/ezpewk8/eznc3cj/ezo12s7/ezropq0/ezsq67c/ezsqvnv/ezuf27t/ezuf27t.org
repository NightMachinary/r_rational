Black is the good old farmboy who took up their father's sword to throw down the evil emperor and rescue his friend.

Except he is as brutal and evil as anyone, the sword is his mother's instead of his father's, the evil emperor is who is usually in charge and is the expected leader of the nation, and his friend is equally conniving and ends up the Evil Empress.
