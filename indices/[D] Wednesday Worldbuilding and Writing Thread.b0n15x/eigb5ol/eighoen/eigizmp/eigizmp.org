I don't mind at all.

I have the seed of a worldbuilding idea, but I need to extrapolate all the details from that seed that are relevant to the story. I'm hoping to imply verisimilitude on the scale of present-day massive interconnectedness, where a random individual's YouTube video might suddenly get tens of millions of views, or a previously-unstocked fruit puzzles shoppers one week and is gone the next.

Basically, I'm hoping for some help making sure I don't forget some of the more obvious implications of "If X, then ...?".
