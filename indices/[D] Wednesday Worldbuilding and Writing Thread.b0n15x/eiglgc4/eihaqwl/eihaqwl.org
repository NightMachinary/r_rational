"Sailor" is a great choice, because ships are expensive, and knowing how to build and pilot ships better could make the MC quite valuable. Assuming the MC is a well-educated sailor, maybe hoping to run a shipping operation of their own one day, and that they have experience in sailing ships and not just steamships, then they'll know nifty navigation and astronomy tools (compass! sextant! telescope! pendulum clocks and mainspring watches!), ways to build faster and safer ships that take fewer crew (the Dutch were great at this in our timeline), and also double-entry bookkeeping and algebra (great for running a business), not to mention finance concepts like insurance and joint-stock corporations (great for long-distance trading companies, especially).

​

Basically, if your MC can get themselves to a major seaport, they can help people go more places and make more money with noticeably less risk.

​

Gunpowder is a long-term game-changer, but it takes a decent-size industrial base to move it from "fireworks" to "knocks down walls quickly", so it depends on how much clout the MC has. The same is true for steam engines (railroads, etc.) and telegraphs.

​

The MC may know enough to make a big difference in clothing and in farming. By 1902, we had things like spinning wheels and flying shuttles that could make weaving fabric out of fibers a lot faster. Clothing is big business in medieval times, so that's potentially worth something. Farming - the MC may understand fertilization and crop rotation a lot better than the locals, which in the long term could give everyone a lot more to eat. But both of these are "ordinary peasant" occupations, unlike ships which are a big glamorous investment, so they'd be very valuable to a ruler in the long term but not necessarily super impressive in the short term.

​

Vaccination will save an enormous number of lives, if biology works the same way there as here. Unfortunately your MC is too early to know about penicillin or other antibiotics. Your MC may know the value of handwashing, which will save lives if it gets adopted.
