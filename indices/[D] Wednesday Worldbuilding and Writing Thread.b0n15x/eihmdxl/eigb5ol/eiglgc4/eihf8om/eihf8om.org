Quite a lot, actually. A sailor at the turn of the century could have some knowledge of newer [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipbuilding#Early_modern][shipbuilding]] techniques. Depending on his background, he might even have some idea of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel#Modern_steelmaking][modern steelmaking]], the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_engine][steam engine]], and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_manufacture_during_the_British_Industrial_Revolution][Textile manufacturing]]. The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution][Industrial Revolution]] was well before then, and he would have seen early examples of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_production][mass production]], and although this was before Ford Motor Company popularized the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_line][Assembly line]], they did use the concept in some contexts such as slaughterhouses, and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_production#Factory_electrification][factory electrification]] was growing quickly. The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseless_carriage][Horseless carriage]] was still a curiosity at that point, but it had been around for a while. Note that in 1200, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping_system][Double-entry bookkeeping]] wasn't a thing yet, and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scurvy#Early_modern_era][Scurvy]] was still a problem. And while gunpowder existed, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_gunpowder#Historiography_of_gunpowder_and_gun_transmission][guns]] weren't really a thing yet. The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press][Printing press]] with movable type and metal letters wasn't discovered until 1439.

The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprengel_pump][Sprengle pump]] gives you a reasonably cheap and easy high vacuum, which can be used for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incandescent_light_bulb][Incandescent lights]], once he has a source of electricity (such as a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galvanic_cell][Galvanic cell]] or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo][dynamo]]). Unfortunately, they still used carbon filaments in 1902, so he wouldn't know about tungsten filament.

If your sailor is the literary type, it might help to get a feel for some of the literature of 1902, and try to imagine it as though it were recently published. The most obvious cultural touchstone would be Mark Twain's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Connecticut_Yankee_in_King_Arthur%27s_Court][A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]], which was published in 1889. Wikipedia has a good list of popular works of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_years_in_literature#1900s][literature by year]]. Anything by Jules Verne would be old enough, as would be Dracula, Frankenstein, Treasure Island, Sherlock Holmes, Wizard of Oz, Flatland, and so on.
