I'm writing a short CYOA. Would anyone mind looking at it and giving feedback? It's a Meta CYOA where you choose one of many conflicts, and then go through another CYOA as normal, but with a minor boost to your abilities. The impetus behind it is that you have a ton of "here's a bunch of magic powers, have fun," CYOAs that tend to blend into each other. This CYOA intends to give them a raison d'etre. I'll PM google drive links to anyone who wants to see it.
