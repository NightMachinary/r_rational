I found this story when it was on chapter 19 and read all of it up to that point pretty quickly.

Really cool stuff. Taking a deep and serious look into a world that I always found pretty interesting. I also likr how it's pretty even handed; there are good things and bad things about this world, strengths and weaknesses of the society. And those strengths and weaknesses are different than the ones in our world. The coolest science fiction does this.

Of the whole story the part that I liked the most both in concept and execution was Blue's sister influencing ther Clefairy's metronome. That really gave me chills! I want to see more like that.

I really like the way that psychic attacks are depicted as more mental/psychological attacks than blasting with energy. I also think that the concept of dark (and people being dark) is cool, and the term really makese sense. It's not dark like as in evil or sinister, but that they're noninteracting with that phenomenon. dark matter. no blips on that radar. dark.

As for my thoughts on things not yet revealed about the setting:

Even before pokeball technology it seems like humanity has a certain... affinity for them. Humans are quite different from all the other non-plant life in this world (pokemon), and it seems that in one way or another they developed ways of controlling pokemon as their method of survival. I think it's a little bit deeper than how people in our world tamed animals. The way these characters form bonds with the pokemon seems very... instinctual, like it's not a learned social behavior but it goes deeper than that, that humanity was interacting with pokemon this way for the entire course of its existence, and controlling pokemon may have been the reason humans gained intelligence in the first place.

It'd be cool to see some of their cultures' equivalents to the garden of eden myth: i.e. their mythological explanation for why humans are different than pokemon.

One interesting thing I noticed is that it doesn't seem like there are any 'domestic only' species of pokemon-- that populations raised in captivity for generations have not significantly deviated from their wild types. I suspect this means something, but I'm not quite sure what.

Question, mostly just out of curiosity:

I know it's comparing apples to oranges, but how far along in its technological development is this world compared to ours? If you were to reduce the maturity of a society to a scalar, would you put them in our past or our future? I get the impression it's somewhat in the future, since with things like only old people really living their countrys' native customs it feels like their world has been globalized for at least a few decades, where ours is really only beginning to be so.
