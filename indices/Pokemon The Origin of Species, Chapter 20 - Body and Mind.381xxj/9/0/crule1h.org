Thanks, glad you're enjoying it!

I'm not overly familiar with Patreon, but since I plan to keep the story free and open to all (restricting viewership behind a paywall would be where legal trouble comes in anyway), I'm not sure what I could offer fans who want to support the story in exchange.

It's something I might look into later, as I've also been thinking of hosting the story on its own website to make the interaction between myself and fans or between fans and other fans more smooth: a lot of readers are only on ff.net, which has terrible support for communication and communities. Thanks for the suggestion though :)
