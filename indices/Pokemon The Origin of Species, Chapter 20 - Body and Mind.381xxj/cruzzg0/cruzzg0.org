I'm slightly upset at the idea that psychics are able to read surface thoughts and change memories. For one, it feels a bit too cliche, but I could over look that. It's mostly the fact that we have somewhat of a understanding of how memories are formed and stored. In addition, memories are hardly static and should reasonable deteriorate/change over time, therefore, the idea that removing Red's partition would revert him back to a prior state seems a lot less believable than say, it would make him a lot more emotional especially on the subject of his father. To simply be thrust back to a state that he's already dealt with, even though it was under his psychic protection, would make his prior efforts to deal with his grief a complete waste of time.

Memories themselves are a function of the brain and for psychics to be able to alter memories or read surface thoughts you're essentially giving them the ability to alter the physical brains of others and not only observe the synaptic activities of said brains but also have the ability to understand those activities as an external system. To me that would break the boundaries of being human. It's simply too strong of a power. I also understand that there's an immense amount of training involved however that doesn't excuse the fact that psychic abilities are too strong.

Granted I understand that this is a fake world where our science doesn't truly follow, but it's a break in the foundation that you've built with the explanation of other pokemon abilities, i.e. charmander's ember and bulbasuar's leech seed.

Of course this is simply my opinion and I still enjoy your story quite a lot. As I said I'm only slightly upset and I'm looking forward to see where you'll take this story.
