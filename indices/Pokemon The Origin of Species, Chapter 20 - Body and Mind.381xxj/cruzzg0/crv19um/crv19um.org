  I'm slightly upset at the idea that psychics are able to read surface thoughts and change memories.
#+end_quote

They actually can't change memories, just remove them. Not sure if that helps, but I think it's a big difference: being able to change memories would be incredibly overpowered, and I think even more unrealistic than the already unrealistic premise.

  In addition, memories are hardly static and should reasonable deteriorate/change over time, therefore, the idea that removing Red's partition would revert him back to a prior state seems a lot less believable than say, it would make him a lot more emotional especially on the subject of his father. To simply be thrust back to a state that he's already dealt with, even though it was under his psychic protection, would make his prior efforts to deal with his grief a complete waste of time.
#+end_quote

The point is that he did not originally deal with it: it was dealt with for him by his powers essentially blunting the emotional response and keeping it separate from his thoughts and feelings. If I understand the science behind neurology correctly (and I fully admit that I might not), memories change over time because of the constant interaction: hence my thought that having the emotional response to the memories kept separate would keep it the same as plausible.

  Memories themselves are a function of the brain and for psychics to be able to alter memories or read surface thoughts you're essentially giving them the ability to alter the physical brains of others and not only observe the synaptic activities of said brains but also have the ability to understand those activities as an external system. To me that would break the boundaries of being human. It's simply too strong of a power. I also understand that there's an immense amount of training involved however that doesn't excuse the fact that psychic abilities are too strong.

Psychic powers absolutely are "too strong," but I would say that about practically anything else in the pokemon world as well, not the least of which being the pokeballs. But psychics are an integral part of the pokemon world, both reading thoughts and altering mental states. Removing those abilities would leave them basically just telekensis, which is nonsensically bizarre enough, but also kind of pointless as a stand-alone thing.

  Granted I understand that this is a fake world where our science doesn't truly follow, but it's a break in the foundation that you've built with the explanation of other pokemon abilities, i.e. charmander's ember and bulbasuar's leech seed.
#+end_quote

It's true, psychic powers are legitimately different from unusual biology of other pokemon. Fair warning, the same goes for ghost pokemon and some other aspects of pokemon's powers, like the Clefairy seen earlier: that's where I wanted to first show that there are some things that are, simply put, "magic." I'm going to try and make them as rational and consistent and defined as possible, but there's no way to make them not-magic because they're not based on any scientific foundation in our world.

#+begin_quote
  Of course this is simply my opinion and I still enjoy your story quite a lot. As I said I'm only slightly upset and I'm looking forward to see where you'll take this story.

Completely understand, and I appreciate the feedback :) Please do continue to let me know whenever you think some aspect of the world is too poorly defined, explained, or divorced from realism. Just because I have (in my mind) justifications for having unrealistic aspects in this case doesn't mean I always will, and if there's something fundamental I'm missing about how the mind or memories work, that's something that I'd like to know so I can adjust the way psychic powers work accordingly.
