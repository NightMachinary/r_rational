Yes, as far as humanity knows at the current point in the story, pokemon are incapable of speech. The analogue is to our world's animals: there are some who are definitely smarter than others, and they communicate in some ways, but there are none that inarguably show "human level sapience," let alone the complexity of language.

Psychics are generally classified as such based on their ability to interact with the psyche or manipulate reality with their own mind, so while psychics rank among the smartest pokemon around (especially those that can do more complex things), they are not uniformly smarter than non-psychic pokemon.
