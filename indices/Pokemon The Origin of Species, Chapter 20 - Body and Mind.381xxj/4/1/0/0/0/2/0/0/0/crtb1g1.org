But anything with a high enough level of intelligence that works on the same medium as humans (using limbs, perceiving roughly the same type of light and sound waves, ect.) should be able to find a way to prove their sapience, no? I mean psychic pokemon even live together with humans and the divide in understanding is small enough that they can learn "tricks". If they were anywhere near the sapience level of an average human they should be able to make that a completely two way street.

Anyway, I assume that those silly facts on psychic pokemon like Alakazam having >5000 IQ aren't canon in any way, shape or form, right?
