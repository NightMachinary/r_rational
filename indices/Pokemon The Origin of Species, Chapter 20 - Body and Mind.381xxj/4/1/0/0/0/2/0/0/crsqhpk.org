Psychic humans can communicate with each other telepathically in a very crude sort of fashion, and with psychic pokemon in an even cruder fashion: but nowhere have they found a psychic pokemon that they can communicate with as relatively smoothly as they can another psychic human. So while there's certainly some debate on what constitutes sapience, there's still that "division" of sorts.
