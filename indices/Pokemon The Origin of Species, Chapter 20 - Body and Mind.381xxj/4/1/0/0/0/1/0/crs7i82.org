I was actually thinking of it in reverse, that language would be a simpler starting step, from which psychic abilities would develop, in the same way that I might expect a creature to evolve a mouth before evolving the ability to use speech.

However, this does depend on the actual medium that being a psychic uses, which at this point would mostly be pure speculation.
