It's mentioned in an early chapter that pokeballs cripple higher brain functions.\\
Considering that pokemon would have to learn a human language from humans, and humans tend to keep all their pokemon in pokeballs, I'd say that at the very least the more intelligent pokemon like Slowking and Alakazam should be language capable, but haven't ever been recorded to speak due to pokeball confinement and disinterest in teaching animals a language.
