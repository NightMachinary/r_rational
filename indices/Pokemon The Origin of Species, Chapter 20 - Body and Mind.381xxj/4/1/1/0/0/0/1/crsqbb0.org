It is... an endeavour, I must say. For people that enjoy its particular mix of sarcasm, humor, and mood whiplash, it's like crack. Expect constant callbacks. Andrew Hussie's (the author) writing is hysterically humorous at times, and while a lot of characters lack depth past a certain point, others grow a lot throughout the story.

Some people take a while to get to the point of enjoying it; some people never do; and some are hooked instantly (I'm in this latter category. Unlike most people I've talked to, I thoroughly enjoyed Act 1).

Its particular brand of time travel shenanigans is pervasive is quite interesting, too, though I'd rather not spoil too much about that. It's enjoyable to learn about in its own right.
