Here are a couple of typos I noticed:

#+begin_quote
  "I... see. Thank you, that's of reassuring."
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  "especially with something so personal.."
#+end_quote

I liked this chapter as well, and didn't think it was too much of an infodump at all. This is such a great fic, up there with The Metropolitan Man as one of my favorite non-HPMOR rational!fanfics.
