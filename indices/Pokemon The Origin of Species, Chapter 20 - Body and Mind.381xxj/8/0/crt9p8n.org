It's a Japanese proverb that refers to how unreliable fortunetelling is, and that the future is always uncertain. Literally it means "Getting it wrong is fate, and getting it right is fate."

Thanks for catching that typo! Yes, it was a reference to him. I'm really bad at naming characters, so when an idea for one pops up that at least somewhat fits, I grab hold with relief.
