You'd think that the PokeWorld humans and their battle pets don't stand much of a chance. Until you remember that they can fit things the weight of a Groudon and the size of a Wailord into hand-sized spheres that then can be resized to be even smaller with little more than tactile interaction. A bit of psychic surgery later and next thing you know it's "Tarrasque, I choose you! Kaiser Blades!"

...I think this lends itself better to crackfic than anything else.
