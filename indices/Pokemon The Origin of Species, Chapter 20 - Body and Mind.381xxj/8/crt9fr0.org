What do "ataru mo hakke" and "ataranu mo hakke" mean?

Also I found a typo. At first you call the psychic Colan Nerud. After that he is mentioned as Narud everywhere else. By the way, was the surname Narud on purpose? It reminds me of "professor" Emil Narud (previously known as lieutenant Samir Duran) who also had considerable psychic powers.
