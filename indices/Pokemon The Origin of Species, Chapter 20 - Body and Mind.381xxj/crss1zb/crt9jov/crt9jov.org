  Of the whole story the part that I liked the most both in concept and execution was Blue's sister influencing ther Clefairy's metronome. That really gave me chills! I want to see more like that.

Thank you, I had a lot of fun writing that part :) Hopefully I can deliver more moments like it soon!

  It'd be cool to see some of their cultures' equivalents to the garden of eden myth: i.e. their mythological explanation for why humans are different than pokemon.

We saw this a bit at the beginning of chapter 18, and will definitely get into it more later!

  One interesting thing I noticed is that it doesn't seem like there are any 'domestic only' species of pokemon-- that populations raised in captivity for generations have not significantly deviated from their wild types. I suspect this means something, but I'm not quite sure what.

There are definitely some pokemon that aren't particularly dangerous, and so could be called "domestic," but outside of a few circumstances, pokemon are never bred to be less dangerous: human's survival relies on them being able to fight wild pokemon, and while some are raised for non-combat purposes (like for beauty pageants and whatnot) that hasn't been going on nearly long enough to affect the species.

  know it's comparing apples to oranges, but how far along in its technological development is this world compared to ours? If you were to reduce the maturity of a society to a scalar, would you put them in our past or our future?

It's definitely hard to measure, but relatively speaking, the future. Like our world, their "modern age" signaled a rapid revolution in technology and globalization, especially with technologies like the internet, but they were far ahead of us in other regards before then, forced to develop incredibly powerful technology to survive, and in some cases like with medicine, having access to biology completely alien to us to develop their nearly miraculous "potions."
