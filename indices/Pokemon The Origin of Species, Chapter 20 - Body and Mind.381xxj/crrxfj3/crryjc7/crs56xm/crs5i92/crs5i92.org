In the show there are a number of pokemon who can speak with humans, though usually there are special circumstances to try and explain it, or they use psychic powers.

In the games no pokemon is capable of speech outside a few very rare/mythical ones, and even then it's not in the form of actually speaking english with their mouths like in the anime. With the sole exception of pikachu in Pokemon Yellow and the latest generation of games, pokemon don't even say their own names, just make animal noises. There are some birds that mimic speech like our world's parrots, but that's it.
