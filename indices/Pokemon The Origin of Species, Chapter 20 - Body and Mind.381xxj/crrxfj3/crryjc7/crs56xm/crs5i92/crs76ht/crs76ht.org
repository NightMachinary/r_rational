So within this story's continuity, I should assume (until shown contradictory evidence) that Pokemon cannot speak? I'm primarily asking because my running theory thus far is that humans are just another species of Pokemon (in the same way that in reality, humans are just another species of animal), but unlike in our world, the existence of Psychics would seem like that would require a more advanced Theory of Mind to work, so I'd expect psychic Pokemon to be more likely to have language.
