  it's something I think falls under the "clearly a game conceit because the makers of Pokemon couldn't be bothered to think out the complications of an alternative and to make it easier for children" classification of justified departures from canon.

You've used this argument before and I just took it at face value but now that I think of it I'm less convinced. Why couldn't they just have the Pokefarm/daycare owner give you a newborn level 1 pokemon instead of an egg that needs to hatch first? In both cases nothing "icky" would have to be shown or discussed.

Same goes for Ghastly by the way. Nothing forces them to definitely not come out of eggs. They wouldn't have to be made of calcium carbonate after all. Just whatever the inert version of a ghost pokemon would be. That is if they aren't actually generated by the death of another pokemon. Though I guess especially with pokemon like koffing/weezing some other type of procreation and life cycle makes more sense and is more interesting to write.
