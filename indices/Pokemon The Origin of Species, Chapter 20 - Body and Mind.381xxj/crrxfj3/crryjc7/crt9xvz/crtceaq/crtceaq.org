  Why couldn't they just have the Pokefarm/daycare owner give you a newborn level 1 pokemon instead of an egg that needs to hatch first? In both cases nothing "icky" would have to be shown or discussed.

I think the idea of getting an egg and having to hatch your pokemon is part of the process that (a) helps bond with it and treat it as a "real" baby, whereas just being handed new pokemon feels rather mundane, and as a more practical effect, (b) makes the breeding process require more effort.

I don't pretend to know the exact reason Game Freak decided on everything they did, but it just strikes me as very likely that once they decided to include breeding in the games they just recognized the simplicity of having everything come from eggs.

  Though I guess especially with pokemon like koffing/weezing some other type of procreation and life cycle makes more sense and is more interesting to write.

Absolutely, on top of which, some of them contradict the idea of coming from eggs: the pokedex is full of all sorts of nonsensical bullshit, but it still describes Grimer as being born from sludge exposed to "x-rays from the moon." It's not outside the realm of possibility that they can be produced both by natural occurrences and from eggs, but it strikes me as simply a game convenience to have all pokemon that can reproduce do so in the same way mechanically.
