  I'm guessing the scientific community in the story knows the type chart is wrong, but still use it because they have yet to come up with any better unifying theories.

  ...

  After all, humans in the pokemon world are a bit different than the real world in that some of them have psychic powers and things like that. It seems almost as if they're a subspecies of human slightly different from our own.

  Although why humans give live birth when ALL other pokemon lay eggs, EVEN THE MAMMALS is going to be hard to explain

I'm actually retconning this: it's something I think falls under the "clearly a game conceit because the makers of Pokemon couldn't be bothered to think out the complications of an alternative and to make it easier for children" classification of justified departures from canon.

Suffice to say, Gastly do not come from eggs in my world.

  I also noticed that we're on chapter 20 and haven't even gotten past pewter city yet. That means this story will probably be significantly longer than HPMOR.

I seem incapable of short-and-to-the-point stories, so sadly my estimates for how long this one will be are likely way off, and you may be correct @_@ Glad you're enjoying it though!
