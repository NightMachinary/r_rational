And the plot thickens! Can't wait to see Red investigating his psychic powers! It's starting to look like the true nature of pokemon is a LOT more complicated than expected. I'm guessing it will take Red longer to come up with a theory on the origin of pokemon than Darwin did with his theory, since quite frankly pokemon seem like a more difficult puzzle than real life species, because of pokemon like gastly, grimer, voltorb and magnemite that don't really make sense with real life biology. It would probably make a huge theoretical gap between biology and physics, even bigger than the one that we had before Darwin, unless the physics in the world of pokemon is significantly different, but since humans exist in it it probably can't be /that/ different. This gap would also explain why technology in the world of pokemon is so advanced and yet they still cling to the type-charts. I find it interesting to compare and contrast the type chart paradigm with Aristotelian physics and elan vital. The fact that the type chart paradigm seems to be more like an "Aristotelian physics" kind of explanation than an "elan vital" kind of explanation, seems to support the possibility of such a large theoretical gap between pokemon biology and their world's physics. I'm guessing the scientific community in the story /knows/ the type chart is wrong, but still use it because they have yet to come up with any better unifying theories.

Then again, maybe the physics IS different. After all, humans in the pokemon world are a bit different than the real world in that some of them have psychic powers and things like that. It seems almost as if they're a subspecies of human slightly different from our own. Although why humans give live birth when ALL other pokemon lay eggs, EVEN THE MAMMALS is going to be hard to explain. I'm wondering if it would be better if you just retconned it so that egg laying wasn't universal to all pokemon species except humans.

I also noticed that we're on chapter 20 and haven't even gotten past pewter city yet. That means this story will probably be significantly longer than HPMOR.

This is awesome! Can't wait for the next chapter!
