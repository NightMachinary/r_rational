Yes. I mention it because the primary theme of /The Long Game/ and its sequels was the human race being oppressed and controlled through restrictions on what they can know about. "From an information-theoretic perspective" (said the geek), there's comparatively little actual difference between deceiving and controlling someone through subtle manipulation of the news-media and through simulated reality.

Well, there is one difference: in /The Long Game/, there were in fact spoons.
