In a Platonic sense, the question is always undecidable: I can't know that I'm not in the Matrix right now, or that I'm not going to hit age 50 and be told the rest of you are AIs and I'm in a Science State or something.

/But/, we observe that the reality around us is causally consistent and runs on rules, rules which allow us to plan our lives and engage the world according to our own desires.

The nasty thing about simulations is that they appear causally consistent... until suddenly they're not, and it turns out that your reality can be altered according to the whims of some /agent/, who is suddenly directly interfering in your ability to live life as /you/ want to rather than as /they/ want you to -- and who is often interfering with agents other than you.
