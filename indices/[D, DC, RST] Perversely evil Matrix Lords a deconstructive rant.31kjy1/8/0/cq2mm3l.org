I think it depends what. Most video games don't make you earn the "privilege" of staying alive enough to play at all, you know. The kind of survival game where you need to spend effort finding food, clean water, safe places to excrete, and shelter against the elements is a fairly unique, isolated genre of game-play.

Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs is a useful approximate model here, though I think some of it's in the wrong order. Most people place a strong but ultimately ascetic/utilitarian/dry /need/ on safety/security: they feel a /need/ for their environment to be secure enough that they can plan what to do and carry out their plans (see: Lord Vetinari of Ankh-Morpork). Then comes satisfying the basic needs of physical existence, which can be done sparingly or with finery, as per preference. Then come (very roughly) the individual's social (and sexual) needs, to be entangled in positive relationships with others, and then comes the individual's need to apply their abilities in interesting ways.

Ultimately, as you move /up/ the hierarchy, you're moving from basic needs, from which people derive little happiness but whose deprivation makes them utterly miserable, to higher desires, which are often said to make life worth living, but whose deprivation actually has comparatively /little/ psychological toll. The further down something is in this imaginary ranking, the more worthwhile it is for society/technology/whatever-the-hell to just go ahead and supply it; the higher up, the more people should earn it for themselves, since they'll undoubtedly care about the /how/ rather than just the /what/.
