Interestingly, I /just/ had this conversation online, literally five minutes ago. The person in question was asserting that a positive Matrix was more likely than a negative one. My answer to that was:

--------------

I would say it's much MORE likely for an evil/negative version to happen. Of all the worlds where Matrix pods come about, more of those worlds are negative than positive. In order for a Matrix system to be positive it needs to be built by people with good intentions, who keep the hardware and software from being backdoored while it's being built, it needs to remain in the hands of the creator (or other good people), and no externalities can come up that would interfere. Mess up any one of those ingredients and you have hell. Also, there's no way for anyone on the outside to tell conclusively what's going on inside, so there's no way for an outside body to provide oversight. If you doubt this, google for "Thompson Unix hack" and click the top result. Short version: Ken Thompson was one of the guys who invented Unix, the operating system that basically the entire Internet runs on. For a few years there he owned the entire Net because, when he sent out the tapes, he put a self-replicating Trojan into the login program and the compiler that you would use to create a new login program. There was no plausible way to detect it or get rid of it, and the same would apply to a Matrix pod.

--------------

I guess the real questions are

1. Do people know it's a simulation and why/how? (Might be "because they went in voluntarily", which is fair.)
2. Is there actually a way to get out from the inside? It doesn't seem plausible on the face of it.
3. Why is the Matrix Lord evil? What's his motivation / what does he gain?
