It depends on people's ability to rebel. If you create a matrix and 5% of people rebel and try to get out that could be bad if they have any ability to get out, less so if the Wode can just lock them down.

They may have worked out that the decrease in happiness of those 5% is less important than, say, consuming 4000% more resources when 5% get out. The rebels can cry themselves to sleep on their bed of attractive sexual partners, alcohol, and luxury bed linings.

But if 5% out meant a 200% increase in resource usage but 5% rebelling meant a 1000% increase in resource usage then it would be better to let them leave.
