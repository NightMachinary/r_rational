Let me put it this way: read poverty coverage in a mainstream, straight-center news outlet, and then read about the same subject from right-wing think tanks and journals. You will see two very different moral narratives. Then go read a mainstream, non-radical left-wing think-thank or journal: you will notice that it appears to think itself accountable to the standards set up in the straight-center outlet (ie: the tone will be, "We really would love to help the poor, but that's expensive, but we think we can afford this little bit.").
