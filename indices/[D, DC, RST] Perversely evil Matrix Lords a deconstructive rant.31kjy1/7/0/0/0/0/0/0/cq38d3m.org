Normally what I've seen from the ruling classes is the idea that welfare has expanded to give far too many people money and it is bankrupting the country and leading them into making bad choices and such and some say that they deserve to be poor for making such bad choices.

Anyway, the normal arguments I've seen have very much taken note of monetary constraints- if fixing poor people's problems is expensive they're less likely to want to do it.
