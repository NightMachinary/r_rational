My first google check shows that their main concerns are the many dollars being transfered to poor Americans, and second that it leads to a weakening of the moral character of Americans.

They first complain about the sheer cost of the proposals, then about the damage in standards that causes.

I could even imagine a Matrix Lord saying something like that.

"Fifty years ago, President AI Model X77787 declared “War on Unhappiness.” It sounded great to me.

I was taught at Ganymede, “We're a strong stellar power. All we have to do is give the people a little freedom, and then use that good will to create social structures that will lift people out of unhappiness. Government sponsored reality programs programs for the strong and less random mind fuckery by our conflict AIs for the weak."

It seemed to work. The unhappiness rate dropped from 17 percent to 12 percent in the programs' first decade. Unfortunately, few people noticed that during the half-decade before the “War,” the rate dropped from 22 percent to 17 percent. Without big government, Humans were already lifting themselves out of Unhappiness!

Despite spending an astonishing 22 thousand sun hours, despite 92 different reality programs, unhappiness stopped declining. Government's answer? More reality!

Cyborg King, Z., Io., chairman of the House Reality Committee, points out that government measures “success” by the growth of programs: “based on inputs, how many people are in reality, how many programs are we creating, how many people are we putting on these programs -- not on outcomes -- how many people are we making happy? ... Many of these programs end up disincentivizing happiness -- telling people it pays to be unhappy because then you're more likely to be let into reality!

That is a great conceit of the central planners: thinking that only government prevents humans from being unhappy. But the reason Americans don't cry all the time is competition, not government minimums.

Competition is what really makes the humans happy. It doesn't much matter that the law says that competition can lead to up to a 90% drop in life quality. Only 4 percent of human workers are at that life quality. 95 percent make more.

The free market will sort this out, if politicians would just let it. Left free, the market will provide the greatest happiness to workers, employers and consumers, while allowing charity as well.

It would all happen faster if politicians stopped imagining that they are the cause of everything.

I mean, consider the example of Eaturbrainz, the star of many of our reality tv shows. Would he really be as happy if there wasn't so much competition and social injustice for him to complain about? Competition brings him happiness.
