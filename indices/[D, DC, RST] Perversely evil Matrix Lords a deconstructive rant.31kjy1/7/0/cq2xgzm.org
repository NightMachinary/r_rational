  They may have worked out that the decrease in happiness of those 5% is less important than, say, consuming 4000% more resources when 5% get out. The rebels can cry themselves to sleep on their bed of attractive sexual partners, alcohol, and luxury bed linings.

This works out well for /Perfect State/, in which the whole situation is implied to be a result of resource crunches (or possibly of the utilitarians adding people until their extreme resource efficiency became necessary anyway). Of course, you'd think there would still be /some/ arrangement or compromise that could be negotiated with the 5%. From the perspective of a powerful overlord, cooperation and negotiation are just the /lazier/ things to do, provided only that the rebels want something /other/ than to totally destroy you.

  But if 5% out meant a 200% increase in resource usage but 5% rebelling meant a 1000% increase in resource usage then it would be better to let them leave.
