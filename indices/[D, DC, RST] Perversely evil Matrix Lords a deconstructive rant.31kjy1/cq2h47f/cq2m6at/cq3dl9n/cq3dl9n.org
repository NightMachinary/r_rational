That's what I was trying to get at when I commented that we don't really know what the Wode will allow. From the description, I agree it's unlikely he'll ever get to reality, but is there any reason they wouldn't allow him a world indistinguishable from reality (i.e. causally consistent and based on the real world so that he can "find out how things really work")?

Again, for all we know there's been some apocalyptic event making simulated life preferable or other reasons that make their system sensible- I say this because like I said before, their system doesn't make much sense, but since it's also not very fleshed out and there's a lot of room to allow a utopia, I don't think it's safe to jump to a dystopian scenario.
