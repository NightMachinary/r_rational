/ExistenZ/ doesn't really fit in here, the reason things are messy is that you're looking at the output of a mass-mind where two players are trying to hide their own issues by shunting all of their distress at the setting-creator and conflict modules. If the two main characters didn't have an irrational fear of simulationist entertainment, the story wouldn't exist.
