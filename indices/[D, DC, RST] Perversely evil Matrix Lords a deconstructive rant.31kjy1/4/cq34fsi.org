Alternatively, if the inside of the simulation is actually unpleasant and has to be (for the overlord's goals or for practical reasons), generate an even worse "Outside" simulation, one that is terrible without anyone making it worse, where it is difficult to survive and no luxuries are available.

Is the bright spot in your month getting an apple along with your gruel? Then in the Outside simulation, you don't get any apples. In the simulation, do you have hard labor every day? Then in the Outside, you have to scrabble day and night to get enough food to survive, and it's even less tasty than your standard gruel. And the best part is, this is /easy/ to simulate.

Add in a way to return to the inside simulation, and people who return will warn people they should stay inside where living is easier and conditions are more pleasant.
